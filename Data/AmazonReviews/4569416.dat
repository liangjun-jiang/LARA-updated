<Title>Defective item, but Apple promptly substituted replacement!
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this item and could not get it to work.  I contacted Apple and they assisted me in trying to get the I-pod to download songs from my computer.  When it would not download, they made arrangements for a replacement and were very polite!

<Title>POS!  Broke w/in 6 months and Apple bailed on it.

<Content>What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks.

<Title>It never came
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unfortunately the product never came.  The actually company said it was shipped, but it never came.  I can not give any stars to this company, as they did not answer my e-mail request for an update.  The star is for Amazon, who was able to get me a refund for my purchase.

<Title>My second iPod shuffle.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wll, they are small, so I misplaced my first one (I 512k).  Found it later.  But I figure that it will wear out anyway (even if switches go on forever, batteries WILL eventually die) given the heavy use I put it to.  I really like the fact that it does no need an external cord like the newer ones, which is why I bought it even though it was the same price as the newer one.  I also use it mostly in the car, since I do not tend to like headphones.  Also, the iTunes has gotten better as a program, but I have not bought anything better from the service.  I had a CD collection before I got the iPod, and feeding in my older CDs has gotten me to reacquaint myself with a good many CDs.   Now, about that vinyl...

<Title>Big on Hype - Small on Performance
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.  My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended.  I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.  Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.  Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

<Title>Very Displeased
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am pleased with my over all experience with Amazon.com, however the Rainmaker Group company is a rip-off.  I ordered on November the 11th, and NEVER received the product.  One week before Christmas I re-ordered from another company through Amazon.   For future reference...look at ratings before you purchase.

<Title>ipod shuffle
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my shuffle promptly, but unfortunately have had problems with it.  It downloads properly, but won't shuffle the songs (they play in the same order all the time), and some songs have never played at all. My daughter ordered one at the same time, and hers works perfectly, so maybe it's just my particular product, but I have been very disappointed.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little device works really well. The battery life is as advertised. There is no skip what so ever unlike the iPod, so this is ideal for running. It is small and light and easy to take with you cycling or running and great for skiing and snowboarding. Another great feature some may overlook is the storage factor. This product also serves as a thumb drive so instead of buying a 512 thumb drive and using it for storage if your a college student like i am, you can buy a 512 shuffle and alot as much memory as you want to storage and to music for only $20 more...good deal. Ive read some reviews that say there is no "hold" feature and this is false. If you hold down the play button for a few seconds it will "hold."

<Title>Great player - Awesome price
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is going to make my weight lifting MUCH easier  If you thought that the iPod was small, then you're gonna LOVE this thing! it's smaller than most packs of gum!  Some people have been knocking this player's sound quality, but I have found its sound quality to be superb! ---- the player is solidly constructed, very small, and very lite - the perfect exercise companion  Unless you love flipping through playlists, then this is all you really need, in any music player - having an LCD would be nice, but you won't miss it - the price makes this thing a TOTAL steal  and lastly, I'm very impressed by the disk use capabilities - I have already used my 1 gig as a USB drive for some files - I'm very pleased with its versatility - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

<Title>I love it for work outs
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle (IPs) is great for working out. Pros -No moving parts, no chance to skip -Easy navigation, don't need to "look" to skip tracks or adjust volume -Headphones sound as good as previous iPods -Price is right Cons -Headphone a *little* long when working out, can get "in the way" when exercizing; your miliage may vary. -Cannot manually sync with more than one computer without erasing the music content  each time you connect to another computer (unlike earlier iPods) -No "repeat" function  Overall, a really well designed product and fun to use. I'd recommend it to parents for youngsters who aren't ready for the responsibility of a "regular" iPod, but want a portable digital music player.

<Title>Got it, returning it
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this because I needed instant gratification and everyone was sold out of the 20GB iPod (except for the U2 version, but who wants that?!)  I apparently don't have a USB2.0, so it never got more than 3 files copies over at a time before crashing.  My computer is 2 years old and has been upgraded with RAM, but apparently no amount of RAM is enough to run iTunes on a Windows XP machine.  This was supposed to help in relaxation and reduce stress through music ... not happening. I'm going back to breaking stuff.

<Title>Pros and Cons are silly 
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love all the reviews of the iPod Shuffle that list the "Pros" and "Cons", as if you would then look up some other MP3 player and compare its pros and cons to this one.  Is anyone really doing that?    The reason to own this gadget is that it is the current "it" gadget to own.  If you don't get it, i.e., "why no screen?", "why so expensive?", "why does the battery only last 12 hours?", "why is it different?", well, then don't buy it.  You don't get it.  The reason to buy and own this is because once you saw one, once you held one in your hand and marveled at its design/weight/simplicity/smoothness/color and all the rest, you had to have one.  You don't buy the iPod Shuffle because it's "exactly what I need in an mp3 player."  No it isn't.  It's not "exactly" what anyone needs.  But it is the coolest gadget you'll buy this year.  Addendum: Here's a weird thing I've noticed with my shuffle: When in "shuffle" (random) mode, I seem to hear the same songs  more often than one would expect if it were truly random. OR, maybe this is just a trick of the mind associated with all true randomness: we expect random to mean that once we've heard a song, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is really low, when in fact, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is as high as the liklihood that we'll hear ANY of the songs on the player. I guess it depends on how they wrote the "random play" program as well (like, did they include something in the algorithm to exclude the same song being heard twice in a row, even though in true ramdomness, that should be possible).

<Title>The perfect travel companion
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just made a trip to the United Arab Emirates and back (12+ hour flight each way) and although I packed my 20 gig 2G ipod, it never left it's case. I wore the shuffle around my next with headsets in my pocket and they never set up the myriad of security alarms and the batteries lasted forever!  On the return trip I discovered I hadn't shut if off, charged it from my laptop and still managed to use it 99% (watched a movies the other 1%) of the flight and there was still battery left for the additional 3 hours to get home from JFK.  I let Itunes pick the songs and then eyeballed the ones it selected and changed the ones I knew I didn't want.  Did I miss the screen no, did I enjoy the randomness, YES...actually heard songs I'd forgotten I owned.

<Title>Cool gadget...with a flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is a fantastic little device created by the genius designers at Apple.  They know how to make things work. The user interface is very easy  on the Shuffle.  The flashing green and orange dots mean different things, but they don't take long to learn.  The sound is excellent. I was very surprised by how it handles every song and seems to strike the perfect balance in pitch, tone, bass and treble.  The only draw back is that it charges through your USB port.  If you have USB 2.0, it charges fast. However, your computer has to be on for it to get power. If you own a laptop (I own an iBook), your computer has to stay on - you can't charge the USB if the laptop is in sleep mode.  This usually means I am using the laptop's valuable power source to charge the Shuffle and I dont usually keep the laptop on for 4 hours (Apples recommended charge time).  I highly recommend you buy the USB power charger from Apple.  Other than that, the iPod Shuffle is a perfect device for work, studying and just listening to music.  I haven't taken it off in days...

<Title>BLAND
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is disappointing.  Buyer beware, if you plan on using it mainly for a thumb drive that it cannot go in at a certain angle, especially into certain Dell USB ports.  I bought this specifically for a thumb drive use and to listen to mp3s while I walk to class.  I got to class today, tried to plug it in, it would not recognize it through the front port.  Just beware if you are planning on buying it strictly for a thumb drive.  Other than that it is ok.
