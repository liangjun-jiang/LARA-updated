<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-0744661-8359135">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.

<Content>I wasn't sure about purchasing an iPod, but now that I have, its awesome.  Very easy to load songs from my CD's.  Battery life is fantastic and the sound quality is amazing.  I highly recommend this for a music lover.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7RVC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-0744661-8359135">Apple 160 GB iPod classic Silver (6th Generation)</a>
