<Title>the best mp3 player I've used.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third digital media player I've owned.  I had a Creative Zen Tough 40 gigs, and a Creative Zen Vision:M 30 gigs before this.  I loved them both dearly but they became unusable a few months after I bought them.  I was super disappointed with the customer service for Creative, so I decided to get a Zune.  I've never had much of an interest in an iPod.  It's not a "I want to be different from everybody" thing so much as Apple just isn't my aesthetic and I wanted all my software to be of the same company.  The packaging is a winner.  I never really thought much about the packaging for a product.  The box it came in was sturdy and attractive and I still have it after two months.  The updated software runs kind of slow but it's still faster than any of the Creative softwares I used.  It helps a lot to not run any other program while you're using it.  Syncing songs to the player takes about one second per song.  Super fast.  The Zune Marketplace is also a winner.  I purchased the Zune Pass and it's really thrilling to use.  All the music I want for 15 dollars a month is a winner.  DRM protection's kind of a drag, but I think it's worth it.  I don't know anything about iTunes so unfortunately I can't compare the two.  You can't put the downloaded songs on a CD or play them on anything else but the Zune software and the Zune, but that doesn't really affect me.    I really love the hardware.  The double shot effect is really neat!  The device feels really nice and substancial in my hand.  It's actually kind of small compared to the huge Zens I used to have.  I honestly don't understand how people say the Zune's too bulky.  There's not too much to say about the firmware.  It's really easy to use, and I like how the letters on the main menu are really big.  It's easy to read, even if you have a lighter background.  It's really nice though, to have the firmware update automatically, because with the Zen, you had to go to Creative's website and download it yourself and put it on the player yourself and the whole thing took about two hours.  It was crazy!  I've always been impressed with Microsoft's customer service.  A couple weeks ago none of the media would play and they walked me through everything and the person I talked to was super nice.  There are a few things that keep it from being completely perfect.  These are pretty minor details though for the most part.  The least minor thing is the quality of the video.  With my Creative Zen V:M, the video was absolutely superb, crisper than a TV.  It was so impressive, and I kind of miss it with the Zune.  I really really don't care about video though, so it doesn't matter much to me, but if video is important to you, consider the Zen.  Another big thing for me is you don't have the ability to turn the zune to the other side so the controls are on the left when viewing pictures and video.  I'm left handed and it's incredibly awkward to use my right hand to control it.  Also, a clock would be such a convenient addition.  Voice recording and the ability to use the device as an external hard drive would be nice too.  The ability to record FM radio like you can with the Zen would be super.  I don't care at all about accessories but that's a huge factor for some people.  There's a company called Vaja Cases that make really super nice custom leather cases for the Zune 30.  I'm not sure they make them for the 80, or the flash drive based devices.  You can find plastic cases at like Best Buy too.  There's an A/C adapter too but I heard that it kind of sucks.  I have a radio adapter that plugs into any headphone jack and I like to use it in the car and whatnot.  Overall though I totally recommend the Zune 30.  It's super sturdy, and the software and everything is awesome.  Definitely consider it if you're looking at hard drive based mp3 players.

<Title>Amazing, Better than Ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is very Good, Great Sound, and if you buy the premium headphones, you get great sound, plus noise cancelling, great for the gym, or traveling.  Definitely you must get the membership on zune marketplace, were for $15 bucks a month you can download EVERYTHING you want. Rather than Buying from Itunes.  Zune beats Apple in about one hundred ways.  Tip:  You get three accounts for one membership, so you might get 3 friends, and each will pay only $5, for unlimited downloads, podcasts, videos, etc.  Very Cheap!!

<Content>I've had this Zune for a while now before bothering to write a review, but it's definitely worth buying.  The new Zunes are out, and I can't attest to their functionality myself, but microsoft keeps coming up with better and better ideas.  This thing is easy to operate, syncs easily, and is more durable than anyone should probably need.  I've dropped it plenty of times, and it's still kickin'.

<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Content>I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.

<Title>Unlike many other reviewers, I actually own a Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many of the reviews here are from (and will most likely continue to be from) people who neither own a Zune nor have they ever touched a Zune.  A majority of the remaining reviews are commentary on the Zune vs. iPod battle without regard to a legitimate compare and contrast of the players themselves (possibly legitimate discussions, but discussions that shouldn't really be regarded as reviews).  My review is intended to be my first impression of my Zune along with a bit of compare and contrast as I make a switch (possibly permanent or maybe temporary) from an iPod to a Zune.  The Zune is a great player.  A large bright screen that presents a great user interface when navigating through your library or settings.  The screen is also beautiful for watching video and in particular works very well with pictures.  Despite it's slightly bulky look and large dimensions when next to other players in its class, the Zune feels just right in your hand.  Maybe a bit large to cram into a pocket, but seriously, it fits your hand like a glove.  Pre-release, many have knocked the brown, but it's a real nice color.  It has a subtle green accent that runs around the edge of the player and the contrast adds a lot of class to the player.  The software is not quite up to iTunes, or in reality maybe it's just that I'm used to iTunes.  The software is simply a better looking version of Windows Media Player (I guess that should be taken as a compliment to the Zune, because it really is a nice looking piece of software).  So, if you're comfortable with that you'll love this.  If you don't like Windows Media Player, you may not like this much more.  The wireless capabilities of the Zune has been a huge push from Microsoft.  This feature has been implemented quite well, but it will take some time for enough Zunes to be out the for the sharing to really take off.  Sound quality is no better, no worse than other players.  Overall the Zune is a welcome departure from the category leading player, the iPod, if for no reason other than it's something new in a category that has gotten a little repetitive over the last couple upgrade cycles from Apple.  The software though not as refined as iTunes, is a bit of a warmer looking alternative and it's UI differences may even grow on me enough to eventually like it more than the competition.  The player's menu navigation has every other player in the market beat.  Picture and video viewing is also at the top of the class.

<Title>Big screen and good design
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've tried out all the iPod competitors.  In general they have all disappointed me, but this is the first one that I really like.  The only downside is that it's not as thin as the iPod, but the iPod scratches so easily that it requires a case which adds extra thickness anyway.  (+) 3" screen is GREAT.   44% bigger than iPod video.  For the first time, showing a friend my travel pictures over coffee, etc. is an enjoyable experience.  You can even zoom into pictures to see details.  And now I can actually enjoy watching videos while sitting in a cafe.  My iPod video's screen is just too small.  I also like seeing the big album art while a song is playing.  (+) It plays ALL my songs and videos iPod won't play any WMV videos, AVI video, WMA songs, etc.  The Zune plays everything I have. iPod video doesn't.  (+) Landscape mode   When playing a video or watching movies, the Zune automatically switches to landscape orientation.  (+) Controls I really like the control layout.  Easier to adjust the volume than on the iPod.  When you switch to landscape mode, it's smart enough to automatically rotate the controls so that pressing "up" always scrolls up.  (+) No scratches. The case is made out of scratch-proof, matte finish material.  It looks and feels good.  My iPod video with it's high gloss finish looked great for the first month, now it's covered with scratches and looks like crap.  That's why everyone's obsessed with keeping their iPod's in a case-- which only adds cost and thickness and keeps you from seeing how shiny it is anyway.  (+) Music Sharing You can listen to your friend's music wirelessly.  And even take it with you for a few days. No need to plug into a computer.  You just stand in front of each other and transfer the music wirelessly.  (+) FM Radio. I didn't think I'd use it, but I do. Cool interface.  (+) Menu design makes sense.  Easy to use.  (-) Thickness The Zune is .58" thick.  The 30Gb iPod is .43" thick. Of course, you have to buy a case for your shiny, scratch-prone iPod and that will add more than the difference in thickness.  (-) Looks like a scroll wheel. It looks like the Zune has an iPod-like scroll wheel, even though that's not how it functions.  They should have done something to make it look different.  Now people will probably think they just copied the scroll wheel, even though they didn't.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As I write this review I am listening to some classic Hendrix tracks through my home-stereo via my brand new black Zune. I've had the product for a few hours now and I've been nothing but impressed. The zune software is very similar to WMP 11 and it was a breeze to set up. In fact, within 3 minutes I was syncing all of my exising MP3 and WMA tracks with the Zune and downloading brand new content from the Zune store for free with my 14 day trial pass. The interface is very user-friendly, and I prefer its look to the increasingly cumbersome interface of the itunes music store.   The Zune itself is just ridiculously cool. The screen is as nice as I've seen on a handheld device, and the interface took me all of 10 seconds to master. Everything about the product makes wonderful sense. The ability to use this with the zune subscription music service is a fantastic feature as I am an avid fan of all-you-can-download music.   So let's recap: Fast, easy, problem free installation of software.                 Ingenius user interface                 Beautiful LCD screen                  Zune store allows subscription downloads   I'm still undecided about sound quality, but so far I can't complain. I also can't comment on battery life because I've only had the zune for maybe four hours now. This product kills all other hard-drive based MP3 players in terms of over-all end-user experience. I've owned an iriver, ipod, and zen nano before and this is my favorite player thus far. I-Pod could compete with this only if they put a larger screen on gen. six ipods and allow subscription based downloads in itunes.   Okay, the wireless sharing feature will be a gimmick as far as i'm concerned because the chances of me meeting many people who also own a zune seem quite remote.. let's face it, not that many people are sporting 250 dollar MP3 players at my apartment complex or my college campus.

<Content>Got my Zune this morning and I like it a lot. Installation is very straight forward. The interface is intuitive and responsive. However I am going to return it because it does not support Unicode. My Chinese and Japanese song title becomes a bunch of squares. It also does not support any lossless format, not even WMA Lossless.

<Title>Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs.

<Title>Dear Santa...
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While holiday shopping this afternoon I got a chance to try out the new Zune.  The user interface is extremely easy to use - perhaps even more intuitive than the I-pod.  I'm not as enamored with the "wheel" motion of the I-pod player as some, so I was pleased to find the Zune's D-pad style controls responding as I would expect. Everything had that familiar feel - even for a first time user.    I liked how the menus went both deep and broad - I had the option to drill down into a specific category, but then I could also scroll across song options within that category.  I had a good sense of direction throughout the experience.  The music sounded good and crisp.  The video seemed fluid - I didn't notice any pixellation.  I liked the radio feature too - something I'm more likely to use than the alarm clock or calendar feature on the I-pod.  The addition of games would be nice - perhaps something to purchased off of the Zune Marketplace down the road.  I would have liked to see a Zune player without the wi-fi at a cheaper price point, but we'll just have to wait and see if the wi-fi music world that Microsoft is promoting really takes off.    All-in-all, a good player.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to have seen a AC or car adapter included in the package - you're looking at an additional $40 for the official Power Kit.    This one is going on my list to Santa (or in my case - Mrs. Claus).  And yes, I'll probably ask for the brown.

<Title>Do not buy first generation of Zune.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky.   OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play.   The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod.   13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless.   It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes.   In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.

<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item for my 14 yr old son as a birthday gift.  He really wanted one and I was happy that I could get last year's 30GB for so much less than the newest 8GB.  My son used it for about a week and the system crashed.  I called Microsoft and got nowhere on customer services.  After waiting about 3 weeks for a return box to show up, I contacted Amazon customer service and had it shipped out the next day.  Then a replacement arrived just a couple of days later and we were back in business. He absolutely loves it and I was impressed that it was so versatile.  He's got music, pictures and even episodes of his favorite television shows on it already.  I buy on Amazon all the time and the customer service is simple and incredible.  I would recommend this product and Amazon to anyone.

<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune 30G as a Christmas gift for my son. Of course, I had to load the software and upload about 100 CD's to it for him. All of this took about a day or so. I didn't have any of the trouble that I see some others have listed on their reviews.   In addition, I bought the PQ DVD to Zune converter ($29.95) online from their site (searched for it by name with Google), and uploaded about 2 seasons of his favorite TV show for him. That took about 6 hours. The screen is perfect for TV shows, but the widescreen movies don't look very good on it. I don't recommend trying to watch those. If you have full screen DVD's at home, those look fine when uploaded.   He used it for about 2 weeks (all day every day) before leaving it behind one day when he went to school. That's when I had the perfect opportunity to use it myself. I took it to work out and ended up watching TV shows through about a 2 hour workout! I loved it so much, I bought one for myself. My second son was so jealous of our new Zunes, that I ended up buying a 3rd as a gift for his 8th grade graduation. Now when they want me to hear their latest "favorite" music, they just wirelessly share it with me through the click of a couple buttons.   I'm a HUGE Zune fan! However, I recommend the following items for optimum enjoyment (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5):  Book - How to do everything with your Zune Software - PQ DVD to Zune Converter and Windows Vista Charger - I am buying a charger of some sort today because we can only charge the Zunes on our computers. I want to find some way to charge them in the car or just with a typical wall outlet. Battery life is really good on them though. (I only charge them about every 14 hours unless we watch a lot of video.)  Oh, one last thing, don't buy the Zune pass or anything like that until you actually start using the Zune. You may decide you don't really need it. I bought a $25 card to give my son with his Zune at Christmas because I thought he needed it to buy music online. So far, he's only bought a couple of songs. We have so many CD's that he just doesn't take the time to surf for extras.

Any way about the zune it's self it's decent. Like everyone else say's the software is horrendous. I absolutely hate it.  The only reason I got this is because my Creative Zen broke from me dropping it. And It was the cheapest at 99 bucks.  Also Check around for the new Zune's the 80 gigs one's on other sites are selling them for $249. So do shop around.  That's all

<Content>Poorly designed, poorly executed. Is too bulky, is riddled with bugs, and does not work near as well as my 30GB iPod. The wheel is not as easy as iPod's, the battery life is not as good as they state, you have to buy from their store (which is DEFINITELY no iTunes Store!) Overall, I was not impressed with this effort, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you bought it, take it back, quick! Let's just face it, this is yet another so-called "iPod Killer" that falls on it's face. Mr. Gates, give it up. Ande besides, who listens to the radio anymore? This product stinks, and is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

I picked it up, and I must say, The interface is extremely easy to use and well designed. Sure it uses proprietary computer software, but so does apple. The screen is a good deal larger than the vidio-ipod's, making up for the slight increase in size. The finish is a scratch resistant feeling rubberized plastic, much better than the ipods. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this device. This deffinatly will be a true contender for the ipod.

<Title>Looks awesome. Can't wait to get mine for Christmas.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I'd like to remind everyone who encouraged others to buy an ipod that this is the place to review a Zune. We all know what an iPod is and we all know that iPod and Zune are competing.   I went to go see the Zune today instore and I got a chance to play around with it a little. I read a lot of reviews beforehand and going to see it hands on was the last of my research to see if the Zune is really all that it's cracked up to be. Some reviews from different websites stated things such as:  "You can't view your now playing song"        -Yes you can. Whoever didn't notice this didn't take much time to figure it out.   "You can't shuffle the songs"        -As soon as you click on a catergory (songs, artists, etc.) the first option is to shuffle all.  "The album artwork looks bad"       -No, it really doesn't.   Overall, the Zune is very easy to control and a very nice mp3 player. The pictures and movies looked really good, the radio sounded good, songs sounded crisp and clear, features such as setting pictures to the backround, viewing movies in landscape, etc. are really nice..

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't listen to people who own iPods and write reviews like the previous ones to try and convince themselves that they got the better deal. The Zune is, like I said, very nice. It's extremely easy to use, the software is good, and battery life is good. I've been playing with it all day but had to stop so that I write this review to try to dispel the previous inaccurate and flat out dumb reviews. About the size: It's the same width, 0.3" taller, and 0.15" deeper. I'm ok with that seeing how as the screen on the Zune is 20% larger. The Zune has a built in FM tuner, the iPod does NOT. The Zune has wireless capabilities, the iPod does NOT. The ONLY thing the iPod has that I wish the Zune had is the scroll wheel. There aren't too many accessories out there for it yet, but once word gets around that it's a lot better than the iPod there will be a lot more and they'll be a lot easier to find. So don't listen to these bitter people who have recently spent the same amount on an inferior product.

<Title>Not even close
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked out the Zune today at Best Buy. I already have two ipods so was just wondering how the Zune compared. I tried to keep an open mind but this thing isn't even close to the refinement of the Ipod or other MP3 players. They had the black and brown Zune on display. Yikes, that brown is uuuuuugly.  The wheel and buttons felt cheap and the over all look seemed cheap. The only nice thing is the screen.   Size wise the Zune is too big in my opinion. It is the size of my original 5 Gig ipod that came out in 2001. The 30 gig ipod is so much thinner and feels more refined.   I can't speak for the music store but Itunes is so good I can't imagine it being any better.   While I was there nobody even noticed the Zune. No big MS marketing materials pointing people to the Zune. Just two lonely Zunes that didn't stand out at all to the other many MP3's, let alone the Ipod. In fact, one of the Zunes had an error on it and wouldn't turn on. It just kept flashing a battery icon as if the unit did not see the battery. MS has a way to go before people will even look at this thing. When I was there a lady came up and said the the Best Buy guy, I'm looking for a 30 gig MP3 for my son's bday and he wants and Ipod. The guy never even suggested the Zune and so she bought her Ipod and went on her way. I think this will be typical of this holiday season. Most consumers want an Ipod and that is about it. Some people will get it for the screen size but for me, I'd rather wait for the larger screen Ipods to come out.

<Title>What was I thinking!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I'm not very techy person, I like owning cool gadgets and admit to have spent a good chunk of money on them in my lifetime. So with all the hype around this Zune thing, I had to get one. Close to 300 bucks later, I have my gadget, sitting in my home office desk. But did I get any cool-factor joy for the price?   No sir. For starters, here's my quick findings:  Its huge. What sort of baggy-pants were part of the group testing this product? And you get the same 30G for that extra bulk - where's the progress? Screen seems less brighter/sharper than I expected, especially in unfavorable lighting. Center button looks like a circular scroll wheel but isn't - its a fake (just a cheap 4-corner version). Installation is slow and has a lot of steps with corny pictures of people I don't care about. I still don't understand why I can't use American dollars to buy songs, instead of these "points". Seems like its a ploy to make me spend more money, like casinos with the chips that don't feel like real money.  I could go on and on, but I don't think its worth the effort... I'm sure I'll find some glitches and more gripes over the next few days. Or maybe I'll just put it back in the wrapping and wait for a "re-gift" opportunity.

<Title>Redefine Refined.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Rarely do you see a product from Microsoft that isn't subject to a barrage of heavily (and I do mean _heavily_) biased reviews, comparing it to other products and services that typically doing whatever Microsoft's products do, only better.  Look at the so-called "credible" reviewers working for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Whatever happened to journalist standard of forming and supporting a credible and unbiased opinion?  Perhaps if you set the competition aside (or look at it on less subjective and comparative scale) you will be able to grasp a fair review of a product.  But may I say that even the Zune does not require this formality, for it is a capable, stable, and solid product in nearly every regard.  Having been looking forward to the November 14th release date for a while now, it was safe to say that I was overjoyed when the day finally came.  After getting up in the morning, eating a quick breakfast, showering, and heading off to my single class for the day, it finally hit me that today would be the day that I would experience the Zune first-hand.  Certainly the harsh words put out by the big-league review columnists couldn't be completely true, right?  Come 10 AM, and there I was standing at the local Circuit City, eager to finally get my hands on the product.  After corralling a service rep to fetch one from the display case, making the choice of Black for color, checking out, getting back in the car, driving home, and getting upstairs to my computer, the time that I had longed for finally came to fruition.  The first thing you'll get with Zune is the brown package.  The box itself is fairly small, and is opened by pulling the top off from the bottom.  Once open, you will be greeted with the phrase "Welcome to the Social," on the side of the inner box.  Open a the flip-out side panel, and you will see your Zune for the first time, nestled in an indentation in the packaging.  A brown cord allows you to dislodge the Zune from the packaging, and two more flip-out panels to the left and right of the Zune house the magnetic black ear buds, and the sync USB cable.  Another opening at the top houses a small instructional guide, software, and other papers, along with a carrying pouch.  Overall, the packaging is nice, and allows you to get to your product fairly quickly.  The instructions are very simple, and you won't have much of a problem figuring them out.  The carrying pouch, however, is too small and tight-fitting, and seems to be provided to prevent damage from scratches, rather than impacts.  Installing the software doesn't take too long, and after a restart, you are prompted to plug in the device.  You will be given the opportunity to name the device, and you will then be guided to setting up a Zunetag account.  I haven't yet set up any online service with the device yet, so I cannot comment on how well the Zune store functions.  The device will automatically synchronize your music the first time out, with the option of synchronizing your pictures and videos as well.  The process went fairly fast, and any additional syncs after the initial load are quick.  The Zune software itself seems to be derived heavily from Windows Media Player 11, as the album-based libraries and options dialog will suggest, and everything fits well and is laid out in a practical manner.  While some may be turned off by the fact that you can't just use Windows Media Player for adding music, it should be noted that you would require a new piece of software anyway if you want to upgrade your devices software when it is updated.  Once all of your media is loaded, it's on to the Zune itself.  Physically, the device is tall, as to accommodate its 3-inch QVGA display, and is semi-thick; no thicker than the size of a small-medium cell phone.  The device is finished in a rubbery matte finish that feels very sturdy and lays true on a flat surface.  The button layout and functionality is well designed, and the only problem you will have navigating the exceptionally streamlined and intuitive menu system is accidentally pressing the center button instead of up on the directional circle, as they are both finished smooth and shiny.  The portrait-based display is very efficient for displaying lists of albums, songs, or play lists, and the album-art centric Now Playing screen also features an thoughtful layout, showing you the pertinent information to your current song.  Video and picture playback forces the device into landscape mode, rotating the screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  This allows you to take full advantage of the large screen when viewing said media.  While the Wifi's state in the device is virtually crippled, it is reassuring to know that it may very well be taken advantage of in a more practical fashion through future software updates.  The sharing feature is nice in theory, but the limitations that are imposed even on non-copy protected music seems a bit excessive, especially for elusive tracks that won't be easily found on online music stores.  The FM Radio feature is a very nice addition, and the display of track and station information is incredibly nice and useful.  Reception won't be without occasional static, but overall it is very consistent and distortion-free.  While you cannot record live radio as you can with other players, the ability to view track information is a near-exclusive feature and is very valuable.  Overall, playback is smooth and uninterrupted by jostles and bumps, and the menu system is responsive and polished.  Audio quality is top-notch, with all levels of audio -   bass, midrange, and treble - reproduced accurately and crisply.  The unit allows for several equalizer presets, and each one has a unique sound to it.  The absence of a bass-boost feature may seem like a loss, but you'll be surprised by the amount of kick you receive by the default settings that you'll learn to not miss such a feature.  Video playback is also smooth, but while I haven't encountered a problem yet, you may be prone to skipping or momentary pauses due to excessive bumping or movement, since the device is not solid-state.  The device, while larger than other players on the market, holds a presentable, professional and refined look.  The physical integrity (yet curiously lightweight construction) of the case only bolsters the units longevity and standout power.  The semi-transparent case with a "double-shot" of color looks very cool in person, and the unit definitely stands out among the sea of white-colored devices.  It is also a magnet for popularity at the office, as one person tells another person, who tells two other people about your new Zune...and they all try to use the directional-pad as a touch pad for some reason...  My only gripes about the device come from the people who brush it aside under the veil of being a Microsoft product.  Microsoft isn't printed on the device for a good reason: it's unlike any other Microsoft product you will have ever used.  The intuitive interface is easy and fun to use, the synchronization is fast and seamless, and the product's longevity through software updates gives you reassurance that even though it is a first-generation product, you won't be sorry when they announce a software breakthrough.  I personally recommend the device for those seeking a competent, well-rounded media player.  The combination of easy-to-use software and superb playback is a major strong point of the device, and the Wifi feature, while limited now, will most definitely come into play in more useful ways in the near future.  The only shortcomings of the device are limited format support, and the need for separate software and drivers to make the unit work on a computer.  In the end, the product is a positive mark for Microsoft's Zune initiative, and if the goals of the product are anything like that of the Xbox, then we may have a product with some serious competitive power in a very short time.

<Title>I just got one!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off i want to start off by saying that i have owned a creative vision m mp3 player as well as numerous other ones, but none have compared to the zune that i just picked up. I like the fact that it doesn't get your fingerprints all over it like the creative or the ipod video does. Also downloading and transfering music and videos with the software are easier than any other program out there. Also you can subscribe to download as much music as you want without having to pay a dollar a song like itunes, thats a big plus for me. Add in all the accesories coming out for it, theres just no competition in my book.  To all those saying theres bugs and stuff are full of it. mine works great and looks awesome as well. Plus no ipod user can compete with this screen. Two thumbs up in my book!!!

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm no tech-genious and I'm not a MS fanboy either, but the Zune has been a good buy so far for me. Sure it's a little bigger than a fraking ipod, but it's not that noticeable. Another good thing is the screen. It's bright and crisp(from what I've seen so far). The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup. I can't compare it with iTunes, because I've never really worked with it. Overall it's a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good player.

<Content>microsoft is trying, but they still have a long way to go. the zune is noticeably thicker than the ipod and the 4 way control pad is a real step backwards from the ipod's touch wheel. i like the bigger screen, but not enough to suffer through the pain of a 1.0 software release. no thank you.  after criticizing apple for making a closed ecosystem, microsoft abandons it's own "plays for sure" partners and ditches the whole "choice" argument in hopes of making an end-to-end solution that doesn't suck.  keep trying, guys. i'll check back at version 2.0

<Title>Good but not GREAT!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this primarily because it has a built in fm tuner. For some reason it seemed really galing to me that other brands had the nerve to  make us get an attachment to listen to the radio. That being said here goes the pro's and con's for me.  Pros-   Attractive- Some find it a bit bulky, but as someone who grew up carrying walkman cassette players or portable cd players, the size is not too much for me. I like the matte texture because it gives the player a soft look and makes scratches less likely.  Large Screen- The screen is very nice, I would not want to spend hours and hours watching it, but it is crisp and clear with great color.  30GB- This is plenty of space for me to keep all of my music and then some. I also find it handy for carrying images to show to friends and family members.   Headphones- For stock headphones, they are great. They almost never get tangles up on me and they are magnetized so you can stick the buds together.  CONS-  All of the cons, for me, are software related. I had no initial trouble with the software, it was not until the November upgrade that I started having all sorts of problems.   One is that the albums, album images, and artist don't match one another. I can be listening to NIN and an image of an ATB album will show but the album will be a third artist.  Another is that for a time I could not use the Zune software due to errors in installation. Then there was an error where the software was not recognizing my Zune.   My last con is that it does not support much of my music files, which are   WMA. I think their idea in that is trying to create a Monopoly in the way that Itunes has but it just does not make sense to me. If they are not beating IPOD in design(they aren't) then they should try by beating them by being more inclusive.   Overall I am glad I have my Zune, even with all its little quirks and irritations.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>Like the Zune, but not the program
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I personally found i like the Zune better than the previous mp3 player i had which was an ipod. However as for the program with my music library i cannot say the same. It is so difficult to use. Much less convenient and harder to sift through all my music. And as far as putting new music in, it is much more difficult. The titles of songs and artists get all scrambled. I love my itunes library, i just put a cd in and the names come in fine and if i want to change it i just edit it, the Zune program does not work this easily. It's quite a hassle to where i haven't even bothered putting new music on it.  So basically i wish i could have the Zune player with the itunes library setup/software. I do love the Zune itself, the color, thickness, sturdiness.  So if you are a person that either has all their music organized, no burned cd's with unknown or misc. artists or someone who doesn't mind disorganized music, then this might not be a bad choice for you.

<Title>WOW and Meh at the same time
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for $140 to sell off to someone else for $200 but while I connected it for him and showed him how to do things, I found out a lot of disturbing tidbits.  First, It can't even connect to a computer easily.  It gets the famous "ipod  errors" in which if you disconnect it without removing it safely from the PC it'll act funky for a while.  Though this is something I should have known previously (also not having a MSC connection type either), still...MS should have done a better job of making this more friendly for any and all computers.  It sucks that I can't use 30 GB's worth of space to store anything.  Another issue was turning it off.  The manual didn't really elaborate on that so I was extremely confused.  It seemed to be in a "stand by" mode instead of "off".    All of those pitfalls have sold me on NOT buying this product BUT there were definitely upsides to this device.  The screen is HUGE and vibrant.  The design is groovy and great.  Everything about the player and its features is great.  Only problems were connecting to PC's (just imagine a PC that has a non-commish account...how do you disconnect it then???),  no MSC mode to drag and drop  any files you want, and having to use software.

<Title>Love my Zune
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After using a Sony High Speed Net MD Walkman recorder (with mini disks) for a couple of years, it was time to update to a newer player. I now have a Zune 30 GB player and love it. For a female over 40 yrs of age it's so easy to use (I even got more helpful info and tips with the book "How to Do Everything with Your Zune" by Rick Broida). So far I have 1299 songs, 91 pictures & 47 movie videos on my device and still have over 7 GB free. The battery seems to last a long time, easily charges while hooked up to my laptop or a wall charger (faster charge time with the wall charger). The picture quality  so sharp and clear. There is even a built in FM tuner that have RBDS, meaning, some of the stations show the call letters, type of program & even the current song & or artist. The best thing is now I don't have to carry CDs in my car. My Zune plugs right into the car radio (made for MP players) and sounds wonderful. This unit has so much more features that I could write a book about it! My Zune was worth every cent!

<Title>Lots of problems
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had he chance to use one for a few hours now, and in that time I've still not gotten used to the lack of a real scroll wheel.  The unit really shows its weakness when compared directly hand to hand with the 30GB iPod...though that's not my iPod of choice.  It sucks that it doesn't work with the Windows Media Player, but requires yet an additional application to be installed.  I knew it was incompatible with iTunes and Microsoft's own Plays for Sure...so all other major stores and subscription services don't work with it, but not being integrated with Windows Media Player is just mind bogglingly lame.  The possible advantages over the iPod in theory weren't that was in reality.  I found none of my favorite radio stations where able to get any decent reception, and even those stations with reception had static when I moved with the unit.  Wireless has no purpose whatsoever other than letting someone else with Zune sample a song before buying...this of course requires finding someone with a Zune, negotiating the transfer, and then waiting for it to occur.  I'd prefer to let someone simply jack into my iPod, burn them a CD or point them to the iTunes Store.  Yes, the unit is ugly.  Get over it.  I don't care how it looks when it's in my pocket cranking out tunes.  One nice feature that I'd give it is that the display is mirror like enough to actually use as such when turned off.  This is like using the back of an iPod as a mirror.

<Title>Great Performance, But Lack of Support and other Problems Plague this "iPod Killer"
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I do not work for Microsoft, I do not work for Apple. This is a competely unbiased review, and I do actually own the product.  PROS: -Bright, vivid screen - A 3" Screen makes it the largest screen of a device this size. Can be viewed in portait or landscape, this very clear screen has good viewing angles and rivals very nicely with the iPod. -Great Sound - This is what REALLY matters right? -Design - With a durable rubberized surface, no fingerprints or scratches will be obvious, and feels safer to carry around in more rugged locations. Also, all three colors look really great. -Wi-Fi - Connect to fellow Zunesters to view what their listening to, share music, and all while not drastically reducing battery life. -Great Interface - The internal software interface of the Zune is great. It is actually built on the Windows Mobile CE OS, and the PC Software is built on the Windows Media Player 11 Software. Great performance and quick menus. -Plays Movies: H.264 (Quicktime/HD), MPEG-4, and WMV (native) -Plays Music: MP3, AAC, and WMA (native) -Views JPEGS  CONS: -Mediocre Battery - Music ranges from 10-13 hours, and video ranges from 2.5-3.5 hours. Very poor compared to the iPod. -3 Plays, 3 Days - Absolute bull. When you transfer a song, it only plays 3 times, or you only get 3 days (whatever comes first). That is not near long enough to enjoy a song. -LACK OF SUPPORT: DivX and Xvid don't play, Lossless music doesn't play, and only JPEGs are viewable. Everything else has to be converted in some form of the other. Previous subscription and protected music won't work on this device, and you are restricted to the Zune Marketplace for music. -Zune Marketplace - Although a great start, you can't buy movies on it yet, and you have to buy everything in points, which is a pain, because 79 points is $.99. -Wi-Fi restrictions - No wireless computer synching, transfering, or web browsing. -5 Click Wheel - Nothing innovative. Quite annoying actually; although responsive, it is nothing like the iPod. -Propietary USB - USB to USB-A(Mini USB) cords won't fly, you have to use what comes in the box to connect. It does charge relatively quickly though.  BOTTOM LINE: No, iPod killer, but a great step in the right direction. Microsoft's transition from Software to Hardware will continue to improve and this might be a tough competitor for the iPod this holiday season due to its large amount of hype. Unless you are really keen on getting the device, wait until the next generation. As an MP3 player, it is great; at the top of its class in sound, but still pails in comparison to the might iPod.

<Content>Firstly, our local Super Target is giving twenty five dollars gift certificate with each Zune. So, that should cover the taxes you pay. The offer is valid this week only.  Secondly, the screen looked brilliant and sharp. I don't care what the resolution is, it looked great to me.  Thirdly, the menu and the controls were very easy to use. I could use the whole functionality while I was playing with it in the shop for 15 minutes or so. (Well, I couldn't figure out how to preset FM stations.)  Finally, I didn't but it. I knew before that it doesn't have voice recording or FM recording function. So, 4 starts. I was interested in the device, even with the missing function, but it wasn't so attractive when I looked at it for me to buy it right then. I can wait to see the reviews of other people. My iAudio MP3 player that Zune might replace has VR function, that I do use once in a while. Also, could a real owner post if you can connect this device to any computer (without its own software) and be able to access the hard disk? Another reason, I didn't buy right then was that the white model wasn't on display. I would like to have a look at that before making my decision.  If I end up buying the device, I will update this posting.

<Title>I would give Zune a try; great sound and video
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is a great product.  Its standard Wifi separates itself from the pack.  Also, FM is standard unlike some of its competitors.  It does feel bigger then some other players out there (because it is!) but that shouldn't matter.  Most people put their players on their belt, in their pocket, etc.  The extra "girth" makes it feel a bit more solid.  Plus, the benefits of the bigger size (larger LCD screen for video) is worth it.  Pros  Exceptional sound.  The best I've listened to yet. Exceptional video quality.  The larger screen matters.  Trust me. Scratchless and fingerprintless body Wifi which, today, you can transfer songs to a friend Wifi, which, tomorrow, will hopefully bring more functionality Seamless integration with Xbox 360 Decent ear buds that fold up nicely Software and on-line store   Cons No bells and whistles  No equalizer (hopefully, this will change via a firmware upgrade) Songs you transfer to a friend can only be played 3 times/last 3 days No video downloads from website at launch (not a problem for me)

<Title>I PURCHASED MINE
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased mine yesterday from a local Bestbuy (Opening day) so far I really like this guy. There are a few things that Microsoft should change but the overall device is great. Here are my thoughts.   Positives -  - The screen is very clear... none like it - I purchased the Brown and love the look. - FM radio is very clear and picks up great - Video is sharp  - Menu on device is very easy to use and had great features like adding to quicklist.  - The texture of the device is really cool. It looks like it should last a really long time.    Negatives -  - Its rather big for a 30 gig but its still a good size. Its not too big and bulky.  - HATE! The PC software. The software that you us to move your songs over is HORRIBLE. It needs a ton of work. I am a Network Admin and know my computer software... and this one was complicated to figure out at first look. After playing with it for a hour I started to fugure out how to use it. I understand it now but still do not like the software. If you have a hard time using itunes, then you will have an even harder time using this sotware. This is the only downfall I have really found with this guy. The software automatically starts to sync ALL your music in youe "My Music" folder to your Zune. (I have 80 gigs of music that I do not want on there) Another big mistake with the software.  - It only comes with a USB connection and head phones.

<Title>It's a great product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got mine yesterday and I have to say that I am pretty impressed. I was surprised at how fluid the menus moved and how well it felt in the palm of my hand. The video quality is very nice, and I like the blue glow that the thick  transparent plastic cover has. I would have gotten an Ipod, but every time I tried a demo unit out I was afraid I was going to break it. No worries about that with the Zune, it feels nice and sturdy.  I see people complain about the thickness, but I don't see what the problem is. Overall I found the software to be pretty self explanatory. I think the people that are nit picking the Zune are probably Apple fan boys, do us all a favor and go back to your steamy Steve Jobs fantasies. Leave the real reviews to people that actually own the device.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a big fan of Microsoft and what it stands for but I dont know what were they thinking with this idea!!!!!!! I was gonna buy a MP3 player about six months ago but when I heard Microsoft is coming out with its own, I decided to wait..so yesterday I got this "Zune" and tried to put it in to my laptop..I have many friends who have ipods and i have closely seen and experimented on ipods of different generations at the stores myself...and also heard how easy is to use iTunes...so when I installed Zune Marketplace...I was surprised how complicated things were...you have to sign up for this...this...and that..I was so mad..I was like all I want is to pay 99cents and download a song!!!!! after 2 hrs of playing with it I've decided to return it and buy an Apple ipod...very disapointed in Microsoft..This product looks like it was hurried to put in to the market..to compete with an Apple...

<Content>Just when you think that technology surprises have all been used up, along comes the Big M with this bad boy.  Who could have envisioned a small, hard-drive based device that plays music and video on the go?!  Wow!  Just like when they invented the video game console, I can tell that Microsoft is really onto something here.  Plus, it comes in BROWN!!!  My advice - don't just buy this player, buy some Microsoft stock.  It is clear that the technology magic is just not gonna be stopped in Redmond anytime soon!

<Title>Terrible Product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried this last night and it's horrible! The scroll wheel doesn't work as well as the iPod's. It's a cheap immitation. It's basically just 4-directional arrows underneath a wheel! The iPod blows this away. Also...the sharing feature is useless! Nobody else has one. Every time I turn it on there is nobody to share with. The social isn't so social afterall.  Now the major gripe...This thing is "chunky." It's ginormous! The iPod is so much more elegant.  In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.  I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod. I highly suggest if you are looking for an mp3 player that you sing another Zune and get the iPod as well. There just isn't a better player!

<Title>Wait For The Next Generation
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 2 iPods and now a Zune.  I have always refused to buy the first year/generation of any product.  First year/generation models are always buggy.  I broke that rule and bought the Zune.  I should have waited.  The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod.  The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well.  The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either.  The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market.  I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it.  They should have anyway.  I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod.  When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video.  Buyer beware.

I bought this to put movies on for trips.  I still have not figured out where to buy them.  I hoped to find them on Zune Marketplace but if they are on there I don't know where to look.

<Content>I purchased my Zune about a month ago, had no problems installing the software on my PC.  I am 60 years old and really enjoy using my Zune with the Shuffle All option, 'cause then I am not listening to one artist all the time.  Also, I really like the FM tuner.  I have the option to listen to the radio for even more music.  I bought the 30GB but I really think I could have gotten by with an 8GB.  The Zune 30GB is a bit big and a little heavier but I do like the big screen.

The sound is full, the color sharp and bright, and the software easy to use, though the initial update the Zune goes through when you first install the software is long with very little indication of its progression status.  Still I love it and getting new music on it is a snap.  Plus, the red color is cool!

<Title>zune in question
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have installed a little over 8 gigs of music and 2 gigs of podcast. I find that when music is installed the zune picks the genre(not happy) I have yet to find out how to change it myself if able. the player works well when playing audio quality wise.the exception is when "shuffle all" is used the zune will move to a new selection in the middle of a song and this has happened multiple times.   The ability to get podcast from online is great although very slow process. I have not found how to get podcasts from a cd or dvd to install into the zune under podcasts instead of music as zune likes to put it.       I do say at this point in fairness to zune I have not fully investigated cures to these issues however they would not be issues if the software for the zune was more user friendly and informative.

<Title>30 Gig Zune
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned both the Zune and Ipod. I ended up with a Zune after my hardly used Ipod stopped working...I had the Ipod for 2 years and barely used it so I was mad when it just stopped working one day. I ended up buying a Zune because I found a deal for a 30 gig for 130.00 and I'm so happy with the Zune. I love the radio feature, how easy it is to find a certain band, the picture function, and the syncing function. My only grip with the Zune is the software. Itunes was very easy to use and I have had a hard time with the marketplace and loading music...I've finally figure it out but I wish they would make it more friendly user...I recommend the Zune over ipod...

<Title>As good if not better than Ipod
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zune 30gb for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I caught it on sale for $149 at Amazon and at that price I knew it was a bargain.  But the features and performance are what have really impressed me.  The color screen looks fantastic.  The scratch resistant case is great and it looks handsome.  The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  The little animated effects when you do different things are a nice touch.  The software is significantly different than Itunes.  But, after 15 minutes of use, you get the hang of it and I actually like it just as much if not more than Itunes.  All in all, this is a great product.  Do not hesitate to buy this over an Ipod.

<Content>I like it.  Had a Sandisk 8gb which was pretty good but wanted more memory so which one: zune or ipod.  I chose the zune for the price. I'm very happy with it.  I can put everything on it. The only problem is with the software.  It locks up on occassion.  You would think Microsoft would be able to find an easier way to program your zune. With a little work, I have been able to do what I want it to do.   I like the player so much my son got one.  He is very happy with it. I would recommend it unless you are tech-illiterate.  The software my be too complicated for you.  For the price vs. ipod, I'll buy the zune everytime.

<Title>My first dedicated media player - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software from version 1.0 to 1.1 right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though :*( so no Rush Limbaugh for me unless I start recording it.  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos on up to 5 different XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so its explains the lack of indicators, but not tactile response.

<Title>Death by a Thousand Cuts
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With Apple having sold 60 million iPods in the last 5 years, it's no wonder Microsoft felt it was necessary to go head-to-head with the iPod. Unfortunately, Zune is largely a tentative, half-baked effort. Despite the vast marketing campaign, prospective buyers should realize several important points about the Zune that isn't readily apparent in the advertisements.  1) Zune does not work with music bought from other Microsoft-backed stores like Napster and MTV's Urge.   2) The Zune's screen is physically larger, but has exactly the same resolution as the iPod: 320x240 pixels. You don't see more of anything - everything is just blown up to a larger size which can result in a larger but fuzzier image.  3) A lot of reviews like to quote how the Zune's battery life is "comparable" to the iPod. Unfortunately for Zune, it's only comparable when you compare it to the 30 GB iPod, which is significantly smaller and lighter than the Zune. The Zune's 14 hours of music playback doesn't look so impressive when compared to the 80 GB iPod, which is still physically smaller and lighter than the Zune. The 80 GB iPod plays 20 hours of music on a full charge and 6 hours of video, vastly outlasting the Zune.   You could play the 80 GB iPod at work almost a full work day (minus lunch) and still have about the same battery life as a fully charged Zune.  4) The Zune doesn't contain a lot of extras that are standard fare on the iPod. There's no Contacts, no Calendar, no Alarm Clock, no Sleep Timer, no Games (Tetris, Texas Hold 'Em Poker, PacMan, etc), no Screen Lock to prevent others from accessing your iPod's information without knowing your combination.  5) Zune does not support Audible Audiobooks.  6) You cannot share videos with Zune, only music.  7) There is no bookmarking feature - Zune will not remember if you stopped playing a song in the middle. The iPod will resume playing songs or audiobooks (see #5) at the point you stopped them.  8) Zune cannot be used as a external hard disk. The iPod can be used as a portable hard drive, which is handy for storing Word documents or other data (even application installers).  9) Songs purchased in the Zune marketplace involves buying Microsoft "points" at the rate of 400 points for $5.00. Since songs cost 79 points (not $0.99 cents), if you buy 1 song, Microsoft gets to hold 321 points or $4.01 of your money in an interest-bearing account until you decide to use them. In effect, consumers are giving Microsoft thousands of interest-free micro loans.  And with songs costing 79 points (a prime number), it is practically impossible to buy songs in a way where you can use up all your points. The system is designed to ALWAYS result in left-over points, which is basically unredeemed cash that Microsoft can take to the bank. It's not enough for Microsoft to make money by actually selling you a song - they need to make money off the money you don't (i.e. can't) spend at the Zune store because they priced songs at such a uneven number like 79 points.  10) Microsoft is giving Universal Music a cut for every Zune sold, on the premise that owners of MP3 players have tons of stolen music that Universal will never get paid for. Basically, even if all your music comes legally purchased from the Zune music store or ripped from music CDs that you bought, you are basically agreeing to pay a "stolen music" tax to Universal.  Given all these compromises, does a Zune's wireless sharing really seem all that appealing to you? After all, in order to share songs, you need to find another Zune user. I suspect that event will occur only slightly more frequently than winning the lottery for quite a while, which basically makes the wireless feature worthless.  To put it another way, it might be cool to be the first person on the block with a telephone, but the excitement will die quickly when you realize there's no one to call.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had a chance to go through a Zune software install with a friend. OOOOOOOPS, he was running Vista. ZUNE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA. Do not buy a Zune if you are running the Vista beta unless you have another PC or you must reinstall XP.  He had another PC with XP and loaded the Zune software on it. Install went OK after a couple of crashes, it appeared as if it had something to do with being a Guest. (Microsoft really should rethink the goofy pictures and Social references used in the install process.)  He moved some of his music over from the Vista machine to XP machine. OOOOOOPS, ZUNE ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH MUSIC HE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THROUGH MICROSOFT PLAYSFORSURE FOR HIS HIS DELL DJ (That was a showstopper for him).  As far as the Zune player. MP3's he had ripped at 160mhz sounded fine. The volume control is not very linear though, tough to adjust it to the exact volume you want. The larger screen is nice but not as crisp as the iPod. They are the same resolution so that makes sense. The unit is a bit clunky compared to the iPod but overall it felt pretty sturdy. The software on the unit is nice. Easy to search and album art fills the screen.  FWIW - He is returning this Zune and will wait for Zune 2.

<Title>My first dedicated portable media player purchase - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Zune Review  Firstly, I would like to say this is not a comparison to an IPOD. I haven't owned one, though I have played with several other brands of MP3 players.  Most of my media playback experience comes from using a PocketPC and 1gig memory card addons.  Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though. Would it have hurt to put AM on it too? Why not?  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos to the XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  One video format I would like to have seen supported by Zune is the .dvr-ms format used by Windows Media Center.  I found a plug-in to convert that format to .wmv format which syncs automatically (even if conversions are needed) and plays fine with the Zune however.   Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so it explains the lack of indicators, but not the lack of tactile response.  Overall: I am very pleased with my purchase. I chose the brown version because it matches (to some extent) the interior of my wood-grained Bimmer; and because to be `cool' one should be different.  When I hear all of the IPOD bigots saying the Zune sux `cause it ain't an IPOD, I wonder what ever happened to `Think Different'.

<Title>Zune  Vs  Zen  or iPod?
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my daughter a Zune for Christmas to replace her Micro Zen because she wanted something that played video. Now I really liked her Zen, but the Zune is 100% better. I brought it home and installed the software no problem and the Zune synced to her computer and transfered all her music automatically. The Zune sounds better than her Zen in my opinion, very crisp and clear. It is bigger but feels very good in hand. It's sturdy and feels solid. It feels like the kind of device, if jostled around in a book bag, purse, or accidentally dropped, that it would handle the abuse. (Her Zen already has a shaky connection where the earphones go so there is static if the device is moved around.) The controls are very easy to use and it seems to move effortlessly under my finger tips. The scroll layout is such a better design than the Zen. Now I don't own an iPod, but I have tried them out several times in the stores. I like the Zune's scroll better, because the iPod scroll goes too fast for me and I have to back track to get to a song or artist. Again the iPod seemed fragile to me compared to the Zune. The 3 inch screen is wonderful! It is bright and clear and the video playback is excellent...I love to watch it.  You can customize the background with any pictures that you download and watch a slide show while you listen to music. Now I feel she won't need the wireless feature for a while (I don't think a lot of her friends will have Zunes, they all have iPods), but that is not why I bought the Zune.  I cannot comment on the Zune Marketplace for purchasing songs. The Zune will now go back in the box until Christmas. The Software is uninstalled from her computer.

<Title>Wait for next gen or buy an iPod
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've used an iPod and Sony MP3 players for as long as they existed. My first impressions with the Zune:  I hated Sony for cornering me into using their own crappy software and compression, I guess you get that too with the Zune. The interface and software (iTunes) on the iPod is way more polished. iTMS offers incomparable music purchase experience.   Sound quality is better on the iPod (and even better if you invest in decent ear buds.)   The fact that the battery doesn't run that long on a Zune is a big turn off, I need it to run during my commute, and this is not lasting as long as the iPod 5G.   Screen is bigger on the Zune but same resolution so who cares because the video quality (compression) is what makes a difference and I don't want my videos to take more space!   The HD size is 30GB so there is no choice of 80GB model?   And what's up with the brown model? Yuk!  Wireless is useless: sharing DRM protected songs with other Zunes withing 3 feet is a meh for me. I can't use wireless to sync with my PC, why?   DRM on the Zune is also a big turn off. Play4sure incompatible with new software? What's up with that?   With the iPod, I download songs from iTMS and burn them to CDs. It removes the DRM and I don't get stock with Apple if I don't have to (think long term investment.) I can't do that with the Zune. Microsoft by releasing a  DRM that breaks compatibility with previous DRM already showed that we can't rely on them for supporting anything in the future.   End of line: Wait for a better model or get an iPod from Christmas.

<Title>First: Own the device. Second: Realize that the iPod is not incredible. Third: Neither is the Zune, but it is definately good.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the player yesterday, and so far I have only been happy with it. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the DRM issues and because I would've liked a little more battery life. That said, both of those issues don't bother me much at all, and I have been able to work around both of them. Also, no player is perfect.   The player itself is well designed. The interface is well constructed and easy to navigate. So easy in fact that they don't include a manual with the player, and that won't impede your using it. I haven't worked much with the zune software, though from what I have done it seems well designed. The whole marketplace issues don't really matter to me because I buy actual cd's, but for those who live in cyberspace, I can see where complaints come from.  For all of the criticisms against the body design, I have this to say. You are all comparing the zune to a device that is thin, fragile, fingerprints to an abscene degree, and has a nasty habit of crashing on its loyal customers. Apple has marketed the iPod brilliantly and have done a fairly good job designing a player, and as we have seen they develope quite the loyal fanbase. They are not perfect. And neither is the zune.  It's not tiny, but then again calling it huge is a relative term. It's the size of a normal mp3 player from a few years ago, and no one complained then, and I'm not complaining now. It sounds good, and these are the only earbud headphones I have decided to use, and I like to think I care about teh quality of my music. It's comfortable to hold and use. That's the bottom line.  My advice: consider this player if you are on the market for an mp3 player. Go to a store and try a floor model for yourself. Form your own opinion and realize that it is my opinion, not yours, that the player is well designed and has potential.  Also, both Gates and Jobs are full of themselves. In concept I like apple. In practice I admit I use microsoft. Neither should be preached about or have a blind fanbase.

<Title>Finally, something better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The brown Zune looks great and works great too! The software is excellent (makes it easy to pull down album art), the interface on the device is great, and I just got finished watching Garden State on my Zune after converting it to WMV from my purchased DVD (you will need extra, although free, software to do this).   Don't believe all the negative buzz about this product. As a person who has owned three iPods (1G, 3G, and 1G nano), this thing is superior (and FAR less scratchable).   I called Zune tech support to get some help, and I talked to a real person within two minutes. They were actually friendly and helpful, unlike Apple.

<Content>Don't waste your time with this product. It isn't that the device is bad, it's actually pretty good, but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update. To show you how bad this software is, Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems!!! Instead of developing the web site, maybe they should should've made a better effort on the software. If you don't mind headaches, wasted hours, and never getting the program to work correctly, then by all means buy this. Otherwise I suggest the iPod. The higher price is worth it.

<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this and the instructions SAY NOTHING about draining the device completely before you try to charge it. I had to call tech support to find this out. You have to do this in order to get it to charge...  then after it doesnt respond (try pressing play after an hour and if nothing happens) charge it on your USB... within about 5-10 minutes you will see the zune logo pop on the screen and start downloading the firmware. I hated this whole draining part.. but I love the product! 5 stars!

<Content>I hate iTunes, so i choose to avoid iPods.  This is the best MP3 player i've had so far.  Much better than previous units from Creative Labs that kept malfunctioning...  Pros:  Very easy to use, fantastic looking screen/menues/navigation, even the software is pretty intuitive.  Compatible with xbox 360 which is kind of neat.  Lots of space.  Cons: battery life kinda sucks, i usually have to charge it at the end of every day so it's good to go for tomorrow.

Kind of wish I had paid extra to get the 2nd generation 80GB because it is not as bulky. But I am very satisfied with the 30GB Zune(1st Gen). I like the screen. Big and colorful. The software is easy to understand and the battery last a long time.

There is no documentation whatsoever to help you learn how to use this; you have to depend solely on online forums all over the internet.  The software is confusing, and I'm fairly tech-savvy.  The Zune is just trying to be too many things to too many people and is failing miserably at all of them.  I received it as a gift; I feel bad that I don't like it but it is AWFUL!

<Title>Great Portable Media Player!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my black Zune today and have been very happy with it so far. I did not have an MP3 Player before and the only "portable" devices I used for music & video were my Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC, thus I never bought any music online and did not have to worry about any previous Windows Media DRM protected files not playing on the player.  I do understand why a lot of iPod/Creative/Sandisk/iRiver/Archos owners may want to defend their products by trying to point out flaws in Zune. That's fine, but for someone in the market for an MP3 player for the first time, the Zune is a great product with the hardware (Wi-Fi) to provide extensibility in the future via firmware updates. The menus and song listings are very well organized and easy-to-navigate resembling Windows Media Center Edition.  All in all I've had great experiences with it so far and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for an MP3/Video Player.

<Content>This is a great product. I just love it. I bought mine on the 14th Nov and have been playing with it. I was able to load the software without any problem and the Zune software on the device is really cool. In my opinion its at par with iPod if not better.  The big screen really does make a difference. But small thing like the ability to personalize it with one's own pic is really good. I have a pic on mine which I had taken with my new Nikon D70 and now my Zune screams that it belongs to me. The FM radio is a good bonus.I think it's a really good start and things are only going to get better.  Rohit

<Title>Gets the basics right: excellent sound, easy to use, and fast sync
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love portable music players, (I have a 60Gb video iPod and a Sansa e270), and the Zune is a welcome addition.  Despite all the buzz over its wireless capabilities I find that it nails the basics, and that is the primary reason I am giving it 5 stars:  Screen: Bright, big, and easy on the eyes.  While a touch less sharp and crisp than video on the iPod, I appreciate the larger screen.  Controls: Very easy to use and make sense.  iPod users will want the center button to turn, but once you get used to the fact it's more like the directional pad on a videogame controller, it's just as effective.  Sound: *Excellent* sound.  Rich bass, decent equalizer, and if you want loud, it gets loud.  (Crucial for me so I can hear it over the roar of the subway on my commute)  Menus: Much like windows media player.  Attractive, easy to use and navigate.  A few things seem to take an extra click than expected, but I find the layout and flow intuitive.  Radio: Does the job, and is nice to have.  PC software:  If you've used Urge on WMP 11, then the 'Zune Marketplace' will look very very familiar.  It's easy to use, and I really like that you just start typing in something to search for, and it shows you how many artists, albums, or song names were found that contain what you're looking for, and you can then quickly go through them and find what you wanted.    Synchronization:  FAST!  This is critical for me, since I'm constantly shuttling music off and on my player.  I like having a music subscription service option, and since I am always sampling new CDs and such, having fast sync is necessary.  Wireless: I don't find the option to share songs wirelessly very compelling.  I'm hoping for future enhancements that will let me sync wirelessly, or perhaps even download directly to the Zune and bypass my PC someday (like the Music Gremlin mp3 player).  But, that's not possible for now, so I see this as a feature with lots of potential not realized yet.  Style: About as large as a first generation iPod, but seems lighter.  I really like the grippy rubber fingerprint-resistant feel of it.  Not as stylish, but much more practical.  XBox 360: I have one, and enjoy that I can use my XBox live account with the Zune, and also share music with my Xbox with it.  Capacity:  Would like the option to have more than 30Gb, but 30 is more than enough, since the fast sync makes it easy to swap when needed.  Overall, I'm really happy with the Zune so far.  I think it's going to be my player-of-choice for quite awhile to come.

<Title>The Zune vs the iPod 30gb video
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I want to give major kudos to Microsoft for putting out a very solid, iPod competitor. I purchased a Zune on it's first day out, and I must say that it has some major benefits over the current 5th Generation iPod. Currently, I own both a 30gb iPod Video and the 30gb Zune. I will try and be as unbiased and accurate as possible. This review will focus on  the Zune's strong points vs the Apple 30gb video iPod.  Section 1: External Look and feel  I will be the first to admit that when I first saw a picture of the Zune I thought it still had a ways to go, but the more pictures I saw (and even more once I held saw one in the store) the more I began to love how unique it is. The semi-transparent, rubberish exterior is a joy to hold. I was torn between Brown and Black, but I ended up with Brown because it had a nice vintage, cool feel to it. The Black is very impressive as well. It is very sleek and the blue double-shot makes it look very modern. Sitting next to my Black iPod it looks better, the only thing that I don't like is that the circle cover over the 4 way controls is slightly loose (on mine) and it makes it feel a little cheaper than the iPod. This thing is rugged and durable, though. Something that I never felt about my iPod. When I first purchased my iPod, I immediately put it into a thick case, while with the Zune it feels like it's already to go, whether it be in my pocket, backpack or on the seat of my car. I find it funny that people call it a brick as a derogatory nickname, when it feels very durable (like a brick teehee)  Section 2: Navigation on the Zune  Hands down Zune knocks the iPod out of the park for me. If you have looked around at other players, the Zune uses the Toshiba Gigabeat-style navigation and it's quite seamless. It's brilliant. You use your left and right buttons on the center "wheel" to Navigate through your Artists, Albums, Playlists, Songs, etc. then you vertically scroll to each song, picture or video. It's hard to explain, but it is very quick and easy to use. Once you have a song playing, you press the center button to get a range of easy to select options (5-Star Rating System, Show song list, Shuffle, Repeat, send, and flag). With the iPod you have to pan through these options rather than seeing them all at once. The iPod does not have the quick shuffle and quick repeat options that Zune has readily available on each song you play. The learning curve for using the Zune menus is practically non-existent. Finding songs on the iPod is no less difficult, but these quick options and ease of use are really what sets the Zune apart.  One thing I haven't mentioned is how good it looks while you are navigating your content. The subtle yet very noticeable animations when going between songs are very tasteful. That's not to say that the iPod's menus are not tasteful as well, but the Zune gives you a little more life that makes it better (imho). All in all you will fly through your tunes on the Zune. I found myself listening to 10 seconds of each song just because I liked jumping through the menus. I know, I'm a geek; but hey, they look good! The only thing that I noticed that was bad about the animations is that the Anti-Aliasing (type smoothing) seems to disappear when changing menus. This is barely noticable and isn't a deterrent for me at all. It's just something that I noticed.  Skipping to different parts of Audio and Video is better with the iPod's scroll wheel. The Zune does well though, it seems when holding down the right button (fast forward) it has 4 speeds that it cycles through pending how long you hold it (the longer you hold the faster it goes). With the iPod it's easier to let your thumb pace the speed that you want to navigate.   That's not to say that the Zune's buttons are bad. I prefer the Zune buttons over the iPod's for one reason really. The scroll wheel was just too hard to use while driving. I constantly found myself over scrolling songs. With the Zune, you can easily see that the tack you want is X amount of clicks away. It makes it much easier to keep your eyes on the road.  Section 3: Audio and Video playback  Being a musician and somewhat of an audiophile I can say that the Zune and iPod are on pretty level playing fields when it comes to audio playback. I did a quick switch using the Zune's headphones on both the Zune and my iPod and couldn't notice a difference. I went back and forth at least 10 times on a few songs at and I couldn't tell a difference. The iPod has more EQ presets than the Zune does, but the Zune's cover a decent enough range (not that I wouldn't mind having more).  As for video I'm going to give a little to both competitors. The Zune has bright colors and a very clear screen, but with the pre-loaded videos I saw more grain than I'm used to coming from the iPod. The iPod screen is pretty much perfect besides the size. Videos and photos are crystal clear.  Viewing photos is a more pleasurable experience on the Zune because it seems to be just as clear as the iPod, and the screen is bigger. I'm not sure why viewing video suffers and viewing photos doesn't on the Zune, but with the pre-loaded content that's the way it looks. I still prefer the bigger screen over a small loss in video quality.  Section 4: Zune Features Wi-Fi and FM Radio  I just want to quickly highlight the FM Radio and the Wi-Fi features of the Zune. I'm about an hour away from the Cities and the Zune's Radio reception has been poor so far. It seems pretty inconsistent where I am. Almost to the point of not being able to use it. This was pretty disappointing. The wireless has been so dumbed down that it's practically worthless for me. As of now the Zune doesn't have a big fan base. I'm doing my best to get my friends interested, but as it stands I don't have anyone to share my tunes with. It's disappointing to have a feature with such strong potential and not use it to it's full extent. The Wi-Fi being the thing that's supposed to separate the Zune from the iPod, takes a huge blow right away because of the uphill battle that Microsoft has to fight to get more users.  Section 5: Zune Software and Wrap-up  I'll be brief (for once) the Zune Marketplace is an elegant easy-to-use piece of software. It imported my music seemlessly and is a breeze to find the artists you know and discover ones you don't. I hope their playlists become a little more robust in the future because as of now they are pretty thin. The player handles music and ratings beautifully. It has a pretty straight-forward interface. I do like iTunes way of displaying how much and what type of data you have on your iPod. I haven't seen anything as nice as that in the Zune Marketplace.  In closing, I'll give you one of my main reasons for getting the Zune in four words. All You Can Eat. I am a person who wants to try out as many different artists as I want with no commitment (other than $15/mo of course). With the Zune Pass, I flew through their labyrinth of music files (still 1 million less than iTunes) and found tons of artists to stack my 30gb with. Most people like to own their music and that's well and good, but if Apple had a subscription service, I may not have purchased the Zune.  The Zune is a GREAT player, which I feel is much better than the iPod. If this is your first time buying a mp3 player, get the Zune. It's the hands down winner. More features, bigger screen, beautiful interface, very stable and has a little more personality than the iPod. If you're already an iPod owner and don't need things like wi-fi, fm radio and subscription based music, the Zune probably isn't worth a possibly expensive switch.  I'm lovin' my Zune, though. I've been having so much more fun with it than my iPod, but that's just me. Go over to Target or BestBuy if you can to check it out!  -=Edit=- 11/17/06  Section 6: What the Zune is missing   It has been brought to my attention that I missed a few key points. I am not a 'fanboy' of either Microsoft or Apple. These were mute points for me, but I realize that some people may really want some of these functions. The biggest one is that the iPod can be used as a portable mass storage device while the Zune cannot (currently). With the iPod you just plug it in and you have the ability to create folders. The iPod has a whole extras section that's missing from the Zune. I didn't remember to mention them because I never used them. They are:   1. Clock  I have not found a clock on the Zune. I wouldn't mind having one, I usually go to my cell phone before I go to my mp3 player to check the time.  2. Games The games that come on the iPod are pretty basic, but they beat Zune's wopping 0 games. Personally, I played them about one time.  3. Contacts You have the ability to add contact information ranging from phone numbers to web addresses and home addresses. I didn't use this feature.  4. Calendar The iPod has built in Calendar functionality.  5. Notes This is one that is actually going to be hard to lose. I often would throw directions to new locations right on to my iPod to save me the 'trouble' of printing. It was a nice convenience that you will have to live without. Notes work by dragging text documents to your iPod notes folder. I never had any problems with it. The text rendering is pretty basic.  6. Stop Watch The iPod has a nice little stop watch built in. I never used it, but I'd assume it would be nice for more active people than I.  7. I may have mentioned this, but the Zune Marketplace has about 1 Million less songs than iTunes and currently doesn't have any videos available for download where as iTunes has a plethora of tv shows and movies to choose from. I was always aware of this, but I have no doubt that Microsoft will be expanding it's library pretty fast. They have a lot of catching up to do.  In closing (again?) The Zune is the right player for me because of all of the points that I have mentioned. The iTunes has a lot more of the smaller features that I don't really appreciate as much in a PMP. Most of the extras on the iPod I do on my phone. But the mass storage thing is a pretty huge hit, and even though I haven't sold my iPod yet I already miss my notes. The Zune has some tweaks that definitely could help it out, but it is a joy to use as is. When it comes to listening to music and ease of use, the Zune is the winner imho. I will give the iPod credit for it's larger amount of extra features.   If I could change my rating of the Zune, it would be a 4.  I hope this helped Cheers

The menus are easy and the buttons are right where they should be.  Sound quality is very good. The large screen is large and bright. Movie quality is on par as well.  The only thing I dont like is that the sync is all taged based and does not show up as a drive.

<Title>Zuned Out
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Microsoft is taking on Apple in the multimedia player market. Well, Microsoft is a marketing company. They will sell some units. As this is the first release of Zune, there are bound to be some less-than-favorable problems (features). First, if you own a Mac, forget it!  Zune only works with Windows (and not with Vista pre-release.) Commercial media can only be purchased from the Zune store. (No iTunes support, not even under Windows). A typical song costs 79 points. (Points need to be purchased in advance, in five dollar increments for 400 points.) You can purchase subscriptions, for unlimited music downloads, at a fixed monthly charge. If you typically download more than 15 songs in a month, this option may be appealing. Zune is wireless, which has some interesting potential. You can send a song from your Zune to your friend's Zune. BUT, it will only play three times or for three days, whichever comes first. Battery life is rated 13 to 14 hours (depending if wireless is on or off.) On a full charge, the most I saw was about 9 1/2 hours. Although the screen is larger than that of an iPod, the image quality is not as good as you would hope.  There are a couple of good points... There is a built-in FM receiver. Sound quality is reasonably good. I am waiting to see what the next generation is like. But for now, I'll stick with my Mac and an iPod, thank you.

<Title>Zune is Great!  The Software isn't.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this the day it came out because I got the urge the night before.  I immediately had buyer's remorse.  I knew that I hardly ever used my last two (now defunct) iPods, and figured that this would be no different.  Luckily these fears have been put to rest for the most part.  As far as the reviews on Amazon right now I would venture to say that anyone who gave this thing 1 star hasn't bought it and are one of the many rabid Apple fanboys that would buy a quarter for $5 if Steve Jobs made it.  I would also venture to say that the people who gave the Zune 5 stars are maybe a little overzealous.  Yes I did give it a 5, but thats only because theres no 4.5.  The actual Zune unit itself is outstanding.  Its close to the same size as the iPod, costs the same, and offers way more features.  Looks are in the eye of the beholder but personally I think the iPods are starting to look old, and they really aren't very reliable.  The Zune has personality.  The menus are outstanding compared to the iPod.  There are nice subtle animations and everything moves smoothly, something you can't always say about the iPod.  Plus when you hold the Zune you feel like it can fend for itself in you pocket, whereas the iPod would get scratched if you so much as looked at it (exageration).  The Zune is almost, but not quite perfect.  Now the software that comes with Zune...  Thats a whole other story.  Its probably perfect for the average user who just wants to get songs on their device, but me, I like to know everything thats going on.  The software doesn't allow you to choose the install directory, and the first time it starts up it will import just about every song, and most pictures and videos it can find on you computer into the Library.  Something I didn't want it to do.  I don't know if there is something wrong with my songs, but most of the ones that didnt have album art were assigned the wrong covers.  Overall the Zune software is better than Apple's first attempt at iTunes, but nowhere near where it should be.  I didn't mark the unit down much for this because its something that can, and will be improved over the coming months.  Summary: Hardware: Outstanding, a true competitor to iPod if it catchs on. Software: Has a long way to go before the entire process is perfected.

<Title># 82 Best Selling Electronics
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One week after launch, the Zune is being outsold by all iPods, two Sandisk media players, and a Creative media player - OUCH.  Falling all the way to # 82 on the electronics volume selling list...  Read the reviews before purchasing - major software installation problems.  Not compatible with Vista currently.  You must buy fake Zune points to purchase music.  The monthly subscription option does not include all music - you still must purchase the most popular songs separately.  Microsoft launched the player before it was ready - no podcasting support, the list goes on...

<Title>a real owner of a zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The zune is really hot.  people are trying to say that it doesn't play all formats but if you remmebered the ipod didn't play as much as it do now when it first came out.  If you need an mp3 i would choose this one because i sure that microsoft will release updates that allow more formats and many more goodies to be unlocked on the zune.  The software is a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it is really nice. when i had my ipod, it kept breaking, glitches ran a muck and please don't forget, almost every time you turn on you computer there was an update.  So please don't be ignorant and complain about it lack of software.  Just give it time and it will be one of the best mp3 out.

<Title>It's not what it looks like
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's not supported in Vista.  The Wi-Fi is not useful So far I cannot get the Wi-Fi to do anything.  I can't get it to connect to the internet, that's not supported. I can't play or download songs directly from the Zune via WiFi. I can't sync to my computer with WiFi. Wi-Fi will search for and find other Zunes nearby.  (no one else has one and I doubt they will for a while) If someone else had one I could send songs for a couple of plays.   The screen and such... The screen is nice but video and images look about the same as they do on the iPod.  To me there's no real difference except the sideways video thing that increases the viewable area minimally.  The navigation button thing... It only looks like a click wheel.  It's a funky hard to get used to button thing.  I'm used to the iPod that has always had an easy natural feel.  This is a "clunky" way to navigate compared to the iPod.  The software and music store is unnatural and confusing. why points?  why not just dollar amounts?

<Title>Nice product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was amazed how easy the Zune is to operate. Clicking through files was as easy as operating a PC. You can't do a lot with it other than storage, but that is what the Zune is about. Not crazy about the FM tuner reception. It is great if you want your music, pictures or video to show to family and friends without pulling the old photo album or box out of the basement. The Zune holds tons of material and you can take it anywhere so you don't need a pickup truck to haul all your archived material. You can take it to your friends and family and hook it right up to their TV. Well satisfied.

<Content>I really like the Zune, it has a lot more memory tha the other mp3 players, and you pay the same price that you would pay for the other types. Plus, I was even able to get it in my favorite color, so it's a double bonus for me. It's also cool that you can share music with other Zune owners (even though you can only play it three times). I recommend this product for anyone who listens to a lot of (or different variations of) music. This thing Rocks!!!

<Title>I told my Ipod "Say hello to ebay!"
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Within one week of owning a Zune, my Ipod 30 gig was thrown on ebay. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my Zune, and the features are too great for me to ever want anything else. I did keep my ipod nano (the screen has malfunctioned on its own twice) for jogging, because I wouldn't risk dropping my zune. If you want to be a boring nerd and whine on the internet about screen resolution, and you need an alarm clock and notepad on your Ipod, hey, your a loser and maybe the Ipod is for you. If you want the most for your money and you really couldnt care less about pixels, and just want what looks feels and sounds better....get yourself a Zune. put that ipod on ebay!!

<Title>Zune Purchase
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was very pleased with the recent purchase of the 30g Zune. There were a couple of issues I ran into when downloading: First I found that I loaded 800 or more songs from my cd's and after loaded I deleted some of them to find that when I synced it the songs deleted were removed from my Zune. That was very frustrating. A book with directions and FAQ would have been most beneficial then I would not have had to look all over the internet to find out what the problem was. Overall I do like my zune

<Title>Zune meets the mark!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was a little discouraged about getting a Zune at first, but like so often happens, I found it on Amazon for a price that I couldn't pass up. I went ahead and bought it and when I received it I took a little time to figure it out, but once I got it all program up and running I found that it more than met the mark with what I was looking for. With 30 GB worth of room on it, I've got photo album after photo album on it along with about 3,000 songs and I'm down from 27.7 GB to 24.3 (approx.).   The only thing that I don't like about it is that the battery seems to discharge while its on or off, so I'm constently charging it.  Other than that, I have used it about every day since I've had it and that's been about a month. Great product, get the battery situation worked out and it would be a perfect product!

<Title>Finally the killer has arrived. Look beyond ipods. Why you should avoid Ipod.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have never liked Apple for its over the edge proprietary control over products and services it offers. What is really disturbing is that people are willingly submitting to apples ridiculus controlling methods. For example not allowing your purchased music to transfer back to PC after a reinstallation or in case of getting a new PC.   Having said that, lets take a look at Zune and compare with ipods. First lets talk about features that Ipods lack.  - Wi-Fi. Oh yes, it will probably be on the next generation ipods, but unlike apple fans, we won't go crazy complaining it was copied from Zune.  - Wireless sharing of music. If apple doesn't even allow paid customers to transfer back their purchased music (from ipod) to a new pc or after a reinstallation, do you think they will allow "sharing" of music? dream on.  File Formats : Stubborn apple doesn't support WMA format. Oh man, don't they love to hate Microsoft although Microsoft saved Apple when it was struggling to survive? But why do you want WMA format? It is because nearly ALL the online music vendors except Apple distributes music in WMA format. So when you get an ipod, you are stuck to Itunes, and Itunes only. Zune in addition to playing WMA, MP3, it plays AAC, JPEG,WMV, MPEG-4, H.264 files as well.   Build Quality : Ipods don't even qualify to be compared in this category. Zune is rigid, solidly, very well built gadget. Even without any kind of cases, it is not scratch prone. Ipods need those expensive fancy cases, but even then they are so easily scratched. Zune has round edges with high quality plastic layer to protect the screen.   Display : Zune can be used and navigated in a horizontal or vertical view. Beat that ipod! Oh did I mention Zune has a larger, brighter display than Ipods. Afterall it is no fun watching video in a lilliputian ipod screen.   Navigation : I really loved it. What a slap in the face of Apple fanbase. Now they won't be able to complain Zune stole the navigational wheel as if nobody else on earth has any creativity. It is not a click-wheel like IPods. Navigation is vertical. It is common sense, the shortest distant from one point to another is a line, not a circle. So that means you can navigate faster using a vertical navigation. Zune navigation is fast and works very well than wheel.   I personally prefer something that is of open architechture, that gives consumer more choices, more flexibility. It is true that not many mp3 players have come and gone, but Zune has a good backing. There are of course better digital players than both ipods and Zune, but because many of those companies are small and don't have enough to allocate for advertising, their products remain unknown. I mean you go everywhere, you see ipod ads. That is the sole reason for their success because it lacks in features and substance. So it needs a way of tricking people. Much like they annoyoing PC-vs-Mac guy ads. They say, if you repeat a lie 10 times, it becomes the truth. Apple says ipods are the best, we hordes of sheep say "oh yes allmighty apple, I'm honored to buy an inferior product, I'm happy to be given only one choice, .."   Cowon (iaudio, jetaudio) makes some of the BEST music players. Creative makes great soundcards but its mp3 players have been very disappointing. And finally IRiver is also good choice. Do your research, know what you are getting unless you are one of those blind apple fan who will reject everything non-apple.   It is time to put a stop to Apples manipulation.  WAKE UP people.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On another note, it seems that I got a defective Zune (why would this be the case since it's the first batch of devices?). Anyway, the battery status is very inconsistent and moving up and down. I only played the Zune for 15 minutes and the battery is now half and falling below that margin after a fully charged.   Being very nice to the device, I also turn off the Wireless feature, just to conserve on battery (what a joke that was). And yes! It was fully charged before I started using it.   Contacted Amazon for a refund on this thing.

<Content>I actually really love this thing! Everything works as it should and the screen is the reason I bought this. It's great to watch videos and movies on this. I also have an Ipod, but I am giving that to my wife. Videos and pictures look way better on the Zune, and the navigation is easier to use than the Ipod. Surprisingly, the sound quality out of the Zune is better than my Ipod too.   The software that runs with the Zune is good but it will be great when their music catalog is more up to speed with the number of tracks available in Itunes. The Zune software is not as good as the Zune itself - yet. Sync works great for music, video, and pictures.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never owned an iPod, so since Zune hit the market I'd thought I'd check it out. Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune. The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter. The sound qualty was the same (using the same set of head phones for each). The scrolling was easier on the iPod. The Zune is larger than the iPod, the iPod felt right in my hand. The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods. Now as far as software installation, I don't know. but when I walked out of the store, an iPod came home with me. The iPod software installed quickly, works smoothly with iTunes. I am so glad I compare first! I say get an iPod!

<Title>Why all the hatred?
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What's up with all the animosity?  I can't see why anyone would rate this product a 1 star.  The only thing that comes to mind is the few ignorant Ipod loyalists that haven't really spent the time to figure this out.  I too love my Ipod but I'm also open to new ideas.   For most people, an Ipod is everything they need.  It's in it's 5th generation, it's small, compact, well polished, the software is getting there, and it has tremendous aftermarket support.  But for me, it lacks some features that should've been introduced from Apple a long long time ago.  Apple's market monopoly is holding back and releasing as slow as possible to milk us.  Simple.  Now that Microsoft, with it's deep pockets, introduced their Zune, Apple will have no choice but to get things moving.  That's good for us, the consumer.  So why all the hate?  If you're an Ipod lover, you should be happy that Microsoft got things rolling.  Because, after all the smoke clears, we're the true winners.  In my industry, when I get visitors from competing Japanese firms, they're nothing but inquisitive.  They don't look at my products and stick their noses up in the air and say that they're products are superior.  They want to learn everything about our operation.  Microsoft's been quiet for 5 years.. maybe they've learned a thing or two.  About the Zune.. It's big.  Ofcourse.. it has a protective case already wrapped around it.  All you need is a screen protector.  It has a 44% larger screen.  That I don't really care for too much because a 3" screen is still a 3" screen lol.  Can't wait until Apple or MS brings out a 4.5" or something.  The Zune also has wireless built-in.  And an outstanding digital radio.  I can zoom in on my images too.  And the screen doesn't scratch like my Ipod.   (Why the heck were Ipod's so easily scratched?  Was that Apple's way of negotiating with 3rd party case manufacturers?  That was lame!  Easily the biggest reason I hated my Ipod.  So beautiful yet had to be covered by some ugly cover)   Screen resolution..  Have you ever seen a Sony PSP with it's beautifully large 4.3" widescreen?  It's got a software limited 368x208.  The Zune has a 320x240 resolution in a standard 4:3 ratio.  If you discount the extra horizontal resolution the PSP has due to it's wider screen, the Zune is sharper!  Click wheel.. Ipod's click wheel was neat at first but I got tired of it real fast.  I was never 100% precise with it and would often overshoot my songs.  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  Seriously, why spin your thumbs around in circles when you can easily just hold down a button?  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  I never saw the logic in that.  The button is more precise and less fatiguing.  Hands down.  Firmware.. If you've seen a store model and it's "glitchy," whatever that may mean,  chances are, the Zune was never plugged into a computer and never had it's firmware updated.  If you go to settings>about>zune, you'll see your firmware version number.  As of right now, the current version is 1.1 (322) and released hardware is 2.0.  If you install the CD into your computer, it'll update your firmware for you.  Easy.  I'm not a brand loyalist, I'm a product a fantatic.  And until Ipod can come out with something better, I'm all for the Zune.  But I'm sure Microsoft won't let just stand there and watch.

<Title>like my zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a zune in exchange for my i-river H10 that crapped out on me (only had that for 13 months, very little use).  Used the zune when I went running this morning, it did not skip or quit playing (held it in my hand, don't have a fancy case yet).  It was a bit time-consuming to start up the software, with the upgrade, but all my wma files nicely synced.  I stayed away from ipod mostly because I used windows media player to rip my own cd's to the computer--I don't have any music purchased from the internet.  Yes, it is a bit big, but just last year I was carrying a cd player when I exercised, so this is a lot nicer.  I do have a flash-memory player also, but I can just have so much more music with me with the larger player.  I also like the fm radio, very handy to check the score of a ballgame when out on a run.  I am just an average 40-something who is a bit technology impaired, so I was just thrilled to figure out how to play music without have to search out directions.  (Had a Creative Zen--returned it, never could figure out how to load the thing.)  If people are so happy with their ipods, that's great.  If you already have a player that works so well, then why go spend the money on a new one only to bash it?  I'm not a brand-specific person for any kind of items, but when I find something that works, I tend to stay with it--when will there be a zune-mini???  Thanks for the nice product!

<Title>MS may have got it right this time...
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought one of these babies and I really like it.  They didnt copy that annoyingly touchy thumb wheel from the Ipod and it is considerably easier to navigate through menus.  It came with a free 14 day trial so I have unlimited downloads from their marketplace. I was admittedly apprehensive about their music selection but was pleasantly surprised that they seem to have all 30 or so artists that I enjoy (from White Zombie, Puddle of Mudd to Hoobastank).  I did have to re-download a couple of songs from the marketplace (free unlimited downloads thank god) that would not transfer from Itunes due to Apple's annoying need to utilize their exclusive m4p filetype. Luckly, it had no probem transferring my movies and pictures. I am very happy to ditch Itunes since it doesnt "play nice" with ANY of my other devices and tends to crash my system.  The Zune marketplace seems to work fine and allows me to do things like download a new song and transfer it to my phone's ringtone. The customization of the Zune Marketplace interface needs a little work, but knowing MS they will catch up fast. Yes, I bought the brown one and it is really not a bad color at all. The green tinge looks cool too. I gave my video Ipod to my husband :) Although after seeing my Zune, he's not really that happy about my "gift".

<Title>Zune Great Job!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Just got one and i really  love it. My best friend loved his ipod, but he gave it to his wife after he played with mine. lol. it it's real good. Big and bright screen, I really love the fact that you can put any picture as background, it really look great!. the controls are really well organized, the menu is smooth, really easy to get to everything you need. The radio works good, I like how it give me info of the radio station and it also show you the title and artist of the song currently playing on the radio station, remember when you heard a cool song on the radio and wonder you is it? well now you will know so u can easy get the song later.  One thing I notice after reading some previews here is that a lot of them are misleading. For example, one says Zune doesn't play DivX and Xvid. first anybody that has a ipod knows that ipod does not play DivX and Xvid , even more the only video file that ipod plays is mp4. Zune plays mp4, H.264 and WMV. plus who care if it doen't play Divx , remember that Divx is a old codes, and now days is mp4 is becoming more standar, so Zune is in the right track.  Next, some people says negatives things about the 3 times or 3 days song shearing feature. well remember it's the music industry fault. they are the ones that doesn't want people to share music, The copyright laws are the ones that limit this awsome feature of wireless music shearing , so don't take on the Zune. But pictures are very easy to send from Zune to Zune and those are yours to keep, isn't that great? .so don't let anybody fool you, Apple's Ipod does not even have wireless capabilities, so why people even dare to say something bad about Zune, having something is always better than having nothing.  Also, I read a complaint about the sinc cable saying that u can only use the type that came with the player and not a USB to mini USB one. well ley me tell you that that exactly the same way ipod cable works , u can only the type that came with the ipod.  I'm just saying get info from different places, cause some people say things that Zune lacks but they forget to say that Ipod lacks them too.  and with the Zune marketplace soon the will add video too!!!!!

<Title>What's the point of sharing...
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...if you can only play the songs you get from other people 3 times within 3 days?  That's right, read the fine print before you buy a Zune for it's sharing capabilities.  You can only play shared songs 3 times in 3 days (whichever comes first), and then POOF... no more song, only a link to the buggy and limited Zune Marketplace to buy the track.  Talk about lame!  The only reason I'm not giving the Zune a 1 star rating is because the player itself isn't all that bad... it's bigger and bulkier than a full sized iPod, but the controls work quite nicely.  However, getting the Zune to work on your machine will probably be more difficult than with an iPod.  I've owned two iPods, and I've never had any problems making them sync with any of my computers (Macs and PCs).  Not so with the Zune.  If during the course of using your Zune with your computer you run into no problems, count yourself lucky; I ran into several.  Another downside is that you can't use iTunes with the Zune, and nothing touches iTunes for easy media organization in my opinion.  In Microsoft's defense, this IS a first generation product, and there were bound to be issues.  But the Zune has a long way to go before it's anywhere near competing with the iPod in terms of ease of use (not to mention the thousands upon thousands of accessories that are available for iPods, the ability to play feature films, and podcasting, all of which are not available for Zune).  The only reason I would recommend this player to anyone is if it were significantly cheaper than the iPod... then it would have at least some differentiation.  As of now, however, the overall user experience with the Zune is not even half of what the iPod offers, yet the 30 GB models of the iPod and the Zune are the same price.  So the real question is... why buy a Zune over an iPod?  The answer...  Don't.
