<Title>This player has a few bugs...

<Content>Being a fan of Swiss Army products, I was waiting for the 2GB version of this device to show up at a reasonable price.  When I got it, I really liked the small size and the fact that it supports what people call "USB On The Go" which simply means that your computer will recognize it as a flash drive and you can copy MP3 files to it without any special or proprietary software.  It also has it's own USB connector so you don't even need a cable.  Now for the bad news. There is *no* support for playlists and *no* support for playing based on the folder structure, even though the documentation implies that these things are supported.  To be clear, the documentation states that it supports the ability to create a playlist in, for example, Windows Media Player and then "sync" with the device.  This does work, but you can't access the playlist once the music is on the device, and there's no guarantee the files will play back in the order you specify in the playlist.  This is really a deal-breaker for me since it misses the point of why people create playlists in the first place.  A third (somewhat related) flaw is that, when you try to play by "CD" (i.e., the ID3 "Album" tag), it messes up the sorting and plays things in the wrong order, even though I'm fanatical about making sure my file name ordering and ID3 "Track" tags are 100% right.  I'm going to try to contact the Swiss Army people and see if they will accept suggestions for firmware fixes but if I don't get a quick response this thing is going back.

<Title>False advertising in the product description...

<Content>The second paragraph under product description:  ::The silver-metal Swiss Army Knife housing that stores the audio player offers a knife blade, a combination nail file and screw driver, a scissors, a retractable ballpoint pen, a LED mini light, and a key ring.::    The file doesnt have a screwdriver tip, there is no ballpoint pen, and no LED mini light.  And no key ring.    It's still a really cool product, but I REALLY don't like being lied to, particularly about something so expensive.  An LED light , screwdriver, and pen were all features I really wanted and contributed to my buying the product.
