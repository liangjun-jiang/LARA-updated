<Title>iPod Nano (2nd Generation) - the best MP3 player I've used!

<Content>My wife gave the iPod Nano 8GB as a gift to me and this is the best MP3 player I've had and used. Firstly, the iTunes interface is simple and intuitive. The iPod interface is also simple and intuitive. Once I got all the tags properly defined, the iPod works like a gem! One of the best features that are not in most MP3 players is the gapless play. I love the gapless play feature! Now, I can listen to live albums without the slight pause in between each track. Together with a whopping 8GB, I can store loads of songs!  Just on the down side... the iTunes does not come in the package, and you would need to get on the internet to download it. If you do not have broadband or a fast internet link, find someone who does and go to that person's place to download iTunes, it is about 37MB for version 7.  Also, they do not have an equalizer where you can define your own settings. All the EQ settings are preset.     
<Overall>5
