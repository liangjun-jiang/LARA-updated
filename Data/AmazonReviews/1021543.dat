<Title>Better than I expected
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did my research before purchasing this item... looking for something within a hundred bucks(preferably) and something that had great reviews.  I narrowed it down to a few MP3's, and both my daughters prefered the zen nano plus 512.  It arrived quickly, and its been a week since they received it and they LOVE it! The sound is great, to get songs in there is easy and fast, and functions are simple. I fully recommend this to anyone shopping for an affordable mini MP3 player.

<Title>XM recordable units beware XM Lovers rejoice
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my 2nd Creative Nano which I upgraded due to space issues and wanted to record Opie and Anthony every day as MP3 files.  I had been recording to my Archos Portable player, however it records as a wav file and then I had to take time to convert the files to MP3.  Now I just plug the Nano to the back of the XM out and his record, dump the files to my hard drive and have them to email, and record to CDR to listen to in the car.  I can record over 12 hours in 96kb format which is excellent for talk radio.  I have recorded songs in the highest format, however satillite is clear but transmission is not "CD quality", but if that does not bother you then just record hours of XM/Sirius and drop it to your hard drive as well.  Also realize that when you record on a portable unit, you cannot drag the files to your computer due to copy write law.  Zen Nano will allow you the freedom to share your recorded items.   The downside to recording XM shows is that there is no timer and of course you would have to leave this plugged into a cradled XM unit..if there was then there would be no reason to purchase a XM2Go.  I have to leave the MP3 player recording and filter through my MP3 files after I drag and drop and then rename or edit them.  In general this unit is fantastic, small, cute, battery life is great and you can change out rechargables as your leisure instead of worrying about proprietarty batteries.  The menu knob is small if you have fat fingers.  FM radio sucks in general, but I used this when I was in Puerto Rico and did not want to listen to my files and found some great music.  The sports band is awesome if you want to work out.  The only negative is that if you are listening to a song and then go into another music folder to see what is in there, it will automatically play what you are looking at.  What can you expect - Cheaper and more usable functions than a Nano, and if you want to record satallite radio without spending on a portable recordable unit...then this is your best bet.

<Title>Great!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item a few months ago and it works great! The AAA batteries last a long time. Adding songs is so easy, you can synch songs onto it via Windows Media Player, you don't even need to use the software. In terms of making a playlist, all you have to do is title your songs with the number you want them to be. For example if your song is "mysong.mp3" all you have to do is title it "01mysong.mp3" and the next "02myothersong.mp3" and they will be in that order on the mp3player. If you want to put another song in between just title it "015myotherothersong.mp3" and no problem it works. I also recommend converting your files you want to add into .wma format. You can decrease the file size significantly and over normal decent headphones the audio quality is not noticably different at all. This way you don't even need a 1GB, I got a 512 and it fits tons, I haven't even filled it up yet. I really recommend this player!

<Title>Much better than Ipod
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an Ipod shuffle but it went dead within a week. The 512MB Zen plus is a great product. I haven't messed around with the mic recorder yet, but the zen plus has lots of good features.   The Zen plus is Windows 10 capable, and I use it to transfer songs to the player. The Zen Nano plus is a durable player with lots of features and a reasonable pricetag.  Only downside is that's it's made in China, but then again, what isn't these days.

<Title>Thanks, Hershon2004!!
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If it wasn't for reading Hershon2004's review on this really cool MP3 Player, I wouldn't have been totally convinced to buy it! I also went as far as to buy a pair of Koss headphones and Hershon's right --- the sound is INCREDIBLE! (I don't like those earplug things that came with the Creative Nano Plus). Unfortunately, I DID have to install the CD that came with it because for some reason, the music wouldn't download properly (unless I was doing something wrong).  Anyway, I DID eventually download all the music that I have stored on my computer into the Nano Plus and once I figured out how to use the Scroller, I was in HEAVEN! The sound coming from the Koss headphones was AMAZING! I was hearing instruments from certain songs that I'd never heard before and I LOVED it! The fact that this MP3 Player is SO light, and SO small that it fits ANYWHERE is amazing! I don't even think I need to use the armband that came with it because I could just slip it in my pocket when I'm working out (which is the ORIGINAL reason why I bought it, in the first place)! This is my first MP3 Player so I can't compare it to anything else (which is the reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5). All I know is I'm in love with the Creative Zen Nano Plus and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to fork out the funds for an Apple MP3 Player. This suits my needs perfectly!  Thanks, once again, Hershon2004!!!

My only criticism, the controls are packed with too much functions.....oh well, I can live with that....nice toy!

<Title>Customer support ate my player
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I paid $99 for this player but it worked for less than five months. Then suddenly stopped registering that there were any recorded tracks. FM radio still worked fine -- until customer support instructed me to install updated firmware. Then it became completely nonfunctional and the computer won't even recognize that a player is attached. Customer service takes no responsibility so I'm left with nothing for my money. I should have returned it early on when I called customer support with a set-up question and they claimed that the device doesn't support downloaded radio shows (something it did easily once I figured it out, until it completely stopped working). Don't buy this product and if you have one don't trust anything customer service has to say.

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is great because it interfaces easily with my computer; the large storage capacity is just what I need. This unit has a lot of features, but I especially like the recorder and the USB flash drive option. The recorder is handy for recording quick notes on the fly, and the recorder function works very well. The player uses a separate cable to interface with computer, and that works out very well for people, like me, who have rear mounted USB ports on their computers. The sound quality is great and makes it sound like I'm at a concert. The ear buds are too large to stay in my ears, so I use other headphones instead. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it to all. :)

<Title>Excellent little unit.
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this player for nearly and month now and truly LOVE this unit. It's physically very small (in many ways it's smaller than the iPod Nano!) and the sound quality is quite good even with the headphones Creative provides with the unit. The inclusion of a built-in display is very useful, especially when you configure the internal features of the unit. Because it is a device that works under Microsoft's "Play for Sure" specifications, you can also play back DRM-protected .WMA files downloaded from many commercial music web sites such as the ones offered by Wal-Mart and Yahoo! Music.  I would recommend a couple of things though--consider getting rechargeable AAA batteries since the unit does use up AAA batteries fairly quickly and also for maximum sound quality, get a good "in ear" earbud headphone such as the Panasonic RP-HJE50 available on Amazon.

<Content>My wife wanted a simple mp3 player that she could work out with, and she's very happy with this.  The included arm band and protective sleeve are perfect for her when she's jogging or on a treadmill, and the sleeve has a belt clip that's nice for when she's using weights and does not want something around her arm.  The only complaint is that the included earbuds tend to fall out when she jogs.

<Title>It's OK
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound quality is ok for my purposes.  I just use the player for listening to podcasts while exercising, so audio quality isn't a huge concern and I can't really comment on it.  Main complaint is that the power/pause/play button is perfectly positioned to be accidentally pushed when you are squeezing the belt clip to attach or remove the device.  Also, the display light is very dim, and navigation is somewhat difficult.  FM radio reception is very weak, but that's probably to be expected given the lack of antenna surface area.

<Title>Very convenient, multi-talented MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actually have never owned an MP3 player until now, so I don't have much to compare the Creative with. But I can tell you it's great to have a small tool that can do so many things. The radio reception is fuzzy at times and the battery life is pretty bad with the wrong batteries, but overall it has a great set up with helpful file folders to organize, great recording capabilities, plug and play option if you don't want to install the CD on every computer you use it on, and so many ways to connect it to your computer and other hardware.  If you're not looking to break the bank purchasing a quality MP3 player then forget about iPod and go with Creative. (BTW: My player was red not black, but I'm sure the black one's just as high quality)

<Title>Not great
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.  After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it.

I tried to find an answer on Creatives website but I couldnt get an answer and I couldnt email the company. While my other MP3 player works just fine, this player I bought sucks. A waste of money.

<Title>I can't think of anything not to like...
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ahem. I already had the 5GB Creative Zen Micro, but wanted a flash-memory-based player as well (for working out). I also wanted something that could play audible dot com audio books (which the Zen Micro, otherwise very good, cannot do). On top of that, I wanted something that could record directly from the line-out or headphone jack of any audio source (I can't always get audio material within the vicinity of my computer. It is surprising how many things there are to re-record).  The Creative Zen Nano Plus can do all that. It is pretty and small and has a nice screen (hey, actual feedback! Take note, Shuffle-users). The controls work very well, everything is laid out intelligently and the icons on the screen are supported by word-descriptions.  This little gizmo will even divide audio material into tracks for me. Seems to work pretty well with only the slightest fade at the beginning of the tracks.   When you consider that it will run forever (well, the better part of a day) on one tiny AAA battery...what more could you ask for? I love mine and would buy another in a heartbeat. It is simply the most perfect device for its purpose that I have ever purchased. Even better than my 6-cylinder Toyota pick-up (another fine, smooth-running machine).  I bought the 512MB version, in white. Go get yours now! :-)

<Title>Great But Get Koss PortaPro Headphones with it!
<Date>Mon Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this solely to use for jogging & working out & it kicks butt! It's great. Excellent sound. Superlight & small. Fast downloads. Easy & Effective software. One total bit of advice, as in most of these players, the company gives you free earbuds which suck- they're uncomfortable, don't stay in, etc. I personally hate earbuds. I would totally recommend you purchase for around $40-50 or so online including shipping, Koss's great portapro headphones. These headphones are superlight, give very good sound with good but not overbearing bass response & are supercomfortable & stay on your ears without slipping when you're jogging & working out & best as I said, they're supercomfortable & you don't even know you're wearing them! Anyway, Zen Nano Plus is a winner. It is also very durable. I dropped mine a couple of times & it did no damage & still plays & looks great.

<Title>...Don't Need 1,000 Songs in Your Pocket?
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...That is, if you don't need to carry your entire music library in your pocket and you want a MP3 player that is small enough to take everywhere with you, this one is for you. The Zen is small enough to fit comfortably into even the smallest of pockets, but when in your hands it does not feel cheaply made or breakable. The Zen has a good weight to it for its size and the screen is  readable. When in normal play mode the screen can convey quite a bit of information: The title, how long the current song has been playing, the play mode you're in, and the current battery charge you have.  The Zen also sounds very good with any pair of decent headphones. (I did not try out the supplied "ear bud" style headphones in the box.) The volume can be adjusted to 40 different levels with the two buttons on the side, so you can pick your comfort level easily.  The menu system for this player is well done for a player with a screen of this size. You can select from several different play modes, lock the player (so buttons aren't pressed in your pocket,) and it even has an equalizer with several settings (you can add your own custom settings, too.) The controls become intuitive after only a few days use.  Overall I am pleased with this player, one of those "I would recommend this to friends" sort of things. If you don't need to (or don't want to) carry your entire music library around this player is excellent.

<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mainly to record lectures, and tried it this morning in a medium sized lecture hall. Stadium seating, projector screens, AC running. etc. My usual seat is 1/2way up the seats, and this recorder did pretty well. It picked up the professor's voice, although it's somewhat faint, but also the AC running and all the page turning. I could aways move closer.  Nevertheless, its recording is clear and crisp when you are in a quiet room.  Not being a sound system freak, anything I say there should be taken with a grain of salt.  All my mp3s sounded great. FM receiver is darned good and clear. I even like the headphones.  The only issue is this:  the menu and menu selection is goverend by a little scrolling wheel on the side that move a quarter turn in either direction for menu selection, mp3 skipping, radio station changing, etc. I'm not used to it yet, and worry that I hold it too hard/long in either direction. If anything breaks, I suspect this will be the first.  Still, I love this thing and am happy I purchased it.

<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am (or was) an MP3 player "virgin" and was only vaguely familiar with the ipod.  I wanted a player with FM radio, so after some research, I got the Zen Nano Plus.  I was suprised at how tiny it is!  It's a little bit bigger than a lighter; it fits easily into a pocket or you can wear it on the armband that comes with it.  It's pretty intuitive to use, though someone with large hands might have trouble with the tiny buttons and the scroll wheel.  I also thought the included ear buds were fine, in spite of another reviewer who said higher quality ones were a necessity.  Sound quality and FM reception is excellent.  The software that comes with it, the Zen Nano Plus Media Explorer, is pretty useless.  It's very confusing to use, with multiple panes you can close and open, and did not reliably transfer my downloaded music to my player, even though it showed the transfer happening.  The song title would appear in my player, but no music.  I finally figured out how to use the "synch" function on Windows Media Player 10 and in addition to being very easy to figure out, it worked perfectly.  Media Player can do everything that the Nano Explorer and Nano Organizer software can do, so I don't recommend bothering to install it.  Overall - a great MP3 little player and easy to get up and running.
