<Title>Big Bang for the Buck
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered the Creative Zen V 2GB MP3 player after reading favorable reviews in Wired and on CNET. They were right! This is an awsesome little player for the low $. Easy to upload, menu is easy to use and makes sense, long battery life. Omly complaint is that, like iPod, recharges via USB so may have problems later with integrated rechargable battery pack. With the Creative Labs stellar reputation and the low price of this player, you can't go wrong if you're looking for a dependable entry level MP3 player for just music.

<Content>Even though I ordered this device only on the 19th of Dec. it was ready to go with the other gifts to the in-laws 4 days later (during the height of x-mas shopping season). Not only am I pleasantly surprised with the player...who needs an I-Pod...I found the speed of shipping and service by the company outstanding!

<Title>A great deal for a kids mp3 player.
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my daughter who is 13. I did not want to spend the bucks for an ipod because she got a really nice kodak digital camera for her birthday and it was broken within 3 weeks. She was surprised and a little disappointed how small it is since all of her friends have ipods. She has gotten used to it now and finds it very convenient. I paid half the price of an ipod for this and got twice the memory size. I bought it for the price and extras, recording feature and being able to hold pictures. Surprisingly she doesn't use these features much. The only disadvantage is having to charge it on your computer unless you spring for the extra accessorty wall charger. Another reason I bought this brand is my son has a creative labs mp3 player (an older one with alot more memory) so I thought they could use the same software and he would be familiar with the format, etc.

<Title>Good but...
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is good in a lot of ways. Small, lightweight, and joystick feature is easy to use. But it can be defective in a lot of ways too. In order to unfreeze the player, you have to find a small pin to fit in the tiny hole on the side. If you have no access to one at the time, it stays locked and then the battery could die completely. And I dont see an access point to even get to the battery.  Sometimes the inside of the product with turn defective after a while. My boyfriend's Creative that I gotten him, the USB part couldn't find the USB cable connected to it, even though its been working fine for a month.  My Creative product had a defect in the earphones after almost a year of using it. So I wouldnt recommend this product or many Creative products to my friends and family anymore.

<Title>Avoid the freeze up 
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product replaces a 5 gig Creative Micro which had a hard drive and broke at 1 year after a minor drop.  The Zen V is easier to download.  The 2 gig space allows me to hold up to 5 audiobooks and some music.  The battery is lasting about 10 hours. Sound quality is better than the Micro I appreciate former comments about the unit will not lose its place if the unit is shut down while playing rather than hitting the pause/stop button, which will start at the beginning of the book or song.   I had a few encounters with the unit freezing up.  I can control the frequency  of freezes by allowing the unit to "think" after I touched a button or control.  It's a little slow to respond to the commands.  If I'm pressing a button more than once or hitting the back button command to get into the system controls, I wait until the unit gets to the window that I want before telling the unit what to do. No freezing!

<Title>Product Has Bugs, Customer Service Won't Help!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  Today, March 6th, I am returning it and this is why:  The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.    All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.    So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.    I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.   By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.    Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.  I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.  Jeff

<Title>Great player
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just love Creative products. I have both Zen Vision M and Zen V. The Zen V 2G batteries last all day, the size is small and confortable, you can hang it around your neck all day long and totally forget you have it there. Sound quality is good, the screen is ok, and in general it's a great product. The only not so great thing is the program it comes with (Zen Cast Organizer), sometimes it doesnt's seem to get along with my PC, although I'm not completely sure it is the program. It's not bad though. Buy it with your eyes closed!

PLEASE DON'T BOTHER TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, BUY A SANSA E200 IT MUCH SIMPLER AND EASY TO USE! I end up returning the product back to Amazon because it was obviously very defective!!!

<Title>Amazing product!!!!!
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've seen a number of negative reviews for this product, however I think their problem was with their particular player not the model itself. I've had my Creative Zen V for about a month now and I take it everywhere I go. It works beautifully! The sound quality is amazing and it's so easy to use! My only wish is that the price had gone down before I got it as it's now $20 cheaper.  When I first got it it took me a bit to figure out how to manage the playlists and such but all worked out. I did have one scare when it froze the second day of use. Another reviewer sited the same problem, frozen with no sound. I don't know what they're talking about "waiting 3 days for the battery to die" though. With the player stuck on it only took a number of hours for it to die. Once I recharged it it worked perfectly and I haven't had a problem since. I use it every day walking to and from classes (I'm a college student).  my final comment is this: For the price it's currently at ($79.99) it's a STEAL. It works like a dream, the sound quality is beautiful and it's simple to operate. I certainly recommend this product for anyone. I went from an Ipod (which never worked) to the Creative Zen V and it's like a breath of fresh air.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I was looking for a MP3 I read a lot of reviews and none of the products had flawless records. Despite some reported problems on the Zen that freezes when being disconnected from a PC(USB connector), I bought one and I am super happy with it.  I have not had a single problem, the sound is great, the size is perfect and it works perfectly with my PC. I did not buy an iPod because I did not like the complexity and restrictions to what source you can download music from and I have no regrets. Installation on my PC was easy and it works perfectly with Media Player. Too easy!! It comes with a little protection bag and that's great to protect your Zen when you throw it in your backpack with the rest of your stuff.  All in all and when comparing with my friends' iPods, I am so glad I bought the Zen. It is cheaper, works great, easier to download music with and maintenance free (my friends buy protective sheets to prevent scratches on their iPod).  Definetely a "BUY"

<Content>The player had all the requirements I wanted in an MP3 player, however the features that I was most interested in did not work or did not work properly, Could not make the unit recognize MS outlook even after contacting creative support for help, The book mark for use with Audio books did not stop the player at the spot where I left off and when turning it back on again could not find the spot I previously stopped at. I loved the size, the screen the way it handled,However after trying TWO of the Creative Zen players and neither one worked for me properly I returned them both and baught an Apple iPod Mini.

<Content>I like the features that it has but the ear pieces fall out easily. I like that it has a strap that I can wear around my neck. The toggle style button is ok to use but hard for people with larger hands to manipulate. It has good sound, and I could use it to download mp3 s from other sites to download on the player.

<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was planning on getting an ipod, but I'm glad I didn't.  So many people told me how unsatisfied they have been with their ipods, I just didn't want the hassle of itunes and sending in the whole device for a new battery.  When I first got this in the mail, I was struck by how small it really is; I was expecting a slightly bulkier build.  In reality, it's about the size of a TicTac container.  I was also planning on buying an extra case with a lanyard, but I'm glad that I didn't because the one that comes in the box is perfect for it; there's really no need to buy anything else for this except maybe a skin, which I have on order.  This was my first mp3 player, and I was a little leary because I am technologically retarded but the directions were simple enough to follow.    I was going to get the 8GB, but the price on this one was more to my liking.  However, I was able to add all the songs I wanted and even a couple of audiobooks (several hours worth), which came free with the software - and there's still free space on the thing.  I think 2GB is more than enough space for everything one could possibly want on a long flight, but that's just me.

<Title>LOVE MY Zen ! !
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First I want to thank the reviewers that reviewed their MP3 players.  The reviews I read helped me land a reliable, cute product.  I chose the creative-Zen to be my firt MP3 player b/c I just wanted something that stores music. Thats it.  The creative-Zen does just that plus it stores pictures and is a voice recorder.    CONS: A couple of minutes after a playlist/album ends the MP3 player automatically shuts off to concerve battery energy. Its alittle annoying restarting it after every playlist.  I like the small compact size but my boyfreind thinks the controls are too small for his fingers  The local time and date does not automatically download to the player when I plug it up to my computer. I can't figure out how to update it. (that just might be user stupidity ):   Pro/Con: Every two days I need to recharge the battery.

<Content>This is my second Zen V. Returned the first one because it worked for a month and then kept freezing up on one song. Would NOT reboot despite pushing the tiny reboot/restart button on the side. Exchanged for a new player and within three days it is doint the same thing! I'm going to get another brand. My husband has a Zen Jukebox and has had no problem for years. This is a great size with great features, but that does you no good if the software doesn't work!
