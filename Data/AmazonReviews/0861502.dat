<Title>huge mistake
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Do not buy this. The 40gb hard drive and the "features" mask the true quality of this product. The firmware is terrible. Folder and filenames only show the first 5 characters, making it hard to find anything. The pause/play button does not always work when listening to music. Folder and file navigation is way too slow. The volume on this thing is extremely weak. Video conversion software that is included does not work (winXP & WME9). Seems to me that the manufacturer tried to make it as cheap and as quickly as possible. It's a good idea, it's just that they should have spent more time tweaking it. If you have the money for one of these things, save another $100 and buy a video iPOD.  P.S. - Anyone know if the PVR firmware is linux based?

<Title>Mustek WHO:(???????????
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know what I was thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!:). ZERO RATING First- You only get 2 hours on a full charge Second-Customer Services is the WORST Third-It's heavy Fourth-When watching a video there's a gap between the actors speaking and what you see.  Think of the old school Karate movies. Fifth-The ac piece on the machine broke after one year Six-If you watch a movie and needed to stop in the middle, forget about it, it won't hold your spot so you go back to the beginning of the show:( Seven-It doesn't show the names of your songs-more than 5 spaces and once a song in there you can't move it. Eight-the kickstand broke because it made of plastic and too weak.

<Title>some what pleased
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really liked the product stands for, but there were problems that I guess are internal problems with the machine.  I have purchased this device several times and each time there was a different problem with the machine.  After I loaded about 35 movies on the device, it wouldn't cut on.  Once the machine wouldn't cut off, so I had to reset the devise, which I lost all of my movies.  I think if there were more products like this, it could really be a good device, because it was good for travel and you don't have to take a portable DVD player and movies with you.  I really like the devise, it just had too many problems for me.  I would love to have another one, but I have purchased too many and returned too many, so I don't want to keep getting the devise, only to have to return it and keep paying for shipping fees for manufacture problems.

<Title>Interesting toy to play with
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have tried a little of almost everything with this device.  I have played MP3 music; recorded shows and movies from Satellite, VCR, DVD, and other sources; played those recordings on a PC; and stored photos and computer data as if it was an external hard drive.  Everything has worked so far.  On the downside, the earphones created instant static (so I substituted them with a set that I have used with a standalone MP3 player), the device is on the thick side, and the external speakers volume does not turn up high enough to listen to (you need to plug external speakers on the headset output to listen to the music or videos if you do not use a headset).  I like the relatively large screen and it almost offsets the negativity due to the thickness of this device.  You can just plug in this device to a PC and play video and/or music etc by double clicking on the file stored on this PVR   It has been easy to use and fun to play with so far for the first couple of months.

<Title>Don't waste your $
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm sorry for those who wish to sell their used unit, but I'm also a user of this product, or should I say USE TO BE.  For those who are interested in purchasing....buy something usefull.  Once the battery fails, it's useless.  You can't replace it.  The only way is to send the entire unit back to Mustek and you're at their mercy as to the price for the battery and shipping costs.  Do you really want to frustrate yourself???????  The only good thing about the unit is the fair video quality.  The sound is tinney, low volume (even on high).  Even though there's no speaker (connect earphones), the San Disk Sansa is the best bang for the buck!

<Title>Great for recording and editing on PC
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really have a single use for this little beauty: my digital DVD/Hard Drive unit will NOT record my premium cable channels. My cable provider (or the channels, themselves) clearly sends some sort of proprietary signal that disables recording of STARZ, HBO, CinemMax, etc. Yes, I could record to plain VCR (yes, I still have one) and I am sure there are more elegant solutions *but* I wanted to generate DVDs and NOT more VHS tapes. SO, solution: the Mustek. It records ANYTHING that comes across your TV. If you hit your TV's MENU button while you are recording to the Mustek, it will record that. It runs off you TV - not the cable; anything and everything. I have also managed to convert some of my 6 hour VHS tape archives to digital video using this method.  Now, its a simpler - if not a perfect - system. I record video (in HQ mode) to my Mustek, USB the file(s) to my PC, and burn them to DVD on my PC's drive. The quality is excellent, at least for my eyes and preferences. I am quite sure the inventors at Mustek wanted their gem used in such a simple system but it certainly does what I expected and needed.  And, though I seldom use them, the other functions (playing and viewing the video or JPEG photos from the Mustek LED, MP3 player, and even storing backup PC files to the hard drive or external - optional - SD card) are quite acceptable as well. For my purposes, as outlined previously, this has been a very useful and cost-effective device. Construction quality is GOOD, the LED screen is quite bright enough and the PC interface is seamless.

<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is not worth a penny.Terible battery life, terrible audio quality, and even worse workmanship. The buttons on mine dissapeared inside the unit and have been waiting for 2 months now for Mustek to fix this under warranty. I give this minus 500 stars. Do not waste your money. 1 star is way to good for this.

<Title>So far so good.
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a college professor and was looking for a portable media center to transsport a semesters work of class files and to have a device that could record programs/documentaries,news that may be pertinent to class discussions.  I narrowed my search did extensive research on the Mustek PVR-H140, The RCA Lyra model, and the Archos AV400 series.  I compared tech specs and read other reader reviews, but realistically my purchase came down to price in the end being that all models recieved good to excellent average ratings/reviews.  I purchased the PVR-H140 for $210 from the Home Shopping Newtork website after holiday discounts, a coupon code and a $20 rebate from Mustek. It came down between the Mustek and the RCA since Sears had it on special for $199.  The determining factor which really steered me from the RCA was that Sears was out of stock would not honor the sale price even though the product was miraculously back in stock the day after the sale ended.  Something fishy there and has soured my view of the store.  Between the Mustek and RCA, they both had comparable capabilities that made those a wash on paper.  I did like that the RCA had a narrower profile, but the aspect that would have pulled me towardes the Mustek is that it had double the capcity (40gb compared to 20gb) and accepted SD cards, which my current digital camera also uses. My only real problem with the device is the poor mp3 interface.  Complicating this and possible other future issues is that Mustek, after my inquiry, informed me that there will be no future software upgrades for the device...this was made perfectly clear.  RCA and Archos do upgrade thier device software; I thought this was standard, but evidentially not. If price was not an issue for me, I probably would have gone for the Archos especially since they offer a new 80gb model in the AV400 series.  Needless to say, the Archos is much more costly, even without the discounts I received.  Another small issue was the carrying case provided as an accessory; it is just a cheap velvety pouch with a drawstring...no protection at all. Overall, this device has performed very well in this first month and there are no indications of any problems with the device.  It seems of sturdy construction, so I wonder what the earlier reviewer who complained about the buttons was talking about.  Of course this is not the best personal media device in the world, but a great little device for the money paid.  I only wish Mustek would show more dedication to this product by issuing software upgrades to improve its capabilities (eg. the ability to read pdf files and a better mp3 interface).  Maybe if enough owners/customers made this suggestion, they would see the value...I have already done this.

<Title>A great addition to my growing gadget collection!
<Date>Thu Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Originally, I purchased the same unit elsewhere as I had heard that it would be a great companion piece for a digital camera.  I really didn't want to store my photos on my desktop as it wasn't portable.  Shortly after receiving my unit, I immediately recorded a tv show..just to play around with the recording function.  I am now hooked!  The unit has now become a companion piece not only to my digital camera, but to my Tivo as well!  Everything works flawlessly and I am very pleased.The unit that I purchased here is a gift for my Mom who will benefit from the recording function.  It's a great time shifter for television and movie viewing!

<Title>One HUGE Roadblock
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good player, really it is, it does everything it says but theres cons to it.  CONS: *There's a siginifcant break in between songs *If youre watching a video you cant go to the next video without going back to the main menu *Fastforwarding and Rewinding sucks *The sound dosent go very high, with and without headphones *Battery life is only about 2 and a half hours when watching video and listening to music with the screen on *and one HUGE road block, you cant just drag and drop videos they need to be in ASF format, most video converters dont do asf and the converter Mustek gives you does not convert big video files, I called them and they confirmed this but they promised to send me a new converter in 10 days.  PROS: *40gigs on something that can fit into your pocket is beautiful *The video quality on it is very good and the screen size is NICE *It's PVR capabilities are amazing, you can even set it to record at a certain time like a vcr.

<Title>Bad quality, worse client service
<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product and after 15 days of use, the item doesnt work anymore. Then I noticed that the warranty only applies in USA and Canada and I live in Mexico. I wrote to support and customer service in order to repair it, even if I had to pay for that, and I never received any answer.So I just put my money in the trash when purchasing this product. If you dont live in USA or Canada I strongly recommend you NOT to waste your money and time.

<Title>Mustek PVR-H140 review
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you love movie's and your a big Survivor fan like me you will love this product. I've recorded (8) full seasons of survivor and (12) movies and still have room for more. You will need to get an auxzillary 12vdc battery pac like the one's used for camcorders and a car power adapter rated at 2000ma and a setting for +4.5vdc or +5vdc if your going to travel with it because the built in battery will only last about 1.5 hours. If you want to listen to music buy something else because the sound quality for music lovers is not there. It will fit in your pocket and the screen is big enough to enjoy your digital pic's, or movies. Or connect it to your tv.

<Title>Very cool device but watch out for all the undocumented items!
<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have such mixed feeling about this device....  once you get past all the weird behavior, the device is really cool and is fun to use, but the hurdles one goes through to get to this point are many....  When I first received my device, I turned it on, it came up, and I played some of the sample movies and pics.  There is a movie of a Chinese family playing in the backyard and blowing bubbles....  There were also many images of similar people.  I then deleted all the sample images I found - BIG MISTAKE....   Mustek made a poor decision in making all "required" files accessible to the user - and it mixes them with the sample files - bottom line, is that after deleting what I thought were all the "sample files," the main menu was distorted.....like you were looking at a monitor in a resolution it doesn't support.  On top of that, the fonts weren't working, so I could see any of the settings I was trying to change.  Mustek should have put these required files into firmware and not where someone can delete them.  After visiting their Mustek's web site, I see this is something addressed in their FAQs.  It's evidently a common issue and there is no warning at all about watching out for this.  I downloaded the restore file and restored my files...  The next thing that is weird is how slowly the device scrolls between MP3 files....  while you can skip a screen at a time, even this is slow.  The sound quality is OK.....  Due to the slow scrolling, I would be hesitant to carry this everywhere with me.  I would like to be able to do this.  Another thing that bugged me is that on some screens, paths are expressed in 8.3 format only, so you see paths like C:\basica~1\xxxx etc....  it just seems like someone took a shortcut here instead of taking the time to display the path in a long format.  The thing I had the biggest problem with was the video recording....  First of all, the software was slightly different than the manual - very confusing....  and all the manual pictures were so dark you could not see them.  but the biggest thing that drove me nuts was using the timer.  Basically, to record, you have to set a recording quality, start time, and end time....  to help you, the machine sets the start time to the current time, leaving you to set the end time.  What the manual doesn't tell you is that if you accept the current time as the Start time and if you save these settings a minute after the start time, the recording never starts!  I learned the hard way that you have to set the time to 1 or 2 minutes after the current time so that the change to that minute will trigger the time - very aggravating!  Oh yes, how to set the time?!  There is a setup area where you can set everything except the time and date....so weird.....  instead, you have to go through another area in the calendar to set the current time....  the interface is just not consistent and not intuitive....  I really had the feeling that this device had its software made quickly, in a foreign country, without any input from real users.  The device should certainly not place its most important files in a place a person might delete them, especially when there is no warning about this....  Lastly, the belt clip is a joke.....  It attaches in a weird way and its design gives the impression it was an afterthought....  Anyway, once you get past all these idiosyncrasies, the device is pretty cool and being able to record your DVDs into the device and then take them on a trip is very nice....  the device does work well once you understand what areas to remain away from.....  The software really needs to be redesigned by a US company, where users are given input.  Enjoy!

<Content>Excellent storage capability, and easy to use video recording off television with RCA jacks.  However, software for this device is simplistic, and limited.  I don't know if updates are available to make it compatable with Windows XP updates, or the release of Windows Vista. Battery life should be longer given the price of this item.
