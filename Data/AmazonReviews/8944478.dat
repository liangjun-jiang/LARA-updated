<Title>Superior to the ipod in many ways
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, this mp3 player has excellent sound quality, far superior to any ipod i have listened to.  Also, this product's display screen is very large with excellent resolution.  This mp3 player is very thin with a glossy front, and the touch pad controls look very nice.  The looks practicly sell this product by themselves.  It also comes with bluetooth, which i have not used yet My only complaints about this samsung t10 is it's menu style and user interface.  This is were apple has the advantages.  For the menu style, you have three choices on how it is displayed, none of which work very well for me.  I prefer to have my menu in a list format(like on ipods) as opposed to this samsung where you have to flip to a new screen for each selection(music, movies, photos, etc). The control pad arrows on the t10 are nowhere near as good as an ipod's scroll wheel.  Ipod's scroll wheel allows you to move quickly and precisely whereas the t10's arrow keys are slow and sometimes inaccurate.   Those are my only complaints Overall, the samsung t10 beats the apple ipod in audio quality, design, and bluetooth capability.  It looses in UI and menu style.  I reccomend the t10 over the ipod.

<Title>SAMSUNG PLAYERS ARE THE BEST
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Samsung T10, P2, and I just ordered the S5. Samsung's players are by far the best players out there - I can't stop buying them all!  Way better than the IPOD. Apple is just a monopoly. With the Samsung players you can use anything to download music, you are not limited to "just ITunes" like Apple. You can download unlimited songs for $14 a month instead of $1 a song like ITunes. IPODs do not compare.

<Title>T-10 Shuffle Problem
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought our daughter a T10 for Christmas.  Our son got a T9 last year and liked it so we figured the T10 would be even better.  It seems neat, has lots of nice options and sounds good BUT the big problem our daughter is experiencing is with the shuffle function.  It plays the same songs over and over in the same order and does not play all songs.  We have contacted Samsung in search of a solution for the malfunction.  If there is not one we will have to return this product.  Does anyone have an idea how to correct the problem?

<Title>Nice player, great battery life, software lacking
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this player for about 1 month now.  Have only used it for music so far.  Had issue getting one computer to recognize the player while a different computer had no issues.  Level I tech support was not very helpful (wanted the player sent back for repair even though it was a Windows problem), and level II support quite knowledgeable (make sure you have the .net updates installed - they ask you to install all optional Windows updates).  It was nice to actually have a real person answer the tech support phone # with very short wait.  I had wanted to get a Sansa, but could not understand why players purchased in the USA have no Asian language support, but if you buy a Sansa in say Hong Kong then you can buy it with Asian language support.  They also refuse to provide that option through firmware upgrade.  The T10 automatically displayed correctly the song names in my music library that were in Chinese.  Pros:  Great music quality great, and even better battery life (3 day car trip without recharging).  The player is stylish, small, and very lightweight.  Many ways to sync - using included software, Windows Media Player, or drag and drop from Explorer.  Cons:  No easy way to manage playlists.  If you create playlists in the included software, all songs in the playlist are transferred to the same folder.  Say you created 3 folders in the T10 to manage music, and a song happens to be in 2 playlists -> this song would be copied twice to the 2 folders.  Of course, this eats up memory fast.  Why use folders?  Because I like to organize my music, and also to avoid filename conflicts from older CD's which have ripped songs with filenames like 'track 1', etc.  Another feature that would be nice is to be able to play all songs in a genre or master folder, instead of having to drill down to the album and only playing that album.  For a long car trip, I would prefer that the T10 plays multiple albums without need of user intervention.  Miss the feature in iTunes where I could set up sync profiles to sync different set of songs to the iPOD depending on what portion of my library I wanted to take.  Recommendation:  Definitely a good player worth buying.

<Title>Very nice product.

<Content>I just recieved my T10 yesterday (2-6-08) from Amazon and I am really impressed.  I was immediately able to download music from Ruckus (yes, if you have ruckus this player WILL work!!!!) very easily.  Video was a little bit tricky at first, but overall it is just as easy.  I didn't love Samsung's download software, so I elected to use the direct link through Ruckus, which was no big deal to me at all.  All in all, it was very simple, if I can do it, anyone can!  The player itself is very nice and appears to be of high quality.  The screen is incredible, it has the quality of an HDTV only much, much smaller.  I find the touch controls to be very easy to use, inspite of my sausage-like fingers, and the software is intuative and easy to use (I have not had to read any directions yet, woo hoo!).  The USB charging system doesn't bother me at all since I am a student and spend the majority of my time on the computer anyway.    This is my third mp3 player, although the first with video capability, and it leaves my Rio and shuffle in the dust (for about the same price).  I really did not want to lay out $200 plus for a new Nano and I think the T10 is a wonderful alternative.  For me it's an easy 9.5/10.

<Content>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an expert on MP3 players, but I have been very pleased with the Samsung T10 that I purchased, and I have no complaints.  My only suggestion would be to purchase the T10 with more memory....I believe there is at least an 8 GB version.

<Content>I've had this player for a couple of months now.  I have an iPod, but was looking for a player which used flash memory which could withstand a workout at the gym and general bashing around.    I don't like to be wedded to things like MP3 players and was keen to avoid either an iPod or a Zune.  Having to install proprietary software to transfer files is a completely unnecessary intrusion in my view.  With the little Samsung I use drag and drop in Windows Explorer and it does the rest.  I haven't tried the Samsung software so can't comment on it, but for me that's an ideal place to be  (in case you're wondering, for the iPod I use JRiver MediaCenter - iTunes, good though it may be, is a relationship I don't wish to be compelled to have).  Using the T10 is exactly how using an MP3 player should be.  There is one mechanical switch (combined power/lock), the rest of the controls being on a touch sensitive pad.   I was a little bit concerned about the sensitivity of the touch pad, it seeming to be very sensitive causing menu options to be skated through too quickly, however, I have become better used to it and can work it fine - definitely not for the heavy handed though.  The menu options are laid out very well, and getting to where you want to be is a breeze.  The screen is very clear and simply adds to the joy of using the player.  Sound quality?  Understand that this is a $100 player!  That said the sound quality is very good, better than a player at this price should be.  The earphones, however, are a different matter. These things should be consigned to that drawer where you keep paper clips and pens that don't work.  Sure, they'll do in an emergency, but they do not do this player any justice at all.  If you understand this and budget for a decent pair of headphones (I like the little Audio Technica ones) then you will not be disappointed.    One thing to note is that the Samsung uses a proprietary USB connection.  It'd be much better if it used a standard type (oh the irony of every manufacturer using their own 'standard')  I have the teensiest, weensiest complaint about this player.  Mine is piano black and it very easily shows up finger marks, hey but that's what shirts are for - a quick rub and it's back to shiny piano black again.  That aside this player is perfect.  In summary, it's not perfect: the headphones are hardly worth the cost of shipping them; a non-standard USB cable, and a piano black finish which needs to be buffed regularly! These minor grumbles aside this is as close to perfect as you will find today.  A brilliant little player, and well worth 5 stars.
