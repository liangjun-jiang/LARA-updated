<Title>Decent mp3 player for the price
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Though I own a Zen that I use for the majority of my music and some videos, I wanted something more compact that I could easily take with me to school and work, and something that would be less bulky for workouts.  This Sony Flash Player has proven to be a great tool.  It's highly compact, and yet still holds quite a few songs.  It also has pretty good sound quality, though I find the ear buds to be a tad awkward.  The USB plug-in makes it really easy to charge your player and load/unload songs at the same time on your computer.  One minor qualm I have with this product is the software.  It's not very user-friendly.  Furthermore, while I can get the software to work on my HP desktop, I can't get it to work at all on my SONY laptop computer, which I find baffling.    Nonetheless, though I find my Zen to be far superior to this particular player, this one is great for the price, and outstanding if you're looking for something small and relatively easy to use.

<Title>Nice features but may be noisy
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the features, price, even the software worked well for me.  But with my Shur E-3c headphones (super quality) I heard a hiss in the quiet parts of songs.  I got a replacement but it took 90 days!  It sounds great.  Both made no noise at all if they were paused.  Anyways, if the sound quality were perfect on both I'd give it a 5.  I reviewed it as a 3 before I got the replacement.  I'd give it a 4 now, even with the BS long 90 day exchange. (5 star if the first one worked).

<Content>Very good purchase.  Only the Sony software to send music to player is not good. Because if you put a file ".MP3" in pen drive, the music not will be played. Only if you put the file through Sony software.

<Title>Wroked well for a while
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this item In Oct 1, 2006 and it worked great till Jan. 1, 2007. Now it is not recognized by the software when plugged into the USB. The unit charges and the FM still works but I can not load new items. The Sony people did try to help on-line but to no avail.  Perhaps I am to rough on them as I carried it in my pocket while I worked virgoursly outdoors everyday>?

<Title>its liek a gem sony has beaten every thing
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>well its the best mp3 player out there. its looks like a crystal and has superb sounnding crystal clear sound. besides this it also plays gpalessly in shuffle mode.it has a great stamina of 30 hrs of mp3 with equalizer on. it also have a very stero mode fm which is very clear even in pakistna.well sonicstage 4.3 is very easy and stable. and it took me abt 20 mins to put my 1gb of mp3 in it.it has a very powerfull equalizer which is very bassy and also good in highs but the bass is pretty tight even with the included headphones. it can also play aac files and mp3s @ 48 khz sample frequency. well its maate finish is quiet cool. and will not fade like earlier units. and is pretty durable.besides this it is very loud. even at 16 though it goes to 30 but u cant bear it it will definatley make u def  so i recommend to use avls function.besides this it has d normalizer which is used to normalize the recortding differences in songs. it is definatley a crytal mp3 player with sony soundquality. i will say that u simply stop thinking of another mpp3 player for this price bcoz u cant get such a powerfull hifi for $[...] and it has beaten all the odd looking and bulky mp3 player out there besides this it has 3 min chage=3 hrs playback.well i use it to listen the whole day and battery lasts but u must switch to super power save mode to save power. well its simple to turn from fm to music just hit the meun button and then select fm and then from fm selct music or playlist than u can resume ur songs from where u left. its definatley coolest and good looking mp3 playerout there

<Title>This is not an MP3 player
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Read carefully I returned my product shortly after purchase.   + The sound in this machine is pretty good I must admit.  - It is NOT an Mp3 player. I forces you to use a software program produced by less skilled programmers. It flat out refused to work in my computer. Had to resort to "SonicStage alternatives", to load the player.   It's slow - Loading the player is painfully slow. It takes forever. (One of the alternative programs even warned me before transfering a big chunk of music "Warning this may take a lot of time do you still wish to proceed") - Wind/Rewing painfully slow.  - You have to sort everything (every track) yourself, I mean it 2007 now.   If you are a user who frequently change your audiofiles in your MP3 player this product is not for you.   Rumor has it that Sony will release a "unlocked" player which will work as a "normal" MP3 player shortly (no SonicStage necessary). I recommend you wait for that one.

<Title>Don't waste money on this one
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The included software is very hard to use and most stupidly written. I add wma files to the library and convert them to Sony's supported format. Then I delete the wma files from both computer and library from within the software. The software will delete the converted files also from the computer though they are neither in the library nor in wma format. How stupid can Sony get?  The player sometines doesn't recognize some wma files. All files have to be converted to a different format. The player control itself are hard to use. The player's USB port stopped working within 45 days of purchase. Sony support says that my only repair option is to have the player exchanged with a refurbished one even though the player is under full parts and labor warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER.
