<Title>Way too much hassle
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So, I got my archos last week and i've been doodling with it - but get this: Playlists and videos don't work nearly as well as they should. Let's examine this:  1) Playlists. Do you want to be able to auto sync your WMP or media monkey playlists quickly to the archos? Sorry, won't happen, not even with the script someone came up with on archosforums. Even if you have your playlist in m3u, it gets converted to a non-playable wla file that crashes the archos. Fun right?  2) Videos. I use Clone DVD mobile to rip 720x404, 1900 bitrate. The videos work fine on my computer, but cut off 4/5 of the way through on the archos?  Are there ways around this? Well let's see. Like I said, someone created a script on mediamonkey to add playlists. I can't get it to work, but even so, why should you need a consumer-made script to get playlists to work? For videos, it's just finnicky with the encoding you use. Any hope for a firmware update to fix all this? Probably not if archos customer service is as bad as people say.  All in all, this was a waste of 380 as it has been more of a headache than a useful tool. Back to the store it goes. Of course, my alternative is an ipod. I might as well eat my own head.

<Content>I "pre-ordered" my archos wifi in July 30, 2007. Approximate shipment date will be on Sept. 2007. Then they move back to Octber 2007. In Octtober 2007 when I check back "where my stuff" they move to March 2008???. What kind business is this? If you don't have the product, PLEASE postpond your advetisement so people don't waste their time to wait for the product (or at least self-cancel order due to "none in stock")

<Title>Worthy new entry in the Archos lineup
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like many others, I gave up on my Amazon order and got it directly from Archos.  I've been happily playing with it for the last couple days and really quite happy.  To be fair, I am upgrading from the Archos 604 Wifi so I am already pretty well familiar with Archos' little quirks and such.   I also have a brand new iPod Touch which is a great product in its own way. Overall I think this product is worthy of a 5 star rating because it offers the most bang for the buck as it were, amazing features at a moderate price.  As is my wont, I start with the things I love:  1)  160 GB, whats not to love about that?  My brand new laptop has only 80GB, crazy to think that this little handheld PMP has more storage than my laptop or my desktop either for that matter! 2)  Awesome screen resolution: Wow thats a lot of pixels for such a small screen. 3)  Touch screen interface, very sensitive, and quite usable with or without a stylus (unlike the Touch which is not so sensitive).   4)  If you purchase the Video Podcast and Cinema plugins from Archos ($40) you can watch just about any video on this baby without any tedious conversions (unlike the iPods). 5)  Beautiful and colorful user interface, nice improvement on 604.  I especially like being able to see what the next and previous songs on the playlist are, the Now Playing screen is nicely laid out. 6)  Wifi is amazing, you can play videos off of your desktop computer or copy files from other computers.  In fact, I was even able to automatically upgrade the Archos firmware just by connecting to Wifi. 7)  Opera browser ($30 plugin) is very nice browser, works well with touch screen and supports YouTube and some other streaming video interfaces.   8)  Fantastic DVR dock allows you to output to pretty much any kind of cable and watch at nice resolution on the monitor of your choice.  This also includes a great remote control with a Blackberryish keyboard; again this is something I don't see available for iPods. 9)  Dedicated volume button (not available on Touch or 604). 10) You can actually edit, rename, delete, etc music, videos, playlists etc. on the  605 itself, you don't have to hook it up to a PC every time you want to make the slightest change or delete something you don't need anymore.  This is perhaps one of my biggest gripes about iPods in general.   11) Built-in viewing stand, how clever is that? 12) Indicator lights: I like the fact that you can see when the battery is charged, when the hard drive is running, if the TV-Out is on or the power is on without flipping through menus or turning the device on. 13)  Playlist editing/saving etc seems to work a lot better than it did on the 604. Just the fact that you can do this on the unit itself is a nice feature in comparison to iPods! 14)  I can use the drive as a data backup and it doesn't messup my music or cause undue delays like it did on my 604.   Of course, for me anyway, 5 stars doesn't mean perfection because there is no such thing in the world of technology.  5 stars means top of its class in my mind.  So with that disclaimer in hand, here are things about the Archos 605 that could use improvement:  1)  Hidden expense: To really get the full experience you should expect to spend an additional $100 to $150 for plugins and DVR dock etc.  Archos, like Apple, just gives you the bare minimum accessories with the product; not really enough to set you up in style.  To be fair, its the same deal with an iPod Touch!  In fact, apple has taken to charging for their new software features too :O 2)  Accessories:  don't expect to be able to walk into any electronics store and buy accessories for this baby.  I have had to order just about everything online -- btw I highly recommend the Noreve case for this player which can be bought on Amazon. 3)   Size:  with a screen this big and a 160GB disk don't be thinking this is just going to slide unobtrusively into your pocket like a Touch does.  It will fit in your pocket but you'll know its there. 4)  Lack of software aka there ain't no iTunes for this thing!  Making playlists is a bit tricky.  You will have to use something like Winamp or MediaMonkey or the player itself to make playlists.  This doesn't compare well to the air-tight integration of the iPod and iTunes system. 5)  No built-in USB port, you have to use the special cable provided or a dock to connect USB (this is a gripe I have about iPods too)! 6)  Volume is a bit on the quiet side,  I just run all my songs through "mp3gain" and set volume to 95dB and is plenty loud enough for me. Or you can use the battery dock which removes volume limiting restrictions. 7) Battery is not removable like the 604 was, its the price we pay for a slimmer profile I guess.  To be fair, this just makes Archos like Apple but I do miss being able to swap batteries.  Fortunately, you can use the battery dock to good effect or other external battery packs such as ones made by Tekkeon to extend the battery life of the unit.  In summary, this is not the most user-friendly player in the world.  But the features are spectacular and cutting edge.  This is not a player for the faint of heart but it is a very rewarding experience if you are willing to take the time to play with it.  Feature by feature it really blows the iPod Touch away.  If you are aware of the quirks of buying an Archos ahead of time, I guarantee you will be quite happy with this product.   Update after 4 months of ownership: still very happy with this product.  I've removed a few negative points because I feel that they weren't really relevant anymore, I get carried away with negative points sometimes!  I have had zero problems with this (making it more reliable than my Touch!) and it continues to be a great product.  In addition, firmware updates have added widgets and seem to have improved the sound as well as fixing bugs relating to ID tags and such.

<Title>An Ipod for adults
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The device is amazing.  It is not apple and so can be accessed as a hard drive by any windows computer (or linux for the geeks among us) and it will do it all.  Movies, music, pictures, videos, podcasts, record tv and playback to TV or Stereo system and it is simply the best media player currently available. The company misses some points but the are largely promotional and availability points not quality.  I couldn't be more pleased.

<Content>I paid so much money and bought it, but they fail to provide a web browser free. I bet business ethics they learn only when they fail dodge a bullet from a technology wave ( by some unknown company ). Anyway i could use it to listen music and watch video. I am not going to buy the browser and all the plugins.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great product!  Huge hard drive, fast load times, great screen (crisper and brighter than my old Zen vision w). Archos is updating the firmware for this thing often.  Did I mention that the Archos 605 supports A LOT of formats!!!  I have used this product for about a week and love it.    The only complaint I have is that I can not use my playlists in windows media player (the Archos 605 supports m3u playlists).  P.S. I typed this on my Archos 605!

<Title>Great but not an iPod replacement
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a great device but....it's NOT an iPod replacement.  It's too big to carry in your pocket walking around the city.  The bottons are on the side and get pressed easily just rubbing against your leg.  Good thing winter is coming up so you'll have jacket pockets for your 605 so that issue can be avoided sometimes.   Again, for its size, it's too big to bring to the gym too.  This is ideal for plane trips or long commutes on a train.  This is not a pocket device.  As everyone says, the screen is really good.  It has a matte finish so it's not prone to fingerprints.  It seems like it woud be fairly resistant to minor scratches too.  While it can play DVD resolution files, it's limited to files 2GB and under (FAT 32 restriction I think).  So, ripping a 2 hour DVD at 2500kbps will leave you with a file to big to really handle.  Today, I couldnt xfer a 2.34GB file due to file size.  So, you're forced to lower bitrates or splitting files.  Anything over 2000kbps is overkill for the small screen anyway but it's needed if you want to watch something on your TV using the dvr station's video connections.     Speaking of the DVR, seems you're limited to 640x480 recording with a max bitrate of 2500kbps.  The bitrate isnt a problem but the resolution is smaller than what I would consider ideal for playback on my HD Plasma.  Guess there's only so much you can expect from the processor in the 605.  Once again, not a problem when viewing on the 605's screen (maybe a little hazy) but for playback on an HDTV, it leaves you wishing the rez was higher.  DVR scheduling and recording itself is good and very similar to set-top box DVRs.  Gives you warnings for recording conflicts etc.  Can automatically schedule listing downloads via wifi etc.  This is a well executed feature.  Audio functions are nice but one thing I noticed is that there's no instant Shuffle function.  You need to change the play-mode first and then go into the first album in your library to start shuffle mode.  Then, while you'll always hear the same first song in shuffle mode, all other songs will play in random as expected.  I wish it would always default to standard play mode and also offer a one-click shortcut to start playing in shuffle mode.  For unsupported file types like apple lossless/m4v files that you may have from itunes rips, the 605 doesnt handle it.  Rather than skip to the next playable file, it just stops and gives you a warning.  So, you may need to re-rip your CD's into playable formats to avoid this problem.  much of the device is plastic except for the bezel around the screen which is metal.  Seems pretty tough.   The USB connection is proprietary which is kind of a pain but given the connection features, you cant expect it to be anything else besides non-standard.   I wish the connection was on the side or top though.  If it's connected, you cant prop the device up with the kickstand - it stands tilted this way.  not a big deal though.  A secondary, mini USB (data only) connection would be ideal.  Charging with the ubs cable is painfully slow.  You really need the DVR station or other plug-in power sources for charging.  Its not realistic to deal with 6-8hours of slow charging via USB.  Get the DVR station for charging as well as other features that make this device shine.  Other great things about this device is video startup time.   Big, hi-rez files startup in under 3 seconds.  fast forwarding is also super quick.  Viewing photos is also superb - the interface is really nice and pics taken in 8+ megapixels are easy to flip though with little/no delays.  Havent tried RAW yet though.  that's all for now

<Title>Archos 605 Wi-Fi - This is it!
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, waiting for this device was frustrating but worth it.  I originally puchased from [...] but they have no idea what customer service is about so I bought from the beloved Amazon.com.  As always, seamless transaction.  I was so excited when I saw someone had it in stock I bought it.  Should have known better than to not get it from Amazon.  This device is finally it.  After iPods, Zen Micros, PDAs, Media Center Extenders, and all of the other devices I purchase to create my digital library, this is it.    I was shocked how easy the Archos was to setup straight out of the box.  I ordered a DVR station with it and it worked perfectly.  The pass-through allows you to view the Archos on your TV and watch movies, etc.  It took less than 5 minutes to get it to record TV.  Very smart interface and the docuing station can be sitting on top of a cable box and still send signals to change the channel.  To sum up how it works, you sign up for the free tv listing service online by your zip code and service provider, you then very easily tell the Archos what TV or DVR or Satellite box you want to control, test the IR repeater funtion works and youre done. You then view the listings on the screen, click on the shopw you want to record and the device does the rest.  It changes the channel on the cable box and starts recording.  Very very simple.  Video quality, awesome.  Very crisp display and good options for adjusting the picture quality.  My MOST favourite feature is no proprietary formats.  So, MP3s stay MP3s, WMV, Divx, etc.  The folder structure is quite easy to understand.  As soon as you dock it via USB you get folders such as "Data, Music, Pictures and Video" as a drive.  You simply drag whatever and boom, it's there and ready to play.  Sound quality is excellent (with headphones).  And then last night I discovered even a better feature.  Amazon's MP3 service.  Finally, purchasing digital music is without DRM, conversions, etc.  A comlpete package.  And no, I do not work for Amazon but I think they have it completely and totally "figured out".  So I highly recommend this baby.  The only "negatives" are the connector cable (proprietary USB 2.0 unless you have DVR station then it is standard) and a little bulky but worth it.  Everyone at my office now wants one.  I love showing it to the iPod Phone or Touch owners with their 16GB of solid state storage :)  In summary, if you want to consolidate your ENTIRE digital library, this is it.

<Title>!!WOW!!   Very worthy product. BEATS the iPod anyday!
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wifi ROCKS!! The product is amazing because it offers all the same features as the iPod toutch and more for the same price or lower(depending on model). Flippin overrated iPods dont have a chance against the Archos. I have the 160GB version and I'm surprised of how small it is. Its no thicker than a classic PSP and the screen is amazing. I love how it has a kickstand for viewing movies, rather than holding it in your hands. I like almost EVERYTHING about it.   But the one drawback is that if you want internet you have to bust out $30 more since its not included. If you also have alot of videos downloaded from a p2p program most of them wont play without the Cinema plugin ($20). Other than that I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!

<Content>Got my 605 wifi after waiting over 2 months (way to long), got it charged and had just started loading it when it reset itself and flashed an error message. Gave the option to fix it, but would not called the company and now I have to return it, and it could take up to 45 days (their minimum estimate) to receive a replacement. NOT IMPRESSED.   User guide leaves alot to be desired, but hopefully the replacement will work properly.

<Title>Love it when it works:(
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Archos 605 160Gb. I love this thing when it works.  I had it for 1 month with no problems.  Took extremely good care of it.  Kept the screen protector on it and kept it in its case in and that case in yet another case.  I put 100 movies on it, 1200 songs, a few thousand pictures, and all my camcorder movies too. I had all the plug ins. They cost..so figure in an extra $100 if you want to make the most of the product. I had the dvr station too another $80.  The DVR station came in with the audio out lines blown. But I used it to convert all my camcorder movies onto the unit; very easily too. Then the problems started. It would not always turn on. The problem got to the point that it came to 29/30 times it would not turn on. The majority of the time the green power light came on...but nothing on the hdd red light. Sometimes I would just get a quick flash or two from the hdd light and (maybe) even get the archos boot up logo. Usually with lines going through it horizontally and then the unit would lock up. This all started at 1 month of ownership. This is when I requested my rma. I kept it a few more weeks to back it up, trying reformats through the unit, and to reinstall firmware. It got to be impossible to deal with at 2 months. I backed up my 100+ gig of data to my computer, though it took me an hour just to power on the archos to do so. It did not seem to make any difference on how full the battery was or not. Now I have sent the unit in next day air to archos. 49 hours after ups tracking shows they got it; their website still shows it not received. Each time I call I waste 30-40 minutes on hold to get through to anyone. They say they have it and it will take (10-15 business days) to test and fix or replace it. Excluding any shipping. This just seems absurd to me. This was a lot of money to me, its new, and now I lose the unit for a month. Should this not be their problem??? Why is it mine? Am I the only one out there that is going through this???  I still think I would recommend the unit.  I just hope you get a good one.  I would rebuy at this point, but not sure if my opinion will stay that way.  I do wish there was an fm tuner, flash capability, and voice recorder.  But for the price, the size of the hard drive, and what it can do;  It is worth it.  If it works!

<Title>Hard to Beat the Versatility
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally broke down and decided to upgrade my MP3 player to a portable media player.  I had originally wanted to get an iPod, but was mostly weary of compatibility with my library.  After lots of research, I decided to go with the 160 GB Archos 605 because it was essentially an 160GB iPod meshed with an iTouch.  It also had PlaysForSure backing up the fact that it will play just about anything.  I had some trouble at first with the player.  It took almost a full day to charge the player, and it wouldn't run off auxiliary power from my computer.  I also had trouble syncing it with my Windows Media Player (WMP).  I don't normally use WMP, so I didn't like this feature.  After getting my music on it, I realized that it filed the MP3's based on the ID3 tags (like WMP), not the folders they were in.  Most of my music was sorted by genre on my computer, so I had trouble finding all of it.  Also, it was tough to make playlists at first for this reason.  It also froze and crashed a lot the first few days.  I figured out that this is because once you open a playlist and are playing it, you can't really decide to load a new playlist without closing the old one.  I also had trouble connecting to the internet via WiFi to download plug-ins.  That all being said, I still give it 4 stars.  I have learned to deal with most of the issues above.  It still sometimes crashes when I decide I want to listen to a particular song after loading a playlist, but oh well.  I found out that you don't have to sync it with WMP.  I didn't have any playlists in WMP, so I don't know if they carry over by syncing it.  You can transfer files like you would with any other external device by going to My Computer and draging and dropping files in the correct folder.  This is how I transfered video to it, and how I will transfer all my new music.  This is also the easiest way to update your Archos and buy plug-ins.  I had trouble with Archos' site, but their phone help was very good and even just had me do it over the phone and emailed me the plug-in.  Most of my AVI files played without the Cinema plug-in, but about 40% didn't.  I got the Cinema plug-in and I have only found one particular file that didn't play because of the compression ratio.  The picture is amazing and I like it very well.  The sound isn't quite as good because it sometimes isn't loud enough.  Especially on an airplane, some of my files cannot be heard, even with my noise cancelling head phones.  I will have to edit the file to increse the volume.  I dabbled a little with the online media available for free through Archos' site on DailyMotion.  It dl'ed very quickly and was very good quality for the player.  Eventually I will buy the Web Browser plug in, but right now it doesn't make sense since I have a laptop.  I like that you can plug it in to the cradle or a computer and charge it while listening to music or playing video.  I also got the DVR and it plays very easily onto any TV.  You have to be sure your TV or cable box has an S-video output or you cannot record TV with your Archos.  Mine doesn't, so I haven't been able to try out this feature.  The battery is only about 4 hours for video and browsing, so you have to plan your time carefully.  I have not figured out how long the music is for it yet, but it is plenty long enough.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the player and will be even more satisfied when I am able to record TV.  Tech support has also been pretty good as well, although I haven't had any big problems yet.
