<Content>great price for a 256mb flash drive plus mp3 player. sound quality is very good i think even with the headphones that came with it. setup and navigation is easy. can easily hold 4 albums and all my mp3s are 192kb encoded. good size, fits into my pocket with all my other gadgets or can be worn around your neck with the added strap if you wish to wear it that way. anywho, i love it.

<Title>Don't waist your time or money!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The player is small and lightweight. It looks good, and the blue LCD is cool, but this isn't a cool MP3 player! The case is cheap and would probably explode if dropped. The sound is noisy during quite songs, and a weird static can be heard fluctuating in the background. At times, the player will not even recognize songs after you have spent a loooooong time uploading them to this slow player. And even at times the player would recognize all of the tracks uploaded, but would merge them all together when played, creating a very bad experience when wearing headphones! Spend your money elsewhere. This is not one to try.

<Title>don't buy any Buslink products
<Date>Tue Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought a Buslink cd rw drive and the company did not honor the rebate.  The better business bureau lists Buslink as an UNSATISFACTORY business for among other things, not honoring rebates.

<Title>GREAT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Sat Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great mp3 player for its price. You can download about 70 songs to it. The music software is easy to use. You can also record songs with the voice recorder or use the voice recorder for lecture in school.Plus the LCD screen displays the title of the song, and the artist. GREAT PRODUCT!!!

<Title>Pretty, nice features, and it sounds great
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The picture above is wrong, for some reason.  It's very nice-looking (red and silver/grey) in reality, and has a backlit screen and convenient controls.  It also sounds great-- I am very pleasantly surprised.  It sounds much better than my Roxio cd/mp3 player, and I think maybe even my computer.  It's a nice size, and feels well-made.  I like the menu system, controls, and the USB interface (includes short extension cable).

<Title>Small, USB built in great for the price.
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have to say i have bought 3 of these.  How could you go wrong for 2x the memory of everyone else at the same price.<p>Pros:  Small, Lightweight, Good (up 20 hours) battery life, nice backlit screen, good features including data code lockout.  Nice look, cap locks securely, 5 second on feature prevents turning on by accident, built in equalizer, Really a pretty well designed product -<p>Cons:  NO RANDOM!!!<br>VERY poor customer service (I had one that locked up at Musicdrive screen.  Called 30-40 min hold - not 800#, and was told send it back and they don't do cross ships -  however I called a week after to get an RMA and someone named Mike told me - oh all you have to do is reformat the drive you corrupted it when you removed it.... YOU MUST click the remove safetly icon in 2000/xp/98 when you remove to prevent data corruption.  I never did this before and so it happened 1/100 times but that would suck if I were on the road...)

<Title>Won't work under Mac OS X 10.3!
<Date>Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought one of these things because it said it was Mac OS X compatible, but it's not compatible with the latest version: 10.3.  I called Buslink and talked to their Mac guy there (who was very kind and apologetic, by the way) and he said to send it back.  It works really well under OS 9 (I believe it even works under 10.2 though I didn't test it), and it's a nice little player, but as of right now it won't work in 10.3.  I asked if there was any possibility of a firmware update or anything that would fix this problem and he said no.  He said it's possible that future generations of these will work in 10.3, but it's probably best to give Buslink a call to check before buying one!

<Title>Nice little MP3 player-also can be used to transfer files
<Date>Wed Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I justified my purchase of this gizmo because I needed a voice recorder.  It works fine but I found out that you need to press a series of buttons to record.  I needed something more convenient.<p>My real desire was to have a small lightweight MP3 player.  This accomplishes that in spades.  Very easy to use-plug into your USB port and transfer MP3s to it.  Plug in your earphones and away you go.<p>256 megs is about 3-4 hours of music total.  I've never loaded it that much.  It has the most amount of memory that I've seen in a MP3 player this small.  This things not much bigger than a flash drive unit.  By the time you add space for the extra electronics to play MP3s, battery and a LCD screen, it's amazing that they could keep it this small.<p>Controls are limited.  Basically you have volume and skip forward, backward.  There are some equalizer presets to change the sound but no actual bass or treble control.  Random would be nice but not available.<p>Also, it doesn't come with an armband-only a cord to hang around your neck.  Not too convenient if you are going to exercise or do something that requires a lot of movement.  In fact, the small size of this unit caused me to make a mistake.  But it also shows that Buslink has good customer service.<p>I was using it when I would do yardwork, etc.  Instead of using the neck cord I put it in my pocket.  My body movement caused too much pressure on the earphone jack.  It caused the connection to become unstable.  However, I emailed Buslink with this problem and they sent me a RMA number within 1-2 days.  I need to send it back but was able to jury rig it to keep working.  I hate to be without it for 3-4 weeks to send it back.<p>In a nutshell, it's a great little MP3 player, very small, lightweight.  Also functions as a voice recorder and flash drive.  If you want more storage or more audio features, look elsewhere.  But if you want an MP3 player that is practically unnoticeable, get this one.

<Title>Good little MP3 player - good value for the  memory
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had intended to purchase the iPod until I saw the price &lt;yikes&gt; and also read several reviews that left me doubting whether that was the right player for me.  This is my first MP3 player - I wanted something small I could take to the gym.  My biggest concern was NOT that it hold hour after hour of music because I knew I could delete files and replace as I wanted.  After reading the reviews on this player I decided to go for it.  I'm not disappointed.  I'm running Windows XP and the device was recognized immediately - all necessary drivers were automatically installed.  Within 5 minutes I had transferred 20 MP3's into the unit and was playing with the various functions. Nice size - 256MB which is more than enough for me  :) I'm glad I didn't spend the money on the iPod....this one suits me just fine.  The ear buds actually stay in my ears, although I still find them annoying and will probably invest in a small set of headphones to replace them.
