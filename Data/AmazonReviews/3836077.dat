<Title>I'd give it zero stars if I could

We purchased this for our daughter. Used to love the Toshiba line. I own their laptop, two high definition tv's, their high definition dvd player, and a regular dvd player.  So, when purchasing the Gigabeat, I didn't hesitate.  Well, the thing turned out to be a lemon. System failure, hard drive failure.  Sent it out twice for repair, both times losing over 1200 songs my daughter paid for.  They told us if it happened a third time, even after the warranty expired, they would replace or refund our money.  Guess what?  It just failed, and they said, tough luck, you're out of warranty.  By days mind you - not months, not years, just days it is out of the warranty period.  Nice company, considering what faithful customers we are..  I will never purchase from, or recommend Toshiba again, and I will take every opportunity I can to let every consumer know what their customer service is.  A Joke.  I will be writing their corporate office also.  They are so non-consumer oriented, you cannot even send customer service an email at Toshiba, nor can you speak to a supervisor.  You have to mail them!!!!!  Yes mail, regular mail, like the post office, with a stamp.  Hello!!!!!!! Aren't they a technology company? No emails??????  What a huge disappointment Toshiba.  Shame on you.

<Title>NO MAJOR ISSUES SO FAR!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a good year before I wrote my review.  I have reached that point with positive opinion on this product.  It is very easy to work with and has lots and lots of storage space!..I like being able to see the album covers when I play songs either on the display or on the TV screen...If I could change anything about this product, those things would be: 1. The battery life: don't get me wrong, It will last all day with moderate use if you are listening to music...apprxmtly 7-8 hours..depending on how you have the device set. (some settings pull more on the battery than others)..If you are watching video, maybe 2.5 hours on a full charge...that might be a little weak as far as battery strength goes in my opinion...But, a simple solution for this is to keep a car charger with you when your using it in a vehicle, and you will never have problems with battery life.  2. I wish it was more compatible with video files and did not have to convert all to WMA format..I found that I couldn't convert some video files...I would get an error message. Also, some files, when you convert them, lose clarity and that defeats the purpose of converting the file in the first place..  3.  I would love if I knew how to make each clip in the video file play continuously without having to manually play each individual video.. If there is a way...I haven't figured it out yet.  These aren't major issues though.. I mainly purchased this to listen to music and audiobooks....you can also run slideshows of your pictures will music is playing as well...I would say that I am overall very pleased with my purchase..

<Title>Mayor Flaw in Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought the S60 and I am totally disappointed. The device is nice and works fine but the way you have to sync the music using MediaPlayer 10 is not working for ripped CD's that do not have Tags. I have audio books that I did place in the Music folder using the FileManager. The S60 attempts to sort them by Artist, Song, Genres, etc. but does not give you a folder view as the F60 did or as any other MP3 player I owned did. This makes this player useless for anyone that likes to listen to audio books and music that was riped from a CD. I liked this device because of size bothy physically and storage but this flaw made me decide to put it on Ebay and get rid of it. It is unfortunate that such a flaw is produced by Toshiba. I even called the customer service and they told me to simply add tags to all my 7000 songs and audio books, Yeah right!!!  My recommendation is do not buy this device until the patched this mistake in the interface design.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am completely satisfied with this player.  I installed the beta version of Windows Media Player 11 and it works great. Takes some time getting used to coming from 10, but it's worth the effort.  One thing I really enjoy about using this product is that it requires no extra software. It comes with a CD, but I just tossed it to the side and let windows xp pro handle the rest.  I did see that some people were disappointed about not being able to put data files onto the unit. Cmon people. Open up my computer while the device is connected. Create a folder and drop your files in. It's not rocket science. This product will work like a thumb-drive.  One minor drawback, but it has not flawed my opinion at all, is that simply dropping media into the device outside the "Sync" routine won't allow the file to show up in standalone mode. I'm sure theres a way this rule can be bent, but why bend something when another method already allows for it?  Buy this thing now.

<Title>A nightmare for me....
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was thrilled to get the Gigabeat (60 gig) and spent hours loading it up. Then the problems began. This is an actual partial copy of my email to Toshiba customer service at the address provided with the product: ........................................................ Just received Gigabeat 60 from Amazon Friday. S/N: (provided)   This has been a nightmare for me. I waited for this product and did not want to go IPOD.   After following ALL instructions and spending hours downloading selected music, pictures and videos - including several VONGO downloaded films which I subscribed to just for your device, I connected the Gigabeat later yesterday to add some more downloads and instead I saw a message on the device stating something like "deleting files" and within seconds EVERYTHING I had downloaded was gone....GONE!   After this I rebooted the PC, reconnected the USB to the Gigabeat and it was no longer recognized by the PC, even though I did get the message asking me if I wanted to use Windows Media or VONGO. When I clicked on Windows Media is when I got the "not recognized" message. Interestingly the VONGO site did recognize and I was able to download films again...BUT I could never get the PC to recognize GIGABEAT when in Windows Media. I even downloaded WM again through the gigabeat software CD.   So, I waited until this morning to try again - since it was after midnight when I finally gave up trying.    This morning (Sunday) I turned on the Gigabeat, the PC and reconnected them using the USB. This time I immediately got a message on the PC stating that the connected device has malfunctioned. Then I disconected the Gigabeat, which said it was connected, and the Gigabeat's screen shut down. It will not turn on at all. It will not even show the battery icon when using the AC adaptor.   I am ready to return this to Amazon tomorrow and ready to write a user review outlining this horrible experience. Your device came with a slip of paper saying please do not return the product and to call customer service. This either means that you are serious about making this product successful, or there have been many problems, or both. Of course, unlike many other tech product suppliers, you have no weekend phone support and do not even begin until 10 am EST on weekdays.    I will wait to call Amazon to arrange the return until 1:00pm EST in case you would like to call or email to discuss. If you email or call and get my voice mail please be sure to leave a direct return phone number....or failing that please state a time that you will be calling and I will make sure I am in my office to answer your call - any time between 11:30 and 1:30 EST.   Again, this has been a nightmarish disappointment for me. I would appreciate a thorough and helpful response.    UPDATE: After I returned the product I received an email response - days later - from Toshiba customer service (Rick) telling me to "swith off the battery for at least 3 minutes" and if this doesn't work to call an 800 number for support. I'm not sure what this meant as the battery has no switch and is not removable. But, of course, I had already returned the product and have received a refund from Amazon.   Some people seem to love the new Gigabeat, but I am not willing to live with the chance that all files will delete on their own at any time. I liked it for the hour that it worked for me. In my opinion, Toshiba has work to do in quality control as well as customer support. I guess I'll wait for the upcoming competing Microsoft product.

<Title>Jury is still out, but you might want to WAIT!
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok... I did my homework and decided the Toshiba Gigabeat was what I wanted.  I ordered it last Thursday and even joined Amazon Prime so I could get it overnighted for $3.99... just had to have it for the weekend.  First, I loaded over 600 songs on it Friday night.  It was great.  While I was listening to those I joined VONGO and downloaded 8 movies!! The next day I tried to transfer the movies to the Gigabeat... TRANSFER ERROR! Oh, but it gets better... ALL my 600 songs were GONE!!!!  Hmmmmm, seems I remember reading about a similar problem someone else had in the reviews.  So I reload the songs and finally get the movies to transfer.  Later that day I record something off TV and try to transfer that.... ERROR!  This is getting old.  Wait, not done.... Sunday I fire it up again and guess what.... yep, all 600 songs are gone again!!  So Monday morning I contacted Amazon and sent it back!  Figured I give it one more chance so I told them to ship me a replacement.  If I have ANY problems at all with this one, it's going back for a refund!  Obviously Toshiba has some quality issues!!! Oh, and when I emailed them (Toshiba) about the problem, I got the exact SAME email back that the other guy did... something about turning off the battery for 3 minutes!!  What a joke!  All I can say is beware on this one... seems to be alot of lemons in the mix!!!  NOTE:  Amazon has been wonderful to deal with on this, so my rating is based on the performance of the Gigabeat, not Amazon.  They paid for the defective unit to be returned and sent me a new replacment the next day, before they even received mine back!!  5 stars for them!!  UPDATE:  I received the replacement unit from Amazon.  I tried transferring movies that I downloaded from VONGO... one of the main reasons I bought this unit.  All I got was error messages!!  After numerous attempts I called Vongo's techincal help line.  "Not our problem, must be Toshiba"  So I called Toshiba's Technical help line.... you know what's coming... "not our problem, must be Vongo!"  So the next day it went back for a refund!!  I'd think twice about wasting your money on this device, it obviously has A LOT OF BUGS to be worked out and I got a real "couldn't care less" attitude about it from Toshiba!!

<Title>Another buggy device
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow after i read the comments on this website I am 110% glad that i returned my Toshiba Gigabeat today. Its uncanny how I've had the EXACT problems with the gigabeat. Transferring audio is easy but keeping them on the device is very tough. When I tried to transfer a video windows media player, it would always get stuck in the converting process at 0%. After 2 hours and still at 0%, i disconnected the gigabeat. When i turned it on, it said "Dumping Information" on the screen. What did customer service say? Turn of the battery for 3 min? BS! This occurs 2 more times after I did this. In addition to this, my battery would abnormally die even after a night's charge. A message would come up on the screen saying that "Portable Media Center is very low on battery and will turn off soon". Then there was an option to click OK, but the screen froze and the only remedy to this was to reset the battery and say goodbye to all ur content.   And what about video quality you ask? lol. It was so bad i thought my vhs had better qualities. Due to the 65k color screen there were numerous color abnormalities on the screen. Horrible night scenes due to lack to color transition made watching nighttime movies impossible to bear. Plus the gigabeat virtually supports no video format. But what about WMV? No. It has no native support for any video file. Even if you try to transfer a WMV file to the gigabeat you will need to convert it. Worse, if you have an divx or xvid encrypted divx and try to convert it on the gigabeat frame-skipping occurs. Atleast the viewing angles are great? WRONG. If you watch a night scene on the gigabeat you will fund yourself turning the screen around.  Why am I saying all of this? You've probably read about these problems many times before this. I am just reitterating my problems just to show you how deceptive this product really is.  O sure you see a 8.3 in cnet, 9.2 on pcworld so it must be a great product. Then you think it looks sexy and its not an ipod. The best deal! WRONG. I was optimistic like this before i bought the gigabeat. Companies and people wonder why many consumers are pessemisstic about products and seek to find anything wrong with it. I have learned that if you want to buy a product you must expect the worst from products.      Bottom line: It depends on what you want. You want portability get an ipod. It has the same capacity, a thinner look, a sexier look and a whole lot more battery life. No FM tuner, but the tunner in gigabeat is garbage anyway. I have manual tuning radios that work better. You want quality and performance? Get the Creative Zen Vision: M. It has greater video support, DivX 4,5, Xvid, Mpeg 2,4 and WMV. It has a bigger and better screen at 2.5 with 262,000 colors compared to the gigabeat's 62k. Better FM tuner, and more features including calendar, contact list, screen keyboard for artist search, organizer, microphone and radio recording.   If there was a zero rating for this product I would rate it just that. I fully recommend that you do not buy it, and if you do then returning it will be the best day of your life.

<Title>An Excellent PMP
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's interesting to see a product get either five or one star.  My experiences have been nearly all positive.  The software seemed clumsy at first, until I upgraded to Windows Media Player 11, which is intuitive and dependable.  It is possible to delete songs, and I have never had any problems transferring music, pictures, of videos to the Gigabeat.  Since I prefer classical music, sound is important.  I previously owned a Creative Zen Touch that distorted with percusive sounds (such as loud passages on the piano).  Those same MP3 files are distortion free on the Gigabeat.  The sound is fantastic! My guess is that the one-star incidents are anomolies.  This is a solid value, especially compared to the Zen and (possibly) the iPod.

<Title>apple can pack its things
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I cannot help but spread my enthusiasm for the player - the 1-stars seem to rely heavily on download-services which do not play a role for me. If you search a player that   - runs smoothly with your music collection (mp3, wma, etc) - has a brilliant screen - plays movies without complaining (even divx after conversion) - shows fotos that can be put on the player directly from the camera  the Gigabeat is your device at a good price.  At this point, accessories are a big minus for sure - there is one single manufacturer that has carrying cases (Noreve St. Tropez), but they cost 40EUR ($51) a piece excl shipping (they are handmade, though ;-)  I am afraid for stands you will have to wait quite a bit (if not forever), car adapters should be easy to find, though, since you can be safe to assume that the player will run with the standard stuff you find at radio shack  however - I have to say how great the player is and how it is worth the hassle to get it (at least it was until july). it is intuitive, the sound is excellent, even divx-movies are converted, the screen is brilliant and the hook-up with the tv runs smoothly (movies are like watching a dvd, seriously).  all in all a great buy - the ipod would force you into itunes and cost way more considering all the "accessories" (i.e. radio, tv-out, foto-transfer, etc.) ipod-people have to pay big money for.

<Title>Sounds good, bad battery life
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you use a subscription service, stay away. Yahoo wma files kill the batteries. Plays for shorter is more like it. I have done tests, mp3s I have made, the battery lasts 15 hours. Yahoo files, good luck on over 2 hours.   I like the interface, the sound is clear and distortion free and it has a huge storage capacity.   As a player, this is a good device. Just stick to files you have ripped your self.

<Title>Battery drains when fully charged
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am returning my unit. Just like another reviewer (read below) documented the battery drains abnormally when switched off. It happens when you actuate the battery 'switch' (it's a miniscule slide button in a recessed opening that you cannot see, you have to use a pin or a needle and knowing that it is in the off or on position move it the opposite direction - one poor design feature in this product). I'm playing it safe rather than having it repaired which Tosh. readily agreed to do. I also have noticed that the battery runs down faster if you play WMA DRM files a lot or move around in the menu a lot. I knew this was not the player with the best battery life before buying it, I would be happy with 8-10 hours with audio. There is a lot to like too. THe sound is great, the interface is great and scrolling to an item in the menu is very fast. It works well with WMP 11 Beta 2. The FM radio reception is mediocre. It would not pull in one of the strongest stations around here for some reason. FM was not one of my requirements anyway.
