<Title>Great MP3 player...
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although Sony has had alot of bad press lately, I took a chance with this MP3 player for my wife, since she likes pink. She ended up loving it and was very impressed by the great noise cancelling headphones. She uses them to jog around our noisy neighborhood. Not only are the headphones great, but the fm tuner is one of the best on the market. Even though its a Sony, it is still far more affordable than an ipod. Sony still makes a great product and we have been very happy with them.

<Title>Cool, Awesome, HOT

<Content>This is the cutest mp3 player I have ever seen. I purchased this because I love Sony products and this one earns it 5 stars! It has great sound quality and the included earphones definitely does cancel out noise. The battery life is out of this world long, which is perfect because I know that recharging batteries often typically decreases the longevity of batteries and since this one hardly ever needs charging, I know that this battery will outlast any other mp3 player. Also, it's compact design and 50 hours of playback time means that I don't need to bring the AC adapter with me everywhere! Convenient, this thing it! Don't get me wrong, I also have an iPod and I like it too, but this mp3 player is actually smaller and cuter than the nano, but not too small like the shuffle. I have the pink one, by the way, and it is so gorgeous. I love the color! Did I mention the built-in FM tuner? A lot of mp3 players these days neglect to put that in, but this little cute device didn't forget to add that in! Unlike my iPod, this one also plays WMA files, which is really cool because WMA files takes up less space than mp3 files. Not to mention that it so much more simple to transfer songs on. You don't need to download special programs (iTunes *ahem*) to add songs onto this mp3 player.  Overall, I just absolutely LOVE this mp3 player. It's sleek, cute, compact, has so many extra features and most importantly, it's really really really convenient to use. It's PORTABLE, I mean, really portable. You fully charge it once, and you take it on the go. You don't need all that extra stuff (like a computer to charge it!). It's Sony, it's pink, it's convenient, easy to use, and portable. You bet this thing is awesome!

<Title>I am very satisfied with pretty much everything with this mp3 player
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was using iPod video 30GB for little more than 1 year, but I don't really watch video in that small screen, and it's too big to carry with me all the time. That's I was looking for flash memory based MP3 player and found this product. I am not very crazy about the pink color, but I don't complain. Battery lasts for 50 hours ,it's very small. Even it has a FM tunner in this small thing. I really want to rate higher than 4, almost 5. But the only thing I didn't like was the sync cable. As it uses USB connection anyway, how come Sony didn't use a standard USB cable. The connector on this MP3 player is very fragile. I think I will use this product for long time.

<Title>Nice sound anc low price
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is highly rated and popular in Japan and is sold with much higher price tag. It was sold since fall of 2006 in Japan and I was wondering whether I should buy it and ask my family there to send it to me.   I found this in Amazon at an unusual low price this spring, so I bought it.     The sound quality is excellent with its headphone, and the noise canceling works nicely.  The cons is the slow and heavy software and you can not Drag & Drop to transfer the music files into the player.   As I do not change the music in the player often, this is not a problem so far.  All considered, this is highly recommended.

<Title>Heaphones stink, interface is confusing
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let's start with the headphones. Now, it seems as though Sony is very proud of the "noise canceling" function of these headphones (which I didn't really notice as being much different from the noise-canceling properties of regular headphones), and they were thoughtful enough to send you 3 different sized rubber attachments for the ear buds, ostensibly to make them more comfortable (I actually found them to be less comfortable than regular disc-shaped ear buds), but none of this matters because the wire is just WAY TOO SHORT for anyone to use these. I'm not sure exactly how long the wire is, but suffice it to say it's not long enough for you to put the mp3 player in your pants pocket with the headphones in your ears. In fact, I can't even fully extend my arm while listening to this thing. This essentially makes the headphones useless for a portable device. I really have to wonder why they did this. Even the cheap headphones you buy at a drug store usually have a decent-length wire.  So you're going to need to buy new headphones. And you're going to need to figure out the interface! Now, it seems pretty self-explanatory at first. There's a main menu from which you can browse through lists of songs or functions. This being an mp3 player, one of the primary functions you'll be looking for is a shuffle. And there's a shuffle option in the main menu! Well, that was easy.   BUT WAIT! If you try to turn on shuffle from the main menu, you'll find that there's no regular shuffle mode to choose, you can only choose from one of several weird shuffle modes that shuffle only songs that share certain characteristics, like release date or genre. Well, that's nice, but what if I just want to shuffle all the songs on the player? Can I do that from the main menu?  No! For some strange reason, in order to turn on the regular shuffle mode, you have to push a nondescript little gray button on the bottom of the unit and click through several other "play modes", most of which seem to be completely useless and are described by the instruction manual in vague, poorly worded terms.  Yes, there is an instruction manual, and I suppose it explains all of this, but why not make it self-explanatory, as it is on the ipod?

<Title>Effective Player
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had the NW-S705FP for over a year and it is THE perfect device for the gym.  Another reviewer wondered about the "short cord" for the earphones and the cord is just right when you wear this player on a lanyard (light just came on somewhere). The controls are easy to use (IF you bother to read the instructions for just 5 minutes) and the battery life gets me through an entire week of workouts (2 hours a day/five days a week); the FM Radio makes it the best 2GB player out there.
