<Title>A Technical Marvel
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is quite simply the most amazing product Sony has come out with yet. I would give it 5 stars just for the sheer coolness factor this little gizmo offers. I got mine several weeks after it came out and i dont leave  home without it. It plays MP3 at surprisingly high quality, and nice and  loud unlike most MP3 players. It's quite expensive, so if money is an issue  I recommend waiting for a price drop, but other than that, buy the Memory  Stick, its just the coolest thing I've seen in a long time.

<Title>Trashware
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the music clip version of the sony players. These products are a total waste of money. True, they have a sleek, compact design but are functionally worthless due to the multiple limitations of the software  (open MG jukebox) which must be used to download or convert files. As best  I can tell they are not really MP3 players but only play reformatted MP3  files. As a result you must clog up your hard drive with all of the  converted tracs in addition to the original MP3 files. To make matters  worse, you can only check out a song from 1 computer to one music clip  player. But wait, it gets worse. You can only check a song out to that  specific player 4 times. This is SONYs effort to protect copyrighted music  for which it has a vested interest. But the ads are misleading and the  product worthless to me. This is SONYs next Betamax. I've gone back to my  prior, somewhat chunkier player which is convenient if slightly larger

<Title>Expensive and Useless
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Sony has made a nice piece of hardware, but you can only get music onto the thing using their sites when downloading emusic. And, if the song is fairly popular, chances are, you will have to pay to download it. The real  surprise is that you do not get to keep the song, you have to check in and  out of Sony's mainframe to &quot;check in&quot; and &quot;check out&quot;  the songs, plus, they will erase your song if they decide you have had it  too long. Basically, its an MP3 player that is expensive, and you can not  even get the music you want. I bought mine, and returned it furious 3 hours  later.

<Title>MPWhat?
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Sony MemoryStick would and could become one of the best portable MP3 players on the market...if it weren't for the fact that it isn't an MP3 player!<p>     Technically, because Sony only allows its proprietary ATRAC  music-compression system on its player, it isn't an MP3 player.  Thus, any  MP3's you might have already on your computer would need to be converted to  the ATRAC compression system first.  Unfortunately, this causes a lot of  hassles, and if you already have a huge amount of MP3's (legally, of  course) on your system, you might want to look at another of the player's  out there.<p>     However, if you are looking to digitally manage all of  your music on your computer, and you have a huge hard drive, then this is  the best player on the market for you.

<Title>I can't believe it sucks
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I recieved the Memory Stick Walkman under 5 impressions.<p>1) It played MP3s. 2) It had no copyright crap that Metallica's whining about. 3) Memory Sticks were pretty inexpensive. 4) It used normal Memory Sticks. 5) I could  use my existing media player to upload songs.<p>Boy, was I angry when I  faced the brutal truth. This thing takes like an hour to convert MP3s into  OMGs, it has MagicGate Memory Stick technology that makes no difference  except that it's more expensive (which is a lot, considering a NORMAL  Memory Stick's price), I had to use OpenMG Jukebox, which is a piece of  crap compared to Windows Media Player 7, or even RioPort. This copyright  stuff will hurt Sony badly, and I'm so ticked off, I refuse to buy Sony's  products!

<Title>Not so bad
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is a very good portable digital music player.  It is one of the  smallest ones available, has excellent sound quality and loading it is very  fast.  The rechargable battery charges quickly and lasts me about 12 hours.   The only drawback is the OpenMG software it uses, and its restriction to  Win98.<p>One of the other reviews mentions that you can only check out a  song 4 times, and makes it sound like it is 4 times ever.  Not true!  You  CAN only have 4 copies checked out at one time, but when you unload the  player it checks the copy back in.  I haven't had more than 1 copy of any  song checked out at any one time, so it isn't an issue.

<Title>Sleek style and size makes up for time consuming formatting
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Lets face it, almost 95% of prospective buyers of a digital music player are in the market because they are downright cool gadgets.  With Sony's MS7 walkman you definitely get a cool gadget that would make all of your friends quite jealous.<p>ATRAC3 WHATS THE BIG DEAL?<p>As you have read in earlier reviews this &quot;walkman&quot; uses the ATRAC3 format over MP3. Technically there are many differences between the two formats but audibly they are one in the same.  The big deal with the ATRAC format is not the sound but rather the convenience issue of the player.  For those of you who simply want to be able to drag and drop your MP3s onto this player you may want to double think purchasing this model.  Though dont be fooled, the Jukebox software that comes with this player allows you to convert your MP3s into the ATRAC format (as well as your CD's) <p>CHECK IN/ CHECK OUT<p>Once converted, the jukebox software will display all of your songs originally with three musical notes next to them indicating the amount of &quot;rights&quot; that song has to be transferred. Once you select an ATRAC file that you want to send to your player you then must continue with the check out process.  Once stored on your player you now only have two notes, indicating that you only have &quot;rights&quot; to that song two more times.  The only way to get your &quot;right&quot; back is to check the song back into your hard drive.  When you think about the system it is quite ingenious and would make any Sony lawyer happy.<p>MEMORY STICKS If you are buying this player thinking that you are going to stock up on Sony MG memory sticks think again.  64MB MG MS are over $100 a piece.  If you are looking for a player that would allow you to keep separate &quot;mixs'&quot; on different medias that you can interchange in your players, look to Iomegas new Clik player. <p>SLEEK STYLE  As seen in the picture this player is very ergonmically built.  It fits well in your palm and has a very intuitive menu. A &quot;rocking&quot; scroll bar on the side of the unit allows you to scroll up and down between your checked out songs and also allows you to FF and REW.  There are also options to change display types of your song readouts and time counter playback options. The look and feel are truly state of the art and worth the price tag.<p>ACCESORIES The player comes with a very tiny (and easy to lose) cradle that recharges the units LITH battery and also is the specially designed input of the included USB cable. (The input on the cradle almost looks like an 1394 port)Also easy to lose is the adapter for the headphone jack. The headphone input is not your standard 3.5&quot; mini plug but rather a 2.5&quot;.  The included headphones are 2.5&quot; and comes with the aformentioned adapter.  Also included is a very hard to install strap to hang the player around your neck.<p>All in all this  is the most sleek and best looking player on the market. Purchasing this all comes down to looks over convenience, shes very pretty but a definite pain in the arse.

<Title>Its cool
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I love Sony. I think there inovators and leaders in the electronics industry. This product shows just that. Easy to use, attractive and a nice peice of equipment. Setting up was easy. The registration process was a little overboard. I dont think you should have to register a product just to use it. &quot;Big Brother&quot; But you gotta do what you gotta do. Nice features and decent software but the conversion time is way to long. Also whats up with them crappy [cheap] earbud head phones? When you spend[this much] you should at least get some rockin head phones to go along.  In closing worth $400.00 no.  Worth $200.00 yes.  Bottom line.

<Title>Betamax redux
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>What a useless piece of junk. Impressively cool looking, it requires you to jump through Sony's copy-protection hoops to play music that you legitimately own. It also requires special MagicGate memory sticks, which are much more expensive per megabyte than other storage media.<p>If you want an expensive toy that forces you to endlessly convert files and pay homage to a technology that will disappear in a year you should by this player.<p>Can you say Betamax?

<Title>Sony MS-7, Great Design Poor Interface
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Like many Sony products the MS-7 is a study in top-notch industrial design.  The MS-7 fits perfectly in the hand and pocket, the controls are intuitive and it has the feel of a rugged piece that will take some abuse.  Unfortunately all the efforts put into the superb design are lost by the proprietary SDMI memory sticks and clumsy software. The music files loaded into the MS-7 are not MP3 rather ATRAC3.  While ATRAC3 has a bit better compression ratio, approximately 12:1 vs. 10:1 for MP3, it is hardly worth the nuisance of having to re-rip your MP3 files after downloading from your computer to the player 4 times.  Had it not been for the fact that mine had a bad left channel I probably would have kept it just because it is so cool.  I wound up with a Nomad II, which I like very much.  The Nomad II cost less, comes with a 32 preset FM tuner, nice headphones, not ear buds and uses a replaceable AA alkaline battery.  If Sony reissues the MS-7 sans SDMI and ATRAC3 I'll be the first in line to buy one.

<Title>quality is all
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I can understand that people are concerned about the check in and out procedure (I don't think it's too complicated anyway and I understand copyright problems very well), but if you want the realy best sounding mobile piece of sound this is the only choice. ATRAC 3 definitely beats mp3 by far when it comes to dynamics and distortion. and in combination with sony fontopia earphones ... you almost get the sound of a good home stereo into your shirtpockets. Even classic cd conversions don't lose any of their transparency. Don't listen to mp3 freaks. They are deaf anyway. The ms walkman is a serious piece of mobile HIFI! Believe it!

<Title>Not  really MP3 - or Windows Media Player Compatible
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I own this and I really wish I had not purchased it at all. I use windows ME with Media Player and have a fairly extensive collection of MP3 files recorded from my own collection of CD's. I purchased this for use while traveling due to its size and storage capacity. The box and advertising is extremely deceptive with respect to its use of the ATRAC3 format instead of MP3. Even the windows Media Player site would lead you to believe its compatible with MP3 directly - it is not. Sony's OpenMG software is very primitive and hard to use compared to other Juke Box software packages. I really dislike having songs taking up my hard drive in both formats. I own a lot of great Sony products. This is one I wish I never purchased.

<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This product is a PERFECT example of how stupid big corporations can be.  They think that since everybody's copying and exchanging music, the best thing to do is make it such a pain-in-the-ask to to copy music.  Sony you are dumb.  This is such a beautifully crafted peice of hardware, but NO, you just had to RUIN it with ATRAC.<p>I got one as a present from my brother in law.  I was shocked that he managed to buy this without knowing that it was a mp3 gimp.  I love sony cameras and vaios, but this walkman is a marketing audacity of sony music.<p>People dont have time and energy to convert files into something else and check them in and out.  Mp3 activities end up consuming enough time as it is, like a hobby or something.

<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>You know, in reading the other reviews, one has to wonder what it is they were expecting when they bought their Sony MS. It's a gadget, a toy, and it is a prized possession of mine. I found it easy to use, easy to download music, great to carry around and take music on the go without carrying a cumbersome CD player and CD's. Maybe if I was a techno-freak I would have knocks against this product, but for the general consumer I think it's a great toy.<p>Just wish it came with a case or clip so I could more comfortably take it running.

<Title>It's not an MP3 player - It's better
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I have been a proud owner of the Sony NW-MS7 for a couple of weeks now and it is one of the most beautiful and best sounding  portable audio machines I have ever used.<p>Before I bought the NW-MS7 I researched the product on the web and in the stores (Tottenham Court Road, London) for about 2 weeks. I wanted a player that can use MP3, WAV and also record my CD collection. It was also important to have playback  without skipping (unlike portable CD players). However, during this time I became concerned about the conversion to atrac3, memory storage and battery life.<p>It has to be said that there is alot of confusion on the web about the atrac3 conversion. The NW-MS7 is not a mp3 player. So you will have to convert all your mp3's into the atrac3 format. If you have alot of mp3's then it will be very time consuming and once converted you cannot play the atrac3 files in anything other than the software provided with the walkman - so the chances are you will have two copies of your mp3's.<p>When you have converted your favourite tracks you will have to go through a process of checking IN and OUT the music onto the memory stick. This is a very simple process. Some (over-reacting and panicking) reviewers seem to think that you can only check out a song four times and after that you have to go through the hasstle of re-sampling the music. This is WRONG. Yes,  you DO have to check OUT the songs and you do have the limitation of checking them OUT FOUR times BUT as long as you check them back IN  when you change the music on the memory stick then you're not going to run into any problems because this will restore the count back to four.<p>Also, this product will only work on one computer running ONLY Windows 98 ( Windows 95 upgraded to Win98, Windows NT and Windows 2000 are useless with this product) - so you can't update the memory stick on a work or friends computer - This limitation could be a real disadvantage. Sure, some music may need to be copyright protected but what will happen if you decide to upgrade to a new system or operating system or if the computer you currently own has a major meltdown. As far as I can tell the NW - MS7 will not work on software re-installed onto another system. <p>The sound quality is awesome. It has the same sound definition as a CD player but at a fifth the size and weight. This unit will not skip as everything is stored on a chip with no moving parts. One 64 MB memory stick will hold approx 80 mins of music at the default setting of 105 kbps. At this setting you're not going to be dissapointed - especially if the sound is converted from a CD ( the converted sound quality can only be as good as it's source ). Initally I did have a problem with the music ripped from my CD's. The converted files  skipped slightly when I played them back with the atrac3 software player and NW-MS7. I worked out that this was because in the setting for the Open MG player I was using an 'optimise cd drive' ( in this case it was a creative encore DVDx2) option. When I reverted back to the default settings the skipping stopped. <p>If you make your own music on your PC this is one of the best ways to listen to your creations. The sound is breath taking. It's converted with depth and clarity.<p>The unit is very easy to use,  you have the opportunity to upgrade the memory and above all it has a rechargable lithium ion battery. This will only give you 4 hours of playback  but you can use it with the AC power cord connected. So it will recharge as you listen to your music or check in/out your next compilation. I have found having another 64 MB memory stick around an advantage. I have one memory stick with my favourite music and I use the other for daily re-arranged compilations - just for variety. This works out a little expensive for 160 mins of music EXPENSIVE - but - this is new technology - remember the price of VHS films when they were first released in the early eighties.<p>It wouldn't have hurt for Sony to install an FM radio into this unit. I think it would have been a nice touch considering the limited storage space. And the headphones  - while excellent for listening to music - I had people staring at me while I was walking down the street. Not because they're cool but because the tips of the earpieces are so shiny they looked like a pair of dangly earrings. Not cool! especially in Hackney Central, London. I  replaced them very quickly.<p>Overall this is an amazing player. I was going to go for the newer NW-E3 but the ability to upgrade the memory and rechargable battery won it for me. In terms of sound reproduction I could not tell the difference between the NW-MS7 and a CD player (even on the default setting) and it looks veryattractive.  However, there are a few niggles with the software and compatibility with other Windows Operating Systems. Most of which, I hope, will be sorted out with upgrades and patches in the future. But, if you have the full installation of Win98 on your system and abit of surplus cash you will be in for a glorious audio experience.

<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is simply the coolest and most functional player out there. It seems as if half the people writing reviews don't even own the player, they're just commenting and adding to what other people have said. <p>What's the big stink about ATRAC? Are you people worried about space on your HD or something? Because if you dont have 200mb (or less) of free space on your computer then what are you doing with something so new and technological as an mp3 player in the first place? The music quality itself is awesome and the player as a whole package really is great.

<Title>Read this before you buy it!
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Two positive things to say about the player: 1.It looks very fancy and is supposed to have good audio quality 2.It is light and easy to use and just looks cool in your hand!<p>But... the provided Open Mg software is awful. It is the worst Jukebox software I have ever seen in my life. I have a feeling that it still runs in a pre-beta. I use win me and when I connected the device with my computer, started the software...&quot;kaboom&quot;, and I recieved a bluescreen message(fatal error). After reinstalling the software for at least 5 times, it still did't work so I called Sony and asked them why it is not working. A friendly person told me that the Open Mg Software doesn't work with windows me and only works with preinstslled Windows 98. He also told me that I can wait till a win me driver will be released. Thanx a lot! I spent [a lot of money] on this thing and now it doesn't work with a new operating system. Tss, tss bad bad software. A stupid thing is also that the player doesn't support mp3, but instead converts mp3 files into atrac3 files which take much storage on your computer together with your mp3's. Now the second thing is, the NW-MS7 is too expensive for a 64Mb mp3 player. You can buy the Rio 500 and spend less money and even although the Rio 500 is pretty old, the software still works better that the Sony NW-MS7. Now I own the Creative Nomad Jukebox and it is so much better. For only 100 bucks more you'll get a 6 Gig storage space with the size of a portable CD player. So if you still use windows 98 and look for a awesome designed &quot;mp3&quot; player and don't care about the software and the price then buy it! If you use win me or 2000 and look for a good working mp3 player and a good software then you should look for something else and don't spend [this much] on a 64 MB player.

<Title>Don't Overlook The Memory Stick!
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I have had my memory stick for around 7 months.  I normally do not write reviews, but I think the reviews on Amazon are unfair to the product.  True, it is not an MP3 player.  True, it takes some time to change files from MP3 to sony's format (the only reason I give it 4, and not 5, stars).  I am not a computer guy, nor am I an electronics guru, and I have no problem converting my music with the sony software.  The rechargable battery, size, weight, ease of use and plethora of features completely outweigh the two cons from above.  So what if it is not a &quot;true MP3&quot; player.  It has operated flawlessly, travels like a champ, is a perfect companian at the gym and gets tons of use.  The magic gate memory stick is a huge plus.  Add more sticks and it's like bringing multiple cd's or mixes with you.  I could go on, but like I said writing reviews is not my thing.  This NW-MS7 is.  If you are in the market for a portable music player of any kind, check this one out.  It truly is awesome.

<Title>EXCELLENT PLAYER!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The functionality and ease of use of this player is so amazing..oh and about ATRAC3, do you people realize that what an mp3 is converted to ATRAC3 it is compressed?! I listen to full-fledged hard rock, not some drum-and-bass junk so listen to this: I had a FOUR MEGABYTE mp3 but after it was converted to ATRAC3 it was ONE AND A HALF MEGABYTES! and it doesn't lose any quality at all!, in fact it sounds even better than mp3 when you're listening to it on the player. Because of this I was able to fit 24 songs on this player with the stock 64MB card!! With a normal mp3 player the files aren't compressed and you can only fit about half the amount of songs as when they're compressed using this player's software. so go buy the Sony NW-MS7 now .... it's the best one out there.
