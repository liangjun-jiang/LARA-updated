<Title>good product while it lasts
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ive had my rio carbon player for about 1 1/2 years and it has worked flawlessly until recently. for the first year i encountered absolutely no problems with the carbon and found that i liked it much more than an ipod, due to its size/shape and how easy it was to use, the only complaints that i had in the first year were fairly nitpicky in that the headphones stopped working after about 6 months (which isnt a big deal since headphones are easily replaceable) i also found it a pain to scroll through all of the artists to find a specific song that i want to listen to because this takes a long time (which is one feature in which the ipod is superior). the player is fairly easy to use and the software for the computer is also user friendly with easy playlist options and it is also simple to modify the title for the songs. it doesnt take very long to upload the music to the player and the player instantly recognizes what songs you already have on it so it wont waste space by duplicating the song on the player. i found the carrying case useless since you cannot access the front buttons while it is in its case and it is an extremely tight fit, making it difficult to insert and remove the player from its case, so i rarely use it. when i first purchased this mp3 player the stupid best buy employee told me that it could hold 5000 songs which is what made me choose this product over others, however i was extremely disappointed to find that it can only hold between 600-700 songs, and while that still is a great deal of songs this did not meet my expectations and it came nowhere near the amount of songs i wanted to put on it, making it sort of a pain to change my songs and go through all of them to pick and choose which songs i wanted to listen to rather than just having all of my songs at my fingertips. recently i have been having problems with my carbon player and have been pleased when i call the customer service center, they have been able to help me a great deal each time i call in getting my carbon to function again (i have called a total of 4 times in the past 6 months) however today i called them since my carbon player said it had no songs on it but when i plugged it into my computer it said that the player was full and they tried to help me as best they could but ultimately they told me in the sweetest way they could that there was an internal issue within my player and that i need to get a new mp3 player, which is disappointing since it seems like an mp3 player should last longer than 1 1/2 years. what surprised me most of all was that the rio employee suggested that i research the mp3 player much more before purchasing it (which i most certainly will do) and that i should really look at other types of mp3 players, basically telling me that i should not get another rio carbon 5 gb player. i will certainly follow this employees advice and do not plan on purchasing another rio product in the future, if you are considering purchasing this mp3 player i recommend that you do so only if you dont mind getting a new one in a year or two... but hey, you can do what you want, this is only my experience with one carbon, if you decide to get one hopefully you will have better luck than i did

<Title>Poor substitute
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was my second RIO MP3 player, the first worked fine but had a very limited memory.  The carbon worked well for about 1 month.  Then an error started to show up which prompted me to 'reinstall' the system to my computer and uplink all the songs again.  By the third month the player wouldn't link to the computer at all.  After numerous conversations with RIO, they informed me that my player needed to be replaced and offered to send me a replacement for the low low price of $100.  As I payed just $150 on sale 3 months ago, I politely (!@$# NO) declined.  My IPOD nano works well everytime, is smaller, more user friendly, and has a 1 year warrantee vs. the 90days for the RIO.  In otherwords, don't buy the carbon.

<Title>Worked great for 1 month/horrible customer service
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned two previous Rio's that I really liked and were adopted by my kids.  I upgraded to the Carbon.  It worked great for one month then required that I format the hard drive every time I wanted to add/delete music.  By month two the "permanent" long life battery was dead.  I followed the exact instructions on Rio's website for warranty assistance--THREE times and was completely ignored.

<Title>DONT BUY RIO
<Date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wish someone had wrote this review before I had bought my Rio carbon(2 for that matter.) I purchased my Rio carbon around Xmas of 2004.  Having used it for almost a year with no complaints I dropped it.  Im not a clumsy person but using it everyday scrolling between songs after song It would move in and out my pocket repeatedly.  As you can guess the volume and song scroll wheel got jammed in.  This delicate piece does not take much effort to destroy.  So I decided to be extremely careful and buy the Rio carbon pearl(6GB).  Again it worked perfectly for a little bit over a year and then suddenly it didn't work.  After restarting the unit more than a dozen times it worked again but did not read the songs I had on the mp3.  Rio customer service said they did not know what was wrong, but I had another 2 or 3 Mb of storage left.  Now 2 months later my Rio completely kunked out and I never drop the unit once!!! I hate Apple and ipod because everybody had one and I didn't want pay more for an ipod mini which at the time had less storage space for around the same price. But now I know why people pay more for things: Qaulity. A brand new Rio carbon cost 114 dollars now as listed on Amazon; but if you are ok with it having problems within a year, then this is the mp3 4 u.

<Title>It's alright
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player like a year and half ago.  For the most part it has worked great.  The price was really affordable for the amount of storage capacity.  I do have to say that I have had an issue with my player though.  A few months past it up and died on me.  I used it until the battery died and when I plugged it in for charging it just wouldn't.  It couldn't turn on or off, it just stopped working.  I threw it in a drawer and started shopping for and ipod.  A couple of days later I decided to give it another shot and I plugged it in to charge and it worked, it charged itself and started working again.  Now, the date and time were way off and I have noticed that it does that sometimes.  You know, the date will be like 5/12/06 and the player will say its 2/15/70, which I don't know why it does that but it doesn't interfere with anything  else. Now, I agree that the customer support for Rio sucks.  When I had issues with mine I tried to call them up and all I kept getting was a machine and that was after they told me that they had a new number.  When I tried going online for support it wasn't much help either and the only thing that I could do was pay them money to see if they could even help me. So overall, its a decent player for the money you are paying.  When its time to get another one I would say that I will most likely not go back to Rio.  I will probably go with something that if I have technical issues they will either help me out or replace mine.  I know that technical difficulties sometimes happen but it doesn't hurt to have a company that at least pretends to care and help you.

<Title> A good buy , when it works properly
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item and found after spending a few hours of downloading songs, that it was defective. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to getting this item.I contacted your customer service dept and was given instructions on returns,your return process is very efficient and I received a 2nd MP3. The only problem is up to this point it was about 3 weeks from when I originally ordered the item. After spending another 2 hours or so downloading and listening to songs I discovered that this MP3 also was slightly defective also. When listening to songs, only on certain songs, it would lock up and the whole system would just shut off. I did not want to go through another return process and downloading session and I really like this MP3 so even though it is defective,I decided to keep it anyway. I also want you to know that when purchasing the item, I saw no indication on the screen of your website where it said that it was a remanufactured item. I only discovered it after the purchase.

<Title>Not durable, bad customer service, overall unreliable
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this Rio Carbon for about two years. The interface with various Windows versions (I've gone through several since buying this) is very poor, the actual software program that comes with this Rio is rudimentary and that is almost a compliment. The unit itself is prone to fits of all kinds including restarting without reason, not shutting off, taking very long to turn on, etc. For any problems that you may encounter, don't count too much on the Customer Service. It's free only for the first 90 days and even during that time, it's pretty much useless. There is not much else that they can tell you that is not already written on their website which is meant to say, the several serious problems that this player encounters point in only one direction - it is, by nature, unreliable. Avoid it! There are much better options out there these days.

<Title>AFter 6 month review.     Bad Bad Bad
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Most of the good reviews I have seen were from people who just bought this MP3 player.  If you notice the on,off and volume switches on the top, they are plastic.  It looks like metal but they are not.  You can only bend or press plastic too many times before it breaks off.  I called the company about this and they wanted $99 to fix it.  Anyone knows you can't press on a plastic piece over and over again.  They told me tough luck.  Sure it was nice for the first week but who cares if its inoperable in a month!

<Title>Twice the storage and half the price of iPods
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. It's a whopping 5 GB player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an iPod with comparable storage. It holds an amazing number of songs and I especially like the recorder feature. It's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! Both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. I agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that I wouldn't recommend it to others. Even if I hadn't been biased against iPods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("Buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! Never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), I still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.  My only complaint is that mine broke easily. I see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so I guess I got the token dud. I only had it for a few months and I dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything I do.  Here's my personal plea: It looks brand new on the outside and I hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when I know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. I checked Rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that I can check with? If not, do you have any general suggestions as to where I could start? Any type of stores or business that might offer this service? Thanks and I'd appreciate any help!

<Title>badly manufactured - won't last
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one of these refurbished Rio players as an introduction to protable MP3 - I loved this thing for the first ccouple of months - great sound, ample storage, nice interface.  Then it started to fall apart - first the volume dial got stuck, then the buttons stopped responding.  The 'push and turn' style of the volume knob is a very poor design that doesn't work and is prone to breakage. Don't be inticed by the low price and ample storage - this thing won't last more than a few months, and there are lots of better options out there now as every consumer electronics manufacturer has jumped into this market.

<Title>I have one of the first ones made
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Rio Carbon when it first came out.  I have the problem with the annoying ear phone plug, but I have been using this Rio daily for years and other than the ear phone plug have never had a problem, never had a piece break, everything works the same as when I first bought it, except it doesn't last for 20 hours on a charge anymore.  I listen to audiobooks when I am running, cleaning house, etc.  I have dropped it a million times, found it in the bottom of my purse, exposed it to heat and cold, and it has never let me down.  I wish they still made RIO's!  I know I have had it at least 3 years.  My daughter has one, two co-workers have one, and my husband's co-worker has one and none of them have ever experienced any problems.  I like the charger, too.  The cable has a usb end and it can plug into the computer or into the ac adaptor.  It makes it convenient when traveling, plus you don't have to have a computer handy to charge the player.

<Title>Non existent customer service
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a rio carbon player; after an hour of use it went completely dead.  I faxed the proof of purchase twice within the warranty period  with the understanding that they would respond by phone within four hours.  That was several weeks ago, they never contacted me.  Now my unit is out of warranty, doesn't turn on, and I can't get in touch with Rio.  They have no customer service via email or phone.  Very poor indeed.

<Title>Clueless mom scores big!
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>[...] I ordered this as a Christmas present for my (then) 13 year old son who longed for "the competition" version of MP3.   The Rio Carbon 5GB was too much memory for the $$ to pass up. Although it's quite a bit larger in size, it's design is sleek, very "industrial" and my son LOVED it.  Still uses it DAILY and it's been 2 Christmases ago!  Felt secure in the reviews, felt secure w/ the guarantee and the company rating.  Mom scored big-time. :)

<Title>Save your money. Buy something else-Any Thing!
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>** Your review of "Rio Carbon 5 GB MP3 Player" **  Sure its cute and fun for the first few hours as stated by other  reviewers. But then there are the problems:  (1) The all important volume control/scroll wheel breaks off if  handled too roughly leaving you with no other means to control the  volume - annoying beyond belief. Given that this wheel also doubles  as a menu selection device/mice you are not going to be able to  change the settings that easily either.   (2) For reasons yet to be discovered, the device goes into an  upgrader mode. Meaning - it displays the message "upgrader" - its  expecting you to upgrade the firmware. But your computer can no  longer recognize it - hence, no upgrade possible and you cannot exit  this mode = IT DOES NOT WORK.  You can't even look at the time at  this point.   (3) Tech support from Rio - ELUSIVE/HARD TO REACH. I don't think  they exist.  (4) Warranty - 90 days after which everything seems to fall apart.  800 number? Forget about it.   Save your money and invest in a more durable device, this thing is  NOT worth it. I became so frustrated with it that I dumped it into  the garbage. I will never buy another MP3 Player from Rio again/EVER!  ** End of the review **

<Title>RIO Carbon Volume Knob Keep Breaking
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 5 GB RIO Carbon about 2 years ago.  After one year the volume knob broke, so I returned it, paid $100 and got a replacement.  About 2 months later the replacement died, so I paid another $100 and got another replacement.  Now the third replacement volume knob broke (without any dropping etc.)  I wish I never bought a RIO.  It has a serious design flaw.  Buy an MP3 player with no moving parts.  I should have bought an Ipod, as I have now spent far too much money continuously repairing/replacing my RIO.  Also not there is no shuffle mode on it either which would have been a nice feature.

<Title>Decent, but not fabulous
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This items works well in general and was a good buy for the price range, but doesn't have the perks that other mp3's have.  You cannot see all of the songs in the playlist when you have selected a list, but only see them as they play.  Also some loose connections at the audio port, making alot of noise when the unit moves, which can be very irritating, especially if you use the unit when exercising/running.
