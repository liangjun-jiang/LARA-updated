<Content>This product broke within 2 weeks of use.  The "forward" button went out first and then it rattled like something broke on the inside.  It no longer works at all.  Disappointing product!

<Title>Unfortunately, the Hydra is a disappointment
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Ultra Hydra is conceptually a great device.  Water / weather resistant, cool looks, voice recorder and radio as well as music player, runs on regular AAA batteries not some expensive specialty battery...  But, unfortunately, when I bought mine, and followed the instructions exactly, it had problems: it would only skip after it played the first track of music. It initially worked for voice recording but then that function also stopped working. I was treating the device like a gem, by the way, and I tried multiple times to follow through the instructions, etc.  The menu system then stopped working, too.  I had bought it from 'TD' and tried to post a review -- they never posted my review! (at least they were friendly and gave me my money back when I returned it).  Buyer beware.  The Hydra needs to be re-engineered, and THEN if it is really good quality, I will be among the first to buy it! but not now.  I am very disappointed in the device.

<Title>5 star value

<Content>I have 2 of these sweet little toys.  They are a great value providing a solid set of features for a great price.  Below are the pros/cons to support my claim:  Pros: * Great price, got my 2 gigger for under $50.  Nothing else comes close! * It is basically a USB MP3 player, no proprietary software needed to load your tunes.  Great for Linux, just plug it into the usb, download songs and go... * The unit comes with a strap and a plug.  Just slip the plug under your belt or into your riding shorts and route the wire up your back to your ears.  It is a sinch to adjust your tunes while on the move and you don't have wires hangin out all over...  Much better than those sticky, hot arm bands... * Rugged construction, water resistant.  I sweat all over it, beat it to death and it just keeps working... * Lots of neat info on the display. * Lots of features that I don't use, maybe someday, so nice to have... * CDROM has a pdf version in case you lose the paper manual. Just email the manual to your gmail account and it will never get lost...  Cons: * One of my units locked up when I got it.  Others on the net complained about this. My solution was to reload the flash software that comes on the cdrom or on the net and it worked fine...  A new version of the flash would be nice. * You MUST have a good battery!  Don't beleive the battery gauge.  I use Rayovac rechargeable batteries that last about 6 hours.  Just carry a spare.  If the unit freaks out (shuts off), replace the battery first.  You can adjust power settings if this bothers you. * Head phones are whimpy, but who cares, you can buy $300 ear buds ;-)
