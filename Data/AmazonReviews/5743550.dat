<Title>Weeeeeeeeee!
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a good item. I haven't tried any other mp3 players so I have no basis to compair.   It caught my eye with the color screen, which is really nice to have some graphics on your hip. The user interface is real easy to use. I have yet to read the manual and I have no reason to. The audio quality is nice. The little bud earphones give sufficiant sound quality. I like the image viewer. It could use a couple more cool features to utilize the color screen. More graphics or such. It has a screen saver function and it'd be nice to use a custom image. Audio options are excellent. You can adjust just about anything.   It's small, light weight, very versitle and easy to use. It comes with a good ammount of accessories.  I have nothing really negative to say about this product. It's real good and I'm happy with it except i'd go for the 1 gig @ 200 instead of 512 @ 150.   Cheers! ;D

<Title>Solid
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The YP-T7X is a solid mp3 player.  The FM radio works well.  It is a good device to use while running.  I also have a Creative Zen and the two devices are complimentary (one for storing all of my music and one for use while running).

<Title>Samsung hit the nail right on the head
<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is perfect for my everyday transit to school of about 1 hour everyday. The bass response and high frequencies are noted very well on the included ear buds. The lanyard and hip clip are well constructed too.  My brother has dealt with his apple, and I do feel sorry for him. He had a 512MB iPod shuffle. It worked fine for a long while until he tried to remove one song and iTunes ended up removing all of the songs. The software is much simpler on the Samsung, because if you are running Windows XP no additional software is needed. All you do is drag from anywhere in your computer and drop into your removable drive folder where the Samsung USB is attatched.  I have dropped it onto cement on several occasions and have found no damage to the case or the storage capabilities. I have also placed text and images and they are easily viewed on the high resolution screen.   And at a price of only $150 its a mini-mini-iPod with built in practicality, or you can think of it as a mass storage USB device with a headphone jack, either way you still get a great working device.

<Title>Beware!  Early release batch defective!
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this unit in late February and within a week it malfunctioned.  The unit turned on with the "locked" displayed eventhough the "Hold" switch was in the OFF position.  I couldn't do anything with it other than turning the unit ON and OFF.  When I called Samsung tech support, it took them less than thirty seconds to diagnose the problem; they already knew about the defect.  My conversation with them gave me the impression there were many returns from the early releases of this unit.  The unit I purchased was manufactured in January 2005.  (For those considering purchasing this unit, note that there's no way to find out the manufacturing date until after you open the package.  The date stamp is on the back of the unit.)  I sent my defective player in for repair and received a refurbished one back.  I was dissappointed at paying so much for a new unit only to end up with a refurbished one.  The other reviewers were lucky to get a working player; I was not so lucky.

<Title>excellent sound and only a few quirks
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is the first MP3 player that I actually like.  It has a customizable equalizer to get the sound to sound just the way you want it.  Very very few MP3 players let you do that and it is something I believe should be in all MP3 players. The player is small but has a bright color display.  The player doesn't require any additonal software in Windows XP.  You simply drag files between your computer and the player in "My Computer": it is that easy.  There are a few quirks.  The little stick that you use to move around the interface is a little too loose.  You can move it up and the player will think you mived it left or right.  Similarly, manuvering around the interface with the little stick takes a few tries before you figure out how to find the options you want.  But these are minor complaints for such a feature-rich and small mp3 player.  Battery life is OK at max 10 hours.

<Title>I loved it for the 3 hours it worked
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A disclaimer:  The sheer gloriousness of this little player earned it the two stars, which is remarkable considering it broke.  I can't imagine how popular this is gonna be if they ever get it right.  This is a gorgeous little player, easy interface, great color screen, rich beautiful sound and works with Windows media player.  HOWEVER, I got the first one this past Saturday, used it for 2 hours....Saturday night it just wouldn't work at all, no matter what I did it wouldn't turn on, I did everything the troubleshooting guide told me to.  So I returned it Sunday morning for a new one.  It worked beautifully Sunday evening...played it for about an hour.  Monday evening, I left the house, got in the car, tried to turn it on..same problem, just refused to turn on no matter what I did.  It's really a shame too, because I just adored it, it was so cute and sounded excellent, and I got photos on it and everything, and it was the size of a zippo lighter.  For 3 hours, I was the envy of my friends.  I returned it Monday for the clunkier but seemingly more solid Zen Micro, and so far so good, but after reading some reviews I'm not too hopeful about that one either.  If this one messes up, I just may scrap the whole idea of ultra-portable music and stick to cd's.  I would suggest you wait two years to buy an mp3 player...wait till they've figured out how to make ones that work right.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player last week and frankly I love each and every aspect of this player. It's amazing how so many features have been packed on to this small device - from a voice recorder to picture viewer - this mp3 player is truly an Ipod killer.

<Title>Coolest MP3 player around!
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player ROCKS! And here's why: 1. It sounds great 2. It's the size of a book of matches and weighs like one ounce 3. It has a color screen 4. Has rechargeable battery 5. Is simple to use and navigate once you are familiar with it 6. No moving parts, it's a flash drive 7. No extra software required, just drag & drop in Windows, or Media Player. 8. It has a FM radio built in. The only downside to this player is the crappy headphones included. I bought some better headphones, and with the included belt clip, I'm all set for the gym. Ipod Shuffle eat your heart out.

<Title>A decent portable music player
<Date>Wed Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Positives: 1.The sound is great. 2.It's really small. 3.It is easy to transfer music to and from the device. 4.Color screen is amusing.  Negatives: 1.Unit controls are lacking.  Navigation through the unit's features and songs is tedious. 2.Short battery life. 3.Screen is too small. 4.Bundled software is not very useful.  Additional notes: The samsung yp-t7x is easily the best portable music player I've ever owned.  However, the only other portable music players I've used were CD players, cassette walkmans, and a minidisc player. I don't know how it stacks up against other MP3 players.

<Title>Great interface & features - ipod is jealous
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I highly recommend this player. I did alot of research on the web and this had everything I wanted. A radio, recording, color screen and easy drag and drop song loading. It works seamlessly with windows media player at home and at work I trasfer files onto it from a mac with no problems. I have not a single regret purchasing this product. It holds enough songs, the interface is so simple that I can switch songs and turn up the volume without pulling it out, and so far it is quite durable. I think if I bought an ipod I would have deeply regreted it. Everyone I know that has had an ipod has sent it in for expensive servicing several times and the price for an ipod is too much for no radio, no line in and being locked into using itunes suxxx. Get this player, you won't regret it!
