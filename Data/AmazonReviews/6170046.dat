<Title>Jusr Right for the Gym
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This my fourth Ipod, and second shuffle.  I bought this specifically for when I am at the gym or working in the yard.  THe clip is substantial, and will endure mistreatment.   And the price was reasonable.  I find the sound quality just fine (though I use third party headphones), and it saves some wear and tear on my 20 gig and 30 gig Ipods.   No install disk either-- if you have Itunes already, just plug and play. [...]

<Title>Perfectly small and useful, Clip is fantastic
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle this week and it is even smaller than I imagined it would be. Some of the reviews just go to show that some people will complain about anything, this item is awesome if you use this for what it's meant for, that is taking a random batch of 240 of songs from your music library and taking it for a run or bringing it anywhere for some music on the go, there is no problem with it whatsoever. Personally I think adding a screen would have ruined it, it's perfect the way it is. Sound quality is great, the battery life is good and the usb dock is pretty cool. For 79 bucks go get one, you won't regret it.

<Title>Comes w/janky old earbuds, otherwise LOVE
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Shuffle straight from the manufacturer today (took 3 days to arrive to DC from China, according to FedEx tracking).  I had to update my iTunes to 7.0.2, but other than that, the device was ready to sync right out of the box.  The packaging is exactly the same as the Nano, very efficiently packed, and no install CD.    I'd love to give it 5 stars like I gave the Nano, but my one complaint is big enough to deduct a star: The Shuffle does NOT come with the new, updated earbuds that come with the Nano, but instead ships with the old, round ones with the foam covers.  I mean, really Steve Jobs, how bougie is that?  Hopefully, this will change with later orders.  Personally, I much prefer the updated earbuds and never got a good fit with the old earbuds. I remain mystified by the functionality of those foam covers.  Also, I feel it's a bit dodgy for Apple to sell the new ones for $29 separately and include them as a pack-in for every other new iPod model except the Shuffle.  Granted, the Shuffle is the cheapest, but previously, all the iPod models came with the same janky earbuds standard, so to unload the leftovers on the Shuffles now hardly seems fair.  All that said, the Shuffle itself is fantastic.  Sound quality is great.  The USB-integrated docking system is genius, no more USB nubbin coming out of the player, though you CAN still drag and drop files onto the iPod on your desktop -- just like a thumb drive or regular iPod.    Finally, the design is super!  It looks a lot like the radio remote, a little wider and thicker, the major difference being that the Shuffle is cased in alumninum vs plastic.  Its clip is also made of aluminum and non-removable.  The Shuffle has a little light on the top that flashes either green, yellow or red and in various patterns, depending on whatever Morse code thing it's trying to tell you.  Like everything Mac, it's very intuitive, and you'll figure it out quick.  I was never into the old Shuffle, but I really like the look and feel of this one.  It's tiny enough to take anywhere, but solid enough to throw in your purse (or for guys, pocket/European carry-all) without being afraid it will break.  The clip is a big design improvement as well.  As much as I love Mac, iPod necklaces don't really go with everything.

<Title>Definitely Portable!
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my 2nd generation iPod Shuffle from Apple's website about a couple days ago. I love the weight of the iPod because you don't even feel like you're wearing it. The size is also nice because it's not bulky at all. The clip is great because then you don't need to buy any special armbands or lanyards in order to keep it attached to you while you're out and about. Also, when adding songs to the iPod, you can have iTunes convert the songs to AAC format @ 128kbps automatically to make the file smaller and still have the great quality sound. This is an awesome product and is my favorite iPod aside from the video of course. The only draw back is the possiblity of losing or misplacing it. For under $80 this is a very nice MP3 player and would make a great x-mas present.

<Title>Incredible and Great Value
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best iPod yet. So small most earphones weigh more. No need to spend tons of money on cases and armbands because it clips anywhere. Perfect for the gym since most people dont need to pick and choose songs during a workout and you can rearrange songs on iTunes.

<Title>Form, meet function
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At a time when most portable electronic devices seem to be engaging in feature wars, it's truly refreshing to see Apple go back to the basics.  With this redesigned Shuffle, they've remembered what's important: it's portable, and it plays music.  The design of the new iPod Shuffle is elegant in its simplicity. The player itself is tiny and sleek, with a simple 5-button arrangement to start and stop playback, skip backwards and forwards, and adjust volume.  The buttons are so intuitive that they can be manipulated without even having to look at them, a feat most portable music players can't seem to manage. Toggle switches for power on and off, and selecting sequential playback or "shuffle" mode (random playback order) complete this tiny package.  A small docking station is included as well, which allows you to hook up the Shuffle to a computer via a USB connection, to transfer music files and to recharge the player itself.  As to function, the new iPod Shuffle plays music, and lots of it. With about 1 GB of storage capacity, you can usually get around 200 songs on it easily.  There is no visual display to show song information, no capacity for video playback, and no options to plug in the various toys and accessories that other iPods can do.  But here's the thing: none of that is needed.  The new iPod Shuffle is a portable music player, and it accomplishes that goal handily.  The earbud headphones that come with it aren't the greatest, but you can use whatever headphones you want instead. Playback of classical, rock, or electronic music all sound good, and that's all I really care about in a portable music player.  The new iPod Shuffle looks great and sounds great.  It merges simple, elegant design with a good dose of technical wizardry to create the perfect blend of form and function.  If you're looking for a portable music player that just plays music and gives you a compact package, this may well be your best bet.

<Title>I can't believe i bought an ipod...
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked mine up at the apple store yesterday, and i am amazed by its simplicity and portability.  This is the first time EVER i have bought an ipod, and i am quite pleased with it.  I still miss the flexibility of other non ipod players, but i was amazed at how simple itunes was to use, and it was not as restrictive as i thought.  the sound quality from this thing was great, but still ins't par with the bigger non-mp3 players, but it was better than my small creative flash player   The clip was a great feature to have, this thing can go anywhere with me, and is sure easier than carring my old 20 gig mp3 brick around.

<Content>This is the second iPod product in our house.  I wanted something small that I could leave plugged into my car's audio system.  As is customary with Apple, the new shuffle is made of high quality aluminum and easy to use.  The sound is great and the price can't be beat!

<Title>Warning: Old style headphones
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle from apple store. It's sleek design is really cool and the sound is great. I love the ability of the clip on for exercise. The only draw back is that apple stiffs you when it comes to the headphones. Steve Jobs in his last keynote address toots about the new sleeker headphones. Apparently you have to buy the nano or regular ipod to get them. Its my first time having apple being cheap with headphones that can't cost them more than a few bucks to make. I'm sure I won't be the only shuffle buyer to register this complaint. Other than that it's a cool product.

<Title>like it, not impressed with longevity
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a 1st generation iPod shuffle and loved it, but it stopped working after 1 year -- wouldn't charge.  Sending it back to Apple to get fixed wasn't worth the inconvenience or the price tag -- especially not with the 2nd gen shuffle coming out.  Instead, got a new 2nd gen shuffle.  Have had it for a year, and same thing has now happened -- won't charge, and problem is not the cable/charger.  Once again, the inconvenience and price of getting it fixed makes it easier to just buy a new one.  I love the shuffle for what it is -- easy to take on runs, love the clip, ease of use, etc.  But am I really going to have to fork out $75 every year for a new one because of quality issues?  Maybe I've just been unlucky, but in my experience, this doesn't live up to Apple's advertised standards.

<Title>Great for running
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love that the shuffle is SO small.  You can clip it on and not even feel that it is there, much different than my other MP3 player.  As a runner, it's great that it doesn't seem to bounce around-- you can't even feel it's there.  Also the lack of a screen is great for exercise, because I never get to look at the screen anyway, and it makes more room for larger controls.  It's very easy to feel for the control you want without having to look at it, which can be very important when running.

<Content>At first I was looking at other mp3 players for the gym that had a screen but I decided this would be better...and it is! I love that it clips to my shirt, instead of some bulky armband, and I can just push the button to scroll through the songs without looking. Very simple, perfect for when I'm on the go or at the gym.
