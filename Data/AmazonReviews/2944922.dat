<Content>This sounds like a great offer.  I purchased 3 of these, one for my boyfriend's birthday, one for me when I heard how great his sounded and one for when I had to send my boyfriends back due to problems with the sound and the radio kept disappearing and use the warranty to get another one.   Within a month there were problems with both players. Mine would only play thru one earpiece and then none unless you held the connection piece in the whole time listening, and my boyfriends's started having a tinnie/tinny sound to the music and the radio selection would disappear with the first, the second one did the same as the first and then his earpiece gave out too.  Now this was something that is internal so purchasing another set of headphones would not help.   Also the manual is hard to understand and no company information was provided.  Basically I am out of $$ since we both ended up getting better player for Xmas.  Thank Goodness. Also the only game on it was soduku and it hardly ever worked.

<Content>I bought my IQ Sound on eBay about 3 months ago. These cost less than ANY iPod, have an excellent voice recording feature (great for anything from recalling where you parked the car to classroom lectures, or even Ghost Hunting for a few hours!)  I admit the directions on these are absolutely horribly translated from Chinese to English, and are pretty worthless, but this is a great tool/toy!  I used mine for watching videos, listening to music (MP3 and radio), recording (and the quality is surprisingly excellent!), sharing pictures (portable .jpg picture frame that changes pictures and you set the time), reading books in .txt format (There are a lot of websites to download tons of free books from for these as well - some are done by libraries and are books you might not get to read anywhere else, such as the original poem of Beowulf and other kewl classics!)   When I first got mine, it had a problem with the enclosed USB cable, but the seller sent me one immediately, and no problems since!  The recording quality is amazingly good! I recorded about 2 hours of stuff and the quality is awesome!  The price is certainly right, although it IS made in China, so the Quality Control (QC) probably isn't the best, but then I heard the newer iPods are being made there too, and the iPods had MAJOR problems when they first came out anyhow, so I don't see much difference except the price! :) The ONLY thing I haven't figured out on it is how to set the clock/date! I haven't really looked around or asked the seller how to set it though... I have a clock on my cell phone so no need for it, although it would be nice to get the date/time correct for the recordings!  Large format pictures load slowly, as they do on iPods, so if sharing pictures, best to downsize them first!  GREAT price for a nice little movie, MP3, FM radio, sound recorder & playback, computer storage (USB) device, .txt eBook reader, clock, games (I haven't really played the games much, but understand there are a lot of freebies - similar to a cell phone!)  Everything a comparable iPod can do AND MUCH MORE for about 1/4th the price AND you don't have to use iTunes (that has messed up more computers than I can shake a stick at!) I find it better to buy the CDs, then convert them to MP3 format, then load them on my IQ Sound!  This player comes with software to convert your files to fit the screen (although some videos I've taken will kinda fold a line at the bottom of the screen if the video is a non-compatible size, but then iPods do this as well, so just part of a portable thing... some subtitled stuff I've gotten is frustrating, as the subtitle at the bottom is not readable, but then they aren't on an iPod either,so just something to keep in mind.. IF you are adding subtitles for deaf or other languages, then good to put them at the top BEFORE converting your files to the format the player uses!  ALSO, since the directions are so sucky in English, when I transfer my files into this thing, I simply found which files were in which folders (It has demos when you get it) and I drop and drag, which seems to work better AND much faster than the software!  Great little toy, and if you loose it, drop it a million times, or someone steals it, it's not hundreds of $$$ you've spent! AND the extra features that are not on iPods I find I use a LOT!  I bought this as iPods are *really* overpriced, and didn't think much about the extra features, but am glad I bought this instead of an iPod! The book reader & movie player are great when you are somewhere you have to wait.  The only thing I think that could use some improvement is the way the menus go (I was used to a slide of a finger to adjust the volume, etc. on a friends' iPod. - on these, it is menu-driven with clicks and click and holds instead, but once you get used to it, it's awesome!)  Glad I save the $160 & got this instead of an iPod MP3 only player with MAYBE FM radio that doesn't do half of what this does!!!  I take mine with me just about everywhere & can even plug it into my car stereo and play what I want on it through a tape to CD-player converter I already had for my older car! :)  VERY kewl gift!
