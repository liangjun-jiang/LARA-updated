<Content>This little gadget looked great.  It had all the features I wanted. But those good looks were only on paper. I use these big flash drives to carry document files and music, as well as record lectures and discussions. Of the 5 computers I use regularly, this drive was only recognized by one of them. I had to send it back as unusable and got the GlorEE 1gb drive instead (at half the cost).  These drives are made in Germany, so when I emailed the service department for assistance in getting it to work with my other 4 computers, it took 2 weeks to get a response and then it was in German.  Not helpful at all.  So, save the bucks and get the less expensive model, which has all the same features, but is a shade bigger and uses a AA battery instead of a AAA.  
<Overall>2
