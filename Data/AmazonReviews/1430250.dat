<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great mp3 player to start out with.  It's just enough for me anyway, i don't have alot of music to put on an mp3 player so this is great.    It's good on batteries and works great.  The buttons are touchy but other then that it's a great little mp3 player

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player!
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received this in the mail today, and had added mp3's and was listening to them within minutes!  Excellent quality, sturdy feel to it!  The earbuds it comes with aren't the best, but that's to be expected and has been stated in previous reviews.  I am very pleased with this mp3 player, and would definitely recommend it to my friends!  For the price you just can't go wrong...I did research on every possible mp3 player out there before buying this one, and am very glad I got the Nextar.  You don't even have to install the software cd it comes with if you've got anything above Windows 93....you just plug the USB in, a window pops up with the files and then you just drag the mp3 files from your computer into the mp3 player folder.  It's that easy!

<Title>mp3 rev.
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player for my son. It seems to be a pretty good buy.  It just needs to have some kind of way to attach to something.  Other then that I would say that it's a good buy for the price.

<Title>disatisfied
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I recieved the product promptly, but the compartment for the battery was not easy to figure out how to get off. THen, I have two of them for both of my kids.  One of them constantly shorts out and the other one occasionally does so.  It has been very frustrating for me and my boys.

<Title>Upset
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The mp3 player I purchased work perfect for three weeks, since then every time it is touched more moved it shuts itself off. When you turn it back on, it goes back to the song that was playing when you first turned it on. It was never dropped or mishandled, so this purchase was very dissapointing.

<Title>A good starter mp3 player
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice little inexpensive mp3 player.  It holds quite a few songs and is easy to use.  There are not a lot of options, but is a good starter mp3 player or for a younger music fan.  I was happy with what I got, but will eventually upgrade, passing this one on to my kids.

<Title>Bad Design
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like other reviewers, I found this item frustrating.  The item would turn itself off, and then hardly turn itself on.  I thought that maybe something was the matter with the battery that it came with, but when I changed the battery, it wouldn't work at all!  After fiddling with it awhile, I found that the battery doesn't fit snugly in the battery compartment, so it comes loose and turns off.  I liked the price, and the fact that it was a good started player for my younger children, but it didn't even hold up under normal usage.

<Title>An MP3 player that is capable, slim, easy and cool looking.
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I must admit, I am one of those people who just hates the iPod. Or the iPud as I call it. Or maybe the iSpud! Its encryption of your files just is more trouble than its worth, and its wayyyyyy overpriced.  But enough about the competition. This MP3 player is magnificent for someone who doesn't want alot of fancy doo-dads and gadgets, like album pictures, or randomized playlists, or games. This is just an MP3 player, that plays...MP3's. And WMA's, and WAVs as well. It plays them, is easy to use, and fits in the smallest of pockets. Best of all, I use it as a flash drive as well, due to its built in USB connection and Flash memory. I carry around all kinds of files on here, along with my music. A great buy for a simple, fun MP3 player.

<Title>Intermittent power connections _et al._ doom MP3 utility
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With different AAA batteries, and both before and after "stretching" contact springs (I was getting desperate), this seems to intermittently lose power.  When it's restored (almost always by just reseating the battery) it's lost its place to one degree or another, restarts at the beginning of the current track, or perhaps in the middle of the previous one, occasionally at the beginning of all tracks.  As if this wasn't bad enough, the backlighting is uneven, the contrast low, and the font too small for older eyes, so it's difficult to tell what's playing anyway.  The big power / play / pause button is indeed too easy to depress.  The small skip-to-next/previous-section lever (above the power button, on the side, barely visible as a tiny sphere in some photos) is too easily tripped (and there's no way to fast-forward or fast-reverse through a track).  Workmanship in the volume control is poor; the "-" lower-volume function requires much more force than the "+" raise-volume.  The earphone jack was intermittent with one set of headphones.  And there's no clip to carry it (depending it from the headphones puts all of its modest weight on the earbuds is not cool, sticking it in a pocket risks toggling power or fast-forward buttons).  About the only neutral thing I can say about this is that now that I've retired it from MP3 usage, and removed its battery permanently, it works fine (so far anyway, but my faith in its quality is badly damaged) as a (too expensive for its 512MB) very very slow (even on USB 2.0) flash drive.  I heartily recommend AGAINST this product (and won't be buying Nextar again).

<Title>Not user friendly for such a simple product
<Date>Tue May 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It took a VERY long time to get music downloaded.  The instructions are not clear and music would not transfer.  When I finally got it loaded, I had difficulty getting it to play.  The directions are not good.  There are few buttons but I still had a hard time figuring it out.  I would not recommend this player even though it is working ok now.

<Title>It's OK for an 8 year old
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my [...]son, and for the price it's not too bad.   It's very easy to use. You just plug it into the USB port on you PC and copy the songs over. You can use either Windows Explorer or MP3 player software. I used MusicMatch. There is no cable to loose.  The controls are simple to use as well. My son has no problems using it.  The only thing I didn't like about it is the headphones. They are very cheap and have terrible sound quality. I had an old pair laying around the house and used them, and it sounded just fine.  I wouldn't have purchased this for myself, but as an inexpensive player for a child, it's not bad.

<Title>not bad for the price 
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is not a bad little player for the price if you have even a little bit of tech know how and are on a budget and hate Ipods and the like the even sell them at Dollar General now for $18 but alot of package for such a small little thing lmao. it was easy to set up the driver that comes with the player and then get songs onto the player was no prob just drag and drop files or folders as you would any other type of flash drive just make sure you make and modify your folders and files on your computer and not once there on the player the ear buds are not too bad and i am part def in both ears to boot and yes rechargable batteries are a must and with something this cheap there are bound to be a few defective ones and what do we want for chinese companies these days with all the recalls lol over all not a bad player for the money although the controlls could be better but then again for the price what do you want people a gold plated scan disk player or ipod sheesh

<Title>Little mp3 player is great for my kids.
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This mp3 has worked out great for my son.  He just wants to listen to "his" music.  With this mp3 he can do that without interrupting the rest of the family.  The player is not so good if you want to find one specific song or artist to play.
