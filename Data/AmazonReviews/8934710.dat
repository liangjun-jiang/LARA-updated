<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got one for my wife for Christmas.  It is incredibly light and easy to operate.  Also easy to load songs on it using pretty much any software or just dragging and dropping in windows explorer.  Less than half the price of my daughter's IPOD.  Personally, I hate the apple software and don't find the IPOD as easy to operate as the Creative Zen Stone or my super cheap RCA MP3 player.

<Title>Zen Stone Plus is good for the money 
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zen Stone Plus does all that it says in the product description.  However, there are drawbacks to this device that I enjoyed with the shuffle.  The first is that it doesn't come with a built in clip, which is a constant struggle in that I only use it for workouts.  Having to buy a separate clip that does not firmly attach to the unit is a daily annoyance.  I happened to purchase the sport pack which included the skin, clip, and armband.  I haven't found a good use for the armband.  The skin covers the screen making it hard to navigate. The battery life seems to be extremely short and it since it has multiple functions, this means charging it after every workout (4 times a week).   Sometimes the on/off function is a challenge in that you have to hold the button for at least 5 seconds. The other drawback is the short USB cord - 5 inches long. I do enjoy the portability of the device and the sound is good.  For the money and storage size, this does offer more than the shuffle including a radio, timer, stopwatch, recorder, music, and screen.  But if you want more from a smaller device, I would recommend the Zen V or Zen V plus, which is in the same price range with a bigger color screen. My overall rating is 3.5 out of 5 stars.

<Title>Pocket-size Powerhouse
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit is half the size of a credit card.  As with most Creative products, the quality is outstanding.  If you don't need the videos and all that other stuff, this will serve you very well.  Two gigs will hold a surprising amount of music.  Recommend buying the keyring holder to simplify keeping from dropping.

<Title>Just what my wife wanted for walking.
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This clearly satisfied her request for something "small, simple to use and has a radio".    It works and sounds fine but we need to work out one bug - its charge indicator light does not flash when it becomes fully charged which is supposed to be in under 4 hours from a USB port; after eight hours I gave up on it figuring that it is likely fully charged after that long.  One thing I think Creative should have included was a clip to attach the unit to your clothing. Yes it easily fits in any pocket but some people I know wear clothes with no pockets when they go walking.   One other thing, my wife's computer is still happily running Windows 98 and does everything she uses it for. However, this unit will not connect to 98.  With so many USB flash drives out there that work fine on a 98 machine would it have been all that much trouble for Creative to have included 98 connectivity?    Neither was a 'show stopper' though; it's a good purchase.

<Title>cute, but no cigar
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great looking device , but doesn't allow DRM type files to play. Also the shuffle "once" function doesn't work as advertised. You will hear songs played twice. For the money, go for the Zen V players. I have one of those and it works and sounds great.

<Title>This is sooo cool!
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little guy!  I had an ipod shuffle that just quit one day.  I was so angry because I had saved all the songs that I really loved on that little thing.  But I had given my boyfriend a Zen mp3 player and he really liked it, so I bought this Zen Stone!  It is so easy to use and upload songs...even the ones I thought I had lost with the ipod.  I have the cassette tape adapter (I had bought for the ipod) for my car and it works with my player and his, too.  I also have some little speakers (also purchased for the ipod) that work with the new Zen players.  I love this Stone...and I got the key chain cover forit.  That is a must since there is not a clip on the body of the player.  It clips onto my key chain and I can take it to class, or in the car, or where ever. AND It picks up radio stations!!!  I can also record leectures in classes.  This is a great little thing and I would highly reccomend it!

<Title>A nice thought of a player, but lousy battery life...
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I bought my Creative Zen Vision:M, I became a rabid Creative fan.  So when the Stone Plus came out, I was very excited.  This excitement has just become disappointment...  more on that later.  It's a nice looking product, and though it feels cheap, it's well-built.  Uploading songs is a snap, as easy as drag n drop.  With the armband, it's also a very nice workout companion, with good sound quality and easy operation from the arm.  Navigation on the device itself takes some getting used to but it's manageable.  I wish it were easier to bounce back and forth between the stopwatch and the music.  No big deals here.  ...  but the battery life sucks!  After two uses in the gym (like 3-4 hours?) the battery is dead!  Also, battery life is not well-preserved if the player is not used for a couple weeks.  Even if it was fully charged before, you'll find the batter dead in a matter of a couple of weeks, even with the unit shut off.  Perhaps I have a defective battery, but I've read other online reviews complaining about the battery life.  Anyway I'd take a look at the Sansa Clip player...  it's exactly the same size as the Creative Stone Plus, and clips on you just like the new iPod Shuffle...  only this one is better, with a nice color display, and excellent sound quality.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software + Nice extras like stopwatch function  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0857010-9622454">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Nice Product, Terrible Headphones
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased these for two of my children. For the price, I think they are a great value, but the earbuds must be upgraded. I have a pair of $8 Sony earbuds that sound much better than the garbage that comes standard with these. The sound levels all blended together, produced static, and sounded muffled. That rant out of the way, upgrade the headphones, and this is really a nice little mp3 player. The equalizer works nice and this unit really does produce nice sound. I like it better than the ipod shuffle just because of the equalizer settings and the LCD display that allows you to see what song is playing, artist info... That being said, the LCD display does drain battery life a little quicker.  I bought $10 headphones for these, and still came in $20 cheaper than the shuffle, and there are some pretty decent inexpensive earbuds out there. If the battery life was a bit longer, and they came with better earphones, I would have given this a full 5 stars. I am very happy, however, and my wife and I are considering picking one of these up for ourselves.

<Title>Inexpensive and Easy to Use!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my 7 yr old daughter for Christmas this year. She asked for an Ipod and I thought this was a better alternative than a pricey Apple Ipod with less storage capacity. I am so glad that I did! We got it out of the box plugged it into the PC USB port to charge and in a few hours my daughter was listening to music on her own MP3 player and extremely happy! I was very pleased with the ease of downloading software and the PC recognized it immediately and transferred over 80 songs in a matter of minutes. We were both ecstatic. I will probably be buying one for the rest of my family now that we know it is so easy to use and has great sound quality even with the cheaper earbuds. Overall I give it 5 stars!

<Title>Love It
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this as my little everyday and workout mp3 player because the other Creative Zen W that I have is not that great to carry around with. i use it every day.  Pros: It has great sound, doesn't even need an installation CD, just plug and drag and drop, much better than the Zen W. The battery life (10 hours) is sufficient. Very light and compact. Love the display. The volume is very loud on high much more than the Zen W.  Cons: little delay when clicking the buttons. I wish the pause button would be on the front as well and not on top, because it takes a while to find, when it is in the pocket. I don't like that I just got this for christmas and a week later they are coming out with the same model that has double the battery life and a speaker, which is what I would rather have for almost the same price.
