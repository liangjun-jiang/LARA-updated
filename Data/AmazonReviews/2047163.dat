<Title>Love it
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I am totally in love with this since giving up my old vision m which I also bought and loved from amazon but it weighed me down too much and in came the sleek and tiny Zen. Only one fault I see so far the SD card I thought I would be able to integrate the memory card music with the ones on my zen but alas not the case. Maybe Creative will fix that with firmware update along with the video scale size. Vision M could play practically all my XVid videos which were mostly scaled larger than what the zen is capable of 320:240.  Outside of those 2 things it is a good contender against the ipod unfortunately marketing and popularity overshadows this incredible company and its products. A fan of Creative products forever

<Title>Man, the battery
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Mom and Dad got me this for my birthday [upgrade from my Zen Micro 6gb) I've got to say I love this thing; it has great sound, plenty of room for what I use it for, it has a great screen and a lot of extra features.  BUT it loses two stars because,  1. Even though I charged it all the way then drained it all the way when I first got it (3 times) it still won't hold a charge longer than 5 hours with the screen on 10% brightness, and no more than 7 or so with the screen off (on hold) Even though, the creative site advertises 30 hours with the screen off [on hold] (I didn't expect to get that much time, but, I did expect at LEAST 15 hours or more (with the screen off)) 2. It will occasionally freeze while Syncing with Windows Media Player (latest version) or while charging (It has happened often enough for to have learned to carry a paper clip with me to hit the reset button on the bottom)   Other than this problem, this IS a great player.

<Title>Best mp3/video player out there ! ! !
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The music sounds great and the videos look amazing, the screen size is perfect.  Even the video converter is reasonably fast.  All in all a great product and will not leave you disappointed.  It is worth it to by the screen protector and case because the piano finish does scratch easily and the screen will smudge.

<Title>Best flash player on the market, great even for large music collections
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great choice for those people who previously limited their flash players to workout duty, or only holding a small piece of their large music collection and having to change the music on it every so often. With a 16GB capacity most people can fit their entire collection on here without difficulty, and even have room for some videos.  First impressions of this player are very good. It is extremely appealing to the eye, everyone who sees it will ask about it. It is about the size of a credit card, just thicker (less than 1/2inch). The front is a very glossy black plastic that looks great until you touch it, instantly covering it with fingerprints :) The back is a rough, cheaper feeling black plastic. Overall it has a nice solid weight and feel to it, but not very heavy. This will easily fit in a pocket.  The 2.5" screen is absolutely gorgeous. Very bright with vivid colors. The viewing angle is very good, two people can easily look at the screen at the same time while watching a movie for example. The menus are all nicely animated and intuitive to navigate. The icons and text are big clear and easy to read.  One of the big perks to having so much capacity is plenty of room for videos. This was one of the first things I've tested as it was a big reason for my purchase. First of all it DOES play Amazon Unbox videos perfectly. Transferring files was very easy (just a few clicks) and very quick. The quality of the video was great as well. The max size of videos is apparently 320x240, I have not been able to get it to play anything larger than that. If the video is smaller (for example widescreen) you have the option of playing it at the correct aspect ratio, or fill the screen (stretched out). I've gotten it to play videos encoded in Xvid and WMV format. Xvid files were encoded with AutoGK, and the WMV files were encoded with Arcsoft MediaConverter. If you synchronize with Windows Media Player, you can put in *almost any* video file and it will automatically convert the file into WMV format and then transfer to the player. How long it takes to convert depends on the type of video you're encoding, how big the file is and of course the speed of your computer.  Music sounds very good on this player, but please... get rid of the stock headphones they are horrible. Using a decent pair of headphones makes a HUGE difference. The EQ options are OK, there are about a half dozen presets and a customizable EQ. The "Bass Boost" option just made it worse in my opinion, it just distorted the sound. Otherwise it is a very even and balanced sound, very similar to the Vision:M.   The FM radio has a whopping 32 presets and the reception is pretty good. Strong stations are in stereo, weaker ones come in mono. I haven't had a chance to test out the built-in mic.  I easily transferred music and playlists onto this player from Windows Media Player and MediaMonkey, as well as protected music (WMA) from Napster. Everything was very easy, usually just dragging and dropping. The speed of transfer is probably the fastest I've seen. I've used this player on XP Home and on Vista Premium 64-bit.  Regarding the SD cards. I think its only a slight inconvenience that the memory card media isn't directly integrated with the other content. Meaning if you have videos on the SD card you don't go to the "Video" menu where all the other videos are, you have to access them through the "Memory Card" menu. Once there, you browse through the file structure like normal. If you organize the content smartly on your cards you should have no problem. And really its a small price to pay for that feature. Currently SDHC cards are up to 16GB in capacity, meaning you could double the capacity and carry around 32GB worth of content in your pocket. Amazing. I tested a Kingston 512MB SD Card and a Kingston 2GB microSD card (with adapter of course) and they were recognized and played the content without difficulty.  A quick note about the firmware. Mine came with 1.10.05. When my player turns off, it really turns off. With newer firmwares when it turns off it goes into a sleep mode for a while before it finally turns all the way off. What that means is with the older firmware each time you turn it on it has to "boot" all over again, whereas with the newer firmware you get an "instant-on" at the expense of slightly reduced battery life (since it is asleep and not off). Something to consider before you decide to upgrade the firmware.

<Title>Faulty and had to send back
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my teenage son for Christmas. The one we received had a faulty processor or something and would not run videos properly (would skip and stall) and the videos would have poor audio.  I give 2 thumbs up to Amazon for the quick processing of the return.  The conversion time for putting the videos in Zen format was quite long too.  I replaced the returned Zen with a 30G Zune for my son (again from Amazon) and he's a happy camper showing me "See, this is how a processor SHOULD run a video!" for the ones the Zen had trouble playing.  Positives: small size, the size is much better than my bulky 30G Ipod. Is ours was defective and my son plays mostly videos with a few songs, I don't know how it'll fare for just music, but the size is a big plus.  Negatives: was how it ran my son's videos.

<Title>If you buy it you will have to deal with...
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST. The battery is the worst. Don't expect much from the battery. It last for me 1 or 2 days on my way to and back from school. It can be half when you turn it off and you turn it on the next day and it wont turn on because the battery is death. You need to constantly charge it because if you forget trust me you wont have battery the next day. I think my old played was way much better on that part. Because of this the clock will never be right and I am tired of changing the time every the time. The battery wont last for a long trip.   SECOND. The videos are very fast to transfer. But before the transfer occurs you have to convert the video to a different format and it takes FOREVERRRRRRRR to convert. Pictures and music are relatively fast. Videos are not excellent. The quality is good but the sound gets disturbed few times on different videos at the exact second of the video every the time you play it. Not on all videos but some and I don't want to re transfer it again after waiting so long for the format conversion. ANNOYING...    THIRD. The screen scratches so easily.    FORTH. The headphones it comes with are the worst and so big that hurts your ear.   FIFTH. Expensive. I made a comparison between this and the Ipod Touch and  found that the Ipod touch is so much cheaper for what it can do. The Zen is relatively expensive compared to other players.   SIX. It Freezes sometimes, not to much but it happens and you have to reset it and find a paper clip to push the button. If you cant find one then wait until you get one and by the way, once it freezes you can not turn it off so the weak battery will die.   Besides my six complaints is a good player. the battery is the worst trust me I have to say it again.

<Title>So far so good!
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just rec'd my zen last week and so far it has done all that I expected it to do. I have played music, videos and pictures on it and the sound quality (even with the cheap earphones) is great.  I didn't rate it a 5 star only because I haven't used all the functions yet and because I have not had it very long.  I did update the firmware and it worked fine.  Though, I did notice when I did it, that there are 2 versions of one of the software - one is for US and the other that is marked (Europe Only).  I am guessing that if someone downloads and tries to install both versions there may be an issue (this may be the reason for some of the zen's freezing after updating), so make sure you download & install the correct version based on your location.

<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well - the theory is great, the practice is not.  My Zen arrived "Dead on Arrival."  Creative suggested I send it back to Amazon.  The only saving grace of this entire experience was Creative's telephone support (free for 60 days) and Amazon's easy returns.  Someone explain that to my daughter on her birthday today. . .

<Title>Nice piece, but there are some issues
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player beats the crap out of ipod. It has FM radio, Microphone, SDHC card slot, plays itunes files, no need to have special software though it does have its own, and it costs less than a comparable ipod, not that there is one. I highly recommond this to everybody looking to purchase an mp3 player. There are two issues that I have come across and that is use on multiple computers, it give it a problem and it causes it to crash while plugged in. The other issue is that when I first got this it was crashing rondomly for a little while, just freeze up and I would have to reset. Not a problem unless you are driving or cannot find a staple to bend and use. It will do this freeze thing with video and music playback. Special with video playback is this stalling thing that it does, it will stop and have to be fast forwaded one second, as if it lost tracking. These issues have gone away after I stopped using multiple computers.

<Content>An excellent MP3 player.  I dropped my Zen Micro, and after looking at Creative's offerings, decided to go with the Zen.  Sound quality is excellent, ease of operation is the same as will the Zen Micro (very straightforward), and I like the big screen.  Battery life does not seem to be as long as advertised, but likely because I am not dimming the screen.  A nice MP3 player.

<Title>Great player, but has flaws...
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen 16 GB player after trying out many different players(including iPod and Zune).  I owned a Creative Zen Micro 6GB for 3 years, and it was very basic, but it did the job, until I dropped it!  Rather than send it back to Creative to get it repaired, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I read reviews about the Zen 16gb, and I was impressed with the amount of memory for the price, the ability to expand the memory(more on this later), and the different file types that it supports.  So it arrives and everything seems great, because Creative knows how to make a great player.  The players exterior does have a major flaw, the screen.  It's so sensitive to scratches that it must be made out of the cheapest plastic possible.  I have never seen a screen get so scratched up just from storing it in a pocket!  So I wish I would have purchased the screen protector(even though I think it's ludicrous to pay 10 dollars for something that Creative should have addressed in the first place), or some sort of case.  I KNOW that other makers(Apple/Microsoft) have much better screens on their mp3 players, so I don't understand why Creative went the cheapo route!  Another issue is the expandable port.  You are able to add more memory with SD cards, which are as big as 32gb, these days.  This was very exciting to me, even though the memory from the card doesn't integrate with the memory in the player.  After I bought the player, I was reading reviews of other players, and apparently one of the newer Sansa players also has a SD card slot, but it DOES integrate the card with the player's memory! Doh! Had I known this prior, I would have definitely bought a Sansa player, rather than Creative.  Creative should have addressed this problem before they released it, as well!  Other than those problems, I love my mp3 player.  It's small and light, and I like what it brings to the table, overall.

<Title>Slick Little Player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very slick little player. It is very small and light, not much bigger than a credit card. It uses flash memory instead of a hard drive, which eliminates many problems I have had on previous players. I've only had to reset the player once. Battery life is very good. I have no idea whether it meets the battery life claims of the manufacturer, but it can be used extensively for at least two days without needing a charge. Transfer of files into the player is simple and can be accomplished using the mfr. software, Windows Media Player, or by dragging and dropping in Windows Explorer. I have tried all three and all work easily. Transfer is fast also. The quality and clarity of the screen is excellent. I have not put on any movies or other video because of a lack of interest in such usage, but photos look very good. The 16 gig capacity is good, and the SD card slot allows more storage. The only difficulty is that you must access SD card storage through the memory card menu instead of the music menu, which restricts your usage of those items somewhat. Navigation is also easy. I have read that some prefer the touch pad on the Zen Vision M, but I used it on my son's unit and hated it, even on low sensitivity. I prefer the one on this unit. I have had no problems at all with the player. My disabled son used it a great deal while his player was being repaired and he was unable to kill it. He has killed 8 iPods, 4 Dells and 1 Creative, so this is a very good durability sign. In fact,our experience with Creative is stellar. This is a very nice, high quality player at a very appealing price. I highly recommend this unit.

<Title>16gb works for me!!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my 16gb for about a month now. I use a Toshiba laptop running Windows Vista and haven't had any problems at all. I did update the firmware as suggested by Zen. My only complaint was the battery life. What took me awhile to find out about was the battery saving feature. I play it at work on random play all day. I was getting about 11.5 hours with the screen turned on. I found out that if you put the player on hold the screen will disappear and save battery life. After that I now average 18 hours between charges which is reasonable. I think one of the main problems is the lack of a good manual which should be included in the box. This would assist in the setup of your new player. I urge Creative to invest the extra quarter in the manual which would probably eliminate many of the problems listed in all the reviews. You shouldn't have to spend hours on the internet to get it up and running. Overall I rate it as an excellent player. Use a Palm screen protector cut to size to protect the screen. Hope you enjoy your new ZEN, I do!

<Title>Great player, my second Zen
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second Zen purchase.  I use Napster To Go, and the Zen is the best player in my opinion for that service.  My first player was a Zen Micro 4GB purchased about 3 years ago.  Both have performed superbly.  The new 16GB Zen is awesome.  The screen is so clear it's scary.  I really like the player too.  It has a huge capacity, great battery life, and another plus is that it charges off the same charger as my Moto Razr phone (they both charge with mini-USB).  The only thing I don't like about it is that the screen gets fingerprints on it often, but it's nothing that can't be overcome.  Also, the battery cannot be removed, so if the battery fails later on, I guess I'd need to buy a whole new player.  So, in short, I love the new Zen.  Its the perfect player for my needs, and the 16GB capacity lets me put all my favorite tracks on there with room left over.

<Title>Nice player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use Windows 2000, and that operating system is not supported whatsoever by this product.  You MUST HAVE XP or VISTA to make any practical use of this product!  Perhaps there is a statement to this effect somewhere in the product description, but I didn't see it and I was a bit bugged by the revelation.  I plan to install a second hard drive in my computer and load XP on it just so I can use my ZEN.  I have loaded many MP3s on my ZEN using a friend's computer and this thing works great.  The sound is much improved by getting some better earphones for it.  I bought some Creative EP-630 earphones and I think these are an excellent choice.  Considering that you can spend $300 for earphones if you want to, the EP-630s are an excellent bargain.  If you want to get a leather case for your ZEN, be sure to consider the one from PCMICROSTORE.  Amazon goofed (I think) by putting this case in the "Apparel" catagory.  All of the other ZEN accessories are listed under "electronics" and it took a little effort to find this case/accessory kit.  Check out my review of this product if you're interested.  I highly recommend it if you're a leather-case person.  Getting back to the ZEN, the functionality is virtually identical to an iPod, and there is no difference in the sound quality if you use the same data rate and earphones.  That little wheel gadget on the iPod is very nice and is the only reason I can think of to buy one instead of a ZEN.  The ZEN will not destroy the files on its host computer like an iPod will if you're not careful.  That alone is reason enough to choose just about any mp3 player over an iPod in my opinion, but most people buy whatever their TV tells them to.  The ZEN is very flexible in terms of its storage and retrieval options, and I found it very intuitive and easy to use.  The display is large and bright enough, and the buttons are spaced conveniently and are large enough for my chubby fingers.  One of those wheel things would be a big improvement, but apparently those are proprietary to Apple products.  That's too bad.  As far as I can tell so far, the ZEN is functionally equivilent to an iPod nano, sounds every bit as good, is considerably less expensive, and is more "open" in terms of available accessories and media compatibility.  If you're trying to choose between a ZEN or an iPod, that decision was an easy one for me.    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110O5UY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">PCMICROSTORE Brand Creative Lab Zen Small Wonder 4gb 8gb 16gb Premium Leather Case Cover with Video Stand and Swivel Belt Clip - Bundle with 12v Rapid Premium Car Charger and Home Travel Wall Charger</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LVIC58/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">Creative EP-630 - Headphones ( in-ear ear-bud ) - black</a>

<Title>A Great MP3 player, despite a few glitches
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a month before doing my review, since it often takes that long for issues to surface, and my opinions to solidify.  Just so you know, I only use my ZEN to play MP3s.  I don't store pictures on it, and have no desire to watch videos on a tiny little screen (although the image is remarkably bright and sharp, with fantastic color depth).  Having said that, this is a GREAT MP3 player!  Noise levels are incredibly low, and the EQ settings (both presets and custom) guarantee a sonic experience that will be pleasing to almost any ear.  I like bass, and this unit can certainly deliver (with the right headphones).  Here's what I like: -	Great sound! (See above) -	No moving parts.  Completely solid state player with no disc drive, which should decrease vibration susceptibility and increase unit life. -	Lot's of storage space.  I have 834 MP3 files downloaded, with almost three forths of my memory leftover. -	Reliable operation:  My unit was shipped with OS ver. 1.10, which gave me headaches.  It would sometimes hang when connected to my computer, or even when just turning the unit on.  I had to reset it several times.  But ever since I upgraded to ver. 1.20.02 several weeks ago, it has been rock solid!  I have downloaded to it, uploaded from it, and played it for hours at a time with no problems whatsoever. -	Long battery life.  I haven't tested how long it lasts, but it seems to go for hours and hours without needing a recharge. -	Connector placement:  All the connectors are on the unit's side, allowing all cables to be routed next to each other in my car (ahh, it's the simple things in life...).  Here's what I wish was better: -	User interface:  Button functions and menus took me a little while to get used to. -	Software gremlins:  Syncing album artwork to the music sometimes gets messed up.  For example, whatever "Greatest Hits" album is playing, it will show the album cover for Styx "Greatest Hits". -	Construction:  The tactile feedback from the buttons and switches makes me wonder how long they will last.  Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, since I am an engineer used to working with expensive lab equipment.  Incidentally, the "5 in 1 New Creative Zen Kit" with AC charger and car charger (also available from Amazon) is a GREAT accessory, worth every penny!

<Content>I had it for about a week.  Had to reset it 20 times.  Sending it back.  Previously I had a samsung 5GB mp3 player.  Never had this kinda problem or any problem for that matter.  I plugged in headset into the device and the screen went blank (white).  There was no volume and the function buttons stopped working.  I then attempted to reset the device, that did not work.  I had to let the device sit for about 30 min and it began working again.  Then I went to Creative's website thinking this was perhaps a software problem.  After updating the software (which the version was already current) the problem continued.  Could not find a tech support telephone number on Creative's website.  Finally I contacted Amazon and they are sending me another one.  After sleeping on it, I want a refund instead.

<Title>Best MP3 player I have owned
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over the past 5-7 years, I have bought 3 or 4 MP3 players, with varying degrees of satisfaction. This is by far the best one I have ever owned. The software interface and button layout are extremely intuitive and easy to operate. No touchpads, but rather actual buttons that make a tactile click when you engage them. This unit is especially good for audiobook listeners like me, because you can set as many as ten bookmarks, and access them easily by programming a customizable button to open the bookmarks screen. Another real bonus for me as a 3-time grandfather is that you can also store and display videos and pictures on this unit, and they play and look great on the screen.

<Content>After going through two ipods in a span of 2 years, I got fed up with this toy and purchased a Zen. It is a powerful device and a hybrid of PDA, portable audio, and tiny DVD player. It is easy to use, has a great sound and video quality and it's just as small as an ipod. It is also itunes compatible. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a full five stars was the fact that purchased, and therfore copy-righted, songs from itunes cannot be downloaded. But I guess that is an itunes problem and not Zen's.

<Title>Freezing Issues please read for help
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As of 12/26/2007  Upgraded Firmware on website. Upgraded all software on website.  PROS:   Good display - Nicely menus - Conversion software - Cheap - Music Good Quality - Pictures seemed fine.   CONS:  Button on-off seems weak like it will fall off in a few months.  Video Problems - Freezing - Must have everything convert using the software to put into the player's format (wmv) prior to use.   Found the problem for freezing in following.  If you convert any of following formats you could get a freezing issue no matter what you do when using the device so pay attention to what I tried.   How I tested I took a standard FLASH-FLV file which after converted plays fine on every player after converted.  Formats Tried: AVI - .AVI unknown codec version - worked find perfectly played even a large video converted fine.  Xvid - Mpeg-4 codec - .AVI - seemed unsupported  MOV - Quicktime - Converts and plays fine sometimes player gets out of sync with display but plays everytime.  Iphone - Video Mpeg-4 codec - .MP4 - Converts worked perfectly even syncs voice to video perfectly  WMV V.7 - I tried it worked on it was extremely jerky on video quality looked awful and the SOUND squeaked yes! squeaked!!!  WMV Unknown version Froze hard after about 15 seconds hard lock video.   Solution find formats Mpeg-4(Iphone), MOV over other codec before allowing the zen software to convert.  Believe me, I know what I am talking about. Strange thing the conversion software converts every video into some WMV codec and yet it can't import WMV without problems every version of WMV codec I tried failed to play correctly after importing.  It also locked up on me after about 10 days of use. I was pushing back and forth between a menu. When it locked up so bad player wouldn't even shut off with buttons, simply pushed a reset button in the pinhole at the bottom got me out of the locked up.  Also other reviews are claiming that the player has a bad SD memory card  setup, I however found this not to be the case the only problem I had with SD memory card situation is that when you load the files directly from the card it doesn't convert them to players usable formats.    Also the software that came with the player had a problem judging size of files. I had 6 gigs of music videos and it said the player was full even though after converting my videos down it was less than 300 megs worth of space. I had over 3 gigs left on the player and it said it was full and conversion just ended mid stream.  Creative could eventually fix this in a patch since it isn't hardware related.

<Title>Pretty cool, but ....
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for myself for Christmas.  I was real excited to get an mp3 player and researched the heck out of them.  The Zen got excellent reviews and so I made a purchase.  The unit is really small, which is good and bad.  I like it to fit into a pocket, but the buttons are small and when paired with neoprene case, they are difficult to use.  I like to wear ear buds, but the pair that comes with the Zen hurts my ear. The menu layout is goofy on the Zen and I played with customizing the menu, but I still didn't like it.  The volume does not have its own buttons.  This is weird and I had to set up a shortcut to the volume, which I thought was weird. The bottom line is ... be prepared to spend a lot of time setting this up to your own needs (which is a great feature).  I have a young baby and did not have time to dedicate.  Also, I consider myself very computer savvy, but could not figure out the menu hiarchy of the Zen.  I sent the unit back in less than a month and opted to use Windows Media Player on my laptop (which I always have)to listen to my music. -J

<Title>Surprisingly good sound, even for classical  (if you get the right earphones)
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As I listen almost exclusively to classical music, I never took much interest in MP3 players; hardly any serious music listener would cherish the idea of compromising a refined performance by compressing it into some lossy file format and then squeezing it through a pair of diminutive earplugs. On the other hand, however, these players are tempting gadgets, and of course there are ample occasions when it is nice to be able to take a sizeable portion of your favourite music with you in such a compact form.  Compact this Creative Zen certainly is. It is slightly smaller than a bank card, be it rather thicker. Though made of plastic, it makes a sturdy impression and doesn't feel fragile at all. The design is effective and nice - no contrived minimalism here, functionality is the prime object; yet the whole thing looks clean and uncluttered. There are real buttons that you actually have to push, which I prefer much to the slick but error- (and fingerprints-)prone touchscreens. The buttons, too, make this feel like a serious little machine. They are easy to use and respond quickly. This is matched by a well-considered menu-structure. You will find your way around soon enough - no manual needed. Better still, menus are customizable. You can select from a full list of options which items you want to appear in your main menu-screen, and in which order. I must say I would have liked it if this had been taken one step further, and itemnames too would haven been customizable (so that I could, for instance, change "Artist" into "Composer").   Albums, Genres and Artists are listed alphabetically and scroll vertically. If the list is very long you can use the alphabet on the right hand side of the screen to jump straight to the correct initial. Once a music track is selected, all relevant track and album info is displayed. Titles that are too long to fit the screen float by in ticker-tape fashion, which is nice, though the movement at times is less than smooth.  So how about the sound? Frankly, it is hard to say, as the sounds reaching your ear are at least fifty percent, if not to a much greater extent, determined by your headphones. As per usual the makers of the Zen put all their efforts into a well-designed player, only to ship it off boxed with an indifferent set of earphones. They look nice, and at first impression may not even sound too bad, with their deliberately warm colouring and exaggerated bass. But in fact the sound is grainy, unfocussed, fuzzy, and lacking in detail. I found results infinitely improved once I plugged in my set of Shure SE310 phones, even before they were properly burned in. Indeed, while I had purchased the player thinking I would use it for baroque and chamber music only, I now found that listening to Mahler's Fourth was not only viable, but quite pleasant. I must add though that I need to crank up the volume to nearly its maximum in order to get a realistic orchestral sound; and bass performance is still a pretty long way of from what I get through my regular stereo set, even with the "bass boost" option turned on and after fiddling with the equalizer. I should furthermore add that the surprisingly satisfying results were reached using the MP3 format at its maximum quality bitrate. That is, the aforementioned Mahler adds up to some 135 MB, and the storage capacity of the 16GB Zen will be exhausted with a 100 to 120 works of similar dimensions. Well, still a lot more than I could ever take with my CD-walkman... Finally, I should mention one irritant I encountered in playback: there is an audible electrical "click" when the Zen switches from one file to the next, which can get very annoying in pieces that play continuously but are broken down in tracks. Obviously, this is a problem that only classical music listeners are likely to encounter.  Next to the sound, the rest of it seems to me a collection of cute but fairly irrelevant perks. I cannot imagine anyone seriously wanting to view a complete photocollection, let alone watch an entire movie, on the tiny 2.5" screen. The screen has a clear, sharp image, but despite its many millions of colours is lacking in contrast so that pictures tend to look slightly washed out or overexposed. You can load one of your own images as a wallpaper, which is nice, though many wallpapers do not work out well due to the unnecessary, semi-opaque gray bars at the top and bottom of the screen. The screen cannot be switched off during operation (why not?), but fades to a low-lit setting after a customizable number of seconds. The lighting intensity of the screen can also be adapted to your own wishes, as so much else in this player can.  The Zen comes with a CD-ROM that installs software for getting media onto your player. Though a lot can be done simply in Windows Explorer, I found that the Zen Media Explorer is a quick and easy way to transfer files and rip CDs to the player. It did a better job of it than Nero and some CD-rip freeware I tried. If, however, you need to correct errors afterwards, say in a track title, the Media Explorer can't do that and you will need a tag editor like Mediamonkey. Rather more problematic is the fact that the Zen software will only let you rip CDs to WMA-format. If you want to rip to the better quality MP3 you will have to unlock that option by getting the "Creative Audio Pack" at an additional cost of 10 dollars - it will not break the bank, but I found that pretty disgusting nonetheless.  Finally, though there is actually a possibility to display an album's cover art, it is not made easy to achieve this. The (generally poor) manual doesn't have a word on it, and while the Media Explorer includes an option for adding artwork, you have to follow an obscure route to get there, in my case only to find that it didn't work. Use Windows Media Player to rip and synchronize, however, and artwork duly appears on your Zen's screen.  In all however, a worthwhile possession, quite a gem in some ways; and soundwise I am pleasantly surprised - but only after investing in a good set of earphones.

<Title>Quite a  nice little player.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked this mp3 player up because my old iPod Nano 4GB was out of space and I needed more room.  I didn't use iTunes at all and didn't really like the new iPod Nano anyway so I decided to look at the other options out there.  After comparing my choices I decided on this Zen and it arrived today.  I was able to quickly sync up all my music using Windows Media Player 11 and it was nice to not have to install any new software to get it done (it does come with software but I chose not to install it.)  Album art is displayed nicely as well.  This player sounds great and I find the user interface simple to get around.  The FM Radio is a nice addition and I was able to receive my favorite stations in the house with a nice strong signal.  I also updated to the latest firmware without incident.  As a runner the only thing I miss from my old iPod Nano is the Stopwatch feature - I checked the Creative forums and saw that others have requested a stopwatch be added and that request has been passed on to the developers  - so we'll have to wait and see if a future firmware update adds one or not.  As others have stated the "sync/charge" cable it comes with is extremely short so plan to spend a few bucks on another option.  Also Windows Vista identifies this as having only 15 GB of space - I doubt this is specific to Creative but it might be important information for anyone that was actually planning to cram 16 GB of stuff on to it.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase and although this isn't as thin as my old iPod Nano it is going to replace it nicely.

<Content>I bought the new iPod Nano (for the sole reason of compatibility for my MAC Book) and I returned it the next day...VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! To even have the radio work I was to make an EXTRA purchase of an adapter to activate it and the easeness was a JOKE! Did much more research and found that the Creative Zen was the BEST on the market for all the features and the PRICE is UNBEATABLE!!! EXTREMELY HAPPY with the easeness and can utilize the radio WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGES!!!! Clarity is AWESOME!!!(pic and sound)

<Title>The Zen ROCKS, all others pale in comparison...
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first bought a Zen Vision M 30gig last year for my son for Christmas. He has absolutely LOVED it since day one. It plays nearly every format of video, something the Zune and Ipods don't, has an FM receiver, mic, multiple EQ settings, etc and the software to get everything where it needs to be is easy to use and not bloated up with unnecessary junk.   Along comes this new Zen and I bought 2 for Christmas for my daughters. The new Zen is smaller, easier to control (although the Vision M was still easy...)and does everything the previous version did! The major difference here is the drive size. The previous Zen Vision M came in 30 and 60 gigabyte versions and the new ones, due to all being strictly flash driven instead come in 2,4,8,16, and 32GB sizes. (The 32gb version just came out.) The beauty of this is you can get one that fits your budget AND you can also add in more memory with the SD card slot! For my younger daughters I only purchased the 4 GB versions, knowing IF they every filled them up I could easily add in an SD card to give more space.   These are simple to update, simple to load, sound great, video's look amazing, and if you try and put video on there that isn't the right format a window pops open and converts it for you! They are also very small with a screen that's just the right size. 2 guys I work with both sold their Zune's and bought these instead.   If you want a great MP3, Video, and picture player you can't go wrong here.

<Title>great product but
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product 16GB, awesome sound over my previous SANSA 280 (though not as loud so I crank up the volume on my receiver). Additional features over Apple's products like voice recorder and radio and a terrific screen make it a much better choice in the features department.   What I didn't like was the face is acrylic and could scratch and some issues with freezing up that seem to have resolved themselves (I now copy music and videos and create playlists through the Zen software).  The SD card is not heavily utilized feature for additional music and vids, but came in handy several times for work and such to copy files over (I only have a 2GB micro SD in an SD adapter). I take one star off because durability of the player is in question (my sansa died in one ear when it was dropped 3 feet and required me to retrofit padding around the CPU portion of the card to get sound out of the headphone) without the acrylic case, bought separately.

<Content>A great little player. The battery life is pretty good, especially if you're just listening to books or music. I watched around 6 hours of video and still had plenty of battery left to listen to some music.   I've put programs I recorded from TiVo onto it (requires the TiVo desktop software and the software that comes with the player.) I've got my music on it, which I can sync easily through Windows Media Player, but you can also use the included software to make your playlists.  I've put some Audible audio books, and the sound quality on these is great. (This did require an update to the Audible software on my desktop, despite said software telling me it was updated. Not the player's fault, though.)   The picture quality is fine, though I don't have any experience with any other players.   All in all, a great little player, and I highly recommend it.

<Title>Creative Shines Again
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been using a Creative Zen Touch now for 3 1/2 years, and absolutely love it.  The best part about it was that, even though I'm not a whiz at computers, I was able to pick it up, get it out of the box, and within minutes, start transferring music onto it.  I finally decided to get an MP3 player for my wife, who likes to listen to audiobooks a lot.  I bought her an IPOD.  Big mistake!  After an initial failed attempt at understanding the thing, it sat and sat for two weeks before I even wanted to get back to it...finally, a friend spent six hours with me trying to show me how to work it.  Ultimately, I learned roughly how it worked, but was far from satisfied, and rather frustrated by its limitations.  Suffice it to say, I returned the thing to Sam's Club and, after doing much research, settled on ordering a Creative Zen 16 G for her.  We have had it for not quite 48 hours, and already have music, audiobooks, pictures, and videos on the thing.  What a delight to hook it up and have it work so smoothly!  The software seems almost flawless, except that when you ask it to rip a CD to the computer and to the player, it only rips it to the player, and not to the computer...but this is easily solved by ripping to either/or, then transferring the ripped media to wherever you want it.  No problems other than this with the software.  It's not even a problem, but rather just a glitch that can easily be worked around.  Video conversion works seamlessly.  The radio works well, the mic recording works well.  If my Zen Touch broke down, I would buy one of these newer models for myself in a heartbeat.  Go Creative!  Unlike many reviewers of Creative products, I find the lack of a touch strip a bit hard to get used to.  But then again, we get so comfortable with what's familiar.  The overall package of the new Zen is far superior to the old Zen I have...and of course way, way superior to the IPOD.  Great going, Creative, with this solid state, versatile, sturdy little gadget!

<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had other creative players but this one by far blows them away and the best aspect is that it starts playing the minute I power it up. I will reccomend the screen protector, especillay for a screen this size. This player is easy to navigate and easy to load music, I basically do drag and drop and I'm ready to go. My last player was a Sansa E280 and it froze up a lot and I couldn't organize music the way I wanted to to, that is no longer the problem with this unit. The price is very reasonable for 16gb of Flash Memory, you can't go wrong with this player.

<Title>My week with ZEN
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'll start by saying that I have issues with things that don't work as described right out of the box.  Whenever I have to spend time and effort to bring an item to its advertised features and functions, I get concerned.  The ZEN has a strong feature set but some don't work without substantial tinkering.  A complete description of what might be available can be found in the product listing here or on the Creative site.  Below is my experience.  My first adventure started with the A/V being out of sync.  The included software (the latest and using the most current firmware for the player) resulted in a painfully slow conversion process to WMV that yielded a progressively out of sync video.  As the video ran, the sound would increasingly lag.  This led to my first workaround consisting of many hours of reading posts all over the place and downloading a half-dozen different progs.  I found one with a modest learning curve and in about six hours of experimentation, converting clips and such, that issue was put to rest: Research and related time invested, about 20 hours.  The device did not recognize sub-folders for organization/playback purposes nor existing .M3U play lists.  I could, however, create sub-folders but for personal organization, only.  I loaded my music through the mandated, included software and had to rebuild play lists within the device that already existed elsewhere.  Please note that this player keys to ID tags so, if you, like I, have ripped a lot of old vinyl albums, you'll have to spend hours building ID tags on the computer as you can't do it once the track is on the device.  Thus, if not done, album tracks will be out of sequence as the player re-sorts everything regardless of how you drop it into its storage.  Time invested in building ID tags, sorting tracks into sub-folders, creating new play lists from re-sorted sub-sub-folders, about 6 hours.  It did not act like your typical USB mass storage device.  I was not able to move files once on the ZEN.  I could delete them, only.  If I wanted to change the location, I had to delete and reload.  That proved to be an annoying inconvenience.  The files were regular MP3's and I can think of no reason why they were not allowed to migrate.  This, also, disallowed backing up the contents of the player when I had to reformat it...all gone, back to square one.  Several MP3's that I had exported to the player became corrupted.  There was nothing consistent about the files that may have contributed; seemed random.  I wasn't aware that they were corrupted until I was searching for a track that I knew was there but wouldn't play.  I had to browse all 800 or so tracks, delete, reload, rebuild play lists, etc.  There's quite a bit more that resulted in my returning the ZEN.  I had read the reviews and noted all the praise.  Where did I go wrong?  Well, I didn't read those stellar reviews well enough.  They seem to have an implied asterisk attached; works great once you jump through this hoop and that fire-ring.  Wow, how can you give something high praise when you have to spend so much time fixing it or conceding that half its functions don't work?  Perhaps it's all relative.  If so, about everything else must REALLY suck and this sucks less because of its beautiful screen and great sound quality.  I truly regretted that the function-frustration overwhelmed what could have been an ideal player.  Guess I'll wait a bit longer and hang in with my three year old 1gb MP3/4 player from god-only-knows where but has NEVER caused me a lick of trouble and the conversion software is fast and efficient enough to produce in-sync video.  Go figure.

<Title>Quirky but Good
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pro: size - small and light weight nice looking screen quality is excellent user interface is easy  Con: requires screen protector (creative doesn't give you one) short usb charge cable (impossibly short, but blackberry chargers work on it!) additional software required to rip mp3's (try mediamonkey) not intuitive to rip movies  quirky (see below)  I tried to move files from my old creative muvo player.  Once I figured out how to copy them successfully, the player would crash (lock up with black screen and no functionality, but still on).  I kept having to reset the player, again and again, to no avail.  I noticed that all my other files that I copied from compact disk did not crash the system.  When I deleted the transfered files, the player worked perfectly and continues to do so.  I'm guessing the firmware is buggy (both old and new).  There seems to be similar problems with a "white screen" that other reviewers have mentioned.  If you can't get yours to work, return it while it is still under warranty.

<Title>Compact, easy to use, good sound
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a creative Zen M (30 GB) previous to this purchase. The Zen M hard drive finally failed after using it almost every day at work to listen to tunes. I was really impressed with the this Zen product size and durable appearance. The metal backing in stylish and protects the unit. The front nav buttons are easy to use but the menu configuration is a little cluncky. For example, you have to go back to the main menu to access different parts of the software (i.e. just from music to system setup). It would be cool if you could navigate with just a scrolling option rather than having to menu 'back' to the main page to get to where you want to go.   One small complaint is that I had this for about a week when I somehow scratched the surface of the screen. I don't know how it happened - i mean I didn't drop it or anything - so I feel the screen is succeptible to scratches. My recommendation is to buy a case with a screen protector.   Overall this is a great small mp3 player that I synch with Napster to get tons of music on it. If you can afford the 30G version go for it. I have yet to watch movies or videos but the screen resolution is good.
