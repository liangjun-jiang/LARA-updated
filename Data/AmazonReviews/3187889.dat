<Title>Very Nice MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After buying a Philips MP3 player and then returning it to Walmart because it was made of flimsy plastic that was easily broken and didn't have any kind of cover with it, I noticed an RCA Sport 512Mb MP3 player on display. Unfortunately, there weren't any left for sale in the supply cabinet. When I looked online, I found this model, which is exactly the same in every other way except that it's not maroon in color, with twice the memory as the Walmart item. And get this-- IT'S THE SAME PRICE AS THE HIGHLY BREAKABLE PHILIPS MODEL I ORIGINALLY HAD TO RETURN TO THE STORE even though it is made of metal and heavy duty rubber! (By the way, it comes with an arm-strap, a plastic sheath, or a neckband if you prefer that.)

<Title>broke within a month

<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my 14 year old and it broke within a month. However, he has also broken 2 others fairly quickly, so I can't say wether it is the products fault, or his.

<Content> Player arrived on time and in good condition.  After a couple weeks usage the display light quit working but then all of a sudden it started to function again and has ever since.  The ear buds offer great sound quality and fit nicely.  I use it for running and it has not let me down in all kinds of conditions so far.  Well built, small with great sound reproduction.  I like it!
