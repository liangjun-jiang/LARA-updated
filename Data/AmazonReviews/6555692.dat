<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0945948-5579607">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Title>Worst product ever: Get the iPod
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Micro in April and want to throw it against the wall in Dec. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. At first, it seemed like a winner. The fact that you could download mp3s rather than paying $1 per song via iTunes, I thought it would be a good deal. Unfortunately, this thing is so poorly made that it's been defective since the first three months. First the screen went out and what good is it if you can't see the titles of songs? The earbuds broke soon after. Then the thing just started turning off for no reason and having to re-build. Now, after just six months, my computer no longer finds it via the USB... thus can't download or do anything. Customer support? Non existent as well. I just wasted $200. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Tech is pointless if you can't hear the music
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tech isn't worth much if you can't get the music to the headphones. Buy something else.  My daughter bought hers in July. She returned the first one because it would not load music. She returned the second one because the headphone jack socket failed. Now she has to return the 3rd one because the headphone jack socket is failing.   Her experience is not uncommon.  She recommended the micro to a friend (it's really cool if its working). Her friend's headphone jack socket is failing.  (...)Consensus is that the only people satisfied with zen micro have not owned it long enough for the head phone jack socket to fail.   The problem is so common that there is a web site that gives the step by step instructions for fixing the socket. (with a caveat that you will void your warranty and should not attempt this unless you have professional soldering skills)  (...)

<Title>Don't buy it!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never written an online review before but I feel compelled to do so.  While it appears some people have had good luck with this product, I found it a complete piece of trash.  My friends laughed when I said, "It was great until it stopped working."  I didn't mind the touchy controls and really loved the size and shape of the player.  Others on this site have described the many technical problems with the Zen Micro.  I will simply say I traded in my first one when it died only to have my second one become very sick in less than one month.  I now have an ipod nano with only 1/2 the storage capacity of my last zen micro but having 500 songs that play beats having 1000 songs that don't.

<Title>Love it to bits
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have had my micro since Feb this year and have no problems whatsoever. Great little player - actually has a replacable battery so you don't have to throw it out once the battery dies, like you do with the iPod. Just remember to download the firmware upgrade before you use it, I didn't know about this and had a minor issue with the battery life (fixed with the firmware upgrade).

<Title>Great player... for the first two weeks
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player as a late Christmas present to myself this past January, figuring that while it was kind of pricy, that meant it would be high quality and last a while.  Wrong!  While I really loved the player when it worked properly, it hardly ever did.  After about a month, I started having compatability problems with transferring Napster songs I bought, despite countless upgrades.  After two months, the headphone jack started to go out.  Once it got so bad I could hardly use the player anymore, I sent it in to get repaired.  Not two weeks after I got it back, it fell about three feet off a table and onto the (carpeted) floor, and completely quit working.  According to Creative's customer service, they need $25 just to LOOK at it, so I'm done with this.    While the Micro is great in terms of features, it's badly designed and cheaply made.  I am extremely put out that I spent $250 on a piece of electronics that broke twice in less than 10 months.  I will be upgrading to an iPod Nano as soon as possible.

<Title>Excellent player - And Not an Ipod.
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this primarily for the FM radio - Apple and Ipod have dug in their heels and refused to include one.. Dopes. But then there are other advantages.  1) The sound quality is superior - it's truly excellent, with lower background noise with Creative than with IPod. See the specs. 2) The thought of having to buy the entire Ipod/Itunes/Music Industry monopoly seemed a bit bothersome. With the Micro you can run your toy off of RealAudio or MusicMatch or any of a number of other programs. 3) You can replace the battery - easily. 4) It used to be in competition with the Ipod Mini, and it's just got more memory. There's more bang for your buck. It is larger than the Ipod Nano, but..5GB!.. and I don't find the extra ounce or two to be a burden. 5) It leaves you as an individual - not one of the millions in the cult-of-iPod - I generally don't like 'mass fashion statement' accessories and I'm glad to be able avoid this one.  Creative has been an excellent alternative with no downside so far. Actually there is one downside, which is that 100 companies make accessories for Ipod and Creative doesn't have many similar add-on toys or cases available. But still I say - buy a Zen - you won't regret it.

<Content>I bought this player a litle over a month ago... sounds good , nice features but it is realy unfortunate how badly it works... download and sync problems( Napster). Whatever you do don't drop it even a soft landing can damage the unit.... Battery life is highly oversold ( 12 hours! not in my experience- try maybe 6) .   When I return this unit it will be the sencond and last time.

<Content>I purchased the Zen in late August.  It worked fine until recently when the headphone jack started to "wobble" and distort sound...now I have to constantly touch/tap the headphone jack area for it to play correctly....I'm about to send it in for repair -- wish me luck...

<Title>Good for those who aren't stuck on IPODS
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like this player. The first day I got the player I wasn't used to the EXTREMELY senstive touch pads and pressed to many buttons too fast and it freezed. All I had to do was take out the batteries and it worked fine. It takes awhile to get used to the senstive scrool pad, but i like this thing better then the ipod. The software is extremely easy to use it's a lot like itunes. The only real con with this player is the battery life. If you listen to it for like an hour to 2 hours straight it'll be out of battery. That kind of makes it a hassle but its worth it. I really like this player better than ipods i've used. It's looks are awesome. it's WAY smaller than the ipod mini in my opinion, and the blue light around the outside is very cool. I've had many compliments about its looks and one of my friends bought one because she loved mine so much. It can fit in your pocket easily and you can throw it in your purse as well. The earbuds it comes with are not so great i went out and got some $30 really good earbuds to replace the ones the manufactuers give you, they have good sound, but fall out of your ears. Overall this is a really cool looking, durable, little guy who will make you happy.

<Title>i love my purple zen micro!
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first received the Micro, I did have some very frustrating times with the touchpad.  Then all of a sudden, I got it.  While it certainly remains a little over-sensitive, I am very comfortable with it.  Buttons would be better and I see that the Zen touch has them.  So far (2 and 1/2 months) my earphone jack has not broken.  Today, I purchased the extended warranty sitting in my cart for $40.00 from Creative, but noticed it went up to $50.00.  That is a lot for a $179.00 item that when the new price points already are much lower for much more storage..But it seems that the odds are that something will go wrong with the jack and the player might freeze up.  Within the first few days of owning it, my player did freeze up.  I was only getting about 3 hours on the battery.  I called Creative and it was just a matter of taking the battery out and putting it back holding the power on the whole time (I forgot the term for that).  I also downloaded upgrades from their site which extends the battery life.  I'm not sure why this information isn't provided upon purchase.  The players stay on "standby" for somewhere like 12 hours until you upgrade and it goes on "standby" for 3 hours.  That's what eats up the battery.  Once I had the upgrade, I was all set.  I don't know what the commotion is about how great the blue light is, but it's nice to have a light.  I did set mine to stay lit a bit longer than the default.  On the positive side, once you figure out the touchpad, the software, the upgrades, and get the warranty..you can really enjoy this player.  This is my first mp3, and I love that i have a stereo now that is so easy to manage and organize and tranport. I replaced the free earbuds (which did have excellent sound) with earbud w/earclips because the buds keep fallling out of my ears.  I have the travel sound speakers by creative that came with it in some promotion.  The music sounds phenomenal.  I also purchased regular speakers and hooked the micro in the living room and it was great during a party.  I then carry it around in my bag when I go anywhere in case I get stuck someplace and then I can listen to anything.  It actually has improved my quality of life!!!!  I also have only been able to get 1000 songs instead of the advertised (with asterik) 2500.  i deliberately went back and changed the settings for burns only on WMA 128, instead of mp3 192, and while that saved quite a bit of space, i ended up with the 1000 songs.    I also can't get any radio stations.  I don't use Outlook, but Palm, and wish i could psynch my calendar with the micro calendar.  In fact, that was part of the reason i justified buying the player-it was a storage disk, palm pilot, tape recorder, radio AND an mp3 player.  but it turns out  not to work for me as a calendar or a radio.    Many snafus, but what an incredible invention.  I'm just hoping it will last for a few years.  And i hope creative keeps on fine-tuning it, and being fast with customer service since they do know their products are problematic.. They have a great website forum where there are very helpful moderators and experienced owners lurking and helping everyone.  You can look up everything you want to know about the battery, touchpad, earphone jack and absolutely everything you can imagine...  Very good product (with lots of potential).

<Content>This product is great. It works very well and I don't have any complaints about the mp3 player itself. My only concern is the directions that are sent with it. The directions are not detailed at all. I kind of had to figure out how to upload songs, transfer songs, and create playlists on my own because the directions don't really tell you how to do all that stuff.

<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>first let me start by saying this little player kicks some serious ipod arse.Why should i get locked into crappy coustomer support and and i tunes and pay for a name this are questions i asked myself when i bought this little gem from walmart, and you should ask trhose questions your self.This little five gig player sound beautiful right outta the box and with a name like creative for people who dont know. Creative has been in the sound bussine ever since the days of the 386 producing sound cards for pcs. This player does it all,plays out crisp and sharp also with it's option to use as a 2gb portable hd. also can store contacts has and fm tuner and voice recorder built in and direct fm recording and trust me when i tell you wont be sorry with the fm tuner tune comes in perfectly no static at all. and the sound is almost as good as the mp3 on ur player.and the creative softwear perfect so easy to use i had it down in about 5 min. an to top that off a removeable battery w00t no more sending the mp3 back to the store or the manufactor becasue you can jus buy a new one. Plus it looks kick with the baby blue outline and all black front and baby blue buttons. but the touch pad takes some getting used to but even that you can turn down the (i have no idea how to spell this btw senseatvity) wow they thought of everything go creative. W00t and wacth out ipod becasue at half the cost and an extra gig of hd space and a unique look you to can have one of these awsome lil players. but i will end on this you could buy and ipod but you will be paying for just a name not and actuly decent player so it is your choice and trust me you will be paying becasue did ipod tell you that there mp3 player only work with i tunes ??? no i bet not well once more w00t for creative bye

<Content>i bought the zen micro because i thought i was getting more for the buck. but within 24 hours of receiving it, it already froze once. and within 3 months of having it, it died on me.  my friend took pity on me and bought me an ipod shuffle after this broke. it's safe to say, apple's jacked up prices are worth it because the zen micro feels so flimsy after holding an ipod. so...basically only get this if you're VERY CAREFUL with your toys. otherwise, i'd go with the safe route and get something else.

<Title>Great player that is dropping in price
<Date>Thu Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for about a year.  The first one I bought frozen up and was unrecoverable.  I returned it for a replacement, upgraded the firmware first thing and it's playing happily ever since.  The touch pad took some getting used to but like anything else, if you use it often it becomes second nature. I like the screen size and the variety of play mode options. As other reviewers have mentioned, you don't get much documentation with it and that's a shame but most things are fairly intuitive. If you upgrade to firmware version 2.20.05 you are locked into Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 for operating the Zen. Version 1.30.03 only allows you to use the software bundled with the player but I find that option more useable.  I like the bundled software.  I don't like WMP 10. 'Nough said.  I use the Zen at work. It's very quiet but we're all in cubicles so this is a way to have my tunes and not disturb other people.  I carry it in a cell phone case around my neck as I move through my day.  I can listen all morning and still have plenty of battery left but I still recharge it during lunch.  If I'm at my desk for a long period I just leave it plugged in.  I've never had a battery go dead yet.  The earbuds that come with it.....suffice to say I invested in headphones I like better.  Needless to say I love this player.  For the price you just can't beat it and I've been very happy with it's performance. The size is perfect and whatever awkwardness there might be over software or button sensitivity, this is just a great little machine.

<Title>What  a piece of CRAP!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased two Zen Micros and within two months both had issues with the headphone jacks cutting in and out. Both had to be returned for warranty work and after a lengthy wait they were returned. The replacements are sent without current firmware and driver updates in place which means that you will have to figure out which updates are needed thru the Creative website. There is an Autoupdate feature that allows you to just plug the Zen into the USB cable and the link decides which updates you need. To bad this doesn't work either.  Now, after having problems with one player that is 7 months old and the other not charging right I would say save your money and buy a Ipod Nano

<Title>Cool player
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I admit I am not what you would call technically sophisticated. After suffering through the limitations of portable CD players, my main criteria when looking for a player was being able to put a lot of music in one space while having good, clean and crisp sound.  Initially, I got my feet wet by buying a 512 MB flash player and eventually wanted to include more songs on the player. That led me to larger players. But which one to buy ... the dominant Ipod or another player which gets less attention? I have an older version of Windows which quickly ruled out the Ipod. So I turned to Creative Zen which was not only compatible technically but financially.  But I had huge concerns as I read reviews complaining about the player freezing and breaking. So it was with trepidation that I bought the Creative Zen Micro.   Hopefully, I don't jinx myself but 8 months later, I can report I am enjoying my player and its capabilities. When I first received the player, I was ready to throw it across the room (the $200 I paid stopped me from doing that) because I was so frustrated over not being able to work the touchpad. It took a few days but once I took a deep breath and managed to adjust the sensitivity levels, things were fine. The FM stations come in clear as well and the battery which I can remove and replace myself (an advantage over the Ipod) lasts a reasonable period of time without recharging.  Because the player came with few instructions, another frustration I had was not being able to figure out how to make playlists and other functions. I fixed that problem by going to Creative's website and finding a 65 page set of instructions there. For those who are still trying to figure out their player, I recommend downloading the instructions. It makes life and dealing with the player much easier.

<Title>ZEN MICRO WINS!!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my zen about 4 months ago. People have all their reviews about how the Zen battery doesn't hold a charge. WRONG! I charged my player right before Hurricane Katrina. IT HELD ITS CHARGE FOR FIVE WEEKS STRAIGHT THROUGH HURRICANE KATRINA!! It has amazing sound quality and is extremely easy to use. The touchpad takes about 1 day to get used to. The software could be a little easier to use, but if you work hard enough you can easily figure it out. The battery will last about 10 hours of use. The battery also holds it charge for about a 7 weeks of no use. I recommend you use the DLO clear jam case for the Zen Micro. Zen Micro is definatly an IPOD killer. IPODs use only ITunes. Zen Micro uses any MP3 format. The Micro is the best.

<Title>Comprehensive Review
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm going to begin with a basic review and then as an addenum address some of the complaints on the board.  Looking for an mp3 player I was looking for (in order of priority):  1) Audio Fidelity 2) Compatibility with music subscription services 3) Build Quality 4) Portability (including batterly life) 5) Interface 6)Maintenance Costs (i.e. easily replacable, cheap battery)  With this in mind, I was led to the Zen Micro.  I know creative creates great sound cards  (I've had 2 of them) and I had also read that creative had the among the best fidelity of all audio players.  Testing with a friend's zen micro and another's ipod, I noticed a clear difference in quality between the two using the same songs encoded at the same bitrate.  I am, however, an audiophile, so many people may not notice the difference.  Ipods tend to have weaker bass and less clarity.  Zen micro also had the features I was looking for that the ipod didn't: (compatability with subscription serviecs, not having to use system--resource-hogging i-tunes, and being able to transfer files between computers).  The FM tuner and voice recording didn't really play into my account, but they work fine: the FM tuner is a bit weak, and I get a little static listening to NPR, but its not gruesomely bad either (what do you expect out of such a tiny device without an antenna?).  The recording is ok too but the fidelity is really meant for note taking not recording a concert or anything.  The build quality of this thing seems pretty good as well.  The back is a clear, white plastic which I find to be very cool looking.  Unlike the ipod, it will not scratch easily and has a nice glossy finish to it.  The front seems to be a thin anodized aluminum faceplate (the screen is a whole in the faceplate, and on top of the plate is a thick layer wich borders the player and also forms the screen).  The text quality is very good and is about 10 font for characters and 8 or 6 font for time remaining and track number.  I've read reports about the zen taking hard knocks and still working and I believe them (at least everything other than the headphone jack seems solid).  This thing is extremely protable.  It is about 3.8 ounces which is slightly heavier than the ipod mini and the nano, and it is thicker as well but I find that to be great because it cradles more easily into my hand  (the back is curved).  It is light enough so that I don't notice it while exercising using my arm-band at the gym (in terms of weight).    I've had no problems with the interface either.  Its intuitive and yes, its pretty similar to the ipod's, but I've read that ipod jacked creative's interface in the first place anyways.  Instead of a wheel you have an up-down touch sensitive scroll which is used for volume control and scrolling.  Tapping it lightly selects things.  It is very intuitive and I got use to the sensitivity (which you can adjust) in a few minutes.  It has a very cool backlight as well making it easy to use at night.  In addition, it can be used in your pocket without a problem.  The controls are the only metallic part of the player exposed (the rest is covered in plastic) so its easy to find, and there are 2 small ridges (like the 1-side of a die) that stick up and  help identify where the buttons are by touch.  The battery life is about 11 hours on mine without constant adjustment (I tested it) and about 8 hours with constant adjustment (which usually happens with me).  The battery is removable and can be purchased cheaply on ebay which is a plus.  Now to respond to the caveats:  Ok, there's a lot of variance in the reviews for the Zen Micro so here are a few quick things I would like to point out.  Anyone that insults the Zen Micro and then tells you to buy an ipod (especially a 20 gig one)  seem to me to be  an ipod fanboy trying to turn you away from a good product or is clueless about mp3 players.  The zen micro is not competing really with ipods, its features put it in a different niche.  The normal ipod was just too big for me and I didn't need to have 20 gigs with me at a time.  Also the mediocre audio fidelity was a big turn-off to me.  Yes, there is a headphone problem, but noone is certain how really prevalent it is.  Forums are a terrible way to tell because you're getting a self-selecting group of people.  If yours breaks, of course you're gonna go whine about it online.  If it doesn't, you just continue on doing what you've been doing and don't even know such boards exist so a board full of complaining people may not mean the player is bad.     That being said, the  headphone problem does seem to be a systematic flaw (at least among those that expereince it) that occurs in  because the headphone jack is apparently not soldered on very tight.  Anecdotal evidence says that newer models are soldered on tighter, but noone knows for sure (not enough time to test).   If you know how to solder components you can fix it but void your warranty.  I don't think its that big of a problem, I talked to a local cambridge soundworks guy who said he never had any problems with the zen micro and that noone has returned it because of a headphone jack problem.   If you're really worried, I suggest you get Amazon's replacement plan rather than Creative's extended warranty.  Creative will send you a refurbished unit if yours gets broken, which begs the question, why is it refurbished in the first place?  With Amazon they will send you a new one, which is a better deal.  THey will also be  likely faster than Creative which has like 1 month turnaround times (no, I don't work for amazon; this is what careful research has shown me).  To solve the headphone jack problem, do not leave your headphones plugged in while in not in use (this also saves battery life), and do not put it in your pocket or anywhere else where it can collide into things.  This should not be hard as you should most likely have a belt clip or whatnot to protect your investment anyways.  Get headphones with a 90 degree jack to limit torque as well.  Small things you might want to know:  The organizer does what it says, display downloaded outlook tasks.   There is up to a three second lag between songs sometimes on shuffle.  This is due to the harddrive in the device moving from one section of the disk to another.  For songs immediately after another its not as noticable.  There is usually about a 1 second average lag between songs when fowarding.   Thats about it, I just got my purchase and am glad I got it, its a cool little device that had all the features I wanted + some nice bonuses.  I'm a little worried about the headphone problem but I know how to solder and I am extra careful with my player so I feel safe.  I'm certainly glad I got it over an ipod, the sound quality is enough to push the micro far and beyond the ipod to me.  Hope I've been of help.    EDIT:  I've owned this thing for 5 months now and still no headphone jack problem.  I even stopped worrying about it after the first month and just left my headphones jacked in and still no headphone jack problem.  Some dust got underneat the plastic at the edges but I used a business card and just scraped the dust out.  I've even used it to record lectures (be sure to listen to the recording after a few seconds to make sure you're getting good sound).  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would buy it again.

<Title>I am returning it back
<Date>Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First the touch pad is too sneitive. I would rather have the buttons.  Second the FM receiver is not sensitive enough to catch the regualr channels.  Third, It would not charge from the USB port out of box, one has to install the Drivers/Media Source application to get it to charge which looks outright foolish specially when the system does not have required drivers on it or you have to sacrifice min 128 MB as HDD space for it to be able to charge. what a piece of BS.  I am done with it. I have had enough with this player's nightmares.

<Title>The Zen Micro
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, the zen micro is the only microdrive on the market that "de-throned" the apple ipod mini, go to www.mp3.com and look at the review they wrote.  the reason the micro beat the ipod was that it had:  1) an FM transmiter 2) very attractive blue outline lights 3) smaller and can fit in a Mintz box :) 4) supports yahoo music unlimited and other on the go subscriptions 5) as an amazing, removable battery!!!! 6) was the same price of the mini but you got an extra gig of memory.  The FM transmitter is a decent one, (espessially for no antena)  the blue lights on the outline are very attractive, but i fear that they are the reason that this player has only 12 hrs of battery.  the size is amazingly small for a microdrive. it fits in a mintoz box (one of the user images on amazon shows it)  the removable battery, this alone made me buy the micro instead of a mini. with All ipods you have to spend over 80 dollars just to get a new battery!!!!   and the value of the zen is much more than the mini.  with the micro you get an FM tuner, Voice recording, and 1 extra gig of memory for the same price as the mini was.  now that the mini has been replaced by the NANO, apple is bragging how thin the Nano is compared to the zen micro.. to me this makes no sence. why does apple compare a BRAND NEW product that was JUST realeased oct 12 2005 to the older zen micro, which was released at the end of 2004.    comparing those 2 is like comparing Windows XP to windows 2000..    tghe zen is a great player for those who go to highschool or colledge.

<Title>Great when it functions
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought it from Amazon in February and the earphone jack failed in three months.  Check Creative's forum to see how common this problem is.    It was still under warranty and I sent it back for repair.  They sent me another one with the disclaimer that this may be a refurbished unit.  This one lasted about a month before the hard drive completely crashed.  Again, check Creative's forums to see how common this problem is.    The warranty is almost done on this product, so I'm looking at IPods now.  When it actually works, it sounds great.

<Title>Mp3 players; the audiophile's worst nightmare
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm addicted to music. I'm also somewhat of an audiophile. Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me. On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine. On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality. I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.  I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut. The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb. The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go". So that's the one I bought. Too bad.  First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.   Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. They didn't really make any difference. I also experimented with an adapter for the car. If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. Hands down, better quality than ipod's. that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.    Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   Otherwise, you should get an ipod. My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made. It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.    If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.

<Title>My unit came defective
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for something else other than the IPOD when I considered the Zen Micro (ours is 6G) that we sell here at my store. I wanted good battery life, a durable unit, and plenty of space to hold my music under $275.  After much research I decided to buy the Zen Micro 5G which I found at another store for $179. It was defective...  I had previously heard rumors about a lot of problems with Creative's products because of poor design or just general defect. I was hoping to God I wouldn't get something defective, but after all I had heard from people's units crashing after a few months of use, I decided to return this unit instead of exchange.  For one, when I bought it, the touch pad did not work like the manual said. Instead of moving up and down... the up button was sometimes the select key, so when scrolling up I accidentally hit a lot of menu options. To avoid this I just used the lower portion of the pad, it was a pain...  Even worse was when I set up playlists once I got into them itself it changed to another list I could not get out using the Back key. It was EXTREMELY difficult to get to the main menu to change songs... and usually I ended up changing songs and moving the volume and so forth trying to desperately get to the menu.  My remedy was hitting the back key and select key at once REPEATEDLY... doing this about 50 times until it worked was the only way I could get to the playlist or main menu. I was not happy with my unit at all...  The display model at our job works GREAT though and from what I hear some people are happy with the units so far. I was thinking my unit was just defective considering many people have come back saying they've bought other Creative models as well as this one that have had similar problems as well as headjack problems.  I still have faith in Creative and it's reputation, but I would be weary of a lot of defects with their products. The hard drives have crashed after so long, at most a year, and I've seen two Zen Xtras returned withen the past few days which is A LOT considering our store doesn't even sale them.  If you notice with some of their models, the prices has dropped dramatically. For example, the Zen Xtra runs for $217 for a THIRTY GIG hard drive. That is massive for an mp3 player.  I still have some faith in Creative so I'm going to be persistent and try the Zen Sleek as it seems to be a very durable unit and something I'd like to give a try. Hopefully your unit wont be as defective as mine, but you should pay attention to why these prices are so low, and judge for yourself if you think this unit will reach your expectations as it is still a very well designed unit and very attractive looking.

<Title>Stay away from this product
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro boasts the capability of holding up to 2,500 songs, yet you will be lucky to fit 1,000 on it. I chose this player because I read/heard good things about it. The navigation is very hard and making a playlist is utterly impossible unless you load everything up on your computer screen and do it that way. The "touchpad" is ultra-sensitive, even when on the so-called least sensitive setting. Nonetheless, I put up with all of this stuff because the sound quality was superb.  Then one day the player froze up. It wouldn't even turn off. I removed the battery to get it to shut off. Now, the thing doesn't even work. I have only had it for a month any already it is broken, even though I didn't do anything to it. It only turns on when I use the adapter and it shows the beginning screen with the word "creative," it lights up, but nothing works...I can't get to my songs, I can't get it to do anything.  I wanted to post this so you don't waste your money and get stuck with this thing like I did! Spend a little more and get something reliable and worth the cash.

<Title>Works for me
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I was aware of the sensitive touch pad and of the headphone jack problem before I bought this.    When I first got it I opened the insturction manual and did what it said.  The manual doesn't tell you how to use your player but only tells you how to charge it up, turn it on,  and install the software on your computer and that's it.  Using the player itself you'll have to play with it to figure it out.  The software that comes with this is good.  It comes with Windows media player 10 and its own organizer.  The organizer is actually powered by Windows media player and a couple of other programs.  You can use windows media player to rip, burn cds, and sync music to your device if you want to, but I like creatives organizer better.  Using the player itself is easy once you get the hang of it.  You slide your thumb up and down the touch pad to select the menu item(don't tap it or press it) then once your on the thing you want you then tap the touch pad to select it.  The first thing you'll want to do when you get it is practice doing this.  You might also want to change the touchpad sensitivity to low in system/player settings/touch pad.  Also when playing music you have to use the touch pad to turn up and down the volume.  There is no seperate wheel or buttons for the volume.  What I mean is once you press play and start playing the file, you use the same touch pad you use for navigating the menus for the volume.  Personally I don't mind this.  I haven't tried making a play list using the player itself yet so I can't comment on that.  It is easy however to make one on your computer and import it to your device.  As for audio quality it's just as good as any other MP3 player.  Nothing special but it's good.  It's not distroted or anything like that.  There is a little bit of squeeling in between tracks though.  As for problems my device did freeze up once and I had to remove the battery and stick it back in.  That fixed the problem and none of the data was lost.  I haven't run into the headphone jack problem yet and I hope I never do.  I've only had it for a little over a month though.  I'm being extra carefull making sure not to twist the headphone plug around in the jack and not removing it and putting it back in all the time.  The only other problem is that the touchpad is hard to use at first but you get used to it.  Pros: -Plays MP3 and WMA -Small about three inches tall, one and a half inches wide and less than a half inch deep -FM radio -comes with good software  Cons -unsure about headphone jack -froze up once

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> The zen micro was given to me as a present, which makes it harder, but the first thing that happened was the battery was dying after about 1 hour. It went back to the shop, which in Hong Kong means arguing like mad to get them to take it back rather than having to go to the service centre in some remote place yourself. A couple of weeks later it came back with a new battery. For a few months it was OK, although it would hang up regularly requiring the battery to be removed to reset it. Then the remote died, oh well, i didnt really need it anyway. Then it came up with "firmware fault", and the whole unit was replaced  another couple of weeks after being returned. Then I changed to Mac from the PC, and there are NO drivers or support for Mac for Zens. Fairly unbelievable for a company trying to compete with the I-pod.  I found a third party driver written for the Zen called XNJB, which at least allows you to use the basic functions. Why Creative cannot do what one person did by themselves and released for free I cannot understand. Now the thing has totally crapped out and is stuck on "building library" and so is impossible to access, even to reformat. I'll try to get it fixed again, but I'm not sure what I'll do with it when I do get it back. I'm waiting for a 60Gb Ipod to arrive now. When it worked it was nice to use, the size was decent and the features were well thought out, but I strongly advise against this player and Creative products in general. They will not reply to any customer service complaints, but just send standard e-mails to put you off. Hopeless.

<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Zen Touch about a year ago and the thing was absolutely ginormous. It weighed about a pound and barely fit in my pocket (and made a huge bulge when it did)  A few weeks ago the Zen Micro 5gb went on sale at Amazon so i decided to pick one up. I wasn't sure if 5gb would be enough space for me but it's plenty. I honestly don't understand these people buying 20gb-60gb mp3 players for double the price, it's just not needed or worth the extra cost. Ive got over 700 songs on my Micro (mostly 192-256kbps, some VBR) and there is still space left for more.    My old Zen Touch had crazy battery life (20 hours+) and I loved that part of it. The Micro's battery typically only has 1 bar left after a full day of use, but it hasn't died (or locked up) on me yet. Just make sure you update the firmware from Creative's website before you start putting songs on it, because it requires a full format of the hard drive.  Why pay 70 bucks more for an ipod nano when you can get one of these? I am a completely satisfied customer... even though Amazon took close to a week and a half to get it to me (free shipping option)

<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Creative Zen Micro to have for Spring Break in March. I originally had a problem installing the software for it and had to call customer service. After that was sorted out, I put songs on it through Napster-to-Go and it worked for almost 2 weeks. That was all I got out of it. It wouldn't let me play any of my songs after that. I was busy and didn't have any time to call customer service for a while. When I did, I found out that I would have to use email customer support cause my time was up to be able to use the over the phone service. I emailed them back and forth for 3 months almost every day. Their response time was rather fast, but eventually I just went back to Best Buy and exchanged it for an iPod. So far, I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it. I do not recommend the Creative Zen Micro as it would not play my songs on it and my computer, which had nothing wrong with it(Dell Desktop PC), didn't sense that I plugged it in, therefore I couldn't even try to fix the songs on it.

I cannot get my wma files (pretty much all of the CDs I copied to my computer) onto the creative software!  It is not like I want to sit around and rip all of my CDs over again (some are so scratched I can't do that anyway).  Otherwise this is a good product, but still this is a huge deal.  Creative states that thier software can recognize wma and mp3 files.  Liars!

<Title>A so so product barely working
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading reviews on the internet, including the ones in Amazon I bought this product at a pretty good price. However, I have deeply regreted. This has confirmed a long time suspecion that online reviews are largely biased, especially the ones raving about the products. You just have no way to find out any info about confliction of interests.     OK, back to the point. I don't want to talk about the "pros" of this product because there isn't really any. Yes it plays music, but isn't it supposed to be working that way? It does everything the manufacturer claims it will do but, the manufacturer has been hiding from the customers a lot of "cons" that are not supposed to be found in any decent, mature product. Let's list some here.     1.  Very very hard to install softwares. It's a pain in the back side to update firmware. I have been playing PCs since DOS age and I have a Linux box which has been fine tuned by myself to such a degree that it can almost replace my Windows box. However, after hours of trying and numerous rebootings I have finally decided to just throw away the CD that comes with the player, just using Windows Media Player instead, any way WMP is the "engine" of all these softwares, the others are just "shells".    But I did manage to up-grade firmware to the newest version. and the following are the problems that I still have.     2. Everytime I have purchased licensed songs in it, it messes up with the rest of the songs unlicensed. I can't find them again, I can't send new mp3 formated songs to it since it prompts me to purchase a "license" for them. But everybody nows mp3 format dosn't carry any license infomation. Creative may say it's not their problem but the problem of, say, Microsoft, like I care to know. I want a working mature portable music player no matter what. Creative had promised me one when it took my money.    3. Every time when I recharge it, it automatically turns on by itself, even it has been turned off before. And when it's turned on it displays a messege saying "Docked" and a sign of re-organising forever, and I can't turn it off again, it is frozen, until it's unplugged. The same happens when I send songs over from my PC, or there is any error caused by whatever reasons. It's just so slowly reacting that it really looks dumb.    4. It's very hard to navigate through the songs. The touch-pad is either over-sensitive or not responding. They could have used older but more reliable technologies if they don't really know how to use the new ones. As an ethnic Chinese I used to take pride of Creative's products but this one has disappointed me big time.    All in all, this is a caricature of ipod, a product made by an opportunitist who is both jealous of the former's success and desperate to catch up. However, take a look at today's portable music player market, who is not?

<Title>Change to ONE star! Must Read. Avoid being nickled and dimed
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars. I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons. This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another. Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc.... I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple. Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  This brings my review to one star! But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.  The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. It COULD have been a great product. Why isn't it? Read the next six mixed pros and cons: . 1.) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 2.) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc. Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. . 3.) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 4.) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries. Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. . 5.) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. I have gone through two of them in two years. . 6.) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.

<Content>Don't get me wrong, I love the Zen Micro, but there are a few problems that everyone should be aware of.    The sound quality is amazing and I love having a ton of  music at my fingertips.  The problem is the fingertips.  The controls take awhile to get used to and they are not the most operator friendly.  I am sometimes frustrated with the way the controls are too sensitive or not sensitive enough.  I usually try to set it to what I want and leave it alone instead of constantly hunting for a different song or album.   Also the software is not the most user friendly.  I had to kind of play with it to figure it out and I am still learning some of the finer points.  Once you get the hang of it it is not too bad, but at first it is frustrating and I don't consider myself computer illiterate.  Overall though, I must say that I love the Zen Micro.  I think it was worth the initial frustration to get to have so much music in such a little package with such good sound quality.  I have about 690 songs and 4 sizeable playlists and I have only used a little over half of my memory.  I would suggest the Zen Micro to anyone who will deal with a little frustration to get the most out of a great device.

<Content>I am very happy with my Zen Micro player.  I've read some of the reviews on this player and  I can't understand why some people are having problems with it.  The only thing that I can say that is negative, is that the earphones aren't the best.  I purchased some high quality Sony earphones and the sound is incredible.  The battery life is also good.  I have over 850 songs in the ZEN MICRO, and I have more space.  I think that creative may need to work out some the bugs that some of the people are complaining about.
