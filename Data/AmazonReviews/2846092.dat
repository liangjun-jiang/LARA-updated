<Title>Hard as a rock
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the zen stone so that I had a compact mp3 player to jog with.  I am extremely happy with it.  I spent much time researching compact mp3 players and the zen stone was at the top of my list beating out the ipod shuffle.  It is almost identicle to the ipod shuffle but with a sleeker design and just as many features.  Also its the most bang for your buck.  I would recommend the zen stone to anyone who is looking for a compact player.

<Title>Zen Stone ... very nice
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one of these for my nephew and was very impressed.  I didn't install the propriety software but was able to simply plug it into my USB and drag and drop a few mp3's onto it as if it were a hard drive.  The only thing I didnt care for the manufacturer's color of 'green'... ugh!  It was my nephew choice, and he picked it sight unseen.  If it was going to be mine, the first thing I'd do is find a new case.

<Title>Creative has done very well
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While not as glamorous as the ipod shuffle, Creative has provided a low cost alternative that is simple to operate and is sturdy. The size is very convenient. The only down-side is that you either have to purchase a separate wall-charger or have your computer on after the 10-hours of constant use

<Title>Nice
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is a very nice little mp3 player with a low cost.  I am happy with it after using it for about a month.  It did crashed once.  Then I format it and it's fine now.   pro - low cost - easy to use and upload songs (just drag and drop, no software required)  con - personaly, I like bar shapes better than small rectangular shapes.    my little experience it's okay that it crashed.  Just format it.  If it's like the computer is not responsing to the mp3 player, be patient and wait for a few minutes.

<Title>Lime Green Music
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been wanting another, smaller mp3 player to complement my Zen Vision M, which I have had for 2 years or thereabouts.  I wanted a flash based player that I could throw around more.  I chose the Stone since I have been buying Zen players for years, plus it was green (like my laptop and Zen V:M).  This is certainly a better deal than the ipod shuffle--I don't think I could shell out 80 bucks for something without a screen.    The skip folder switch is very handy for quickly going through the music on the player, though I wish it had something similar for going backwards.    I thought about getting the Sansa Clip, which has been getting some good reviews and has a similar price, only with a screen--but the Clip doesn't come in green... and I had to make a decision.  So: the stone is a very nice, attractive, low price, and easy to use (drag and drop interface)

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-8669651-5871251">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Creative has fixed some of the software issues.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Great little MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this after doing some research on small, flash-based mp3 players that I could go jogging with. I have a 30gb iPod but was concerned with all the bouncing it did while I ran. These zen stones got good reviews. So far, it's great. It charged up faster than I expected and all I did was drop files into a "Music" folder. While it is disappointing that it does not support OGG format, I expected it from reading the specs. Also works flawlessly with Ubuntu. The color of the player is much better than in the picture. It really is a cute lime green, not so much a fluorescent yellow color as depicted.

<Title>gotta love creative zen!
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Creative MP3 players are great!  I have 4 of them in my family and love every one.  No need to use software or music download sites, just plug it in and it shows up like a hard drive on your computer.  You can then just drag and drop files to it, uplug, and go!  Its that easy.  Great sound quality, and easy to use.  What more could I want?
