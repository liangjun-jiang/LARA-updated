<Product Name>Coby MP-C7092 MP3 Player with 2 GB Flash Memory with FM & Color Display
<Title>The buttons don't know what you are trying to tell them.

<Content>Budget mp3 player that doesn't work as well as most other brands.  There is a delay when pressing the buttons of up to 3 seconds before screen changes or other actions.  Sometimes when pressing a button for one action (such as menu) it will bring up another action (such as volume).  Due to the short battery life it is not worth the time it takes to push play (less than 5 songs per full charge).  I made the mistake of researching this unit after buying it, apparently these issues are inherent with the Coby brand mp3 players. However, it does play 2GB worth of songs if you are leaving it plugged into the computer (what's the point of that?) or a USB compatible stereo.  The color display does have good picture quality.  I would recommend going with another brand.
