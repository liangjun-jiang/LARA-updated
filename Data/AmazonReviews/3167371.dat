<Title>My first iPod...
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my iPod straight from Apple a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW!  The capacity is great and fit my needs perfectly.  The sound is absolutely amazing - it's as good as any portable CD player, if not better.  The look of the 2nd generation is very sleek and I'm digging the scratch-resistant metallic feel of it.  While some feel it's too small, I think it's perfect.  It fits in the hand perfectly and is very intuitive.  The menu design is easy to navigate.  I also like the fact you can "lock" the volume bar so it can't go past a certain point and that you can also lock the screen, turn of the backlight, and all the other functions this little gadget has.  All in all, this is one of the smartest buys I've made in recent years and will last me (hopefully) a few years.

<Title>One thing to 'whine' about
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love the new nano, fantastic improvement over first-generation counterpart.  Only caveat: When I purchased it, every time I turned it on it emitted a high-pitched whine (the iPod itself, not the music or anything) that was REALLY grating on the ears, even when listening with the headphones on. I brought it to Apple and they replaced it, no questions asked... the new unit works just fine. I've heard this is not a common problem, but just so you know, listen for that whine.

<Title>Wonderul Design and Function
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a mini that I loved and replaced it with the first Nano. I sold that one to buy the new one and I'm pleased with my trade up. The unit's new case gives me the security I didn't have with the first gen. And the sound does appear to be improved - posibly due to the better design of the new earbuds.  I don't bemoan the lack of Fm radio, voice recording etc. since I bought this to listen to music, books and podcasts. I try to avoid the radio and if I want those other features, I'd buy something specifically for that.  All told - elegant design, simple function control and durability. Oh and the battery life is greatly improved.

<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod nano rocks. I just got one, green, and it is so cool.  Pros: Light, fits anywhere, and it is COLORFUL. It holds a thousand songs and the battery lasts all day. Pictures look nice too. And the sound quality is great.  Cons: Doesn't play video but that doesn't really matter. Might be too small for some.

<Title>maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do.  The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the "do not disconnect" screen.  I have found no support phone numbers to call. If/when I figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, I may update my review. But as of now, I am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration.

<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Title>The Mini Mini
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been reeling over when to buy a new ipod for a long time now. I have a 3rd generation 10gb ipod that I got for Xmas in '03 and it was immediately filled to the brim with music. I have probably used the thing every day since I've had it but the battery isn't what it used to be and I have to charge the thing for a good hour and a half during my work day just so I can listen to it for the last few hours. This has become an inconvenience for me considering that my job is extremely boring and the workplace is fairly loud and I find myself getting easily frustrated without music. The new nano commercial certainly is flashy and very persuasive. I want to point out that the click wheel does not glow up at all-I think that Apple falsely advertises that it does and that they should look into changing this misrepresentation. I am sure that they did this in the commercial for a greater effect but I can bet that people who haven't seen it in person and purchase this item online will be a little disappointed when receiving it.   Considering how fast I filled up my 10gb ipod I was torn between getting the new 30gb model with 3 times the amount of space I had before, or, the nano with considerable less space but a much longer battery life. It was a very tough decision but I went with the 4gb nano because of its long battery life. I know that Apple is going to continuously have new and improved models so I decided that the nano could hold me over until a 30gb model with a better battery life (for music and videos) and other improved features comes out.   The nano itself... I would say that I wasn't all that impressed at first sight of the nano, it looked different than the previous nano and very similar to the mini which I thought looked silly. My impression has totally changed considering the fact that I haven't been able to put the thing down since I got it last week. I can't stop holding it and marveling at how compact, light and sturdy it is (compared to the previous model). The screen is colorful and bright and I am happy with the resolution of the photos (albeit on a really small screen). The new headphones are an improvement since the previous ones didn't fit in my ears too well. I haven't noticed much of an improvement regarding the sound quality but I am extremely satisfied since these are more comfortable in the ears than the previous model, the cord is longer, and they also will not wind up together since they are separated by a handy little piece of rubber that you can adjust to your preference.  Some small gripes...I have noticed that the games tend to slow down at times, not really a big deal since these games get boring within the first 2 minutes of playing them. Transitioning from one screen to another isn't as smooth as on the other models--probably due to the fact that the nano is flash drive based. The click wheel isn't the most stable and certainly takes some getting used to. I have noticed that turning the backlight on and off isn't as easy as it used to be. On my older Ipod all I needed to do was to hold down the Menu button for a few seconds for the backlight to turn on. It isn't possible to do that anymore so you have to make sure that the backlight settings are turned on. I also would like to say that my previous model came with a white plug that you can put into the data outlet to protect the outlet from dust and other hazardous circumstances. I think that the little piece of plastic is essential to the life cycle of the ipod and it should be included with every Ipod model.   All in all I couldn't be more pleased with this item. I would definitely advise you to purchase a case that would shield the nano from everyday hazards. The new anodized aluminum casing should protect this item better than the previous models which were easily scratched. I will probably purchase a case from Otterbox when it becomes available because it appears that it will be the best protection available for this fragile investment. Hopefully I won't regret not getting the larger storage model but as of right now I am 100 percent satisfied with my new ipod 4gb nano. It has all that you really need in an mp3 player.

<Content>The product itelf seems to be fine. Shipping time was minimal. However the packing of the product was substandard. The box it arrived in was crushed on one corner due to no packing material around the product inside the box. The plastic case was therefore scratched on the outside. A little more care in packing the item might prevent damage in future orders.

<Title>Close to perfection
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To hold this iPod is to be amazed. It is almost lighter than air - any thinner and it would slip through your hands. It is truly remarkable that something so lightweight, so small can do so much. My less than perfect rating is for the screen size and lack of firewire support. As I creep into my late 30s, I simply cannot read text that small anymore, and playing solitaire on that screen really hurts my eyes. The definition & brightness in the screen are truly remarkable, however. I truly miss the firewire iPods. On a Mac, synching was just faster w/ the firewire models - and if I'm on an older Mac that has USB 1.0 and FireWire, I would prefer firewire, but am stuck using USB. *sigh*  The small size means you can forget you have it in your pocket - so you should really have a case to protect it. I've talked to some folks who have accidentally left this in a pocket and then put it in the laundry. Adios ipod. Electronic components & water rarely make good dance partners.  I have more than enough audio (especially podcasts) to fill up one of the new 80GB video iPods, but I bought the new Nano for the Nike+ support - seems like a smart match - running/walking w/ an iPod that is so lightweight it doesn't bounce around and it has no moving parts to get rattled. I do like the huge numbers in the display when using the Nike+ adapter.  The sound is excellent. A definite upgrade from the Mini - even the center select button has matched color. This is a piece of futuretech - available to you now - and it works!

<Title>Nano is fantastic
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an ipod for 4 years. I have an original 5 gig Ipod and fell in love with it back in 2002. It still works great and battery life is still good. I was thinking of getting a new 30 gig ipod with video but received the 4 gig nano as a gift.  So far I love my nano. The size is just right, the screen is very bright and clear, and battery life is very good. The only thing I don't like is the headphones. I have never liked Ipod headphones but thought the new Nano headphones might change that, they didn't. For me they just don't fit well so sound fades away very easily. They also fall out easily when on a run or walk. I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones and when you match them up with the nano the sound quality is fantastic. For walks or runs I use a cheap pair of nike headphones that wrap around your ear.   I picked up the Nike + integration device and a pair of Nike + shoes to track runs and walks. For the price this is the best addition to your Nano if you like to walk/run with your nano. The shoes are a little expensive but not much higher than most shoes today. The adaptor integrates so easily anyone can use it. It provides a great way to track your workouts.   Overall, I love my Nano. For the features, Itunes integration, and many offered accessories for the Ipod, I'm not sure why anyone would buy anything but an Ipod. Good luck to the Zune, you'll need it.

<Title>Improved? Nano Won't fit my Dock/Speakers now!
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After exhausting research and sound testing, I purchased speakers, only recently, for the Nano (perhaps the best available portable speakers now, Altec-Lansing InMotion IM7) and the new improved, second generation Nano will not securely fit into the dock of these beautiful speakers! Why did Apple feel the need to move the docking and headphone jacks? Whatever happened to backwards compatability in electronics? The Nano will fit but  only if you don't use the supplied Nano adapter which holds it snug in it's dock. It will now have to sit loosely while docked and so there goes my portability with this system and lose one of it's many/best features that made the IM7 a solid choice over the Bose and the Apple Hi-Fi. I hope  Altec dsigns a new adapter for this generation Nano. I suppose I have to buy new Apple speakers/Dock made just for this unit. That is until the 3rd generation of Nano comes along that won't fit in the second generation designed speaker/dock accessories. What a joke! I am in the process of trying to cancel my order for the Nano before they engrave it. Originally I wanted the Sandisk Sansa e270 because it had more memory, bigger screen, will play video and pictures, not to mention FM radio and additional 2GB storage via SD memory disk and easy user battery change. It was also considerably cheaper. But... It would only play on my InMotion speakers by using the aux in cable... so I balked on the Sansa  opting for the Nano's docking ability instead. So much for that. Goodbye Nano, Hello Sansa.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sansa. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them.  I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected!  I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. (update 12/2006- found a case just like my other one, but this one is actually made for the 2nd generation nano! Fits perfectly!! Got it at Radio Shack. They allowed me to trade it in for the other one that actually fits.) I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs.  People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips! I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sansa. This new nano is a must have!

Sadly, it just didn't have the audio punch and unique size/shape of the 2nd gen Nano. So I, "Traded" my wife my super-shiny brand new iPod Video for her scratched-up 4GB Pink Nano 2nd gen, and I absolutely LOVE it. It's the perfect size, amazing battery life, crystal clear audio quality, and fits anywhere in my car. I am a guy and even my friends think the pink one looks cool haha! This thing is a classic.

<Title>Worst Purchase Ever!! 
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Ipod Nano for Christmas last year. It has been nothing but trouble from the start. To begin with, I had to exchange it the first week I got it. The original Ipod I was given was not recognized by the computer so I could not charge it and I could not download any music. So then I exchanged it for a new one which is recognized by my computer. This one worked much better except that it would randomly choose not to play some of my songs. They will begin, but then suddenly stop and skip on to the next song. The songs play just fine on the computer and on cd. They simply do not want to play on my Ipod. The latest thing is that, in the last few months, my Ipod has started to freeze. I will go to select a song or just advance to the next song, and it will just freeze up. It won't play music and the screen won't advance. Since there is on/off switch and the battery is not removable, I simply have to wait for the battery to die and then recharge the Ipod before I can get it to work again. This is an awful product. My first advice is do not buy an Ipod. My second advice is do not buy anything that does not allow you to replace the battery and make sure  it has an on/off switch.

<Title>IPOD did not work
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My IPOD did not work, and I spent over 6 hours on the phone with Apple tech support, calling 6 different times at 45 min-1.5 hours each call, and the product still did not work properly.  It would randomly stop playing songs and would skip to other songs, when they would work fine on the computer or as a single file.   I am never buying a refurbished product from here again.

<Title>Very good mp3 player...for a while

<Content>I recieved the 2nd Generation iPod Nano blue about 1 year ago. I loved the bright, beautiful color and aluminum coat. But, Apple claims that the coat is scratch resistant, but it's not. It's gotten scratches all over, and the aluminum is sort of easy to chip and dent, and I have barely even dropped it! The screen is very nice though with barely any scratches but after a few months, a black line appeared from one side of the screen to the other. I don't know why. I called the Apple company and said I needed to get a new one.  The sound quality is great, but Apple earbuds are really disappointing. My family had a total of 3 pairs of the "new" earbuds and one had barely ANY sound out of them, and the other 2 were staticy after a few days. No destruction was done to cause this. Apple needs to produce better earbuds.  From what I've seen, the iPod Nano isn't nearly as slow as iPod Videos. Unfortunately, the Nano still freezes sometimes.  Being the only second mp3 player I've had, it's pretty nice. But I recommend buying a case and ejecting it EVERY single time you disconnet it from your computer because I think not ejecting mine made the random black line on the screen.  4/5 stars

<Content>I bought this last year for my teenage daughter for Christmas - she has been very happy with this.  Batteries have good charge time, usually takes a while for these to deplete.  Good video and audio quality.
