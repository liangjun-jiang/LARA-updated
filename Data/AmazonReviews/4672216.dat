<Title>Great when it works!!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I loved this PSA player, and then it stopped working two weeks after I received it.  The computer software could not recognize the player and made changing the music impossible.  Also, the player stopped working.  I found out, dealing with Sonic Blue customer service is a NIGHTMARE.  It looks as if I MAY get a new player 1 to 1.5 months after I returned it due to lack of stock on their part.  The player itself was sleek, and easy to use, but<br>eats batteries fast.  Rechargeables are needed to make it cost effective.  All in all, the player is a good design, Sonis Blue and their warranty/customer service get a zero for their help and support.

<Title>The only MP3 player for athletes
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I've had the PSAplay120 for 3 months now and I absolutely love it.  It's light weight, it's durable, and the sound is incredible.<p>Nike/Rio have supplied many features which make this the ideal player.  The arm strap and belt clip offer two different methods for wearing this player, depending on your activity.  The player is designed so that you can easily control it without having to look at the buttons (great for when you are running).<p>Now I just need to get my 64MB MMC card and I'll be able to load over 150 minutes of workout music.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I love this thing.  Its so lightweight and perfectly designed for running with, unlike most other mp3 players.  Some tips for others to note with this device, and some for all such devices: although mp3 is the most widely used format, wma offers the same qualty for less space thus giving you more music.  Also, and this is important to know for this device, the sandisk cards are the only ones guaranteed to work all the time with the nike players, the other brands have been found(by the sonicblue development team) to work only part of the time.  Make sure you get a sandisk card so you dont end up getting burned and then taking it out on the good folks who made this wonderful device.

Since head phones are about 5 bucks they don't detract a whole star from a 200 dollar product. Other than that none of the other problems are that annoying, the lack of features is made up for by the remote control which makes it so easy to change tracks that you can listen to whatever you want. Not being able to change the battery when the belt clip or arm band are attatched is ok because chances are when you are running you don't have a battery any way and isf you do you can always just unscrew the thumb screw and change it. The last slight con is the arm band being a bit snug, this was unavoidable because if the band wasn't a bit snug the player would not be secure to your arm and it is no where near tight enough that it will ever cause any damage to your arm. I find that be putting the band over my shirt sleeve feel barely anything. Overall this is a great product and should be considered if you are shopping for a player even if you aren't an athlete.

<Title>Great Sound, User Friendly and  Affordable
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>After several hours of reviewing many types of players I decided on this one and I have not been dissapointed.  I was looking for a player with at least 1 hour play time so I decided on a minimum 64MB.  After my first download (about 15 seconds per song) I had 30 songs with around 2.5 hrs of music without the additional memory card!  I bought it for snowboarding and mountian biking so fancy controls and LCD was not a priority.  The software is great wants you spend and hour or so getting use to how it operates. Headphones are nice but I'll buy new ones that will allow me to wear a helmet. The face plate design with its controls is easy to operate without looking at it. The arm band works great and I can't imagine not having this option!!  Overall a great player and great choice!!

<Title>Not bad...initially.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>My player worked well for the first 2 months.  Unfortunately, I also had a lot of difficulty with my computer recognizing my player due to driver problems.  Dealing with Rio/Sonic Blue customer service is a joke.  I had to pay...just to speak to a technician and, at the end of the session, NOTHING was resolved.  I would seriously consider another player.

<Title>great for running
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>the player itself has been great.  Had to download the new firmware to stop the battery from draining when it went to sleep but after that it was fine.<p>The headset was too small for my big head and the remote control was useless to me because the combined length of the headset cord and the remote (which always popped off anyway) was too long.<p>If you buy a headset make sure it doesn't have the &quot;L&quot; type plug as these don't fit in well to the device.

<Title>Looks Great.   Looks Are Deceiving.
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Lightweight.  Easy to use.  And truly a piece of garbage.  I used it only three times (while running) before it went kablooey.  Waste of money (which I am now trying to get back).  Spend the cash.  Get a decent one.  NOT this one.

<Title>Slow downloading on external media card
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>It downloads songs to the player at a decent rate to the internal memory, but it takes twice as long to download songs to the external (extra card plug-in) memory.  Also, you really need to have a great battery charge to transfer songs or you'll get an error in the process.  I always put new batteries in right before downloading songs, then you can put the older batteries back in.  I can't wait until they put 4 times as much internal memory into this unit and give it a firewire interface.  ....what, I can dream, can't I?
