<Product Name>2GB Hydra MP3 Player Pink
<Title>Not good
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased this item - I am returning it.  Tigerdirect has been great however, the product does not accept .wma files with licensing.  So, if you download a song from a digital music store - you can sync it but it will not play because it doesn't support the licensing file.  If this is not an issue - the buttons worked but, there was a slow response time from pressing them and the unit responding.  Features were good but product definitely came up way short!!

<Content>Questionable quality... the menu button broke right out of the box...I did not care at the time, it was a cheap price, I just needed a mp3 player for my bike ride, after using it for a few weeks it died.  I tried reformatting the player, no dice... I now have a slow 2GB Flash Drive.
