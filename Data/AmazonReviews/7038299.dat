<Title>Great little MP3 Player

<Content>I bought one of these mp3 players almost two years ago. It was my first one. I have carried it with me everyplace. The paint on it is now wearing off. It still runs perfectly. The sound that comes out of it is still fantastic.  I never really used the software that came with it. I just dropped the MP3 files on it. It is very easy to use.  It doesn't have a ton of memory (I later bought myself an Ipod and willed this one out to my Mom), but as a simple, starter mp3 player it can't be beat!    
<Overall>5
