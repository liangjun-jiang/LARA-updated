<Title>What a great buy.
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third Samsung mp3 player. I own a YP-MT6Z, a YP-T9, and now this. I'm really thoroughly impressed with this player. The touch screen interface simplifies some tasks, such as quickly finding a song in a list. No more multiple button presses, just scroll your finger down to the song and tap.  The screen is beautiful and clear. They give you two screen protectors, but I'm horrible at applying them, so I just keep a microfiber cloth handy.  it comes with a nice mini stand that allows you to prop the device up at an angle while it's on a flat surface. That way you don't have to carry it in your hand while you watch video.  Video is clear and smooth. Be certain to configure the media studio to encode at 30 fps, because it defaults to 15, and that's too choppy.  I don't have bluetooth headphones, but I'd love to use that functionality. Turn it off if you don't have the headphones, though (it is on by default).  The ability to hear your music while browsing the other menus is really good. I can play a song, go through some photos, change some settings, build a playlist, and never have to worry about my current song stopping.  Gesture based functions come off without a hitch. Personally, the earbuds provided do not stay in my ears, but they do provide a decent sound quality.   I definitely recommend this. If I had any complaints, it would be that it doesn't come bundled with a pair of bluetooth headphones, and that there is no way to charge it without a usb port. Oh, and a carry case couldn't have hurt.  EDIT: I've since updated the firmware and if I could give an extra star, I would. The bluetooth functionality they added really boosts the value of the device. Out of the box, it can already pair with a set of bluetooth headphones, but as of December, it can also pair with your phone. If you've been wondering what the mic on the bottom of the device is for, that would be it. You pair it with your phone, and when you get a call, you get a tone in your headphones to let you know a call is coming. Take out your P2, answer the call, and speak through the mic while you hear them on the headphones. It's great. You can also add your address book to the P2, so that you can see specifically who is calling just as you would on your phone. I've used this with my Blackberry Curve, and it's really great. I was easily able to send my address book via bluetooth over to the P2, and call quality was pretty good.  I had a little trouble with the file transfer, but I'm blaming myself for that, not the device. Pick this one up.

<Title>Do not use this pice of poop
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had used this freak mp3 player. Here is reasons why I am saying piece of poop. 1. SOUND : I can tell this mp3 has the best sound quality. BUT!!! Nothing good beside sound. 2. Video : Holy Poop. Everytime, you have to convert video clip in to .svi!! How bad is it....Furthermore, quality of video sucks. 3. Picture : IPOD TOUCH is better! Slow slide show. 4. TEXT VIEW : KILLS YOUR BATTERY!! 5. RADIO : YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!! YOU WILL NOT HEAR ANY CHANNELS. USELESS!!! 6. DATACAST : WHAT THE HELL!! USELESS FUNCTION. YOU WILL NOT USE THIS KIND OF FUNCTION IN THE FUTURE. UNLIKE TOUCH, YOU HAVE TO UPDATE EVERY NIGHT!!! 7. BLUETOOTH : HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS. AT LEAST BLUETOOTH WILL COST YOU $40. YP-P2 8GB + BLUETOOTH = IPOD TOUCH 8GB 8. GUI : ONLY 3 DIFFERENT TYPES. 9. LIMITED DEGREE OF FREEDOM IN YOUR MP3 10. LOTS OF DIFECTIVE DOTS ON SCREEN 11. SLOW REACTION (TOUCH SENSOR)  RESULT : Yp-P2 has bunch of problems. YOU WILL REGRET!! I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY OTHER PRODUCT!

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it.  Works great, the battery life seems good, the buttons on the sides are pretty handy, being able to set up your own background is nice.  The only two complaints I have are that it is new (ie doesn't have many accessories out yet) and it makes it very easy to watch my favorite movies during class...

<Title>A good mp3 player, but not user friendly.
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave this product 4 stars because it not the easiest thing to get content on to. The player itself was simple to use. The menus on the screen has small icons. Not recommended for first time mp3 owners or persons with large fingers. Video conversion time can vary depending on the size and file type. From my experience it takes about the same amount of time as the video file or less, keep in mind that I have a 6 year old desktop. Conversion may be faster for new computers. When converting make sure to choose the highest settings for quality.  pros * light weight * clear and bright display * 1 free thin screen protector, not factory applied * great sound quality  cons * play lists are not as simple to make and sync as itunes * the shuffle for music is off by default, you have to turn it on from the menu * according to the manual, which i read after buying this player, all videos must be converted to .svi before it can be transfered

<Title>An awsome mp3 player, but dissapointing at the same time
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Seeing that this was a highly rated mp3 player, I had high expectations for it. The screen, videos, and pictures on it look absolutly beautiful, and the touch screen didn't take long to get used to. I love everything about it except the one thing that counts the most when it comes to high end products like this, sound quality! It sounds good mostly, but it lacks real punchy bass, and it distorts easy when increasing the bass in the EQ. My other mp3 player is a Cowon U2, the sound quality on it is an audiophile's dream. But with a measly 1 gig of memory, and not designed to play videos I want something else, good sound quality is a must for me!

<Title>Samsung does not give information about their products.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great product if you do all your research. Samsung did not give any resources on the bluetooth ability of this product(the only thing that seperates it from any other product). Samsung makes Bluetooth stereo headphone called Samsung SBH170 for $69 to $89. You can use two with the YP-P2, but only one will control the player. They should have just improved on the YP-T9B(bluetooth model they never brought to the U.S.)it was a much more sleeker model and more ergonomic(it would fit into your front pocket of your jeans)the P2 is bulky and looks like an old Ipod. The radio does not work with bluetooth(Samsung failed to mention this). On their site they show pretty pictures but no helpful information. They even still show one of their T9 models on explore lineup but when you click on them it takes you to MPfreedom that cuts out the T9. They do not like to update their site as this player the YP-T9B bluetooth is still yet YTB announced release date.

<Title>Does anybody elses feel like there is something loose inside?
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got mine in the mail today and I love everything about it except that fact that it feels like there is something loose inside of it.  Last time I checked there were no moving parts inside of an MP3 player.  Has anybody else experienced this?  Other than the loose feeling its a great player!
