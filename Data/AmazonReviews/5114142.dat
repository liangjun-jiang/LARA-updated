<Title>So far so good
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had an MP3 player before that only lasted a few months before not working anymore.  From what I read, this is not unusual.  This time I bought the Zen Stone 2GB because of the price and lack of negative reviews.  The controls don't always work  well, sometimes it switches to radio when not trying, or won't turn on or off easily.  Also, it seems like the battery needs charging more often than they say.  But it was easy to load the songs from RealPlayer, and delete and add songs.  I bought a generic charger from Radio Shack so I could charge it from an electric outlet rather than the computer (for trips).  It includes a car charger.  This for approx. $30, same as Creative's AC charger.  I'm hoping this will be the last MP3 player I have to buy for a long time.

<Title>Zen Stone Plus

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5QIFS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Creative ZEN Stone Plus 2 GB Blue</a> I just go the Zen Stone Plus and I think it's a great product. Its so easy to download CD and the sound is great as well.  The best part is if you don't want to listen to the downloaded music you can always put the radio on. Definately recommend it.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software + Nice extras like stopwatch function  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6671655-7010068">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Perfect for younger child
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter. She wanted an MP3 player like her 13 year old brother, but I wanted to make sure it was something easy to use. At the same time, I didn't want to make a big investment until I was sure she could be responsible with it. Well this little player does everything she needs it to do. The day she opened it, with some help from dad, the Zen Stone Plus was charged and was loaded with music. She likes the screen that tells her what song is playing, and she likes the option of listening to the radio. The lime green color also makes it very "cool".

<Title>Stay Away
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered three of these and NONE of them worked. They performed when plugged into the computer, but failed to hold a charge once disconnected from the PC. This was after the tech-support recommended "all night" charging.   By way of background, I'm fairly computer savvy, have a new PC based system, and spent hours on the phone with Creative tech support trying to fix the problems. Ultimately, I had to return the units.  Stay away.

<Title>Useless and Creative's Cistomer Service Department stinks
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If this is your first venture into MP3 players like it was mine DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this device. First of all, there is no legally downloadable music to play on this thing. Nothing is compatible. But, go to their website and click on the "Fill Your Zen" link from the Zen Stone Plus 2GB webpage and it gives you all kinds of links to compatible services. Go to the service, sign up for it, and Guess What? It's not compatible. But wait!!?? They advertised that it was? Now try to get help from customer service. They talk in circles, oh yea, by e-mail only... and then to top it off you have to wait at least 24 hours between e-mails to get answers that get you nowhere. In the last e-mail I got customer service finally told me..   "[We] Apologize for any inconvenience caused from this experience. Please allow me to assist you further in resolving the issue.   Prior sending us an email, our website suggested some solutions for the issues that you are having. Some information that I provide might be repetitive, but I want to get you the solutions that have highest probability of resolving your issue.   I regret to tell you that Zen Stone Plus doesn't support Online Music Subscription Services. Therefore you won't be able to transfer any of the online music that you have subscribe whether it is itunes or Yahoo!Unlimited."   Well now, there's some help. All that stuff that they linked me to on their website, its not compatible. And I'm not comfortable downloading pirated music. So now what? I've got a device that does not do what the website said it would do. I call that false advertising and, Oh Yes...hmmm, its a piece of junk.

<Title>So cute and easy to program
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player I didn't have to fiddle around with and this one really fits with my tech skills, which are low. The sound quality is very good too. The only thing that didn't last were the earphones - one of the pads came off the 2nd time I used it, but it's no big deal as I had another set. Overall, I'm very happy with the product.
