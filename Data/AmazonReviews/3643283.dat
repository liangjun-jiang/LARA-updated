<Product Name>Creative Zen Vision W 60GB MP3 and Video Player - Slim
<Title>Slim is in
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Prior to purchasing the Zen Vision W 60GB Slim I looked at several different options, including the 30/80 GB ipods, the Zune, and of course, Creative's other products, such as the Zen Vision M and the regular Zen Vision W.  I picked the Zen Vision W because of the screen size, the capacity, and because I wanted a device that could tackle both my movie needs and my music needs.    The Good: 1. Just as slim as the 30GB model.  I personally felt the normal 60GB version was slightly hefty.  This is a great size for a media player that can play movies. 2. Awesome for movies--just the right screen size--I wouldn't want it any smaller. 3. Easily replaceable battery, which none of the aforementioned players have.  If I want another 4.5 hours of movie time, I can just pop in another battery.  If the battery dies on me one day, I don't have to deal with any replacement programs. 4. Extremely easy to transfer music and movies with the media manager that comes with it.  It's also a cinch to convert movies if they need converting. 5. Supports DivX and Xvid movie formats. 6. 60 GB size is just right for plenty of high bit-rate music and movies 7. Comes with AV cable to hook up to the TV.  Great for showing pictures, music videos, or movies.  It's also a no-brainer--you just plug it in.  The Bad: 1. I wasn't hugely impressed with the sound quality (not that it's bad--you just have to mess with the EQ settings to get what you like--and that isn't too hard, just annoying) 2. It lacks the no-stops playing feature (i.e. from song to song) that the i-pod has. 3. Not suitable for working out--it's simply too big.  The Zen Vision W is best enjoyed sitting down.  Bottom Line: If you are interested in watching TV shows or movies on your media player, this model is a great choice.  The wide screen makes watching media a great experience, and it's still great for listening to some tunes while on a plane or in a car.  If you are looking for a media player mainly for listening to music on the go, this probably isn't the right choice for you because of the size.

<Title>Title Says Slim But Dimensions Show Depth of 1.04"
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision W 60 GB model comes in two sizes, one thinner than the other.  The thinner version has a depth of 22mm, which is about 0.866 inches.  But note that the description of this product (at the time I wrote this review, perhaps they will correct it if it is wrong) is as follows:  Size WxHxD - 5.27 2.95 1.04  1.04 inches is the depth of the thicker model, not the thinner one.  The dimensions quoted for this player on the Creative site are:  	134mm x 75mm x 22mm  which is about 5.27" x 2.95" x 0.866"  So, if you are looking for the thin model, see if they have changed the above part of the description, and, if not, you might want to inquire with the vendor to confirm the actual depth of the player.

<Title>The Mp3 To Beat
<Date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all i would like to thank Creative for this much Talked and awaited audio/video MP3. I'm a video enthusiast for the past 30 years way back during the Betamax generation. Curently I'm an Ipod video owner and now thankfully I can say goodbye to this gadget.My prediction was right. It has always been screen size, screen size no matter what you do.This MP3 is the best I've ever had which fulfills every video honchos out there,lots of memories,screen size,various formats you can play with,usb wire which you can buy anytime anywhere,portability (it can still fit in my pocket),long battery life from New York to Paris,excellent picture quality,removable batteries,multiple functions like FM radio,storage for photos(by the way compact flash card is not the only thing out there). I wish you would provide for other formats.HOW ABOUT A JUMP DRIVE FOR GOD's SAKE. It has smaller slots than a compact flash card. I was so disappointed that your latest vision w I understand is only 15G. Although it has a better hard drive and looks slimmer than its predecessors people would always look for  bigger memories.My prediction on this race-whoever make the biggest portable screen and the biggest memories will win this market.Remember people are tired of carrying their CDs or DVDs. Everybody on this day and age wants portablity and versatility. This is the perfect MP3 that every video enthusiast must own. I would still pray for the jump drive and bigger memory.

<Title>Great player but crashes 
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The pros: nice, big, sharp looking screen.   Pretty good sound quality.   Dependable, strong sturdy body.  Removable battery.  Slot to insert a memory card from a digital camera and download photos directly to the player. I haven't actually used this feature yet though.  Comes with audio, video cables so you can run video from the mp3 player to your tv. Also comes with a charger, carrying pouch, and ear buds.   If you like Asian music, it comes standard with the language packs for Korean, Japanese, and Chinese script.   If you download the CD with the Window's Media Player, it shows the cover though it's a real small image. Also you can adjust the settings in the Window's Media Player (by hitting the Sync tab, selecting More Options. This makes a pop up with several folder tabs come up. Select the tab that says Burn, this lets you change the burning quality from 64 KPS to 32 KPS, It compresses the files which lets you add twice as much music and the songs still sound pretty good).   The battery lasts a long time. I listen to it about 5-6 hours a day and it still says it has half the battery, or it just goes to saying a quarter battery in the last hour of play.  Amazon Unbox works great for purchasing and running video.   Basically a really good all around MP3 player. I've seen where people say they don't receive the slim model. Mine is 7/8ths of an inch thick. The player looks really nice, it's easy to use, has a radio and a built in little speaker which I really like alot.  The Cons that aren't the fault of Creative:  They don't have anything like Itunes. You have to download your music from Amazon or some other website out there.  If you use the Window's Media Player to sync your MP3 player you have to go into the Sync options and turn off "Auto sync". Otherwise, it'll delete any songs on your MP3 player that aren't on the computer. If you use the Creative program that rips the music to your player, it sometimes won't find the names of the songs on the CD, when the Window's Media Player can.  I have a computer with XP that the software works great with. With my computer with Vista, it always says "No file associated" when I click on the icon for the Creative Media Player. This is one of the programs you can use to download music but its also the only one to download video and many podcasts.  The Con that is the fault of Creative.  With any MP3 player out there, you need to leave an amount of the memory empty so it will work well. When there isn't enough free memory, the player will start messing up, slowing down and crashing, resetting the player. I think on most players you have to leave a quarter of the memory free. On the Zen, when it crashes and resets it says "Rebuilding the Library" and it takes 10 minutes before you can back to listening to music. I would think leaving 15 GBs of free memory should suffice and that would let me put about 40 GBs worth of content on there but you have to leave half the memory free! I do have alot on there though. (4900 songs, 100 hours of Podcasts, and another 2 or 3 hours of video). It's a 60 GB player, says it has 29 GBs free. That's my 27 GBs worth of audio and video and the 4 GBs of software/firmware for the player. Now within 3-4 hours of play, it crashes 4 times, one time just 3 minutes after it just crashed. Each time it crashes it takes 10 minutes before you can back to your music.   That's fine. I'll take off a bunch of Podcasts and just have a few hours on there instead of almost a hundred hours. Then I'll have about 25 to 26 hours of content on my player. It does sound good, look good, has a cool built-in speaker, its well made, (everybody at work is jealous of mine) but it's frustrating that I can't put atleast 40 GBs worth of audio and video on it. Update: Ive figured out that the player crashes when I touch it. If I pause it, walk away for 10 seconds, then unpause it. Or if I'm in the car and touch it to skip a track or pause it. It crashes for 10 minutes. It appears a tiny, electric shock is causing the player to crash. I don't feel any shock myself but it happens too often to be a coincidence. It was crashing about 10 times a day, therefore unuseable for almost 2 hours a day. Now I turn it off when I leave my desk for a few seconds and it only crashes one to five times a day. I'm ready to send this one back though. I assume since I'm the only one that doesn't have glowing reviews that perhaps I received a defective model. Creative Zens are usually great products.
