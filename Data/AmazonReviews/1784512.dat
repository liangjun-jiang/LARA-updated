<Title>Sony Walkman NW-S7xx Series - Great hardware/sound - NO MAC SUPPORT - No drag & drop - Junk software
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The NW-700 series are a great bargain right now for people who want great quality in-ear noise blocking/canceling audio. The requirement that SonicStage software needs to be used to put files on the player is the absolute worst thing about this great hardware device. This is the one and only reason that this series of players is being sold out at 1/4 the retail price.  First, the sound. it's amazing! The buds really work on two levels, by blocking out sound (giving great bass) and electronic noise "reduction" that only works with the provided MDR-NC022 ear buds. Please be aware that these are NOT the Sony MDR-NC22 ear buds that are sold on the Sony site. the buds themselves look exactly the same. Those (NC22) have a device attached that provides the noise "reduction" separate from whatever player they are used on. These ear buds (the MDR-NC022) need this Sony NW-S700 series player to work at all! There is a notch on the 3.5mm mini jack that keeps you from plugging them into any other jack or music player. A few have engineered an adapter that lets you plug it into a device (by cutting a slot into a audio splitter) but there are none available for purchase. Doing this also defeats the noise canceling function - but they are top notch buds even without the N/C  Other ear buds and headphones may be used on the NW-S700 series with no problem - except the noise "reduction" feature will not work without the provided ear buds. If you loose these, or they break, the only provider for replacement is the Sony Service Center. They cannot be purchased anywhere else. The price is likely more than $49 (the lowest price I have seen for the 1 GB NW-S703 model - which aside from the capacity,is otherwise exactly the same player) from Sony Service Center. The Sony Style store will not take these in for repairs. You will need to return it to the seller. BEWARE!  The positives are many. Battery life is outstanding. The 3 min charge - for 3 hours of play is a big winning feature. The sound is the best of any portable music device that I have listened to. I have had HD based and flash based iPods as well as other flash players. It's awesome! The menu is fancy, but not nearly as good for finding what you want - when you want - as an iPod. It looks cool! It's great for walking and not needing to use two hands to change songs & the menu. Getting the hang of the menu will take some reading & trials.  The USB from the computer to the Walkman is another mistake - it's a proprietary Sony end on the cable, and if you loose it, or need another, you will likely be stuck with paying a quarter or half the original cost of the player. Available accessories are nonexistent.  The FM radio has worked well for me. The audio capture from line-in is very cool. It lets you select 128 or 256 kbs - and puts them in Atrac format. Not my first choice. To "capture" audio (real time only) away from a PC, requires a cable that has not been available on-line from any site that I can find. I purchased one at a SonyStyle store for $14.99 and I am wondering if they will ever become available again. Right now, the only way I have (at home) to put music onto the player is with this cable - importing the music from iTunes on my Mac. I HAVE BEEN AGAIN, AMAZED AT THE SOUND QUALITY. I may need to purchase a surplus PC JUST to use SonicStage. I have it on my PC at work, but it is such a poor interface to manage music that I feel like I am being punished by Sony for buying their product!  If you commute and want great sound that blocks out most of the city noise - and can handle dealing with the SonicStage software, this is a great player with very long battery life; solid hardware that will not fall apart; and just feels, looks and sounds like quality.

<Title>Excellent product by Sony
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this because I need another MP3 player that I could easily carry when I'm in the gym. I have a 30GB Ipod but I don't like its size which is too heavy and big for me to carry around in my pocket. Furthermore, I listen to music most of the time. Movie is just secondary.  I first plug in the ear bud that comes with the player and really AMAZED of the sound quality. Unbelievable top sound quality from an ear bud. How many times you will find those come-with earbuds are meant for the trash? But this ear bud is different because it has noise canceling function which reduce the ambient noise and really works well in the noisy place.  Battery life is excellent, about 4 or 5 times better than Ipod. Design is top-notch.   I find myself listen to this player more often than my Ipod because music has become more enjoyable!!

<Title>It's a Sony!
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This superlative unit is perhaps the finest portable audio/MP3 player on the market to date. I find it funny to say that, because this device crystallizes not only everything that is right about Sony, but most everything that is wrong about it, as well.   In a maddening repeat of the Sony story, the Sony Corporation was perhaps some ten years ahead of every other company on the world in developing high-compression audio using software algorithms to store sound data in computer-based files. In spite of that achievement, Sony was never able to successfully capitalize on the technology, primarily through a combination of missteps in advertising, pricing, and non-licensing of its proprietary technology. We sometimes watch with bemusement when we see today's MP3 aficionados, knowing that Sony was doing this type of thing - and doing it better - as far back as 1992, when it launched its first commercial MiniDisc player, the MZ1. For what was essentially an entire decade, those who worked with the MinDisc format enjoyed most all the advantages of MP3, and almost found ourselves chuckling to see the world "discover" lossy media recording some decade or so later, around 2001. It was also bemusing to watch the implementation of the technology in such open standards formats, primarily MP3, when an arguably superior encoding algorithm, the Sony ATRAC format, had been perfected for that entire timeframe, first with "S" and "R" variants, and then with even greater strides with the "ATRAC3Plus" algorithm. With such early work in the field of psychoacoustic encoding and the psychology of human sound processing, Sony played a key role in this technology's base, and helped make the entire domain possible.   And so as the story goes, Sony was able to capitalize on a ten-year technology lead, and completely dominate the MP3 world as they had done twenty years earlier with the invention of "Walkman." Everyone in the world used a Sony-developed portable audio player, and once again, Sony showed the world how it could translate their technological innovations into yet another product success story. Right? No, as usual in the recent past for Sony, WRONG. Sony managed to wrestle defeat out of the mouth of victory, and today, one can hardly find a Sony portable music player on the market, while competing companies sell their units at a rate that is seemingly limited only by market saturation. And that, too, is funny, because when one takes the time to check out a unit like the NW-7xx series, it is pretty easy to determine that the combination of an outstanding compression algorithm like ATRAC3Plus along with Sony's indisputable prowess at developing incredible audio hardware can result in a truly impressive product. In many ways, the NW-7xx series can be regarded as the pinnacle of a 15-year process in the development of portable audio equipment, the superb integration of digital computer technology with analog audio technology.   The NW-7xx series is a marvel of miniaturized audio technology. Sound quality is exceptional, the unit is designed with a style that is the hallmark of the Sony Design Center in Tokyo, and the operational control of the unit constantly reminds us that this unit truly is a "Sony," carefully thought out and executed with both technological and artistic flare. Ergonomic issues surrounding the use of small electronic devices have been carefully considered and marvelously addressed, and, in addition, pioneering technologies are implemented in the unit which are only now beginning to show up in other players. This is especially true of the use of OLED technology for the unit's display interface, which uses far less electricity than other display technologies, but is bright and attractive, and also the impressively functional, active noise reduction system which uses microphones at ear-level to create an inverse sound wave to cancel out ambient noise.   Features abound in this visually-striking device. Control is through a select few buttons, but the main interface is through a spring-loaded rotary knob, the design of which was successfully used in the earlier "Core" Sony devices. The OLED display is bright and clear, and even shows a full-color thumbnail of album art (if one has taken the time to capture the album art during ripping). Battery life is simply amazing, easily surpassing 40 hours under some conditions, and yet, is recharged at high speed, with only three minutes of recharge needed for three hours of play. (It may take 60 - 90 minutes to fully top off the battery, but this is still fast, considering the 40 - 50 hour playback time.) And because the battery is a lithium ion design, we have full battery readout on the screen to tell us the current battery charge level. The unit weighs only a few ounces, and is easily pocketed or worn around the neck with a strap.   Entering the menu system reveals a wealth of customizable features pertaining to operation and playback sound settings. There are multiple, customizable equalizer settings, adjustments for sound reduction sensitivity, "clear bass" technology, "clear stereo" technology, and a host of pre-configured, digital sound processing selections to imitate all types of sound fields. Noise reduction is accomplished through the use of the supplied headphones, which possess very small microphones in the earpiece component. (Other headphones using the small inch standard headphone jack size will also work with the player, but the active noise reduction will be disabled when doing so.) Is this a concern? Most people rate the Sony ear buds as one of the true "sleeper" headphones on the market today, churning out great sound quality in spite of their relatively low price. The headphones which come with this device, however, are even better than most other Sony headphones, utilizing a 13.5mm driver instead of the more typical 9mm driver found on other Sony ear bud headphone models.   The sound quality of the unit is simply superb. Using combinations of the noise reduction, equalization, and other settings, the player can produce playback that rivals much more expensive home systems, and surprisingly, due to the effectiveness of the ATRC3Plus algorithm, even at bit rates as low as 64 kbps. It's difficult to not be impressed, even upon repeated playing. And, yes, the noise reduction actually works. Take the unit into any noisy environment, turn it on, and watch the sound "floor" drop by a significant amount without any deterioration in sound quality. But it is the combination of elements - the high-quality circuitry, the outstanding headphones, and the sound processing options - that make the sound playback on the unit far surpass what we might ever expect from a portable player. So good, in fact, that the effect sometimes surpasses our home listening experiences.   With all these superlatives, why then would I say the unit also crystallizes everything that is WRONG with Sony? With Sony's advent into the world of media ownership (both music and video), the company moved into a semi-schizophrenic world that apparently pits the electronics division (which designs and manufactures hardware devices like the one reviewed here) against the media division (which sells music and movies). One could argue not unconvincingly that the two goals of such a move was not only misaligned, but perhaps opposed, to one another, with one group wishing to sell music DEVICES that play media, and the other wishing to control COPYRIGHT of such media. The result? A program called "SonicStage," the media ripper and control program for Sony portable media devices. And although it's not quite as horrible as some of its detractors make it out to be, the program is indeed slow and hobbled with DRM (digital rights management) that can be supremely frustrating even for the most basic of tasks. There are nightmare stories about the use of SonicStage (and some of them I've experienced, or witnessed, myself), and its presence alone more than anything else is at best the weak link in the use of the Sony portable digital players. This is the side of Sony that is probably most responsible for pushing people in droves into the arms of the now-famous and ubiquitous MP3 and iPod players. And while SonicStage has steadily improved over the years, it is still locked into DRM, and no Macintosh version exists to date. For a company that uses Macintosh in its own Design Center in Tokyo to create its award-winning designs, one can only wonder how such decisions are made.   The NW-7xx units are now showing up in some retail U.S. outlets at greatly reduced prices. The 4Gb units, until now sold exclusively in Europe and in Japan, are also showing up at discounts of up to 70%. As such, they represent one of the greatest bargains available for some of the most technologically advanced players on the market today. Sony may have more tricks up its sleeve, and we may soon see changes in the near future, perhaps another attempt to wrestle back some of the market share from the iPod. Even so, picking up one of these units now at sub-$100 prices is probably the portable electronics bargain of the year. If you can deal with SonicStage and not get too frustrated with its operation, you can enjoy one of the best sound experiences available today in portable electronics. Using one makes us remember with feeling the old marketing slogan: "It's a Sony!"

<Title>Gem of an MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Having done quite a bit of research on mp3 players, I settled on this Sony unit, and I haven't been disappointed.  As one other reviewer stated, the SonicStage software is not as user friendly as iTunes, but it's not as bad as some have depicted it to be.  For one, SonicStage does allow you to easily transfer music to different computers, by using the unit as the transferring mechanism, and there are no problems with registering units like with iTunes.  A few points though: i) from a practical point of view, this is a unique mp3 player because of the noise-cancelling feature.  I know when you fly long-distance there are distinct advantages to using noise-cancelling technology to relax you and take away the constant drum of the aircraft engines, which allow you to sleep more easily on overnight flights, but believe me, the people wearing these Bose headphones ( - even the on-ear Bose 3s) do NOT sleep!  I mean how can you sleep properly with huge great big cans on your ears?  They are sweaty, don't allow your head to turn, and for most people they end up giving you a headache.  The headphones that come with this unit, however, allow you to sleep...and also don't require batteries...and will continue for up to 60 hours!  What more can you ask for???   ii) Sony only provides the unit and headphones.  You really need the unit stand (available on Amazon) and also either the perspex holder with clip or the pendant to make the unit secure for moving around.   iii) this unit is not available through retail outlets in the US.  It is available in Canada, Europe and Japan though.  Consequently I'm sure repair is headache and getting accessories is not easy either ( - to get mine I had to use a friend in Canada).  Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase though, and would recommend it highly to anyone who travels a lot and wants the noise-cancelling feature.
