<Title>Flimsy, easy to drop.
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great item that Archos designed poorly. The still camera isnt all that great, takes blurry pictures. The video isnt great either; nice FPS but the sound is garbage. Plays great video. Has useless games on it that are also impossible to control because of the location of the buttons. Awful multi-use buttons for scrolling through menus, you lose track where you are in the menu process because none of the buttons are labeled and theres no indication on the screen of what you're supposed to click next. From the factory, the back part didnt fit well against the middle & couldnt get it to fit better; could welcome in dirt or moisture and wreck it.  Great battery life; it lasted for 6 days and about 9 hours of use before I returned it to the store and the level indicator was at 50%+. There is NOWHERE to put a wrist strap or lanyard and thats the main reason I returned it.  If this was redesigned with a no-slip design, case, or wrist strap and better menus, this product would rock.

<Title>Had Early Issues
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The unit seemed like it would do everthing that I needed for a vaction or school show.  One unit for MP3 or video watching on the plane, recording the kids at the beach or taking snap shots.  I opened the box and the camcorder and camera functions did not work.  All I had was a snowy screen for both.  It was sent in for repair...let's see what happens.

<Title>Nice all in one multimedia unit 
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player about 2 months ago. I like it. It's easy to transfer files to and from the unit especially since the unit can be connected to your computer as a Windows device and use Windows Media Player to transfer files or it can be connected as a hard drive and the files can be transferred as you would transfer files from any hard disk drive. I use it mostly for music, but I have also used it to take photos and to record video. The picture quality is just fine for me and I believe for most applications. It works well as a camera and a camcorder and it is simple and straightforward to use.  I don't like the carrying case supplied by Archos, it is thin and unpadded. The battery life is excellent. I am not impressed with the ear buds, but then again I don't like ear buds generally. Over all it is a nice unit. I haven't played any of the games, but it is a game player as well. It works nicely for me.  You need a carrying case for the unit because it can easily slip out of your hands. The menu buttons are large enough to actually use even with clumsy fingers like mine. I use music match jukebox and I wish it had the ability to sync with this unit, but it currently does not. (last time I checked)

<Title>Could be Great but...
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product has a lot going for it especially on the surface--you can use it as a camera (low megapixels), digital video camera (not too bad), MP3 player (just fine), mediaplayer (can be difficult to import media) and overall digital storage device. Yup a lot there overall and a good price as well so what's the real issue? Well mine fried, the video screen and therefore all menus and all use just gone for no apparent reason; although fortunately within the warranty period but still no fun. Another major flaw although this will seem minor is that there is no way to attach a strap to this player and therefore it is quite awkward to hold and use in it's camera capacities; as your one handed hold will often hit just on the tiny lens that is far off center on the back of the device. So way to go Archos on giving it the old college try and please go back to the drawing board, and include WIFI when you do!!

<Title>4 star on product when it works, 1 star on CS & Tech support

<Content>Bought this product in Dec 06 when it was around $200.  Not bad for 20GB and the loads of functions.  Works well the first three months.  Digital camera and Camcorder is not bad.  Quality is not the best, but it's useful in a pinch.  The MP3 shuffle is not a true random shuffle, it shuffles through the same path of MP3.  With the 20GB, it stores alot of Video & MP3 and although the screen is not the biggest, can't watch for too long, but is good if you need something to do or need entertainment while waiting in line or on the train. However, in April 07, harddrive started having issue.  Read error, can't read from hard drive and the whole thing started freezing up.  Called Archos RMA (return) department, told them the problem and they email me the RMA right away, but you have to pay for the shipping.  Took over 5 weeks to get the product back.  Looks like they upgraded the firmware.  Called to just confirm, they did upgrade the firmware and replaced the hard drive.  Used the product for less than a month, same issues.  Can't read from hard drive, hard drive error, product freezes up.  Called them again and they issued an RMA through email and since it's second time with the same issue, they will send me a free ship label so I don't have to pay.  That was 5/31/07, it is 6/11/07.  Called them at least 5 or 6 times to see where the ship label is, each time, waited at least 1/2 hour and more and they can just keep saying it's coming.  Take 72 hours, the person sending the label is not in the office.  No help whatsoever, alot of run around, no one seems to know what they are doing.  I have been on the phone today since 7:48pm, it is 9:20pm and am still on hold, have not talked to anyone at all.  This is the customer service or Archos after you have bought the product.  Very dissapointed and very dissatisfied.  And with the hard drive breaking twice within 6 months, not sure if it's really worth the hassle.

<Title>Good, not great

<Content>Pro:  watch divx movies, usb host to download photos from digital camera, sync with media player Con:  battery life so-so, interface is lousy, does not come with a real case  The 402 is pretty good if you can get it on the cheap.
