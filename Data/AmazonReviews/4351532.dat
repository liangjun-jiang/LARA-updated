<Title>Fussy Player 
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this little Rio over 2 years now, but have decided to move on.  The FM has never been good. Even in flat Chicago with powerful signals, the stations never came in well. The software interface is clunky - however the update I found on RIO's website is much better.  After it froze up recently, I called tech support and was recommended to purchase a "reconfiguered" replacement for half the price of a new one. No way. While the tech guy was reading through his manual, I ended up solving the problem myself. Don't look for help there. It's been spotty ever since.  It often stops and tries to "connect" to the computer - even when I'm miles away on a run. The headphones now only play out of one channel.  You've been OK for a little while, but never perfect. Time to move on, little RIO.

<Title>A must before you use the player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received this player as a christmas gift. I found the sound is amazingly well for this small size gadget. It also has an equalizer to change the music settings. I strongly recommend you to visit www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/ to upgrade the player firmware and the RIO Music Manager.   After the firmware upgrade, it will let you upgrade up to 1G of memory (SD or MMC memory card). I believe 512M is a basic necessity. It also let me play by my own playlist rather than all the songs I have in my player. I find this very useful, because I can organize the songs by album.  I love the sound quality and the small size. It is a good quality product.

<Title>There are better choices
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices. (I will be looking at a different company's players this time.)

<Title>Works Great Til It Doesn't...
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...then you are doinked BIG TIME. My S35S worked great for about the first six months; I had some of the same clip holder issues that others mention but I could live with those problems. What I could not live with was the unit's death and Rio's Customer DisService. I called and talked to someone who was pleasant enough and gave me a case number to fax along with the unit's serial number and copy of proof of purchase. This I did  according to their instructions. Waiting a couple of weeks I then called to get an update and was informed how busy they were and told to give them a couple of more weeks. A couple of months later I e-mailed them and received a reply explaining they were in the process of moving their warehouse and this resulted in the delay(???). Six months after sending them the information requested to implement repair or replacement I have nothing to show for my original purchase but a dead Rio and a worthless warranty. Ri(o)p-off. No more Rio in this household, period.

<Title>Does the job around the gym and outside
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Durable, light weight MP3 Player. (I must have dropped it around a dozen times in the gym, keeps working)  Good sound, after you replace the headphones that come with the unit.  To  enjoy the good sound you will need to get another headphone, (Sony and Panasonic have decent units for around $20.)    Poor FM receiption, limited playlist managment.  Volume not as lound if you plan to use them in the plane.  Could use a couple more dBs to be near perfection. Overall a basic, no nonsense,  durable unit to bring your tunes to the gym or outside.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I used mine over 8 hours a week for over two years in a gym.  It took many hard hits and continued to work.  It worked for 6 months even after the plastic case was cracked.  But the internal memory is starting to fail.  Perhaps using it in a steam room was just too much for it.  Very well made!

<Title>Great, But It Has a Few Flaws
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Sport is an excellent little mp3 player.  The sound quality is great as is the display. While, the original model came with only 128MB of internal memory, it has an SD slot making expansion fairly inexpensive, especially in 2005 when 512MB is available for $50.   In general, the construction is rugged with a rubberized enclosure apparently meant to reduce the affects of impact from dropping. It is also has a rather compact, odd shape that is probably less than ideal for someone wanting to store it in his pocket.    While there are a handful of small design flaws, two features that are particularly annoying.  First, it has a four position concave rocker switch that is extremely sensitive.  While this is great to use blindly with your thumb, it creates a real problem when placing the unit in a pocket as switch easily depresses, causing the RIO to change songs, stop, or pause.   In short, the Rio Sport is a decent mp3 player that could use a couple of minor interface modifications and feature enhancements  Pros Excellent sound quality Good battery life Rugged Compact  Cons Main concave control button very sensitive, too easily depressed  Plastic bracket interferes with buttons and jack Uses AAA batteries instead of AA    ****  Note that the technical description in Amazon is incorrect regarding the memory type and expandability.  It uses and SD card and can go over 128 MB in total.  My 512 MB card is working fine.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Rio for a couple of days now. It's been working great. The bundled software is not all that great, but if you have Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 then you can use that. The player has good sound and is really durable. The armband took me a minute to figure out but everything works great. The internal memory is a nice starting size. I was able to fit 54 tracks on my internal memory (64Kbps - WMA format). I bought a 128MB card for $18 and that works perfect and now I have over 100 tracks on my player. I've been hearing that the player can handle cards up to 512MB despite what the specs say. I haven't tested it so it's still a rumor to me.   In conclusion, for the price this player is a very good buy. I use it when i work out and the armband is a nifty way to keep the player close but out of the way. I'm not sure is the USB interface is version 1 or 2 but the interface is really quick. When I update my track listing it takes about 1 minute and a half to transfer 54 tracks to my player. Check the Rio site frequently for firmware upgrades. When I got mine i had to upgrade the firmware which is a sinch and take about 30 seconds to do.   Just to add, many have complained about how the player tends to slip out of the armband when you move excessively (ex. Running or jogging). I have to say that I use my Rio everyday while running and have yet to have it slip out of the armband. I run just like everyone else, and wear it while playing basketball also and it has not fallen once.

<Content>Rio no longer supports this model and the Sports case is cheap and breaks easily. Once it breaks, you are out of luck because Rio only carries replacement parts for their newest models. Do yourself a favor and buy something dependable with good product support such as Ipod, Iriver, or CreativeLabs..Leave Rio alone.

<Title>Amazing lil device
<Date>Fri Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was getting fed up of the talkshows in the morning and the advertising tirades in the evening on my sony tuner while working-out. I depend on music quite a lot for my running, so finally had to break down and buy an mp3 player. I am so glad I chose S35S, because it fits everything I had in mind. Light, tough, efficient and trendy. I upgraded to 256MB about a day after the purchase. The 128MB MMC (card) is about 80 bucks, but a good investment as it doubles the song numbers. I have about 100 songs in .WMA(the only way to go, since mp3 is usually about double the file size as wma) saved with some space left over, and with the shuffle mode on, working out to music is a breeze. Battery life is very good, about 10-12 hours on 1 AAA. I also upgraded to a Sony streetstyle (MDR57 ??) headphones which are much better than the supplied ones. The back-lit display and menu options are very easy to learn and operate.<p>The set up software couldn't be easier to use, with downloading and managing the songs the fastest I have seen.<p>There is a mail-in rebate offered by SonicBlue till January 03, so go for it right now, if you're in the market for a mp3 player for the fitness minded folks, or anyone for that matter. <p>The only negative is an abysmal tuner that fails to do anything, and will probably recieve a signal if you operate this inside a radio station. So that is a waste. And hence the 4 stars.<p>Counting that out, this is a great product, and since I am not missing the tuner at all, I would highly recommend this product.<p>An Update: After about a couple of months, I managed to crush my precious lil mp3 player under my truck tires in a freak accident. May be this would be an attestment to it's toughness, the display was broken, but the lil thing has refused to quit playing..Lets see your cd player beat that.

<Title>Finally a good sport MP3 player
<Date>Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been watching the roles of MP3 players for about 4 years now, waiting for a good one in the application for which MP3 was conceived:  sport.  Requirements:  decent resistance to the elements/sweat, high memory capacity, immunity to shock, light-weight, decent sound, decent comfort.  The RIO S35S meets or exceeds all of these.<p>128MB built-in has me covered for 1.5+ hours of activity; plenty for most people.  I'll get an expansion card anyways, just to have the option of more.  It's light enough that I don't even notice it on my arm when running.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and, surpisingly, I don't even notice them when running either.  It's case provides ample protection from my prolific sweat.  The sound, while not audiophile quality, is perfectly good for exercise.  I've been using a NiMH battery with no problem (it worked even better once I found the battery setting in the menues and switched it from alkaline to NiMH  ;-P).  <p>The radio reception is poor.  I didn't get it to listen to the radio.  If I wanted to listen to the radio, the are many sport models available at far less expense.  For me, the radio is just a last resort if the battery gets too low to play MP3s.<p>In all a very good player.  Maybe a little expensive, but less than competing models like the Nike, which doesn't even have the option of a tuner.  Enjoy!

<Title>Review for XP users
<Date>Wed Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S with some reservations after reading a few reviews mentioning problems with the diver installation on PCs running XP.  I just installed the driver and music transfer software on my PC (running XP) and had no problem at all.  If you just pug in the device and let XP detect and install the driver automatically it will NOT work, because Sonicblue is in the process of certifying the Rio S35S driver for Windows XP.  Since this certification is currently only in process the diver will not be automatically detected.  What did work is to first install the music transfer software from the supplied installation CD (the music transfer software is a different piece of software than the driver), restart the PC after the installation of the music transfer software, leave the installation CD in the PC, connect the player to the PC, turn the player on, XP will tell you that an new device was found, select the detect automatically option and click next (or continue), XP will search the and find the driver on the installation CD (which you left in the PC as mentioned above).  After the installation of the driver is complete, XP will tell you that the driver was installed and that the device is ready to be used.  Launch the installed music transfer software and you are ready to roll...have fun!!

The memory is nice, the FM radio is bad bad bad unusable-it is a non feature and shouldn't be advertsided (really it's false advertising to say it has such a feature and it doesn't work), the headphones are average, the music quality playback ok, I miss the ability to replay over and over a song, the rio manager software is ok. The size is 2.5 times bigger than i thought. I should of checked out the specs better. But for [the money] I paid  a more accurate rating would be 2.5 stars. Very average at best for the price.

<Title>Rio S35S
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>SONICblue Rio S35S Sport physical construction is ergonomic, nice looking and appears to be rugged. Exterior, made of a &quot;rubbery&quot; material, has a good feel and allows for a good grip when holding the unit. Lighted display is excellent and fairly easy to navigate through the menus. Joggers will have to stop and navigate through the menus to switch from player to radio (or vice vera) since there is no radio/player hardware button. Sound of audio player is decent.<p>Unfortunately, radio reception is poor. Earphone wires which serves as the antenna is sensitive to movement and the position of the device. S35S has a bass/treble equalizer but loses its settings in radio mode once the unit is turned off. Unit does not have much bass. When S35S is turned on, you may experience distortion for a few seconds, depending on settings. When unit is turned off in radio mode at a low volume setting, there is an annoying power/volume surge.<p>People considering purchasing the S35S will want this product because of its small size, nice exterior features and expandable player capabilities but will pass if an FM radio is important.

<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If you're looking for a little MP3 player for the gym, or running, etc., the Rio is perfect.  The only problem I've really had with it is that the radio isn't very strong.  That is, the stations don't come in very well.  Also, there's no &quot;hold&quot; button, so if you acidentally hit a button, you may skip a track or change the radio station, etc.  In terms of functionality and usefulness though, it's been great!

<Title>Rugged little unit
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. After much research (and knowing what she really wanted to do with it -- listen to music while working out) it appeared that this Rio model, although new, was the best fit.<p>My only beefs are with the included software. We should have been filmed by Apple as we were trying to install the software and connect the Rio to my wife's ThinkPad with Windows 2000. After about 20 minutes, I got so frustrated that I just plugged the thing into my PowerBook G4, downloaded the iTunes driver and let her load it up with songs from my MP3 library while I installed the various bits of Windows software.<p>The sound quality is great, the integrated radio tuner works well and its rugged design seems to be pretty, well, rugged. A good purchase!

The sound from the 35S was really annoying based based on the Real Jukebox files.  When I recreated the files using the Real 1 software supplied with the 35S, the sound quality out of the 35S improved dramatically!  All in all, the software package is is easy to install and use.  I use the player now have to admit it's a great unit for workouts.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to replace the headphones.

<Title>Extremely User Friendly
<Date>Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I transferred music to the player last night and it was extremely user friendly.  Anyone who has owned an MP3 player in the past knows that compatibility with your computer can make or break the performance of the player.  The box lists a minimum 64MB of RAM as a system requirement for this item, but I have an older laptop with only 32MB of RAM, and I still got the player to transfer music.  The only limitation was that I couldn't download the entire capacity of the player at once.  This is an issue that I believe would be resolved had my computer possessed the minimum system requirements. Overall, the software is intuitive and very easy to use.<p>The only negative feedback I have so far is that there appeared to be one flaw when I was setting the time and date of the player.  The player clock would not let me set a PM time in the 12 hour clock mode.  I had to change the clock mode to 24 hour (Army Time), and set the time that way.  Once the time was set, I changed the clock mode back to 12 hour and the clock reflected the correct time.  Overall, a very minor inconvenience.   <p>I have yet to use this player in the gym; however, I have found that this compact, light, and sturdy player remains secure when fastened by belt clip or arm band.  I will follow up in a few weaks to review the durability and playback performance of the player.

<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've owned this little MP3 player for about 3 weeks now and have spent about 15 hours in the gym with it.  It is extremely small and light weight.  It clips securly to my gym clothes (haven't needed the arm band) and doesn't get in the way no matter what excercise I'm doing.  The controls are user friendly enough that I operate it by feel.  The sound is very good and I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.<p>If it can handle the gym, I should work equally well riding bikes or jogging.  The player itself actually snaps into a soft, shock absorbent housing that protects the player and provides the belt clip.<p>Downloads have gone off without a hitch and the process is typical of a Windows application making it pretty intuitive.<p>If I lost this player, I would replace it in kind without hesitation.

<Title>A great mp3 Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this mp3 player and I am extremely satisfied with it. The player has a lot of functions including a stopwatch, FM radio, equalizer, etc... There are definitly no bugs in the program and very easy to use. <p>PROS:<br>1. Small (very small!!!), durable and handy<br>2. The software was excellent, no crashing, no stalling, and a fast transfer too! The program split the window into two parts, one is my library and the other is the files on the player. All the ID3 tags (tags that display the name, author, etc of a song)should be automatically added if you label them in Musicmatch, Real jukebox, or any other player. <br>3. Water and compact resistant (extremely durable, i even dropped it a few times on concrete and it still worked!)I ran in the rain once, it was working perfectly<br>4. Big LCD screen to display time, battery level, song title, song artist, album, a location thingy to display how far u are into the song, volume indicator, how much time left, how much time already past, and date. The resolution is very fine so the date and the time is not all distorted. <br>5. There are amazing functions including a treble/bass equalizer that doesn't distort the quality of the sound<br>6. The stopwatch includes laps, an average time, and the difference between each lap<br>7. The radio has a search option with 3 savable channels<br>8. A power saving capability to save power (cutting off backlight time and a saving power mode that acts like a screen saver)<br>9. A menu option to browse all the songs<br>10. Light and handy, i ran with it and almost forgot it was still clipped on my shorts<br>11. The cd also comes with iTunes and RealOne, both really nice music managing programs<p>CONS:<br>1. The big round set that has the Play, FF, RW, and Stop is easy to hit so you can't walk around with it in your pockets, on the other hand it is a good thing for running because no one would like to struggle pressing the FF button while keeping a even pace =)<br>2. The earphones aren't as comfortable<br>3. There is no remote control...<br>4. It uses an MMC card for expansion and MMC cards are usually 10 more bucks than Smart Media<br>5. It's a little thicker than most mp3's players (u can check up the dimensions) and its round shape looks a little babyish & toyish...<br>6. SONICblue boasts up to 10 hrs on one AAA battery, I only get around 5 hours....<br>7. no microphone...<br>8. there are no detailed instructions, just a quick start. The detailed instructions are found in the CD program<p>Overall this player is outstanding and I think that SONICblue has hit the target. As a runner, no other mp3 player would match this player's size, weight, and ease of use!!! The package comes with an armband, a belt clip, a pair of earphones, a cd software, and of course, the mp3 player! Again I would definitly recommend this for runners, or people who do sports. I would not recommend this for people looking for an mp3 player that is cute and small with advance features.

<Content>This was my first MP3 player.  I bought it for its versatility with fitness activities.  So far, I love it!!  I like the FM radio option- although only stations with strong signals come in.  Most MP3's don't even offer the option.  I also like the stopwatch function.  Sound clarity is excellent, ease of use is great and fast transfer times for songs.  Backlit display is nice.  It is small, compact, securely stays clipped to your clothing (haven't needed the strap, but its nice to have it).  I also like the appearance.  I like the option of adding more memory later.  I'd definitely recommend it.

Outside is better but if you are skating or running expect the signal to fade in and out as you change directions.  As far as MP3 capability it is a terrific little device.  You could not ask for anything easier to download from the pc.  Point and click everything.  Let's you know how close you are to capacity.  If you can live without the radio portion buy this unit.

<Content>Hi there!<p>A great player ... but what I'd like to know is, whether anyone out there is having problems with the integrated DRM. <p>In the description of the player is a feature called DRM (Digital Rights Management). Does that mean, that in the future I can only put &quot;legal&quot; MP3's into the player, which I ripped by myself?<p>Thx for answers!
