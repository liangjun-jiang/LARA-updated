<Title>Excellent Choice
<Date>Sun Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently purchased a Muvo 256MB Nomad and its excellent.  I use it to run and workout.  Its a great choice over other mp3's.  Its so small and very easy to use.  I recently bought the Rio Cali, but the software and difficulty connecting to the computer and downloading songs persuaded me to return it for the nomad.  This is a great product.

<Title>MuVo NX is the Perfect Workout MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo NX is my first MP3 player and based on my experience so far, it could be my only!  It really is perfect for my needs - gym, commuting on the subway, air travel...  <p>I spent a lot of time researching these things and chose the MuVo because of it's ultra-portable size (it's smaller and lighter than a Zippo lighter!) and the way you simply plug it into your USB port and drag-and-drop music (I didn't want yet another piece of music-management software on my computer).  The MuVo is the perfect player for folks who a) want the smallest, lightest, most easily navigated digital music player on the market and b) have the ability to actively manage their music on their PC.  While you can't take your entire music collection with you, the 256MB MuVo swallows music.  I have 60+ tracks on it right now (and it's not full) organized in several folders...one for the gym, a jazz collection, a blues collection, etc...  The ability to drag and drop whole folders is key...organize your tracks on your computer and swap entire folders back and forth between player and PC. <p>Features and navigation are great.  The screen, while small, has a cool blue backlight and displays all of the important info - track timer, song title, play modes, etc...and navigating through menus, folders, and options is intuitive and can be done with your thumb alone.  The provided case/belt clip and armband make this thing truly "wearable."  Having traded in a CD player for the MuVo, I can't imagine a workout with anything else!

<Title>Adequate for what it does
<Date>Mon Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the previous model of this player a year ago.  Since then, it has survived my marathon training and a run through the wash.  I just hit my first snag with the volume stuck on full blast with no way to turn it down.  <p>Along the way, I found that it eats batteries so its good to invest in rechargables.  Also, when the batteries gets low, it will do random things from either shutting off or blowing static at full blast into your ears.  I almost fell off the treadmill when it blasted me one time to the delight of nearby runners.<p>Static will cause this little guy to do weird things.  The sound kept dropping out on me until I noticed that my headphones were hitting the treadmill, causing the dropout problem.  Also, every once and awhile, the drive will become corrupted.  Creative includes software to reformat the drive.  When it becomes corrupted, it will sometimes mush your songs into a frankenstein monster.<p>Also, it plays in the order that files are copied to the drive.  There are some free programs out there that allow you to reorder it on the fly.  One such program is muvolist.<p>Overall, it's a great player for working out.  Just be prepared for problems and when they do happen, remember that the internet is your friend.

<Date>Sat Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Create MuVo NX is wonderful. I've only had it for a few hours and it's been wonderful. I could transfer files onto the device easily and quickly and it has been very cooperative. The earbuds have been great and seem to play sonds louder than my old headphones. The uneven cable lengths is a style issue, not a quality issue. The songs on the devide are in alphanumerical order, but I ususally jump song to song manually, so it has no impact.

<Title>Cables different length for a reason
<Date>Tue Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>People complain of the headphone's cable length being weird, but this is on purpose to wear on the arm. This allows one side to reach further behind the back (like a cell phone hand's free). Other than that, great size for working out. Who needs to have a 4 to 40GB hard drive on them, this is for people who don't want to search 5000+ songs to find a good one while using. Anyone who has that many mp3's just screams music pirate anyway :)

<Date>Fri Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>just got my MuVo NX 256 MB MP3 player today and i could not be happier with it.  the software loaded easily, plugged it in, starting uploading songs immediately, and within minutes i was listening to music.  now if yer looking to get music quality you might hear from a CD on yer stereo at home or in your car, yer expectations are a bit much, but i think the sound is great! it weighs next to nothing, so working out with the armband shud not be a problem.  if you are looking for a moderately sized MP3 player (holds about 55 songs), the MuVo is solid.

<Title>Mighty Muvo!
<Date>Sat Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great and tiny alternative for those who think other MP3 players are too expensive, big, or complicated. As a Mac user using System 9.2, this couldn't be easier to use. Even without the battery, the tiny unit plugged in right into the USB port and came up instantly on my Mac without having to install anything; true plug &amp; play! This also makes sharing songs with other people easy (assuming you want to risk the wrath of the RIAA, not that I'd ever do it of course). Windows users will probably have to install the enclosed software. Then it was simply drag and drop. This makes updating it so easy! This is especially useful when you just want to hear individual songs. It will hold folders of songs like if you want a whole album, but unless you preface each track with a order number (01, 02, 03, etc), it will play the folder in alphabetical order. It has a decent MP3 display for song titles (not artists). Also, the headphones are crappy but the sound is very good if you replace them. And yes, there's a slight buzz when the backlight goes on for a second, but if you don't make any adjustments while playing you'll never hear it like during a workout. Also, the single AAA battery lasts 11 hours which is also replacable, unlike iPods which you have send the whole thing back. It holds 4 hours of music in non-compressed CD quality (a minimum 128kbs), which is plently of non-repetetive music for the commuter, excersise enthusiast, or pretty much anyone. It can hold more in a more compressed format, but you'll notice the difference in sound. It includes most of the major playback selections like normal, repeat, and shuffle play for the whole player or folders. No programming feature, but that can be fixed by making a folder on you computer of songs and tranferring it to the Muvo. It also doubles as a voice recorder or for holding any small non-audio file. For the very minor problems it has, this a very simple machine that really delivers.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My biggest concern was the voice recording capability because I intend to use it during lectures at school. After trying it out, I'd have to say that I'm satisfied. The sound quality is great, and it's fairly easy to use. I also really like the storage capability. All in all, this mp3 player is everything that it was advertised as. Small, compact, easy to use, etc. However, there are two improvements I would like to see. One, I wish it had radio capability. When I'm in the gym, I would like the option to tune my fm frequency to listen to the tv without switching to my cd player, which does have fm capability (but then again, I knew this when I was buying it). The second problem is the speed. It really is not a huge deal, but the 1.1 USB speed is pretty slow. When you're only deleting/adding just a couple songs at a time, it probably won't be noticeable, but when you're loading up 40 songs at once, you'll wish it was quicker. I guess it's all about cost/benefit. You can pay 30-40 bucks more and get the TX which uses 2.0 USB. Other than that, I really like this player. The armband/belt clip comes in handy as does the extra battery pack.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue May 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received this MP3 player a couple days ago and here is what I have to say about it.<p>This is a great package. The packaging comes with everything you'll need, including headphones, two colored battery holsters, an armband, a belt loop, a AAA battery, as well as all the documentation you would ever need.<p>Right out of the box this thing impressed me. The CD installed very smoothly and easily. Within 20 minutes I had already loaded over 70 MP3 files on the player and was already listening.<p>The sound quality is fair, it lacks bass, but I think that's the headphone's fault. The headphones are nice looking earbuds, but I am not too fond of earbuds. These are the best I've seen out of all the earbuds I've experienced, but they are uncomfortable after a long period of time, and they fall out of my ears /very/ easily. The sound is very clear, but the lack of bass led me to purchase a pair of Sony behind the neck headphones, which should improve this a good bit. More on that when those arrive though.<p>The belt clip is really nifty and works well, the player stays put and doesn't move around or fall out. The armband is a little confusing at first, but once you figure out how to use it, it's quite simple and good for the active person who is running around outside playing sports or what not.<p>I've heard talk about a few things, mostly rumors that I would like to dispel. First off, the headphones are NOT defective. The left side fits in like normal, and the right sides goes BEHIND your neck and into your right ear. This makes the length fit just perfectly for most people. I actually prefer it, as now there is nothing hanging out in front of me when I'm out playing around with my yo-yos; nothing to get them tangled in. Also, there is talk about slow transfer speed. I'm not sure how patient these people are, but the speed is fairly decent, perhaps 5-7 minutes for 70 or so songs. Not too bad in my opinion. I just start the transfer, and do something else for a little bit, and then I'll check back and they'll be done. It's perfectly fine for everyday use, and unless you feel like paying $40 more for the TX (which is the same size, only using a USB 2.0 interface), which I don't think is worth it.<p>So here is the rundown of things that I do like and things that I do:<p>LIKES:<br>-Very small, very compact<br>-Very easy to set up<br>-Easy to carry<br>-Transfer speed acceptable<br>-Holds plenty of music<br>-Battery life is decent<br>-Looks very clean and sleek<p>DISLIKES:<br>-Headphones are sub-par<br>-Fits upside down into my front mounted USB ports (cannot see the screen to know when it's completely done transferring files)<br>-Armband has no instructions, have to figure it out yourself or from a friend.<p>Overall, it's an excellent product, just needs some better headphones.<p>Jared<p>EDIT: I got a pair of Sony MDR-G72 Behind the Neck headphones to replace the somewhat sub-par earbuds that the MP3 player. The sound quality that you will hear from these headphones are the perfect complement to the Muvo NX. Absolute perfection for ym ears, I love it.

<Content>As an owner of an Archos 30GB jukebox, which I love, I needed something that I could take a CDs worth of music with me while I work out.<p>I bought this player and it is THE best thing I have ever taken with me. I can take about 2-3 CDs worth of music, put it on my arm while I run, exercise, etc. and it works beautifully. All the buttons are easy to reach on my arm. The menu is EASY to use, it doesn't skip (flash memory), and haven't tested out the battery lifve, but using a AAA battery, it's no big deal to just put another one in. <p>This is the best portable I have used, I now carry it EVERYWHERE I go as it can be used as a portable drive as well. I love it.

<Title>IF it was a woman I'd marry it.
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Okay, So this is the 4th MP3 player I purchased in the past month. I tried the Dell Juitbox 20G. A Samsung and a IPOD. I needed to take off a week of work to stay home and figure out the Dell. On my Harley the thing kept freezing and finally just bit the dust after 2 weeks. The Samsung would NOT let me download from Musicmatch WMA files. The IPOD was miserable to figure out menus. So I purchased the Creative Labs Muvo NV 256MB as a last resort before returning back to my simple Tape cassette player on the bike. Plain and simple: This is SO SIMPLE, beautifully designed, AGAIN SIMPLE to use MP3 there is. It downloaded all songs both MP3 and WMA files no problem and no glitches. The menus on it are superb, easy to read, easy to navigate, no brainer toggleing. Its tiny, amazingly free of glitches, and wont freeze on my Harley. Plugs directly into the USB port with no wires and no problems with my windows XP like the others had. I actually hired a guy to help me figure out the other MP3 playes I purchased and even he was boggled. I didnt even call him for this. Whoever invented this thing is a genious and realized that I AM NOT. BUY this thing and dont think twice. Enjoy.

<Title>A must have for the gym.
<Date>Wed Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So, a little while ago I was in the market for an MP3 portable device.   I pretty much ruled out the iPod (I'd rather be dead than cool) and the Creative Nomad. Even though these are top notch players, I felt they were just a little too big for the gym, which would be its primary use.  After much research I decided to go with the Creative Muvo NX 256mb. I wanted more variety at the gym and the cost jump from 128mb to 256mb was minimal. I also went with the NX model instead of the TX model because the only things the TX offers that the NX doesn't is USB 2.0 transfer and FM Radio. The content on FM absolutely sucks, and the transfer rate really wasn't a big deal to me, plus the NX was $40.00 cheaper.  If you're running Win XP or 2000 (which you should be) the install is a snap. Just plug it in! It will auto recognize and install all the necessary drivers. The only good thing about the included software is the format utility. If you have MusicMatch or any type of mp3 ripping software, the rest of the Muvo software is a waste of time. From there all you have to do is drag and drop as you would with any other folder.   I read from just about everybody that the supplied headphones have much to be desired. So that being said I went out and purchased a set of Sony MDR-E829V Fontopia Ear-Buds ($10.00), and kept the included buds as backups. Most of my mp3s ripped to 160kbps. As far as sound quality I have no complaints at all, even at 128kbps. I usually have the volume set to max in the noisy gym atmosphere. Which brings me to battery life.  This bad boy runs on a single AAA. I usually get about 12hrs out of the Energizer E2 AAA that I use (volume at max, backlight turned off). But of course the battery life will vary depending on how much you fuss with it and volume level.  The on screen display has a lot of other options like EQ, play modes and such, everything you would expect. It also has a voice recorder which I haven't used, and probably never will. PLUS, it has a killer nylon strap u can put on your arm, its super convenient for the gym, never gets in the way.  The low down.  Pros: Super small and convenient Excellent battery life and sound quality Easy to use.   Cons: Stock ear buds need to be upgraded  **If you go to the gym often, this is the perfect mp3 player for you, hands down!

<Content>I have owned several MP3 players including RCA's Lyra, Nike-Philips and a couple of variations of Rios.  I am multisport and tend to be hard on equipment.  I got this MP3 player two months ago and have been waiting for it to fall apart, but it has not. It is very easy to use out of the box, I love the direct USB attachment (no wires), it's functional, the arm band is great and I could not be happier with the sound, size and performance and especially the price.  I highly recommend it.  The RCA Lyra--I always encountered memory problems after seeveral weeks of use--I could not change up mp3s without major issues. Low cost, but tech headaches.  Nike-Philips--DO NOT BUY IT it stinks.  hard to figure out. Crappy outsourced support in India which was HORRIBLE.  Limited memory. It's a great design and looks sexy but like the sneakers its all marketing--no substance.  It is all glitz and packaging. Really not worth it.   Rio--Expensive and not worth the money when there are products like Muvo that do a better job at a fraction of  the cost.

<Title>Great little doohickey
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, got this for my birthday to work out with. I wanted a nice and small unit for jogging, that would hold at least an hour's worth of songs and work in Linux.  Since I use Linux 100% of this time, this is great, because it just works! I have usb and mass-storage compiled in my 2.6.8 kernel and can mount the drive (it uses fat16). The file names get truncated to 8.3 dos format when you copy them to the device. Also it doesn't like spaces in the file names.  My only compaint is that the ear buds are a little large and get uncomfortable after about 20-30 minutes.  It takes about 5-7 minutes to fill the device from 0 to 256mbs. I kinda wish I had gotten the USB2.0 version, but I can't complain, it was a gift.

<Date>Sat Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Somehow,the music is'nt great. I ripped the music from original CD's using Muvo's software, but this tiny player can play things right, but music is'nt that rich when compared to other MP3 players like iRiver or iPod. It has a shrill, mechanical undertone (ya, i tried to fix it by adjusting the equalizers, but no good),and lacks the normal bass. An advice for Amazon: I know Jeff's gotta big store, but please send me CDs, not boomerangs!! Sorry for the wry humor! The included software cd was very wavy and cud'nt play. It almost damaged my ultrabay device of my thinkpad.I had to download the required software from www.nomadworld.com Endnote? Just buy it for the heck of it!

<Title>Very "creative"!!!
<Date>Thu May 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found the other reviews very helpful in making my decision and will just add a couple of things.  <p>First of all, I found the design to be very "creative".  Basically it is a flash memory stick that plugs into a USB drive to copy music or data files.  Then, you just snap it into a battery pack and you have a player, which is very small (the size of a lighter) and very light.  There is no need for a cable, and you can also use it as portable memory.<p>This product is perfect for jogging or going to the gym.  You won't fit your entire collection on 256MB, but you'll get your favorites in and the new album you just got.  I fitted more than 120 songs on it.  <p>Concerns:  It might not be loud enough for some people.  In a noisy gym, I had to turn the volume up all the way.  Finally, it uses a AAA battery.  I would have preferred a more powerful, rechargable internal battery.  <p>I decided on this flash-memory based player vs. a hard-drive based one, such as the i-pod.  Those i-pod like players which can store your entire music collection are very close to being obsolete.  New products, like the Archos AV380, are coming out which can not only store music, but movies as well and can do so much more than just play music.  However, the Nomad will still remain useful because you'll probably still want to have something this compact.  Even if you stop using it for listening to music, it can still function as flash memory and should be quite useful for transporting files between home and office.

<Content>When I first saw this item on Amazon.com I couldn't stop going back to read the reviews. I decided after reading many positive AND negative reviews to buy this item. I was so shock when I got this item a day after I ordered it. I couldn't wait to open the box! I started transferring MP3 music into this device that same night! I was up almost all night! I can't believe how GOOD the sound quality of this device! It sounds better than my stereo in the car! <br>The earphone, is NOT defective. It's meant to be worn around behind your neck. It's like a regular earphone, you just need to put the Right earphone around behind your neck to your ear. I personally think this is a genius idea! I was fed up many times for having my earphone taggled up when I am trying to do things, like lifting weight, etc.<br>So don't wait any longer. Get this Creative Labs Muvo NX 256 MB MP3 Player and you won't be sorry.<br>Amazon.com RULES!!

That way the rechargable battery doesn't wear out and you don't have to spend time recharging it, you just change the battery and go.  Anyway, you can still buy AAA rechargables to use if you want.

<Title>Perfect MP3 Player!
<Date>Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is really a review of the Creative Labs MuVo TX 256MB MP3 player which has the 2.0 USB connection, which is super fast, much faster than the 1.1 that almost all other ones have.  I purchased this so I could have music for working out and so I could have a portable drive for power point presentations etc.  <br>First, it is the perfect size and comes with belt clip and arm band.  It plugs directly into the USB port on your computer so you don't have to lug around all those cables etc.  The display is excellent, backlit blue, the controls are easily accessible while running, the software included allows you to build your own play list folders and to take music off your CDs and put it on the MP3 player.  The latter is an awesome feature as I have several CD mixes that were burned that I love to run to and I was thrilled to be able to easily transfer them to my new MP3 player.  In order to load music to the player you just click and drop them in.  <br>It sounds like some people had trouble hearing with the headphones, but I thought they were fine.  I am however using Sony earbuds as I think they do have better sound and are more comfortable.<br>I would highly reccommend spending the extra $$ on this product as I think it is exceptional.  I am truly pleased with it.

<Title>Everything I was looking for
<Date>Thu Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I needed something to use while running and other situations that favored ultra-portable.  This player is very smartly engineered (I'm electronic quality engineer by trade).  Buttons are in all the right places.  Arm carrier is great.  Love the way I can plug this in at work and listen without downloading MP3's onto the company computer (a no-no).  At first I thought 256MB might get old but it's been more than enough for my tunes.  The best part about this is it's not Sony, who's so paranoid about copyrights that they handcuff their users with their software.  Great job Creative Labs.

<Title>Small / Lightweight / Perfect
<Date>Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the perfect small MP3 player.  Easy to use, easy to work out with, what more do you need?  Instead of having a big MP3 player clanging against your body like an IPOD while you are working out, you hardly know this one is even with you.  Except for the fact the sound is great.  USB could be a bit faster and battery life is ok, the higher the sound goes up, the shorter the battery life.  But, overall, this is a great player.  I have used mine traveling, running, reading, and it has worked well for 5 months.  I have little to complain about.  B+<p>Joseph Dworak

<Title>Excellent performance, impressive features
<Date>Sat Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is quite an astounding little gadget.  It weighs just over an ounce, but it carries a quarter-gigabyte of music-- about four hours, at standard MP3 compression.  Since the MuVo NX uses flash memory, it has no moving parts, which makes it great for use while running or working out-- it has already replaced my CD-based MP3 player, which was larger, heavier, and inclined to skipping.<p>The interface is easy to use and very intuitive, using a simple rocker switch to page through songs or options.  The device also includes several thoughtful touches, such as a vertical-flip option for lefties, a wide variety of playback options, and a customizable graphic equalizer.  Sound quality is excellent, the volume is ample, and the package includes a nice pair of earbud speakers.<br> <br>The only drawback with this MP3 player is the USB interface, which is the old USB 1.1 standard instead of the faster USB 2.0.  This isn't a serious issue, however, as USB 2.0 is only supported by recent computers running Windows XP, and even at USB 1.1 speeds it only takes a couple of minutes to fully load the player.<p>I enthusiastically recommend the MuVo NX to audiophiles, early adopters, and anybody who wants ultra-portable music on the go.

<Title>Simple / Perfect
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>At last an MP3 play that fits in the palm of your hand!  This little unit is amazing and an answer to a search.  If you want an MP3 player that is light, easy to use, plugs right into your USB port, this is the player for you.  I run and this unit is perfect for exercising or traveling.  No longer will you have to hassle with a big CD player, or out of date MP3 player, the Creative Nomad takes care of your music needs.  Now, some will argue the IPOD is a better deal, but the IPOD is at least twice the size of this unit.  Sure you can max out at about 44 songs on this player, but that should take care of you for any trip you are on, or long run if that may be the case.  I highly recommend this excellent, innovative, and well thought out product.  You will not go wrong here.  A+<p>Joseph Dworak

<Title>Incredible MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The MuVo NX is the absolute best MP3 player I have ever had.<p>The ultra-small and ultra-light chassis makes it about as burdensome as a lighter. The battery case is also interchangeable giving you a choice between blue and black.<p>The sound quality is top-notch, not including the fact that a five bar equalizer gives you tons of options.<p>It is incredibly easy to load music onto it: <br>1) Remove flash card from battery case<br>2) Insert flash card into USB slot (it can be awkward without a front USB port)<br>3)Drag CD folders straight onto it (the MuVo NX is recognized as a external hard drive, open it through My Computer and go to your song folders, then drop onto the hard drive window)<br>4)Re-insert into battery case<br>5) Listen to music!<p>You can also use it as a voice recorder, or drag non-music folders onto it and transfer them to another computer as with a normal flash drive.<p>It comes with earbuds, but to truly enjoy it's great sound, I recommend getting some nice headphones.<p>All in all, this is an INCREDIBLE MP3 PLAYER.<p>P.S. I have only had it for about a week<br>P.P.S. DO NOT USE WINDOWS FORMATTING SOFTWARE (I haven't done it, however it says it in the manual in very large letters)

I got a 'bunk' pair of headphones though, and cant imagine how these passed quality control.  Called the company and they are shipping out a new one to me.  No problems or questions asked, service was good.  I wish that the unit came with a battery charger, I thought it did, and I am kinda bummed that I need to buy one now.  If it had an fm tuner that would be nice too.  I really like it though, and I think you will too.

<Title>Perfect Workout Companion!
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Pros: Tiny player with great sound, features like shuffling and EQ, lightweight, easy to set up and copy music or files<br>Cons: Buttons may be too small for bigger fingers, one AAA battery life only about 5-6 hours, included ear buds are dinky<p>I already own a CD MP3 player, which is fine for most applications except when I'm at the gym. It's too big and it skips whenever you move. So I really wanted one of the new tiny players. My wonderful boyfriend got me this player for a birthday present. <p>It is super simple to set up; just install the Creative software, plug the player into an empty USB port, and you'll be copying files in no time! I can either drag and drop from my folders, or create a playlist in Windows Media Player and copy it automatically. It also holds any kind of file. I've used it to copy photos from my laptop to my home PC. <p>The sound is terrific. I like to turn up the volume fairly high, so that probably eats into the battery life. I was pleased to find out that I can randomly shuffle files, skip folders, or maneuver around my songs any way I like. I can also set the EQ to boost the sound even more.<p>I find the buttons easy to use, but someone with thicker fingers might not like it as much. Just rock the slider back and forth to move from song to song. The attractive and readable display shows you the time elapsed and any MP3 tags included in your file.<p>The included belt clip is very secure and slides into the included armband. I've only used the armband once, but I noticed a funny rubbery smell on my arm after working out. Could be because it's new!<p>I have not yet tried rechargeable batteries with the player, but a normal alkaline battery lasts about 5 or 6 hours. That's certainly long enough for any intense workout, or a 2 or 3-hour flight, but I don't want to have to keep changing batteries. Two colored battery &quot;skins&quot; are included, blue and gray. (You can also buy more skins via the Creative website for about $8-10 apiece.) You could either swap the player out to a different color and match your outfit, or keep a battery in each skin and use the alternate skin as a backup.<p>I also bought new sports-style headphones because I found the included earbuds to be totally useless.<p>Overall I love this little gadget! It's exactly what I needed in an attractive usable extra-light package. Thanks, sweetie!

<Content>After I received this product and tried to play with it, it is pretty cool. But my first impression is gone after one night of using it. <br>First, when I play the MP3 songs, the sound is gone. I have to adjust the the volume and the sound will come back. But in the next song, it happens again. When I downloaded the songs back to my computer and played, everything was fine. <br>Second, sound quality is poor. I tried to adjust the features and everything but I cannot see the different. The right earphone was 3 times as long as left one.<br>You can read more review at Creative Labs Nomad MUVO NX 128 MB to compare with this 256 MB before buy it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got one of these little gadgets for Christmas so that my runs are tolerable.  Internally, the toy is great.  Having various play modes and 256Meg of memory means that I can make my own radio station without commercials or annoying dj chatter.  It's small enough that it doesn't throw off my run.<p>Now for the bad items. First, there is nothing in the instructions that explains how to use the arm band.  Perhaps it was an excess of egg nog, but it took me a while to figure it out.  To save you from the same headache, put the belt clip's belt clip through the little loop on the arm band. Now put the gadget into the belt clip.<p>Second, the head phone ear buds are a piece of crap. They fell out of my ear within half a block.  I don't know if my ears are strangely shaped or what, but they are unusable for me. The solution is to buy a set of sport ear buds that clip onto your ears. Relatively cheap at $10, but still...<p>Two minor problems, and this thing now gets four stars.

<Title>Very Compact, Lightweight, Easy to Use...
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After comparing several MP3 players in it's class I decided to go with the MUVO NX because it's perfect for working out in the gym and lightweight for running. I considered going with an I-Pod for the larger storage capabilities at first, however when <br>I found out that the included rechargeable battery will stop holding it's charge after a about 2 years of use it wasn't worth the money for me. The 256MB memory included in the NUVO MX stores a good amount of music so you won't run out of songs in the middle of a workout or on a 4-5 hour plane flight.  <p>The Pro's:<br>- Lightweight, compact design.<br>- Plug and play USB connection. <br>- Easily drag and drop files directly onto the player.<br>- Good amount of storage for music.<br>- Decent battery life. (I suggest investing in some rechargable AAA batteries)<p>The Con's:<br>- I only have one negative comment about this product. After opening the package the earphones included were defective. One side was about 3 times a long as the other side and the sound wasn't the best. This is why i'm giving it a 4 Star rating instead of 5.

<Content>It holds all the songs I need for a day of snowboarding, never skips, the battery lasts for two full days of riding.  Sound quality is excellent.  The player works even in the cold at 20 degrees, no problem.  Flash memory -no moving parts means it does not skip even off of big jumps or in the bumps.  You can wear it as a pendant.  The thing is practically perfect.  Ditto the other reviewers on the headphones -they suck, but I took one look at them and knew they would not work for vigorous activity and replaced them.

<Title>Works with Linux! (almost...)
<Date>Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got my unit yesterday, after having chosen this unit mostly based on reviews of this and other mp3 players here. What I wanted was a small, flash-based player that works out of the box with Linux. Since the MuVo NX acts as standard usb storage, it should plug in and work.<p>The good news: it works! (provided you already have USB working). To ensure smooth functioning, I added the 'sync' option to mount (so that all writes are performed synchronously).<p>More good news: all the other reviews are right on target; the interface is easy to use, sound quality is good (if you replace the included earbuds), and it is *tiny*.<p>The bad news: somehow, I got the player into a strange state where it wouldn't power on or show up as a usb storage device.  I might have done this by deleting a song from the computer that the player had been playing, but I'm not sure. I ended up having to use WinXP to load the supplied software and use the media restore option (see Creative's web site for details if this happens to you, too). But after the media restore, it once again worked fine.<p>More bad news: one of the above reviews mentioned sound randomly turning off. This happened to me, too; the unit seems extremely sensitive to static in the headphone cord (perhaps it's meant to facilitate a remote?), and fiddling with the volume control brings the sound back on. Switching to better headphones largely fixed this problem.<p>Also, you might notice a faint high-pitched whine for a few seconds when you turn the unit on or fiddle with the buttons. I didn't realize this in the daylight, but later found out that this is the backlight (which can be disabled if you prefer).<p>Overall, it's pretty much exactly what I was expecting: a usb flash drive that plays mp3s (and works easily in linux); get your own headphones, and you'll be all set! If this had an FM tuner, it'd be perfect!

<Content>Ok guys or girls this will be a totaly honest review. I own an apple ipod also it is great for listening at home long trips and for its large amount of storage  but sucks for working out and sports. So everything has its place .I just got my 256meg movo nx. It rocks its light comes with 2 battery mods in colors blue and gray and dosent  skip like the ipod can. The movo is easy to set up and use. And sounds great. The included earbud while not great are not as bad as other reviews I have read. Here are the downsides or at least what i would improve in a perfect world I would like to see an fm tuner even though they suck for small devices like this I would like to be able to plug it in to recharge the battery ( a normal battery will give you a good 6-7 hours listening time so you might want to get some rechargable batterys) All in all i would highly recommend this product.

<Title>Decent player
<Date>Sun Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this MUVO NX for a little over a month, and it has proven to be a decent player.<p>PROS:<br>-Easy to use.<br>-Overall sound quality is respectable with good headphones.<br>-The battery will last 12 hours if allowed to play continously, but for &quot;real world&quot; use (i.e. pausing, searching, changing the volume level), the battery lasts about 8 hours. <br>-The player's lightweight, compact design is durable with normal use. <br>-The built in USB connector allows for quick downloads from any computer with a USB port (no connector cords needed).<br>-Can double as a USB drive to store pictures, documents, etc.<br>-256 MB stores about 60 CD-quality songs.<br>-Comes with a removable holster and belt clip.<p>CONS:<br>-There seems to be no way to select the order of play, nor is there built in software to create individual playlists. <br>-No FM radio.<br>-Sound becomes muffled at low volumes.<br>-The memory is not expandable.<p>I would prefer more memory (or at least an expansion slot), and the inability to create playlists is a major drawback. Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the player's overall performance.

<Date>Wed Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my eye on the MuVo line for a while, since the original, 1st generation MuVo came out a few years ago.  I heard about a bunch of problems with the original MuVo (not the NX), so I didn't buy one.<p>I've had the 256 MB NX for a few months now, and I have to say I've been extremely impressed.  The package is small, and I've dropped it several times, hard enough to knick the plastic outercase, and it still works like a charm.  <p>You plug it into the USB port, and it shows up as a &quot;removable drive&quot; in My Computer.  Copy files to it like you would a hard drive, and you're good to go.  Jog the dial and you can record voice notes.  AMAZING.<p>The earbud style headphones that ship with it are lousy; that said, I plugged in my Sony studio monitor headphones and this device is jaw dropping; the sound is incredible for something as small as a long Zippo lighter, especially with the built in adjustable 5 band equalizer.  Buy rechargable batteries and a good pair of headphones, and this thing is HIGHLY recommended.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Sat Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the Creative NOMAD MuVo NX about two weeks ago and I'm very happy with it so far. It was not too much money compared to other players and the quality seems to be extremely good. All you have to do is replace the not-so-good supplied earbuds.<p>Let me start with how easy it is to get music onto this MP3 player. It is extremely easy. It is recognised by Windows as a removable disk drive, so it adds itself into My Computer or Windows Explorer or whatever and you can copy and paste or drag and drop music on there in a snap.<p>The battery life is alright, but I'm not complaining since it only takes 1xAAA battery and lasts a good 10 hours.<p>The size is great! The first thing that occured to me was that the actually memory bit of the player (the bit that plays the songs) is smaller than the battery clip-on!<p>There is also upgradeable firmware, so your player can constantly be updated for new patches and fixes. I'm downloading an update righht now.<p>Another key thing for me was WMA support, since it's about half the size of an MP3 (even though I keep mine encoded at 80kbps for a medium between quality and being compact).<p>256MB is a great amount if you're not looking at a jukebox, I've still yet to fill it. I think it can take roughly 120songs in WMA and 60 in MP3.<p>Get thins player! The interface is friendly and very easy to use and read. The only downside I can think of right now is the fact that you cannot fast forward tracks, although it remembers where you were in the song as you switch it off.

<Title>Does everything as advertised and more!
<Date>Tue Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have to admit I was not sure whether to buy this unit or not given the mixed reviews I had read on Amazon before making the decision to purchase.  I am very glad I took the chance!    First what I am pleasantly surprised by;  1. the volume with the standard headphones is MORE than enough, unless you have been deafened by years of rock concerts you should be happy with this unit set between 20-30 (it goes up to 40, 30 works for me on airplanes!) so much for lack of volume as mentioned in some reviews.   2. the stock headphones are fine...I am a bit of an audiophile with many thousands of dollars investing in stereo equipment in my home and even after comparing the sound from these headphones with some of my pricey ones I am not at all dissapointed.  of course there is some lack of bass compared with reference phones BUT all ear buds suffer from this lack of bass in one degree or another AND, as another reviewer mentioned, this unit has a little equalizer that allows you to adjust for your musical taste.  also, remember you can always buy a pair of etymotic or shure ear canal phones and have a near reference system! 3. the battery lasts a LONG time, I am getting over 14 hours of continuous listening out of a single AAA.   4. the construction quality of the unit is quite good, buttons, etc. all solid feeling and give every indication of lasting years. the unit is made of plastic so the normal rules apply i.e. don't plan to drop it too many times on concrete floors!   Let me remind of the features that make this unit stand out for me: 1. works on a single AAA battery, no rechargable (non-replaceable) batteries to get ruined, have memory effect, etc.  if you must have rechargability, get some NiMH AAA and live happily ever after, I'll stick with one alkaline AAA and replace it every couple of weeks. 2. VERY compact and light, the whole thing sits in my shirt pocket when I am not using it, portable audio is about portability and ease of carrying so...good work creative! 3. Acceptable storage size, I find that 128 WMA files sound as good as CD (or as close as you need while jogging, etc.) allow about 80 songs (easily double that if you use more compression and can live with "near cd" sound quality)...besides if you have all your favorite songe ripped to the computer just download new playlists (80 songs long!) when the songs get stale, jeez! 4. low price = no regrets, how can you go wrong for $60-70???? 5. I like the ease of plugging this unit into any available USB port and being able to simply treat it as another drive, erase files, copy files, drag and drop, you name it, easy to manage!  also, please remember this can hold your resume, your favorite recipes, you name it, it is seen as just another drive by windows computers.   let me also leave you with a little trick that solves some of the other complaints about this unit;  since you have to track through all the songs on the unit "alphabetically" you may not be able to access the songs you want in the order you want  convieniently, however in windows explorer you can rename the files using numbers as the first two charaters and thus get the songs in the order you like, i.e. "01rockthecasba" or "12sweetesttaboo", try it you'll like it!  I am sure that any buyers who share my basic criteria for buying will be very happy with this player. best of luck.

The output frequency is 20 to 20,000 so the stereo quality is very good, and the supplied headphones do a good job. its quite user friendly and light. I was not expecting the 2nd battery pack in a new colour, so that was a surprise for me too. I had a problem whie seeking an mp3 at 320 kbps...but then i upgraded my firmware from 1.01.07 to 1.30.09...and the problem was solved! :) So am quite content.  I plan to buy rechargable batteries tomorrow. The voice recorder is also very effective. Put it on a table, and it records everybody around it...so quite senstive. Good if u wish to record a lecture or an interview :).  Recommended.

<Title>versatile and good for running.
<Date>Mon Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was looking for something to run with, help cope with the repetitive boredom, so I was looking for something small and light. I had searched a long time. This is the best for the purpose, IMHO. I have had it for many months now, still no problem.  Likes: very light, comes with everything. can use as usb device, that is great! I really have use for it. doesn't need to format data/music to store it, unlike sony, which would be a real pain  Dislikes: the navigation wheel doesn't respond well in  my opinion; when I run, I can't skip to the next song sometimes.  packaged earphone is not good for running, need to buy your own.  I recommend it for running and its versatility to be a usb drive. The price now makes it even more attractive, I found mine from whosave dot coom (shows you online sales), so it was a good price and value.

<Title>overpriced for a lack of features.
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>while creative has a hit on their hands with their latest Muvo solid-state MP3 line, there is absolutely NO reason to choose the Muvo NX 256MB player over the Muvo TX FM 256MB player.  The NX is more expensive, utilizes USB 1.1 to transfer files and lacks a radio/radio recording.  The TX FM is CHEAPER for the same memory size/usb stick configuration, utilizes USB 2.0 for MUCH faster speeds AND HAS FM RADIO INCLUDED AS WELL. seriously, the NX right now is a ripoff until the price drops the TX to match.

<Title>PERFECT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This little thing is awesome.  Basically, it is a Walkman, but about the size of cigarette lighter.  It holds approximately 70 songs.  I'm using it for running.  First thing I did was ditch the ear-buds that came with it.  Those things will never stay in while you're running.  My old Walkman headset fit in the jack.  Runs off 1 AAA battery.  I went to this because it was less than $100 and I've been reading all kinds of horror stories about getting the I-Pod battery changed by mailing it in.  Not worth the effort.  The Nomad 256 fits easily into the USB port of your computer, though some computers will not allow you to slid the oversized flash drive in because the plastic case blocks it from seating property.  Shove it in the back and you should have no trouble.  Holds a lot of music and its easy to click through songs you don't want to listen to.  If you make a mistake in typing in info it will carry over to the Nomad and you have to delete and rename the file.  Editing won't do it, for some reason.  You'll love this thing.  Cheap and easy to use.  I'm going to buy one for my wife.

<Title>Good Product

<Content>I really like my MP3 player, it is small and comes with an arm band so I can work-out with it.  My only complaint is that the battery compartment is a bit flimsy and the cover comes off all the time.

<Title>worked well while it worked
<Date>Fri Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I thought this was the best thing ever. I loved the capabilities to carry data at the same time as music. I loved being able to run with it (with no skipping or problems at all) and it was easy to transfer.  I don't like how the songs play in alphabetical order. and MOST OF ALL- i hate the fact that they only have a 90 day warranty! Mine stopped being recognized by computers a month ago, and creative labs (terrible cust. service by the way) is telling me i have to pay 40 bucks to get it fixed. I really have a hard time trusting in these products when creative labs themselves can't trust the products they make enough to give them at least a 1 yr warranty. I suggest not taking the risk on this one... and just spend a bit more money and get something w/a better warranty and something that's better -- Ipod.

<Title>love it!
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Nomad Muvo NX 256 over one year ago, and I loved it so much that I am upgrading to a TX 512.  I love the fact that the USB connector is built right in. That was the biggest factor that influenced my decision to buy this unit. No cables to carry around (or lose), just plug it in and go. If I am at a friend's house, and they have a song I want, I can just plug into their computer and take it! It is SO EASY! You use it as you would any other removable drive.   Don't bother with the Creative software, it sucks. Just drag your music over and go. The "problem" of playing alphabetically can be overcome by putting numbers in front of music filenames, I already do this with all my CDs.   The headphones that it comes with are not great. I use Sony's MDR-ED21LP headphones, which cost about $20 (buy them online, I can almost never find them in stores), and the sound is great.   The unit is very durable, I dropped it many, many times and it survived with no problem. Battery life is pretty good, but if I am going on a trip or planning a long day at the beach I usually bring an extra AAA along, just in case.   One word of caution: I upgraded the firmware a few months ago, and it slowly began to crap out on me after that. I would have to push the power button twice to make it turn on, and it would not always be recognized by my computer. It was fine until I upgraded the firmware... So if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Overall, I love the Muvo NX 256, however I would probably recommend the TX series to a new buyer, since TX has USB 2.0 and NX has USB 1.1.
