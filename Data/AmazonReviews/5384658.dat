<Title>Well Made Sounds Great
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my New Samsung player. The negative reviews are humorous. You can tell they were written by IPod owners &quot;defending&quot; their choice.I'm new to all this and could care less about Apple, Steve Jobs or anyone else. I just want a good player and legal service so I don't get nailed for stealing music.<br>I tried iTunes, Rhapsody and Napster. They are all fine. Anyone who says this player is no good or an iPod is a piece of garbage are just plain wrong.<br>My preference is for the Napster player that I bought because I like the Napster service the best. Its all about taste and I can't see all the fuss over priasing the iPod and trashing this perfectly fine music player/

<Content>Got one of these players today at Best Buy as they were out of the iPod. Can't complain I am using the napster service and for the same price as a 20GB Ipod I got a 20 GB Samsung player with 20 free Napster downloads and some nice extra features not found on the iPod.

<Title>Certainly a winner
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I researched this product in the magazines and here on Amazon. The only negative reviews were found here and I took them with a grain of salt as they were obviously written by iPod fanatics. When a reviewer says the Samsung Napster player &quot;does not work at all&quot; or &quot;it fell apart&quot; and then suggests that I buy an iPod, I have to seriously doubt the genuiness of the review.<br>In any event, the player is great and I have nothing to add except how to get the best price.<br>At Best Buy they have the player for $399 and you get 20 free tracks on Napster.<br>On Amazon you can get it through J&amp;R Music world for $399 and it comes in a couple of days or you can order it from Amazon for $379 and it comes in a week or two. I don't know if you order through Amazon or J&amp;R if you get the 20 free songs.<br>Find the best price and get this superb player.

<Title>Incredible
<Date>Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>How they fit all the product features and storage space in such a small player is truly a miracle. The battery lasts for at least a week of my hour long + jogging sessions.<br>The best part about the player is the connection to the Napster service which rocks. I am a music nut and have tried them all.<br>Rhapsody sounds good but is limited on the download side.<br>Itunes doesn't let you listen to more than 30 seconds of a song.<br>Napster is by far the most extensive and flexible service out there. <p>The Napster player is the best way to take your tunes on path and on the road-it works really well in the car too!

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The best thing about this player is that it can serve many purposes.<br>1. as the obvious portable player tapped into Napster<br>2. for use in the car with the built in radio fm transmitter (something the Ipod does not have)<br>3. as your home stereo. Many people don't want to be tied to their computers to listen to music. They can use this player hooked up totheir stereo or just buy a good pair of speakers to hook into the system and plop the player anywhere you'd like in your living room. This avoids having to stream music via a wireless router from your computer to your living room system.<p>The features are all great and the interaction with Napster is a plus.<br>You can download all your other music not bought on Napster onto the player as well.<br>The only downside to this player is the cheap earplugs and handheld remote.<br>The rest of the player is top shelf and in all regards a superior player than the iPod.

<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i see alot of ipoders flaming sammy here as anywhere else... basically both are nice mp3 players. both have working software accompanying hardware. both are from competent electronic producers. now design wise, yes apple got &quot;IT&quot;. it is so cool to look at ipod. however i got the sammy because of the FM recording capability and FM transmitter. OH YES! it is so awesome. i have no idea how i ever lived without these two features. (remember bart simpson and the FM radio mike? i have so much fun with this...) and all the special radio only mixes that i have in my collections. these stuff you just cant buy!<p>now to sum it up, i'm pretty sure ipod is good, if you want just a basic player. however if you know you way around electronics and want a extra features that you'll grow on, choose sammy. it may be little pricey but hey when you are using it every single day, almost every hour, who cares!

<Content>I made a mistake and bought into the Apple hype. I overpaid for the ipud and luckily learned of the Samsung Napster player which works with Napster. i did not know fo the player before I bought the ipod and then I realized that the Ipod only uses some proprietary Mac format that did not work with Napster. Also the ipod lacks the extra features of the Samsung Napster player like the FM tuner and the car adapter and voice recorder.<br>All in all I was luck in that I managed to return my ipud  the next day for this great player.<br>I am now enjoying Napster!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Fri May 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Look - it's inevitable, so let's get the comparisons to the iPod out of the way right away. This is not quite as stylish; you cannot create playlists on the fly or play games; and...and...<p>Right.<p>If you are buying an MP3 player to be stylish, you are kind of weird anyway and form over function is a poor choice in technology.<p>If you want to play games, get a cell phone with games or something.<p>IF, however, you want an MP3 player that plays MP3s and WMAs, has massive storage capacity, is lightweight, offer easy control of functions, and at least for me has so far worked flawlessly, look here.<p>iPods are overpriced. Simple fact. Plunk down the money for an iPod and you get a pretty little piece of mp3 player that can't play WMAs, gets annoyed if you try to circumvent iTunes, and has a battery that will most likely die on you in a few months (look it up, it's true). Oh, but that's ok - it's backed up by Apple's legendary customer service. By which I mean atrocious and feared customer &quot;service.&quot;<p>Get the Samsung. It's a good player. I admit that the FM transmitter is wimpy, but I didn't buy it to play mp3s in my car - and even if I want to, I have a tape adaptor from my satellite radio that works fine with the headphone-out jack on the YEPP. FM reception is great and you can record directly from another digital source with the line-in jack...and they include the cable! (something iPods do not), along with a (albeit meagre) carrying case, FM transmitter antenna, surprisingly decent earbuds, and the USB cable.<p>Go ahead and get it - I highly recommend.

<Title>No more CD clultter in the car!
<Date>Thu Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Samsung/Napster player is my first MP3 player ever. I compared it to others in the market, most notably the mini iPod and finally took the plunge. I am very pleased with the player.<p>The Napster software that accompanies the player is user-friendly and the user manual is very clear and informative. My only complaint is the FM transmitter function. The sound quality is good, but not great, and there is static between tracks. You will need to find the best EQ setting for the music you're listening to or else get way too much bass pumping through your car speakers. <p>Not being able to change playlists on the go could be a hang up for some people, but if you're using it to commute, it's perfect!  <p>If you're a windows guy/girl, I recommend this player for you!

<Title>Heartbroken -- I really WANTED this to be a great product.
<Date>Wed Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>There are a b'jillion MP3 players out there.  I have wanted one for about a year, but this one had an FM transmitter, which is what really seperates it from the pack (well, that &amp; the integration with Napster, which didn't matter to me).  I wanted to be able to listen to this in my car, at home, wherever.  And the FM transmitter should make that easy -- you don't have to carry anything else; just the unit.<p>Without going on too much, here's why I'm returning it:<p>1) The FM transmitter is very poor.  It's not just that the range is short (which it is), it also has crackling static all the time, regardless of which station I selected, and regardless of how close I put the unit to my receiver/antenna.  This was the case both in my car and on my 2 home radios.  I could hear my music well only if I turned the radio way up and had the unit within 1 foot of the receiver.  Even then there was an annoying static noise going all the time.<p>2) I had to reformat it -- twice -- and I only had this thing for about 36 hours.  When I downloaded my MP3s to it, everything seemed fine, but then when I would try to disconnect the device I kept getting &quot;Cannot disconnect right now&quot; messages.  The software said it was finished transferring -- I waited another hour, nothing happened -- so I shut down my PC &amp; disconnected.  None of my files were on the unit.  I could see them in Win Explorer, but they wouldn't play on the unit.  Reformatting fixed this, but wiped the drive clean &amp; I had to start over.  Second time worked with a transfer of 100 songs.  Then when I tried to transfer the rest -- another reformat.<p>3) You can only load music (even your own MP3s that you ripped from your own CDs) through the Napster software, and the Napster software sucks.  It froze on me several times, wrote corrupted files to the MP3 device, and is generally slow.  I did upgrade the software which improved the speed &amp; stability a bit.  But now that I'm returning the player, you can bet that I'll be removing Napster from my PC.<p>Anyway, that's it.  I'm really disappointed -- all I was looking for was an MP3 player with a (decent) FM transmitter.  If I was just a little geekier I could probably make this at home.  I hate that the only player on the market with a transmitter is so unreliable &amp; has such poor sound on the transmitter.

<Title>Sadly, I'm Abandoning Napster Because of This Product
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a reconditioned YP-910GS from an Amazon dealer.  Unit works fine (although I agree with other reviewers that the FM transmitter's too weak); problem is that the current edition of the Napster software won't recognize it (though an earlier edition did, which permitted me to load some songs).  Customer Service made an initial attempt to solve the Napster software problem, then went silent.  Since the Napster software interferes with all attempts to load even Napster-purchased tracks onto the unit via WMP or any other way, I'm stuck with $90 worth of Napster songs that I can't get onto the unit.  I've thrown my hands in the air and downloaded I-Tunes (which, of course, doesn't like the Napster tracks, either).

<Content>To start the FM receiver is weak and the tramsmitter is even worse. I can have the player next to the antenna and it still gets over powered by local stations. I never got any downloads from napster and didn't care for about all of the songs that came preloaded. I had to send it back to Samsung because I had problems tranfering music files. It won't do some tranfers unless your logged on to Napster. There was no mention that you needed to be logged on to transfer music. When I got it back I still had trouble tranfering files. One of the worst purchases I have made. The only good thing is that Samsung has good tech support and customer service personel.

<Title>Do not waste your time
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This gets 2 stars because I really liked the hardware. Problem is, the software is from Napster and the hardware is from Samsung and even though they say they are in "partnership" the software doesn't work with the hardware at all.  Simple things like ripping a CD to the Samsung is a nightmare. The software acts like it's pulling CD data from CDDB, but it's not. You either get a garbled mess, or nothing. Even though the manual says that you can build a play list on your computer and then drag and drop it to the Samsung, you can't. In order to do practically anything, you have to sign in to Napster first.  And, of course, when you call for technical support, Napster blames Samsung and Samsung blames Napster. Both are pretty clueless.  Just get a standard MP3 player and forget about this Napster/Samsung stuff.

<Content>I was almost convinced to get an ipod by some friends of mine. They all say the ipod is &quot;awesome&quot;. Well, its not, its just an overpriced storage device that some people think looks cool.<p>Its large and costs too much. So does the Napster player BUT, if you are going to shell out this kind of money you might as well get the S. Napster player as its sturdier, has fm, a car adaptor, voice recorder, fm recording capabilities and works with Mp3 and WMedia files instead of the iTunes format.<p>I got my Napster player as a gift so I am happy but I almost ended up asking for an iPod.<p>I would never spend this much just to listen to music. A Gateway  or Samsung 256mb keyring player for around $100 is a fra smaller player and a better bet unless you are planning on using your device as your primary storage component, in which case the Samsung Napster player almost justifies the price while the Ipod is a blatant ripoff.

<Content>I have an Ipod, and I decided to buy a Samsung player as well (I know, I'm one of the crazies who buy gadgets instead of eat!).  While I love my ipod for storing CD's, I LOVE this new player for the simple fact that I have tons of dance mixtapes from about 1984-1999, and I wanted to be able to digitally record them onto one central location.  This can be done with the ipod, however it takes a LONG time (you have to record onto CD, then put the CD onto itunes, etc), and with the Samsung you can tranfer your tapes right onto the device.  Sound quality is not magical, but at least I have everything stored on one device now.

<Content>The Napster Samsung player in addition to being player/storage device like the iPod it ALSO acts as a recorder for all media. <p>The line in/out feature allows you to digitize your entire audio library including CD, old cassettes and Lp' s. It also plays FM and can transform the player into a car stereo with the FM transmitter. In short, the Napster Samsung player can act as you entire stereo system by just adding speakers.<p>Also the Napter service is great. Many people don't understand the benefits to the Napster premium service. They call it renting music (as if renting was a dirty word-people rent houses, cars videos!).<p>First of all on Napster you can buy individual tunes and albums just as you can on iTunes so you don't have to rent. <p>The Napster premium service allows you to listen to almost all songs in the Napster catalogue-the ENTIRE songs not just 30 second clips. You can make playlists of these songs or even download them for playing them off line. The radio stations are also customizable allowing you to skip, delete or add songs (from you own collection or the Napter library) to the 30 + pre set radio stations. All this for just $9.95 a month and you have access to the vast majority of all great songs available on line.<p>With the Samsung Napster player and the Napster premium srevice you have all you music needs met!

<Content>All this iPod and iTunes vs Napster debate is kinda funny. It seems like the only people posting reviews for this product are Apple and Samsung empolyees. Nothing can be this good or this bad. I can tell you what I do know though. The iRiver ihp-120 offers all the features of the Samsung in a package just as small and even lighter than the iPod for a price fifty bucks less than both of these products. In my experience with digital audio, iRiver is the company to go with for both value and performance. Even if the player is extremely difficult to get your hands on, its worth it to check out. By the way, firmware upgrades will soon support the .aac used by iTunes.

<Title>A Word Of Caution
<Date>Sun Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Any product with music controlled by WMA may be lost if the service providing it goes under. Right now, Napster 2.0 is outsold by the iTunes store by a 5 to 1 margin. If Napster 2.0 never gets any traction and goes under, you may lose all the music you bought because Napster will not be there to authenticate it. If you buy this player, I'd only use MP3's with it. Of course, if you are really going to spend this kind of money, I'd stick with the best and get an iPod. No WMA worries with music from the iTunes store.<p>Before using this player for Napster songs, please learn more about Napster and WMA/DRM at Napster's "Terms An Conditions" Site. http://www.napster.com/terms.html<p>Be sure to read and understand the portions about "Napster may at any time lose the right to make certain Tracks and/or Materials available. In such event, you will no longer be able to obtain these Tracks and/or Materials or to utilize the "Sync/Restore" function for Purchased Tracks."<p>and <p>"Any security technology that is provided with a Purchased Track is an inseparable part of it."<p>Learn more about iTunes DRM at http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/<p>Digital Rights Management is new to many people, so it pays to learn about it before spending alot of money on anybody's player. <p>I do like the 10+ hours of battery life on this player, the iPod is only 8+ hours.

<Content>Just read the ridiculous Mac mentality pro ipod review. it says not to buy the Samsung Napster player because Apple is going to put Napster out of business!.<br>Even if this Mac fantasy were to come true, its irrelevant to the player's usefulness. Any songs that you buy in WMA format will continue to play on the Samsung Napster player (and the more than 400 other players made by Gateway,Dell, Rio,Iriver etal). You can also easily transfer WMA files to mp3 files using Roxio or Real Player software.<p>If you have bought the WMA files they are untethered and do not require any authentication from Napster or any other service.<p>The Napster Samsung player is far superior to the ipod and for the price you get far more features (fm tramsmitter and recording capabilities)<br>The Ipod is a closed system that does not function with WMA.

<Date>Tue Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, I figured this would be a good idea, since I am using Napster for all my downloads now, why not get an MP3 player directly from them. And the 20 free songs was a good way to finally get me to purchase this item for the insane price of 400 dollars at the time (8/2003). Ok down the to nitty gritty. The idea is nice, when it actually decides to work, which is rarely, it works really well and relatively easy. Download a song into napster, right-click the song on napster and it automatically downloads into ur MP3 player, disconnect the player from the computer, and boom, instant music. Good Concept right? Yea for the first 2 months. After that it kept crashing, losing every song Ive downloaded into it, and just stop working all together. I had to replace it twice! Thank God for Best Buy. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT PLAN. Or better yet, just dont buy this item. Save yourself the headache. If you do decide to buy this item, be prepared for the thing freezing on the opening page with the little napster logo mocking you as you cant get the thing to start. Get ready for all your songs to automatically dissappear for no apparent reason, and be prepared for the annoying problems when you connect the USB to your computer and it keeps disconnecting for no reason. Its just to much of a headache. I have 2 more returns for this thing then they give me my money back. Im going to bring it back again tomorrow since it froze on me again. Only one more to go. I give it one more month. DO NOT BUY THIS!

<Content>The antenna is worthless.<br>Transferring songs MUST be done through the Napster software and it reuploads the ENTIRE list everytime you want to update music. It's a real pain. You cannot just copy and paste mp3's to the player.  Song lists cannot be created on the fly and this is needed for a player that holds 5000 songs

<Content>This was my second hard-drive player. The first was the HP-Iriver 20gb and I returned that one. This one is also going back. I was looking for a device that would work with Windows Media Player and Napster's new music service, so the Samsung fit the bill. Unfortunately the device doesn't play playlists. The best you could do is play all the music on your device, or individually select songs. Neither of those are handy. You can play recently transferred songs which suffices until the songs you want no longer show up in that list. Support from Samsung is poor. The radio reception is also poor even when you are outside and expect decent reception.

<Content>I Found this player to do everything it says it will. The software is simple to use and easily found all my tracks and set them up in the Napster program. The FM transmitter is a very nice feature. It works great it both my vehicles. No more cd&quot;s flying around the car. The FM radio works great also. My battery meter looked as if it was going to die after only 4 hours, but I set it down and let it play for 3 1/2 more past the last bar on the meter. Plan on 8 to 10 hours playing time with no downloading.If you follow the instructions on plugging in the USB and disconnecting you will have no problems. Some reveiws claim you cant make playlists,when you can make as many as you want with over 200 songs in each playlist. The Napster Yp-910 works with Napster or Windows media player. You can find these units for around 200.0 dollars now, way less than IPOD. The Dell jukebox is 15 gig for 200.0. The only thing missing is ripping software in the Napster player. So far this has been a very easy to use and quality player. I bought a cell phone belt clip and took it to the shoe repairman and had him sew the male end into the belt loop of the case that comes with this player. It makes it alot easier to unclip it to search for tunes or put away than undoing your belt. Also, Radio Shack sells an armband that is used for small walkie talkies that fit this unit perfect on sale for 1.50.

<Content>This is the EASIEST WMA player EVER!! I am completely computer iliterate and this is by FAR the best on the market. I tried out and returned the MPIO and the iPOD. The Samsung Player is the best 20GB on the market and is a VERY reasonable price compared to the iPOD. The iPOD is more expensive, and it doesn't come with the FM transmitter.   The reviewer who said that you could not add playlists, must be completely blind. You can drag and drop playlists from your Napster account to the portable device and I have numerous playlists on my device. They each hold up to 300 songs.  Check it out!!

<Content>The Napster Samsung was the first player Ive bought,and I have been using it now for 4 months. I have not had ANY problems with this unit. Dont believe this crap about uploading only with napster software, I have used my musicmatch, media player and the napster software to upload with and all have worked fine. With any players storage size you will have some used for the operating software, so as it states a 20g you only get about 17.5g for storage. Battery will last for 10 hours of continious play with a recharge in a couple hours.(let the player go dead for full recharge) Fm  will only pick up a very strong station,Fm transmitter works ok. Remote works well for what it can do,mostly for volume adjustments. The only problem was the headphones,will not stay in ears so upgrade to a pair of sony's . For the price of this player compared to what else is out there you cant go wrong !

<Content>Was pretty impressed with the player. Have an IPOD, but missed the extra stuff - fm radio for the health club, fm transmitter. The FM transmitter is a little weak, but it does play quite well in the car. The FM radio reception is strong also picks up a lot of stations, that other portable radio's never do (KROQ in LA is crystal clear) The only weak point is the navigation, the song selector dial is on the side and sometimes it takes 2 tries to change the song, but liveable when you have got playlists.

<Content>I thought the hardware was most excellent, except for not being able to ever remove music from the player, and even though it seems to act like another hard drive in Explorer, if you transfer music to it from Explorer the unit won't see it.   The Napster software interface is pure junk, everything seems to work fine on my work computer but does nothing but lock up my home computer no matter what I try, un-re-installing drivers/program etc. The tech support from Napster is slow to respond and cannot give me suggestions to make this thing work. In their favor they do actually reply with suggestions on what to try. I also don't like having to be registered with Napster and online with them to be able to transfer music to the player.   Really thought I had a winner here, works at work, not at home. Sound reproduction is excellent though.   You can create playlists in the Napster software, but if you have 2 playlists and they both contain the same song, that song is then listed in your player twice. Napster interface is crap! There should be a way to use this thing without having to use the Napster software. It lists the songs in your hard drive library. Move the songs to another directory, and it still thinks they are in the old directory and continues to list them, with no option to refresh the list.   It has also yet to allow me to do a sync/restore, which is the only way to copy music back from the player. USB 2 is what it wants, which locks up my computer until I unplug the player. USB 1 sees the unit in Explorer, but does you no good. They need a simple interface that works, or allows you to use Explorer to move your music back and forth.
