<Title>Look elsewhere, this is a poor-quality mp3 player
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>While I'm a big fan of Lexar's flash memory cards, this MP3 player is a very poor choice, even though its memory can be expanded via a larger-capacity SD card.  First of all, this player is thick.  Companies like Creative Labs have thin and stylish MP3 players, but this Lexar is thick and unstylish -- you have to see it in person to see what I mean.  It's not really butt-ugly like iRiver players, but still very plain.  Again, it's the thickness that unpleasantly surprised me.  Second, sound quality is TERRIBLE.  The same MP3 files (encoded at 192kbps) that sound great on the iPod sound muffled and colorless on this Lexar.  Worse, there are occasional pop noises that are not present on the iPod or Archos AV320.  This is just terrible.  For this alone, I advise you stay away from this Lexar product.  Third, the buttons are hard to use (esp. when the player is in the cheap clear plastic case) and the screen is hard to see in most lighting situations.  This is simply one of the most user-unfriendly MP3 players I've come across.  Fourth, yes it has built-in FM, but its reception is horrible.  My tiny $5 no-name AM/FM radio gets clear reception here in the office, but the Lexar gets nothing but statics.  I don't think this is because I got a lemon; from what I've read elsewhere, this is a common complaint.  In short, while I'll continue to buy Lexar flash memory, I'll advise anyone not to even think about getting this MP3 player from them.  In fact, if you search on Amazon you'll see their other MP3 players are no good, either.

<Title>ajayisht123's review of lexar ldp 600
<Date>Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i bought this player 5 months ago and i am more than satisfied with its performance. it is packed with many features ans is till now the only mp3 player in the market that broadcasts to radio. apart from that it has a long battery life of atleat 11 hours on a single charge and is rechargable vis a usb port of a pc or laptop.   i like it's sleek and stylish look, and is comparitively smaller than most older players in the market. although size does matter to me, this size of this player seems perfect to me.   the sound quality is quite good and there are no dips, or distortions when playing music on a high volume.   thge only down side to this player is the built in radio, the receiver is not too strong and so the radio signals are sometimes very weak, even if you are indoors.   i would highly recommed this player to anyone wanting to buy a mid range feature rich player or is a first time mp3 player buyer.

<Title>Lexar LDP-600 is the best MP3 for the money
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anyone who says this is not a good mp3 player does not know what they are talking about. If you shop around, you can get one for under $100.00. The sound is terrific and the earbuds that it comes with have a great sound. It is not only expandable with cheap SD memory cards, it also has a FM transmitter and an FM radio with a good signal. Simply put, the best MP3 out there, with every feature in players twice as much. Why pay for an I-pod for twice the cost that has no FM radio, no FM transmitter, no expandable memory and is limited on the music files it can download. Lexar should pay me a marketing fee for this review.

<Title>Good Sound Quality - Hard to use - Freezes a lot
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have this player for 5 months now & am looking already to replace it.  Pros:I really liked the sound quality, FM transmitter and the battery life.  Cons: 1)When a expansion SD card is used the MP3 player freezes upon start-up one out of five times. It then needs to be reset with a pin (it usually happens on the train when there's no pin  to be found. 2)You can't navigate the music files from the Expansion slot to the Actual players memory. You have to manually set the player If you want to select from the SD card or the players memory. 3)Poor instructions in manual (pdf) included.  4)Hard to navigate the button & options.  I never use the FM radio & Voice Recorder,

<Title>Amazing Product...
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After toying with the controls and familarizing myself with this mp3, I was amazed that everything works as discribed on specs. I wished that i would have ordered two at the price i have gotten it at. The was only one down side to this product, while play with it the display went blank on me, maybe it was my pressing to many buttons at the same time.  I'll hold off on sending it back for replacement for a few days, to see if it happens again.

<Title>Worse Player ever made
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have purchase this player in April because I went to a Wedding to California. It worked and when I bought in April and in May I came back and three (3) months later in July the battery is not holding so I had to call Lexar for a replacement and they did send me a replacement. I got the replacement in August and then guess what happen agian? YES the battery will not hold again. This is ridiculous. I mean the new one is a lemon and the EXCHANGE one is lemon too. Lexar makes cheap cheap cheap things except for memory. The shouldn't make MP3 Players anymore and just stick with making memory. Like the I-PODS and other manufactures who uses a built in rechargeable battery and when the battery dies your screwed. If they say pay $30-60 to replace a battery I rather buy a new MP3. If you get there extended service plans that is crazy you can even but a new one if you get there extended service. Think about about it when you're buying MP3 players. My suggestion is buy an MP3 player that uses batteries like for a walkman or rechargeable batteries for cameras because once they die you can get batteries at a CHEAPER price. I am going to REFUND my money for my player. Don't ever buy from LEXAR or any other compnies that uses built in rechargeable batteries.  Nothing good about this player.  Rechargeable batter (Built in) always dieing every three months. Think about it after the warranty is over what are you going to do with it. You're stuck.

<Title>OK mp3 player for the price
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this product for about a year and a half now without any major problems. Some of the other reviewers should check to see if their firmware is updated to vs 1.7 as this fixed several issues with the unit. I have to say that for the price this player performs well. I use it with some Phillips sound reducing headphones and I think it sound pretty good. The fm transmitter is a little weak and the ear buds work as a better antenna than the one that comes with it. Also the menus are not very intuitive but after a while you can navigate them fairly quickly. I'd have to say that for the $60 that I spent I'm pretty happy. It's no ipod but then again it doesn't cost $300 either.
