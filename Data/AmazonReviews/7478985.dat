<Title>Tunes and Photos on the GO-GO-GO

<Content>Love it- need it- you must have it  - a must for people that love thier music want to share photos and present a slide show with family and friends. The 30GB is large enough to accomodate lots of images and tunes. The controls and navigation is simple - build quality is excellent - the color screen is clear and beautiful - well worth every penny.

<Title>Love it!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It stores a lot of music and photos, and fits in your pocket.  I'm a musician, so I can't live without my music; however, anyone who loves listening to music will enjoy it.  As with any other iPod, you can have everything you want to hear, whenever you want it, without carrying CDs.  The photo feature is also really cool.  I've had it for over a year and it's been working flawlessly!!!

<Title>great product, but.....i'm still trying to get mine to turn on....
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod is an amazing device that eliminates the need to carry around thousands of CD's, and allows one to create master mixes of their favorite music. The Ipod Photo even lets you at 25,000 of your favorite photos and place them in a nifty slide show viewer. yes, that's all wonderful and great, but there are some buyer beware issues with the Apple Ipod. First of all, sometimes the Ipod will "decide" to not work properly, i.e the turn dial will not turn, the Ipod will die on its own, the battery won't last that long. I have owned my 30 gig pod for about eight months now and it has acted funny since I got it. I try to take care of it the best that I can, but sometimes it seems that the IPod has a life of its own and can decide when it wants to work and when it wants to take a day off. Still, it's a remarkable piece of electronics and I highly recommend purchasing some kind of MP3 player if you are a jogger, biker or a music collector/lover.

<Title>There is an iPod killer out there
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had my ipod for 2 months and everything went wrong...Let me start with the: 1) Battery- u need to buy at least 2 more batteries because the battery completeyl drains to where you can't listen to anything anymore. When that happens, all of that precious music that you spent 2 weeks or 2 months downloading is nonexistent, it deletes everything 2) A 30GB holds 7500 songs...I am a proud owner of the Sony NW-A3000 (20GB) it holds almost 15000 songs, that's right, 15000 songs 3) Trying to get support from apple is like being on life support and someone pulls the plug...enough said 4)Using itunes almost made me break my ipod from all the frustration. Sony uses sonicstage and it can be a royal pain to use, but that software compresses the files which give you more space on your player. A LOT MORE SPACE!!!  My Sony HW-A3000 may not hold videos (Which I never watched on my ipod anyway because I work out) or photos (for the same resason) but I've had it for 4 months and only had to recharge the battery completey 10 TIMES! SONY actually got it right this time There is an ipod killer, it's name is Sony NW-A3000

<Title>Thinking different is cool, Apple iPod is not.
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.   That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).   I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time.

<Title>A Good Product Worth Considering if in the MP3 Player Market
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its true, the 4th generation 30 gig Apple Ipod is a very good product.  Is it great?  Well, maybe not.  But its not that this 4G model does not have every thing that some body wants out of an MP3 player, including video, the ability to hold and show pictures (about 25,000 of them), music (7,500 songs) and a pretty good battery life when listening to music of at least 10-15 hours per charge.  When writing a review of any Ipod I believe that you must mention Apple's Itunes software, which make is very easy to buy and download music to your Ipod, that is why it is the industry leader this in regard.  Also, the body of the Ipod is very slim, the menu of the device is very easy to figure out even if you have never used one before.  Within minutes of turning it on you will be able to understand how to download music, create play lists and arrange your music just the way that you want it.  Whether you like the Apple Ipod or not as an electronic device you have to give Apple credit for the fact that it is very easy to use, all the way around.    So, what's wrong with the Ipod?  Well, the fact that the battery life on this particular model is very limited when you are watching video on it, about two hours.  Also, while the screen of the 4G Ipod is very crisp and clean, it is just hard to view.  But then again, a small MP3 player like the Ipod is naturally going to have a small screen, there is really nothing you can do about that, it does though strain your eyes to view the screen for long periods of time. Also, the screen does scratch very, very, very easily.  Any thing will do it and I think that it is real down side to this product, it should have made so that any body could be able to carry it in their pocket without worrying about whether the screen is going to scratch or not.  That would resemble to me at least that it is a product that is made to last, instead of one that is made to last until next Ipod comes out so that maybe you have to buy another one.  I would really recommend that you purchase a protective case for any Ipod that you buy because they all seem to scratch pretty easy.  Having been a fan of Apple products throughout the years I would say that this product is worth a four out of five.  I wish that all Ipod came with a home docking station instead of just the USB cable to charge and download music.  I think they sell those docks for 20 bucks, but they make them for only 5 in China and it would great if they included that in the package.  The sound quality of the Ipod is very good, and it should be for a couple of hundred bucks but if Apple doesn't make some changes to the 6G Ipod which is probably due out right before Christmas 2006 I believe that other players could offer some resistance to Apple's market share.  This includes adding wi-fi, maybe a built in satellite radio function, perhaps different colors for the Ipod, touch face design, maybe a wide screen, it has to be some thing to set the Ipod a part from every other MP3 player out there.  All coupled with at least 20 hour battery life with music and 10 hour battery life with video, I think that is one thing that every body can agree on.

<Content>I've owned my ipod Photo 30 GB for three years now, and the only problem I've really had has been with the original ear buds wearing out. I found OEM replacements on EBay for cheap:  they're good enough for me right now.  I am glad I purchased a neoprene case to protect the fragile little whizzer from the get go.  I have dropped it a few times, and the case saved its life.

<Title>awful investment
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the ipod photo and I was extremely excited. I brought it home and installed the software and everything looked good to go. I had to change all of my wma audio files to mp3 to put on itunes and that was a horrible pain. I have over 500 albums and I had maybe 12 done after over 3 hours. Anyway after just a bit the ipod started saying do not disconnect. This would not leave the screen. I tried turning it on and off, ejecting from comp, etc. I troubleshot for over 5 hours to no avail, I reinstalled it 5 times. No go. What a piece of crap. Apple prides itself on the ipod but it is a bunch of conformist garbage and I would never wish my grief on anyone. I'm gonna buy an iriver. Screw ipod. Ifthat stupid U2 commercial doesn't turn you off I hope this review will DO NOT BUY ONE!!! (...)

<Title>Totally stoked on my brand new 30 gig photo!!!
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had a really hard time choosing between the 20 gig iPod and the 30 gig photo but I definitely made the right decision in the end. It is DEFINITELY worth the extra $50, don't kid yourselves. You're getting another 10 gigs, the awesome color screen (some of you may not care about this feature, but I love it and it's so much more fun and bright than the b/w models), the photo capability (I enjoy this, too!) and some other stuff. Like they say, everything looks better in color! I got all geeky on my iTunes library and tracked down all the album covers I could find so I could see them when the songs play.  Now, for those of you who don't have USB 2.0 or Firewire, like me a while ago, a company called TechGear makes a nifty little device that looks like a pen drive called the USB 2.0 2-port transfer hub. It's compatible with USB 1.1 and you can plug it right in your USB 1.1 port and then you've got two 2.0 ports. It's about 15 dollars, I'm sure you can find it on Amazon (I got it at Circuit City).   For those with Windows XP worried about having to install Service Pack 2 (or rip your hair out trying to get it because you don't actually own a copy of Windows XP, like me), don't bother. This didn't cause me one problem and I was installing the software and listening to songs on my iPod in minutes. I don't know about other version of Windows, though. This was a huge relief. SP2 is nothing but problems and I don't want them on my computer.  One of my favorite things about the iPod would have to be how freaking loud it can go. I like my music nice and loud and this more than quenches my thirst for that. Especially in the mornings, I usually put on something heavy and loud to keep me awake (and everyone else around me on the subway). Seriously everyone, this thing can go ridiculously loud.   Anyways, put a b/w and a color iPod next to one another (I did so at BestBuy with some demo versions the day I purchased mine) and if you are going to look at both and buy the 20 gig you are cheating yourself. Splurge a bit! You deserve it! Like I said, the extra $50 is worth it and than some. Don't make the wrong decision, 30 gig photo all the way. I highly recommend!!!!!!

<Title>PERFECTION!
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As I recieved the 30GB Apple iPod for a gift I was thrilled.  I had been wanting to get one for a long time and finally had one in my hands.  Man, was I excited.  There are many things that make the iPod Photo VERY different from the 20GB iPod and the 60GB iPod Photo.  I will compare the Apple iPod 30GB to each of it's competitors that most buy may buy instead.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod Photo 60GB  You may think: "Wow, 60GB is a lot of memory and it can't be much more bigger than the 30GB, right?" Wrong.  You will NEVER use all of the 60GB unless you have the enourmously large music collection of somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 songs.  If you just so happen to have 15,000 songs waiting to be put in an iPod, knock yourself out and go for the 60GB.  7,500 songs is still a great deal of songs, and if each album has 20 songs, then it would fit 375 Albums.  The main thing that comes to mind is that the 30GB is WAY lighter than the 60GB model.  I messed around with my Uncle's 60GB and it was very heavy. It was also very thick, also. When I opened the 30GB, it was as light as a feather, and extremely thin compared to the 60GB.  Also, my Uncle was having all sorts of problems with his 60GB iPod, and I have yet to have one single problem with mine.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod 20GB  There really isnt any contest here.  The overly priced 20GB comes  in black and white while the 30GB comes in color.  Also, you can see the album cover on the 30GB and nothing on the 20GB.  You may not really need the Photo feature, but if you do, the 30GB holds a ton of photos, where the 20GB does not have the capability to store photos.  Basically for only $50 more, you get many excellent features that make the iPod much more fun.  The color screen, photo storing, album cover viewing, 10 more gigs(2,500 more songs), AND more battery life.  The 30GB has a 15 hour battery life while the 20GB only has 12 hours.  If you ask me, that's well worth a 50 Bucks.  Overall, I Highly reccomend the Apple 30GB iPod Photo. I love it and wouldn't change anything about it!

<Title>Undeniably great, MP3s and a photo album too.
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must preface this review with a confession.  I am *NOT* an Apple fan, but I'm slowing beginning to see the merit in many of the Apple products today.  My first computer was an Apple //e, and then I just moved on...  ...Twenty years later, I found myself looking for a birthday gift for The Wife.  I decided to get her something she could use to store the hundreds of pictures we have taken of our son.  I'm a believer of convergence, so I wanted to also put her music collection in the same device.  I immediately looked at Archos, iRiver, and Creative for their solutions.  Each one in turn was compared to the Apple iPod Photo.  Each one fell short.  Some had more storage but less battery life.  Some had difficult UI issues, others had navigation that was less than intuitive.  If the thing was for me, I'd have gone with the Archos for the storage size.  But The Wife doesn't need to be confused or annoyed with UI choices and over-capability.  Simple, direct, useful.  It doesn't hurt that the iPod is stylish, either.  I ordered one, and the optional dock, and the Griffin iTrip.  Took delivery quickly, opened up the well-designed packing, and was suprised at how small the iPod was.  Also, Apple will engrave a few sentences for free if you order directly.  Since this was a gift, that was the route I took.  Some things I didn't like?  Price.  The dock being made optional in this iteration of the iPod.  The lack of a Firewire cable, or AV cables.  Apple should be bundling these items with the iPod; breaking them out to soak customers will likely hurt them later.  If you accept the pricing and grab the optional items, you're in for a treat.  It worked perfectly out of the box.  Install the software, install the dock, dock the iPod.  I had her songs transferred over in less than an hour, her photos of our boy in less than ten minutes.  All 30 gigabytes were filled, too.  Now she has Axe from Brazil, Depeche Mode, and Metallica to get her to work and back; and now she can show off all 600 pictures of The Boy wherever she goes.    And she can finally stop asking me where all the pictures of The Boy are, because they will always be synchronized to the iPod.  And when she wants to hear her music, the iTrip will transmit on any free FM frequency to her car radio, or the kitchen radio, or wherever... and hopefully, she likes her birthday present.  Fred

<Content>The iPod photo is without a qualm the most prevailing mp3 player on the bazaar. This apparatus is exceedingly astounding. Occasionally, I have thus had a intricate time figuring out how they essentially prepared such a device as grand as this. The sound quality is dazzling. The look is outstanding. The grip is exceptional. And if you're as near as rich as Nick Manos, the price is stupendous. Overall I bestow this item vast praise. Do yourself a favor and acquire one now!

<Title>Thousands of Songs in Your Pocket! Does it get any better?
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you're like me, you see a new product like the iPod Photo and the techno-lust starts to kick in. The price of the new have-to-have gadget gives you pause, so you read online reviews and start to save your soda cans. Then the day comes. You shell out your hard-earned dollars, and you now have that cool gadget in your hands. Then after a few weeks or months, that had-to-have gadget sits on your desk collecting dust. All the fun was in the wanting, and the product never really lived up to the hype.  Well, let me be the first to tell you... This was not the case with the iPod Photo. I love this thing!  All Your Music - Everywhere You Go: My entire CD collection fits on this thing with plenty of room to spare. Did I mention that this device is smaller than a deck of cards? No more lugging around a handful of CDs wishing that you remembered to grab that other CD on the way into work. Not to mention that with the iPod Photo I can grab the album art from somewhere like say ... Amazon.com, and it displays when I play a track from the CD. You can't do that with the standard iPods as far as I know. The battery life is great. After charging all night, I listen to music on my one hour commute into work, eight hours at work (some days), and then an hour on the way home again. Not even close to running out of power. The sound quality is great, and for headphone listening there's more than enough power to make your ears bleed ... this is a good thing in my opinion.  So if you've never owned an iPod before, what makes this thing so great?  Discover New Music: The iTunes Store offers more than 1 million songs, some of which you may have never heard of for only 99 cents a song, and sometimes even for free. That's FREE as in Beer (and that's always a great thing).  Discover Podcasts: What are podcast? Think of them as talk radio broadcasts that you can listen to whenever you want. There are podcasts on just about any topic you can think of:  sports talk, political opinion, tech-geek news, movie and music reviews, and my favorite "The Dawn and Drew Show" (which defies definition ... think ADHD Seinfeld with an R rating).  Audio Books: Listen to those books you've been meaning to read, but never have the time. One Minute Manager, Seven Habits, etc ...  Carry Your Contact List: Now I've ditched my (dusty) PDA since my contact list was really the main reason I had to carry one. You can upload your entire contact list to your iPod, and phone numbers, email addresses, everything is right there with you.  Photos on your iPod: Aside from the CD cover art, this is not a feature I've played with yet ... what can I say ... I have to sleep sometime.  My advice is buy the 60GB if you can afford it, but my 30GB is not even half full yet. Either way... Give in to your techno-lust and BUY ONE!

<Title>Best MP3 Player By Far
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was holding out on purchasing an apple iPod photo. I didn't want to give into the hype, i was waiting for the perfect mp3 player, but the bottom line is that there is none. I was either going to purchase this or a creative zen touch 40gb. I opted to go with the iPod photo. I'm not a supporter of mac whatsoever, but the iPod impressed me. 30gb is more than ample room for those musid hoarders like myself. Apple says 30 gb of music but 5gb itself is taken up already, due to the awesome programs such as games, contacts, calendars, etc. that apple pre-installed. I'll give my pros and cons below, but overall this is an awesome product, no mp3 player out there is a match. DON'T PURCHASE creative mp3 hd based mp3 players. The hd usually freezes up within 6 months of use even less and you have to send it back to creative for a hd repair, but the customer service is crap to say the least.  Pro: - 3o gb of space plenty of room - album art capabilities - easy user interface in iPod as well as program supplied to transfer music. iTunes   Cons: - although it shows album art the downfall of it is you have to manually upload those album arts. Typically it shows if u have purchased the dl through iTunes, but like me i download music from another source, there are already album art included with the music, but iTunes does not transfer the art into the iPod. You have to purchase a separte program such as iart to make it easier on yourself  - low sound. As compared to the creative i purchased the sound on the iPod is not impressive. You would think with the amount you're paying it would. I suggest getting better earphones which boosts the sound quality   Overall iPod photo 30gb is well worth the money

<Title>(Quite) A Few Quibbles
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, let me start by saying that this is a very good product. But it is FAR from perfect. I have many complaints, often quite petty (after all, this is my first iPod), but for the $300 or so price tag I expect CLOSE to perfect...   Quibbles:  1. You can't load pictures directly from the camera/memory card onto the iPod. Or, rather, you can't view photos loaded directly. In order to view photos, they must be moved to your computer and loaded through the iPhoto software. This is a MAJOR dissapointment for anyone travelling with their iPod and camera.   2. The (necessary) iTunes software is not compatible with Windows 98 or ME. Devastating to those of us with older computers full of MP3s.   3. The iTunes software is constantly redirecting me to their store. Very obnoxious.   4. I firmly believe that any product that costs me around a week's salary should come with all the necessary accessories. Noticably absent: a carrying case (if you dont want it severely scratched), flash card reader, fire wire, decent headphones, etc. etc. All told, be ready to sink another hundred (or three...) on "fun add-ons".   5. Could they not add some better games?? My cell phone has way better games than this. My TI-83 calculator (yeah, I was a bit of a nerd in high school) had better games than this. What a waste of a color screen...   Complaints aside, the iPod still rocks. The sound quality and design are unsurpassed; the software and database style song sorting are strong - there are clear reasons why the iPod is becoming a cultural icon of the digital age. But, given the price and potential for improvement, I wish I'd waited for a better version.

<Title>BEST MP3 PLAYER ON MARKET!!!
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best MP3 player on the martket. It beats others hands-down. 15 hour battery life, 7,500 songs, and pictures. What else could you ask for. So simple to use, easily to navigate and find your songs, and automatically syncs with your computer every time you hook it up. Even better, it's in color. Think of it as a digital photo album. Much smaller and easier to carry than 750+ Cds that you would have to carry around. With all the accesories there is so much possibilities. I would definately recomend the iTrip. Great addition because you have the ability to play in any stereo that has FM. Not any drawbacks unless you are really really picky.

<Title>Incredibly Nice Change
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wrote in my previous iPod photo review that it was horrible. Now I think this is the iPod to go with. This 30 gigabyte version is only $349.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the normal 20 gigabyte version. They have this 30 GB version and the 60 GB version. The discontinued the 40 GB version. This holds 7,500 songs and 25,000 pictures. It's only .62 inches in depth which is extremely thin compared to the .75" for the 60 GB. I still do think that the color screen is a waste but ever since they discontinued the 40 GB normal iPod and the 40 GB photo iPod I really have nothing to complain about (price wise). Even the 60 gigabyte is only $449.99. Now the iPod Photo is really going to sell. I would no doubt look into this. If Apple proved me wrong on the iPod Photo and you are having doubts just read this review and you might want to get one for yourself!

Like if you play "american idiot" on the ipod photo, the infamous heart grenade appears left of the song title.  Big screen not much thicker than 20 gig.  I am glad they discontinued all the 40gig models.  This is definately the #1 mp3 player on the market.  the only thing better is the 60 gig.  ipod photo for 100 bucks more.  I recommend the 30 if you want the ipod to fit in your pocket.

<Product Name>Apple iPod 30 GB Photo White M9829LL/A (4th Generation)
<Title>Incredible, Simply Incredible
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I do not own a 30 gig model.  I actually was able to get a 40 gig on closeout.  Although the 30 gig is a little smaller and lighter, it has the same features as the 40.  I have never been so impressed with a product before.  I have it to where when a song begins to play, it also shows the album cover.  When friends view my iPod this helps them discern which cd to buy.  It is also just cool.  Another benefit would be the photo's features.  My family and friends are photo fanatics and this product allows me to carry around all of my favorite pictures and produce them for friends immediately.  The small two inch screen does and incredible job with the photos when viewing.  Now the 40 gig came with a docking station, fire wire cable, USB 2.0 cable, adaptor, carrying case, and cords that allow you to plug the photo into a television.  I do highly suggest the purchase of these accessories.  They simply make life much easier.  Battery life on the iPod photo is not dazzling but not bad.  The weight of this player, although heavier than most, is still not really an issue.  The sound quality is remarkable.  Whether I am playing music through a television, the ear buds, or in the car, the sound is just as good as if it was from a perfect cd.  The only gripe that I have is that it is terribly easy to scratch which really does not affect the performance of the player.  As I have said from the beginning, for the price and the features, you simply cannot go wrong.  I have muddled with other mp3 players, but iPod is simply the best and this is the premier of their line.  With many other products you feel as if you are settling for the product.  You will never have this feeling with the iPod photo, it knows it is the best and illustrates that to you every time you turn it on.  It is incredible, simply incredible.

<Product Name>Apple iPod 30 GB Photo White M9829LL/A (4th Generation)
<Title>30gig color VS. 20gig B&W
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>SCOPE: Because of the price drop on the color models, this review will be targeted to those struggling over a 20gig b&w screen vs. the 30gig color iPod decision.   BACKGROUND: I own both the 40gig iPod Photo and the new 30gig iPod Photo, and have owned a 15gig regular 4G iPod in the past and I also own a 512mb Shuffle. I use both PC and Mac formats.  Note, I am not recommending the 60gig variety.   1) BOTTOM LINE: The new 30gig iPod Photo @ $349 is, in my opinion, the *perfect* iPod.  My main complaint with the 40gig iPod photo was its price and size/weight (i gave it 4 stars).  The new 30gig is roughly the same size/weight as the b&w 20gig and has all the features of the Photo family --> and for just $50 more, you get another 10 gigs, 3 more hours of battery time and a color screen!!!  This price/feature tradeoff is one of the best you'll find anywhere in the Apple product suite.  Frankly, the 20gig b&w is currently mis-priced @ $299, i would expect this price to drop very soon.   NOTE:  30gig iPod Photo = $11.63 /per gig -- $23.26 /per hour battery time 20gig iPod b&w = $14.95 /per gig -- $24.91 /per hour battery time  2) PHOTO QUALITY: Good to "pretty good".. but not excellent (no improvement since the first iPod Photos were released in 10/04)... I do realize the size of the screen is only 2 inches, but photos tend to be slightly pixilated, even the full resolution ones that are over 2mb (though you stop noticing after a minute) and color reproduction is not all that great on skin tones and deep reds, but very good w/ greens&blues... which make pics of landscapes quite nice!   3) PHOTOS ON MY TV: Now this is where this thing shines... this is a really cool feature... however you MUST BUY the mini-plug-to-RCA-out (headphone to 3 pronged yellow/white/red) for another $20, which in my opinion is worth it.. you can scroll through your photos on your big (or at least bigger than your computer screen) TV screen.   4) MUSIC: Biggest change here is you can now see the album art... sounds like a tiny feature, but after you get tired of showing off your photo albums, this is probably the single most useful feature.  When before you had no incentive to look down at your ipod screen, now you'll find yourself looking at it all the time... In terms of music playback, it's the same as any click-wheel, 4G iPod.   5) SIZE/WEIGHT: Its great!, I cannot physically tell the difference in size and weight between the 20gig b&w and the 30gig iPod Photo... this was my #1 complaint about the iPod Photo 40gig -> it was simply too big and heavy to be practical... that's why I was forced to buy the Shuffle!  6) COSMETIC CHANGES: None on the outside, still scratches as easily as the rest, but has a color screen w/ a new font and screen looks very dark w/out the backlight.   7) BATTERY LIFE: Conditional based on the user... However, so far it seems to run above spec during mixed use = 16hours.   8) STORAGE: Disk access time for photos do have a lag (on both my 40gig and 30gig), and the unit tends to freeze from time to time, but I would consider the severity and frequency of this event to be insignificant to the overall functionality.  In terms of size -> i think audio books, photos, and Podcast Radio programs have made -for the first time- the ridiculous size of the hard drives actually justifiable... in my 40gig photo, i used 15gigs due to my podcasts and audio books and would expect to reach 30gigs in 3-4 years of use... I still feel the 60gig to be not very practical... i suggest you stick with the smaller size.   == SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX==   A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better (if you are the rare few that bought your computer in the last few months w/ 4.0, you still have to download an upgrade to 4.03) ... Now I bought my iMac from the Apple website last Christmas and it still shipped w/ iLife 2.0... so I had to purchase iLife 4.0 (according to several company reps, there is no free upgrade from the jump from 2.0 to 4.0)...which took me an additional day to figure out... Yes, you can assign folders and such to sync to your photos to your iPod, BUT having an album editor enables full control of changes and what changes I'm making, to the entire process. Oh Yeah, you need a high version of iTunes as well; my pod came w/ ver. 4.7... IMHO, you \need\ the iPhoto upgrade to enjoy this purchase.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) TRANSITIONS: Only the "wipe" from right-to-left is included, however, I heard a firmware upgrade with more transitions would be out later this year.   C) SLIDESHOWS: You cannot assign multiple music lists in iTunes to specific albums in iPhoto... as of 03/05, you can only assign a SINGLE music list to ALL photo albums when you enable the slideshow feature. Yes, you can change this music list, but need to go back to the menu to do so.   D) COLOR SCREEN: When not backlit, the screen during regular music playback turns \VERY\ dark, much more so than regular B&W iPods... you need a light source reflecting off of the screen in order to see the letters... typeface has changed too, more like "Arial" and slightly smaller. Oh yeah, with the backlight off, the screen still displays in color.   TECHNICAL DETAILS:   A) You cannot adjust the color quality, size, cropping or transitions of the photos when detached from your computer, so don't waste your 1 customer service call credit on it.   B) The 30gig package does not come with the TV-out cable, you have to buy it ($20), and it comes w/ a USB 2.0 based charger, not firewire.    C) If you never upgrade your iTunes due to the hacks you can employ on earlier versions, then you cannot use the photo feature (yes I tried).  D) ALBUM ART: For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, you don't have to purchase a song from iTunes to get album art... just drag and drop an image of the album cover into the window where iTunes usually shows the album art.... plus there are programs out there that auto-download the album art into iTunes if you have the name of the album and the name of the artist...

<Title>Yes, I Made the Upgrade.
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My introduction to the iPod world was through the Mini, which I like, but I secretly envied those who own the 20GB or 40GB.  After a few weeks, I grew to hate being limited to only 1,000 songs on the Mini and wanted an iPod that was able to store more music.  So when Apple launched a new line of iPods, I jumped on the first opportunity to make the upgrade.  I didn't quite need an MP3 player that can store photos, but I recommend the 30GB iPod Photo for its color display screen and its ability to save up to 7,500 songs.  That's enough to store my entire collection of Miles Davis, Bob Marley, AC/DC, John Coltrane, and Roxy Music, with plenty of extra space for hundreds more CDs.  If you purchase music through iTunes, you'll also be able to view the album artwork on the iPod screen (this feature SOMETIMES works for music not purchased on iTunes).  Very cool.  I didn't buy this player for its photo feature, but I was able to transfer a few family photos just to test the picture quality.  The images are fairly clear for an MP3 player, but in no way can they replace a traditional camera.  While I'm happy I got the 30GB, I do have one axe to grind with Apple.  The headphones, while stylish in their white design, are weak and flimsy.  Within a month's worth of use, the right ear started to give out.  Of all the headphones I've used in the last 15 years, Apple's are by far the worst.  Audio snobs will most likely throw these out the nearest window and get something else.  Beyond that, I highly recommend this bad boy.  Those who own the Mini or Shuffle and want to upgrade should skip the 20GB and pay just a few dollars more for the 30GB iPod photo.  One final comment: it is absolutely critical that you get a protective case for your iPod, regardless of which model you purchase.  The display screen scratches VERY easily.  Cases are available on this website, your local Apple store, and at other retailers.  Protect your investment.  Would you like to see a few hundred dollars of your money go down the drain in a matter of days?  I, for one, wouldn't.

<Title>"the gold standard" for spam
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!  The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for "iPod not really free David Lazarus" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.  In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information.

<Title>SIMPLY AMAZING
<Date>Wed Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was thinking of getting this or the Sony Vaio Pocket VGF-AP1L digital music player(I love Sony) but in all, I decided on this. There is no other word to describe it but amazing. It holds a ton of pictures, it shows album art, and you can get a cable extra(which I did) which lets you put the photos you have on the little color screen onto the TV for a slideshow, and you can use music on your iPod for background music. Anyways, I have no complaints, it is great!

<Title>to the obsessive-compulsive: beware
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i agonized for many months before getting one of these.  for one thing, i'm a pc user, so i looked at all of the imitation players from dell, diamond, creative, etc., and even among the ipod's i was torn between the 20G model and this 30G model.    but i really believe this ipod -- compared to all of the imitation players out there and all of the other ipod's -- really hits a sweet spot in terms of physical size, hard disk capacity, features, and price (well, maybe not price :).  compared to the 20G model, the 30G has the following advantages: it's about the same size, has a color screen, holds 10G more for $50 extra, can show the album art (very fun), and has a slightly longer battery life (12 hours compared to approx. 8-10).  if you're still wondering whether you should get an ipod in the first place, here's my number one bit of advice: itunes is an outstanding program and it blows other music-management programs out of the water.  you might not think about the software much when buying a player, but you really should.    consider that you have 100's of cd's you'd like to add to your digital collection.  you need a really well-engineered program that can handle your collection now, and possibly 5-10 years from now.    itunes rocks.  it's the kind of program that understands that your needs will grow over time.  certainly you'll add more music, but what if you hook up your computer to a hi-fi stereo and suddenly it becomes more than just an mp3-generator?  you might want higher quality recordings on there.  or what if a new compressed format comes out a few years from now and blows aac and mp3 out of the water?  suddenly you might want to convert all of your music to the new format.  or maybe you just don't give a damn and just want to easily convert all of your files quickly.  the best way i've discovered to allow your collection to grow over time is to first rip all of your cd's using apple's lossless format.  once this is done, you change the import setting in the preferences to a compressed format (mp3, aac, etc.).  i personally like using mp3 192 (VBR).  then you simply right click on all of the files you generated using apple lossless format, and click 'convert to mp3'.  go have a cup of coffee while itunes converts all of your lossless files to mp3.  so what you end up with is 2 files for each song -- a perfect lossless version AND a compressed version that will go on your ipod.  to ensure that only the mp3's go on the ipod create a playlist out of them and have itunes only sync your ipod with that mp3 playlist.  what's the advantage of all of this?  well, if you decide that mp3's stink and you want to convert your collection to some other format, you simply change the import setting and right click on all of your lossless files again.  no need to import from cd ever again.  yes, it requires more disk space, but that's cheap compared to your time.  but, of course, if you're not as obsessive, you can simply import all of your music using the default settings and be done with it :)

<Title>It's a masterpiece!
<Date>Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my new iPod. It's really cool and especially helps me because I travel a lot and all my music is now in one place. Please note that you will need very specific MAC OS or Windows OS versions to make it work perfectly with iTunes. I have Win XP SP1 version (which is not that old) and iTunes doesn't work correctly all the time. In my third call to Apple, one rep told me to upgrade to XPSP2 (which, by the way, my company doesn't allow because there are lots of issues with it). So, please read the technical requirements for your computer because you will need to latest and greatest versions to make iTunes work.  Other than this, the iPod Photo is a very sleek thing - great sound, great design -- you'll love it the moment you start using it. In my research, no other MP3 came even close to it. Kudos to Apple!  P.S. I also bought Belkin TuneCast to use the iPod in my car and it works very well too! If you buy TuneCast, be sure you buy the version that comes with the car adapter otherwise you will spend a lot of money on AAA batteries.
