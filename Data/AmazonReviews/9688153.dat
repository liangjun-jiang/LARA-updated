<Content>I have the 256 version of the series, the only difference in this mp3 player is the capcity, which is 128, 256, 512 and 1 gig. Each player is a different color. The unit has a nice weight to it, indicating better than average parts. This unit is small and compact...it's about the size of a pager.   It has a built in mic for voice recording and it has both the standard 1/8 headphone port, and a 1/8 line in port. This particular unit has a preamp at about 5 volts...which will power a microphone if plugged into the line in port. You can adjust the record volume as well. A lot of podcasters use this particular series of mp3 players for thier podcasts.  The only down side is that the little meune joy stick is a little touchy and sometimes you have go through a bunch of different menues to get where you need to go. I found that I need a lighter touch when scrolling through. When I first got this unit, it was hard to figure out what button seqeunce to push to get where I needed to go, but with some paitence and through trail and error, I was able to figure it out. The directions where vague.. at least to me. Maybe I'm just dense...lol  The silicone case includes a hook on it so you can attach it to a armband.  All in all, it's a nice little peice of hardware.

<Title>Better functionality than an iPod

<Content>I love this cause I use it as an audio recording device for my home movies, this friggin thing rivals even the official $1000 sony models, I can also monitor the audio from my headphones, It also has a 5v preamp, dont get too happy though, this thing gets a little to get use to.
