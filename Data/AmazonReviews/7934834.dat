<Title>Good player
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Bad News 1. Only 4 Gigs 2. iRiver Plus 3 is a huge pain to put video onto player 3. Screen feels really sensitive 4. Feels like it will slip out of hand 5. Sometimes clicking noise can be annoying 6. Can't listen to music while charging 7. Learning curve for user interface can take a while  Good news ( and plenty of it) 1. Beautiful and huge screen 2. 4 GB is a lot when you don't have a lot of songs. 3. Very small and pocketable/ portable 4. Great battery life 5. Tons of setting options  6. If you look online ( www.clixhere.net), you can find hundreds of themes and tons of flash games to put on your Clix for free. 7. Flash games 8. Videos at good resolution 9. Good sound quality 10. Totally customizable themes (background/font/interface) 11. Pictures look totally gorgeous 12. Comes with free songs/ videos/ flash games/ pictures/ audio books/ preloaded 13. Ever expanding community of active Clix members who love to create free stuff (www. misticaudio.com, www.clixhere.net).  To Protect the Clix, I would suggest a silicon case (mines from misticaudio) and a screen protector. To wipe of fingerprints (of which you will get a lot) a moist tissue (NOT WET) will do. I realize a main competitior of the Clix 2 is the touch screen Cowon- i never tried it, but I don't like the idea of a touch screen- thats just me.

<Title>What other reviews leave out
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received my iRiver clix2 and I thought I should list some important information that other reviews I read, neglected to mention.  First off, I am having a very pleasant experience with the clix2 and if there was a little more direction and support from the documentation or website, I would have been completely happy.   Important list of things to know:  The difference between MTP and MSC- If you do not set your Clix2 to the MSC mode the computer and the coupled software will not recognize the device. By default it is off. You can do this in the 'advanced' menu but make sure you do this before adding any music, you will lose it all in the necessary format. MSC mode is better anyways so do this first.   Wheres the shuffle?- I have only played around with it for a little while, but the only way I could figure out a shuffle mode (my favorite setting on an mp3) was by setting the smart key to "shuffle all"  Looseness of the cover- Yeah apparently it is supposed to be that way, the cover is actually D-navigation buttons, so don't fret about the seeming looseness during the 3-4 hour initial battery charge  Guide recommends that you turn on player then charge- Mine was so dead when I got it, that it would not turn on so this step wasn't possible. In that case just skip step 1 and plug it in, it will auto charge.   Battery- I was scared about the battery so I turned brightness to "low" which is still pretty bright, and went to "timer" to have the back light turn off in 5 seconds to save power.    Yeah there is a guide on the cd but its not very helpful unless you read the whole thing, including all the small print.   Volume buttons are seemingly switched up.   Wheres the podcast directory?- It may be there, I didn't look too hard  Look for the 'auto power-off' and sleep settings-set to your preference ----- Now the easily recognizable positives, based on a day of use.   The interface and menu is very easy to navigate- just click the sides of the device.  The sound- Amazing.   Video- Looks good, though the screen is really small for video watching, plus it drains the battery a lot faster. Beautiful screen and transitional effects with several themes to choose from. All the themes and fonts can be added from an online source (or you can make them)  I don't want this to run too long so I'll end with this.  Barring any unforeseen failures or future problems, this thing is great. It is well worth the 184-200$ it costs at this time though if it had been easier to set up (the info above) I would have had a much better initial reaction. I'll update this review after a while using it.

<Title>THE iPod killer
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>wow. Think of anything you'd want an mp3 to have, and the clix 2 already has it. FM radio, flash games, nice wallpapers/themes, audiobook, voice recorder, supports all languages, pictures, music, and videos. And not only that, some sites can give you customized flash games, wallpapers, themes, and fonts. Also, not wanting to give out all the surprises, some VIP members in rare mp3 sites can get updates for the clix 2 and realllllllly nice games and customizable wallpapers... what more do you want?

<Title>Iriver Clix2 Clix 4gb (U20)...
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought for someone near and dear who's into portable electronics.  She seems to love it - but she 'accidentally' hit the delete key and lost all her music.  Fortunately, she reloaded the music in 10 minutes, the Clix2 seems to be a little 'sensitive' in it's functionality.    I ordered it early in the a.m. on 07/28/07, and received it via UPS on the 07/31/07, beating the delivery estimate by 5 days (thanks Amazon and UPS!).  For the joy it seems to bring - I give it five stars...

<Title>Excellent Screen and Sound
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very impressed with this player. The styling is simple and elegant -- there are no words on the front, not even the silly "menu" word. The screen is fantastic. Sound is great (on Sennheiser headphones -- I have not tried the supplied phones). Vocals are very clear. In classical music I can hear the individual instruments - this level of detail usually requires a good hifi setup. The menu navigation is very simple and easy. On the first day with the Clix I took it running. It passed the test: I could change volume and song track just by reaching into my pocket without looking (but always use the hold button at the bottom if you are running).

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had experiences with Apple iPod Video, Shuffle, and Nano, and my previous Toshiba Gigabeat S30 (which is an absolute iPod killer). The clix2 is overall a SOLID MP3 player and this is my experience thus far:  The sounds quality is great; it contains a vast array of different EQ settings suited for your sound system/headphones.   The menu system is very easy to use with the innovative D-click system. The screen is, as other people have stated, very bright and attractive.   The extra features are fantastic- alarm clock, the fun flash games, text reader, the built-in mic recorder (good for class), the FM tuner, and above all, the ability to completely customize your little clix2. You can change the themes, fonts, the way you browse yours music, and also there is a "Smart Key" on the side of the player where you can program it to do a number of things that best suits you. There are fan based sites that contain slick themes in addition to the nice stock ones.   The ability to synchronize with WMP11 as well good ol' drag and drop is a very convenient feature. It is compatible with my URGE subscription, which happens to be a very good music store (just putting that out there).    Some drawbacks I will point out. (some are reiterated from other people): 4 GB is too small for me, seeing as how my music library is around 13 GB. If you do not like updating your playlists constantly, as I am doing now, then perhaps the Clix2 is not a great idea. But my motivation for buying it regardless of this was that it was a way to make sure my music is fresh (which has been working so far).   The clix2 is smaller than I imagined. This is a small con because it means a lesser experience when watching videos, but it does keep the navigation quick because the D-click system utilizes the entire face place to navigate through menus.    Overall, this MP3 player is very solid. I am only giving it a 4 because of its small storage space. But if this is not an issue for you, then I give my highest recommendations for the Clix 2. This player is an example of one of the great quality products you can find outside the "iPod craze." It will definitely make you stand out when you bust this slick player out.       BTW, one of the reviews mentioned not being able to shuffle songs- this is not true, you just need to read the manual. It's clearly written.

<Title>iriver clix2 - very nice alternative to ipod
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iriver clix2 is a very nicely designed multi-media device. I am not a fan of apple and decided not to get an ipod. The clix2 plays mp3's and movies, and displays pictures. The screen is very clear and bright. The sample movie clips alone will blow you away. The sound is equally good. The usb interface offers two modes: drag and drop or software sync.  The ear phones were a little disappointing. I replaced them with some quality ear buds. Make sure the battery is fully charged before a long trip.

<Title>iriver clix 2nd generation. Absolutely AMAZING!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the iriver Clix 2nd generation is an absolutely amazing device that offers you all the features you would ever need and the most beautiful screen in it's class.  Pros-  -2.2 inch AMOLED screen produces colors clear and crisp. one of the best screens of it's size. 320x240 resolution at 30fps. -Fantastic audio quality (much better than the iPod) -Intuitive D-clix system. Each side of the surface is a button. it is in essence a D-pad with a screen in the middle. -Great battery life (25 hours of music, 5 hours video). -Flashed based memory is solid state (no moving parts) so it will not break as easily as a hard drive based player. -MSC and MTP transfer mode, which makes it compatible with any modern OS like Windows, Mac, and Linux. -Amazingly smooth user interface -Video, Photo, Radio, Voice recording, Flash Games, and many other features. -Easy syncing to any computer -Small and reliable -Dedicated volume buttons  Cons  -Not as solid build as it should be, but still reliable and very useable -Strange location of headphone jack -4 gigs is the standard capacity, and an 8 gig player is hard to find. This is not very much memory, especially if you want to utilize the pretty screen with videos.  -Volume and power buttons feel cheap and are set into the groove between the surface and the rest of the player, making them somewhat uncomfortable to use. At least this keeps them from being accidentally pressed in your pocket. -A little expensive at retail price.  So if you are looking for a beautiful flash memory based media player with lots of features, an intuitive control scheme and user interface, with amazing audio and video quality, and don't mind a slightly expensive price tag, this will not disappoint.

<Title>Holy Crap is Iriver's Service Awful - BEWARE
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved the player when I bought it May.  Two weeks later it failed to power on and Iriver gave me an RMA immediately.  They have confirmed that I will be receiving a new clix2, but there service center is backed up.  Eight Weeks later they still haven't sent me a new one and can't tell me when I will receive one.  I thought the player was pretty cool in May, but the new Nano matches most of the features and you will feel much more comfortable with a warranty from an established US entity.  Buy a Nano!  ps the Flash menus are pretty cool (especially when you can make your own)

<Title>Awesome product...under rated in the U.S. !!! Great Anti-IPOD
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this for about 3 months and I absolutely love it.  The battery last for about 20+ hours. Depending on what you are using, if it is the video, of course it would be shorter.  I got this after it won a lot of different tech awards, and they were right.  It is a great, and realiable product. The video is clear, music can be equalized to fit what your ear likes to hear, and has almost unlimited amounts of functions!!!  It even has a radio (which IPOD's don't have), and amazing radio and external recorder built in. Lets just say that everyone who I have shown it to, DOES WANT ONE,  PERIOD!!!

<Content>Within 4 months of use, the screen went blank.(the screen going out is a common problem)  Sent it in to be repaired.  It took 3 months to get it back.  When we got it back it was DEAD!  I have called customer service so many times but they never return any calls.  They have been useless.  I would not buy this product because any problems will only cost you more $$$$$$ to replace the unit.

<Title>GREAT MP3 Player!
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before you follow the herd, and get an iPod, check out this great player from iRiver! Simply the most vibrant, sharp screen I've seen on ANY MP3 player! It's positively gorgeous! Photos practically pop off of the screen, and videos are sharp and crisp! The D-click navigation system is also a great design... tap one of the four edges of the front surface to navigate... very easy to use, even if you've never glanced at the users manual. This device also comes with recordable FM radio, voice recorder (with voice activation!), flash games, oh, and it even plays your favorite MP3's! Menus are customizable, so you can easily change the background of your menu screen, even adding Flash (moving images) screen as a background, or add your own photos! I compared the size to my mother's ipod nano... it is just a hair thicker, slightly wider, but still remains small enough to put in your shirt pocket, and not realize it's even there. overall, an excellent MP3 player that looks great! (It's face is solid black, with no text, no buttons on the face of the device, no manufacturers markings... very clean look!)  To summarize, this device comes with the following, which (I believe) the iPod lacks: 1. FM Tuner, with 30 presets 2. FM Recorder 3. Voice recorder 4. Flash games 5. Flash Menus (You can find tons of user designed, animated menus which are simply amazing!) 6. 30 FPS video player 7. Ultra-bright, 2.2" AMOLED 8. Built in reader 9. Alarm Clock 10. Ability to purchase music online from sources other then iTunes! Also allows you to use subscription music services!

<Title>A Little Gem of a Media Player!
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Clix 2 almost a week now and I'm even more impressed with it than I hoped I'd be. The AMOLED screen on this thing is simply gorgeous--much better than the typical LCD screen on most players. It's bright, sharp and the colors are stunningly vibrant. It really blows the screen on my 5th gen "iPod with Video" right out of the water.   The feature set is terrific. It'll play MP3, WMA and OGG audio and AVI and WMV video and display JPGs. Video looks really amazing. It sports an FM tuner, which works well, and it's cool that you can record off the radio or its built-in mic. It comes with a few flash games installed. You can even customize the menu backgrounds.   The controls and user interface were pretty easy to master. The only fault with the ergonomics, in my opinion, is that it normally takes two hands to operate the Clix. With practice you can sort of operate it with one hand, but it's awkward.   It's a tad smaller than I imagined, about the same overall as the iPod Nano. The audio quality is as good or better than my iPods. One of the coolest things about it is it can connect as an MSC external storage device, allowing you to simply drag-and-drop your media files into it. In this mode it's platform agnostic, meaning that it'll work on either a PC, Mac or Linux computer. Drag-and-drop is nice because I can simply copy media files onto it from multiple computers, regardless of platform and not be restricted to syncing with one source, like the iPod. It's perfect for a geek like me who has multiple computers running different OS's.  If you prefer, you can also set it up as an MTP player for use with Windows XP or Vista and sync it automatically with iriver's own iTunes-like app or by using Windows Media Player 11. Theoretically, it should be also able to sync in MTP under Linux with Amarok if you have libmtp installed, but so far I haven't been able to get that to work--but that's probably an issue with Linux, not the Clix 2.  One word of caution: before you do anything else, connect it to your computer and copy all of the contents of the Clix to your hard drive as a backup. Why, you ask? Because when you format the player or switch modes between MSC and MTP it erases the entire contents, except for the operating system. All of the included games and background themes disappear and they aren't provided on the CD it comes with. This is an embarassing mistake on iriver's part. So back up your Clix before you use it. Hopefully, iriver will make the default Clix content available on their website soon.  The bottom line is the Clix 2 is one of the most beautifully engineered devices I've ever owned.

<Title>My very first mp3 player!
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i finally picked this player up from amazon.  fast shipping!  received the item the day they said it will arrive.    i didn't want to jump into the nano band wagon like everyone else.  i've been very familiar with iriver products as my friends from asia all love their products.  but still, i did my research and decided to get the clix.  it has everything what im looking for.  design, simplicity, style, features, and awesome sound.  i just love playing around with this thing.  customizing, and changing to different themes, backrounds, and watching videos.  i don't think you can do that with a nano.  the color display is very vibrant, and it jumps at you.  menu system and navigation is very simple.  you can use it on multiplatform with different connection settings and configuration.  the sound is great! especially with a decent pair of in ear headphones.    the only grip i have with this is the D-Click button when not on hold mode, can be pressed mistakenly very easily.  also with the slick black design, finger prints gets on very easily.    For my very first mp3 player, i'm very happy with this purchase.  i'm a now iriver believer, and will consider iriver on the top of my list.

<Title>Nice. A little buggy.
<Date>Sun Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> ----EDIT---- I made this review right when I got it and after updating it. Since then, the software has applies several updates, and all of the 'bugs' have been resolved. Also, music continues to play while using the flash games and other extras now, so my review should reflect five stars. -----------  I am really enjoying the clix2. I'm not a huge .mp3 player fan so I can't offer a comparasin to other products, but it does everything I've wanted it to do, and has FM radio (Which is great, because I have a habbit of running my battery down in my van and killing my presets!).   The Bad. Battery life has been a little lower then advertised, where I work for nine or ten hours listening, then turn it off while I sleep and try to use it for nine or ten hours again the next day. The battery usually dies near the halfway point of that second shift, despite an advertised 20+ hours. Maybe because I mess with it alot, and make the screen light up constantly.  I've had some minor software issues such as being unable to delete songs directly from the player. I get an error that says I can't delete a song in play, but the song I'm trying to remove is not playing, or even on the playlist for what I'm listening to, and the message persists even when nothing is playing at all. Somtimes songs would duplicate when I transferred in bulk despite a displayed check for redundancy, and the songs it came with did not delete from the player even when I deleted them using it's software. Nothing crippling here though, actual play and use is not really affected.  The main reason it lost a star with my review was the flash games feature.  I have liked having devices to play games on in the past for long trips and things, but I tried playing them when I first got my clix, and was disappointed. The press-plate button style on such a small light device is not a good one for game control to begin with so I can't really blame the creators, as this was not priority, but I noticed that music stops playing when you enter a flash game. Even flash games without any sound! Silent games on an .mp3 player... I mean... c'mon now people... really. I'd just assume scratch this one off the feature list really.    The Good. It is, extremely customizable and with lots of smart design features. For example, if I'm listening to a song and move to another playlist and start it with the same song, it will continue to play the song while I navigate menus, leaving the song where it is in play and just change the next song qued up when I start the new playlist. Another example, the entire interface can be set to portrait or landscape orientation, and the press plate automatically adjusts to keep controls intuitive.  It has lots of interesting playlist features. A 'quick list' to add songs to and make a playlist when you really want to hear a certain few songs, as well as a built-in rating system of one to five stars, which you can then use as a playlist to start playing all songs with the same star count.  I am impressed with the screen. I expected the video feature was moot on such a small device, but it's very clear and bright. The surface over the screen is also very easy to clean and does not glare. I can even read subtitles on anime without any extra focus or concentration, the letters do not blur and are very crisp. Again, video play is very customizable, able to set things like if the video resumes play where it left off or starts over when you leave it and return. Even scan speed has many rate settings.  I want to emphasize, that all my gripes with this player are nitpicky and have to do with extras or side features, so despite how I elaborate on some of them, it is, as an .MP3 player, FM radio, and portable video player, awesome.

<Title>Amazing little thing!
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had this thing for a few days, but I'm completely blown away by it. First, the OLED screen looks great. I thought it would be too small to watch for long periods, but it worked fine for me. I had the clix2 on a 9 hour flight, and watched about 5 hours of video. Didn't feel any worse than trying to see the video screen 20 rows ahead of me, and I'd much rather watch what I want. After the flight, I still had 2/3 of the batter life left according to the icon on the screen.  The clix2 is so small and light that it's no bother at all to carry with you.  I do wish that it came with some sort of screen protector. Being plastic, I expect it'll eventually get a bit scratched up.   I had no trouble navigating my way around the device. As far as transferring songs and video to it, it defaults to "MSC" mode which means it shows up as a storage device when you connect it to your computer. In this mode, no special software is necessary - you can drag and drop mp3 files right into it's Music directory. You can do the same with Video, but the videos won't play unless they're compressed properly (framerate, size, etc) for the device. You can use the included iriver3 software to do those conversions for you. You can also use the software to transfer your songs and videos around, but again you don't have to. Windows Media Player 10 and 11 (11 is included on the software disk) will also do this, apparently.   I ended up having to switch it to "MTP" mode (this mode switching is done via the interface on the device, and is trivial). In this mode, you can't drag and drop things onto the device anymore, you must use transport software. Again, either the included application or Windows Media Player will work. I had to switch it to MTP mode so that AudibleManager would allow me to copy an audiobook I purchased onto the device. I couldn't get it to work in MSC mode, but thankfully it had no problem in MTP mode. (Just dropping the .aa file onto the device didn't work in MSC mode).  To summarize: I like this thing more than my iPod and my Zen Vision:M. I love that I can charge it via my USB port. I love that I can transfer songs and videos to/from it without the usual copy protection issues that screw everything up. I love how convenient it is to use, and to carry.  And remember: Audible audiobooks require it to be in MTP mode. Otherwise you get some silly message about having to upgrade your device's firmware.

<Title>Forget about Support from iRiver
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since most other reviews have focused on the good things about this player I will just be quick on that.   The Good: - UI is simple and much cleaner than other players - the player is the perfect size - small but not too tiny (it's about the size of a Nano) - the screen and display are absolutely gorgeous. You won't find a better picture.  The bad: - After 1 sync, the player crapped out and wouldn't work when attached to a computer - Fingerprints are unavoidable on the player - The earphones that come with it are horrible. This wasn't a big deal to me but if you are expecting some decent ones with your player.. you won't find it here.  The ridiculously bad: - The technical/customer support from iRiver America sucks!!! They have a total of 2 reps in the office and it is nearly impossible to get through to someone. You will wait on a phone cue for 30 minutes and then be sent to an answering machine. Don't bother leaving a message there either because they won't call you back. When I finally did get through and they determined my product was defective, they told me that I would have to pay for it to be sent out and that I wouldn't even get a new player in exchange. This was after only having it for 6 hours and paying expedited shipping to get it. Then I was told they would call me back to make arrangements but that never happened. I am still dealing with the issue but thought I should give everyone fair warning about the level of service you should expect.   If I get a player that works and never have to call iRiver again, I'm sure this will be a sweet player.

<Title>Amazing OLED screen
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I reviewed the Clix 2 on my site and gave it a rating of "higly recommended".  Probably one of the best media players we've ever reviewed.  First off, the OLED screen provides crips and clear output.  You can pretty much view it from any angle.  Also, when displaying videos, it produces no ghosting at all.  It is the same size as the one available on the Video iPod but it really puts the iPod's screen to shame.  The navigation is very intuitive thanks to the patented D-Click interface.  Since the form factor of the Clix 2 is smaller than the original, the clicking feels even better.  The video playback at 30fps is INCREDIBLE.  I never thought I'd enjoy watching DVD movies on a screen this small.  I was wrong.  I ripped some DVDs and watched them on the Clix 2 and it was a joy.  I have only two complaints about the Clix 2.  It definitely needs a bigger storage.  I'd say 16GB should be decent.  Lastly, the alarm feature is useless because it has no speakers.  You only receive visual cue.  For a full review on the product, check it out on my site.

<Title>Unbelievable

<Content>I won't bore you with the details.  Yes it does all the things that other people have written, and I am thoroughly enjoying mine.  2 things that might influence your decision.  The first is the battery is sealed and not intended to be changed by the user, the second is, the only way to charge the battery is by plugging it in to your usb on the computer.  The only other thing worth mentioning is, I wish people would get busy creating more themes/wallpaper for this (not that I don't like the factory ones).

<Title>Bang For Your Buck
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wonderful mp3 player. Easy to use, fun, and sleek. Great screen and image quality and the buttons and menus are easy to use. The USB cable is the same size as my camera's so it's nice to have a backup. Battery life is decent, you could go all day, but don't forget to turn it off when you're not using it. Space is similar to that of an ipod nano but for less money, and the size is very very close. I have about 600 songs and a few pictures on mine right now and it's about 2/3 full. Radio works well. Really easy to sync songs using WMP11. I still use itunes to listen to music on my computer but the transfer process to WMP is quick and painless. Like others have said, you will get your fingerprints on the iRiver Clix, but it doesn't bother me at all. I did have trouble syncing it up a 2nd time until I hit the reset button, but that didn't change my settings or erase my memory and I haven't had any problems since then. Definitely a great little player.

<Title>Excellent player with a few drawbacks
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little flash player ... I love it!  The player is very small and light.  The interface is slick and very responsive.  Battery life is great.  SRS WOW EQ greatly enhances the sound on external speakers and my Etymotic ER-4P reference-quality earphones.  Many more (useable) features than any flash-based player I have owned.  My only issues are 1) no FLAC support 2) no gapless output, and 3) MTP/WMP10+ required for firmware upgrades
