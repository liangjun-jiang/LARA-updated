<Title>Descent Player, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have purchased several Coby products the last couple of years and have no issues with any of them.  I bought a Coby MP-C781 in November and it died last week.  I emailed tech support and got a caned response 4 DAYS LATER.  The email said to reload the firmware and gave a link to the site. NO FIRMWARE ON THE SITE. So I called support. Took 3 number to find one that worked.  They told me there was no firmware for the unit and I would have to mail it back to them with a $6 money order. They had no answer when I asked why the email said to reload firmware even though there is no firmware on the website.   I had a similar problem with a Sandisk unit and they only required me to send the unit back and did not give me any hassle and they were very responsive on their customer support emails.  I WILL NEVER BUY another Coby product again because of their BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT.

<Title>Worked well for about 4 months
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter was so happy to get this for her birthday!  It worked well and we downloaded numerous songs for her.  She used it a few times every week and carried it with her to keep her from getting bored in the car when I wanted to listen to my music.  The last time she used it she put it in her jacket pocket & zipped it up.  We really aren't sure why the LCD screen looked like we dropped it in water because it stayed dry.  It just stopped working. That's too bad, because it seemed like a nice product.  Should've lasted longer than 4 months!

<Title>Not impressed
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this at a day after Thanksgiving sale for Christmas.  The speakers never worked but I bought a cheap pair from Walmart and didn't worry about returning them.  The MP3 worked ok for about 2 months then just died.  Nothing would work.  I bought it from Home Depot who would not allow a return because it had been 3 months since the purchase date.  Coby would also not honor a warranty.  Although it was only 2 months from the date it was opened as a Christmas present, it was past the 3 month deadline.  My feeling is that when you pay $80 for an item, it should last more than 2 months.  I will NEVER buy a Coby product or from Home Depot again.

<Content>I would never buy this product.  Every time I go to use it I have to put in a new AAA battery.  I have spent as much money on batteries as I did on the player itself.  I have since purchased a different MP3 player!!

<Title>A Disappointment
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for my daughter for Christmas and I was so delighted to find a player with expandable memory.  It seemed like an answered prayer as she continually outgrows the capacity of previous players.  However, from the beginning we noticed that the player ate up batteries like nothing.  Even digital batteries weren't much better.  Now, 4 months later and the player will not stay powered up and I'm finding more and more bad reviews with the same complaints. That expandable space is of no use to us now!

<Title>What a piece of junk.
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would advise anyone looking to buy an MP3 player not to buy this one. I had one for just about a week before it started acting strange; it would randomly turn itself off and eventually I had to pop the battery out and put it back in to get the stupid thing to turn on. This things sucks up batteries at an unbelievable rate too. It uses 1 AAA battery and I would have to replace the (Duracell) battery EVERY OTHER DAY.   DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!

<Title>Great price, no frills: a nice compact player
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Other than not having a color display, this player has absolutely everything in a perfect tiny square player.  I bought it during a one day sale and for 1 GB with an expansion slot I felt like I was getting away with something because the list price was even great without the sale.  I bought this for my boyfriend to use in his car with an FM transmitter, and the battery life is long enough to leave it in the car for a couple weeks at a time between charging.  It is a great deal for anyone who wants space and quality without a big price tag, and who doesn't care if the player doesn't come in every color of the rainbow, etc.  No frills, just a great player. :)

<Content>For its cost, the player delivers great sound, great performance, it's easy to load up songs, radio and voice recording feature are definitely a plus...and for those who complain about the battery consumption...buy a pair of rechargeables for $10 at radio shack and you're done!...unbeatable price, great device!

<Content>Purchased for my 8 year old son.  The price was good and it works great.  Easy for him to use.  He doesn't like the earbuds that came with it, but other than that it's perfect for him.

<Content>The Coby MP3 met all my expectations. I ended up giving it as a gift because my friend needed something easy to use while working out. I plan to replace it with the same item.

<Title>A worthy little instrument!
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to protect my expensive wave/mp3 recorder - at 10% of the cost, this is better than insurance.  I also wanted the memory feature - to have it boot up to the same location as when I turned it off, so I could use it with recorded books, which this does admirably.  Unfortunately, this function only works with the on-board memory, not the extended memory in my SD card.  Also, this is necessary even for music, because the unit will shut down after a short time on pause - certainly less than the period of a phone call.  I have the 512 MB on-board version, and was jealous when my fiddle student showed up with the 1 GB upgrade.  The recording quality really surprised me, as for me this was only meant to play back what I recorded on my Edirol.  Edirol is still better, but this isn't as bad as the last cassette recorder I owned! Other reviewers complain about reliability, so maybe I'm lucky.  I was convinced to purchase (despite the whiners) by a photo series by one owner who had fixed a few basic problems by himself, and decided that if necessary, I could do the same.  There is one tune out of the nearly 512 MB I have recorded that consistently causes a unit failure, requiring me to remove the battery momentarily to reset.  Otherwise, I have no problems with it, and can't believe it only cost $40.  Removing the battery is a pain, so I place a small bit of ribbon behind the battery before installation, and that works great for pulling it out.  There is very little room for this, however, so if you're going to try this, think minimal! I use it almost daily at work, with Sennheiser PCX250 noise-cancelling headphones.  The headphone's electronics unit does seem to interfere with the radio reception, but then I'm in a large steel-frame building, and radio reception could be compromised anyway.  If I lay them out on the desk at maximal separation, there's little interference, but for walking around I'd need different headphones.  I keep a few rechargeable batteries on hand, and replace as needed - again, I don't expect the battery to last forever, so I'm not as irritated as other reviewers - I do like the fact that it uses commercially available batteries and not proprietary ones like the ipod. The main improvement I'd like to see to this unit is the ability to play wav files - converting these to mp3 or wma is not hard, but the extra step gets to be a chore.  Otherwise, I love this little unit and heartily recommend it.

<Title>Coby 2
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought another Coby MP3 for my older son, however wanted a 1 MG since he was younger. This was a poor quality MP3. The lighting/graphics/words are poor. I tried for hours on Christmas to download 4 songs, all the same format. Two downloaded, the other 2 kept giving me an error message. The quality of the player itself seemed plastic-like. I thought I couldn't go wrong buying a Coby, but I guess I should have read more reviews. You get what you pay for.....
