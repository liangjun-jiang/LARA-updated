<Title>The most complacent and unprofessional company encountered
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1 star only as giving 0 is not possible.   I brought this machine in Thailand but crashed after minimal use. I contacted Customer Services via the web who suggested some procedures to reboot and re-download the software. This failed. I had voiced concerns regarding the warranty being close to expiry but was assured, in writing, that the warranty would be honoured as the fault was reported prior to the warranty cover finishing. I then needed to take the machine to a service centre in Bangkok (a lot of travel expense involved) where it has been for the past 10 months!   This time has been spent being passed from one representative to next all of which just ask for he same information over and over and then do nothing. Then I am promised, as I was in August, that my case had been escalated and they would contact me, I am still waiting... I contacted them again recently at the Singapore main office only to be greeted with the same arrogant, complacent and totally unprofessional service. I am still waiting to have this resolved...Anyone at Creative reading this who cares to assist? Perhaps this kind of 3rd rate customer service is something exclusive to Southeast Asia. As it is demonstrates clearly why, with a superior product than the i-pod, Creative fail to command any kind of significant market share.   DO NOT BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS!

<Title>Works well with Audio Books
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are an audio book listener, this player will do nicely.  I am a first time MP3 buyer and tried to do extensive research on the best player for audio books.  There is not much written, so I decided to get my feet wet with the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g.  For the most part, it was a good decision.  Volume is excellent (although it takes a while to get used to accessing it) and this can be gotten around by attaching a wired remote.  There is bookmarking, which allows you to hold the place on several books if you want to listen to music or look at photos.  And, the unit holds your place when you turn it off.  I have downloaded audio books from the library and transferred them from my collection - the unit handles it all.  It took a while to figure out how to and where to transfer the books, and understand the genres.  So far, the unit has resisted my creating a new folder, which just holds audio books - I must put everything into the music library.  For genres, I cannot create a new genre and call it "book" - I must use "speech", "science fiction", etc. and it will be mixed in with all of the music genres.  So, searching for books becomes tedious if a lot of music has been transferred to the unit.  Much has been written about the "intuitive menus" on the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g.  I am 50+ and know my way around computers.  This MP3 Player has multiple levels of menus and I would not call them "intuitive".  There is a snooze timer mode (a great feature if you want to listen to a book at night and fall asleep), which is buried deep in the "Player" settings.  I have started to reconfigure the menu settings to what I use most, but it is going to take a long time before I get the knack of getting to a menu and finding what I want.  Also, which software on my computer to use for downloading and configuring.      The on/off switch - actually a slide -- for the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g is not easy to use.  It is on top of the unit, next to the headphone plug.  As an adult, just using my finger pads will not create enough friction to move it; I have to use my nails a lot.  And just as the on/off slide resists sliding, the touch pad controls are exactly the opposite.  The default setting is "medium", and the sensitivity of the controls seems off the charts.  Any neophyte to MP3 players should turn the sensitivity to "slow" and learn about sliding the power switch to "lock" in order to disable the player's controls.  Again, the wired remote control is a wonderful accessory in controlling the most used functions.      The battery for the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g is charged thru the USB Port on your computer.  Not only does it take a long time to charge (up to 5 hours), but also the unit is unusable during the charge.  I guarantee that you will become dissatisfied with this quickly and will order an AC and/or Car Charger.  I have ordered another battery, but it can only be charged in the unit (annoying).  Very little is out there in the way of accessories for the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g.  It comes with a drawstring pouch - I guess we are meant to carry it around in a pocket.    The Creative Zen Micro Photo 8g is packed with features.  Besides audio books and music, I have only used the photos feature and am very disappointed - and what should I expect on the tiny screen?  Use your photos as wallpaper to personalize your player and forget the rest.  This MP3 Player will deliver on audio book and music playing.

<Title>Creative Zen Micro Photo 8GB
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought this Creative Zen Micro Photo 8GB a week ago and my observations are as follows:  1) The unit is much smaller than I expected. I thought it was the size of an iPod, but it is only about 2" x 3". 2) The sound clarity and volume is very good. I use this while riding a motorcycle and I need to be able to hear over the traffic noise, which is not a problem. I can listen at a comfortable level that also drowns out wind noise. 3) The slideshow is nice, but I haven't figured out how, if possible, to watch the slideshow while listening to the MP3 player as well.  4) The colors are very sharp, but unfortunately for such a small unit, the display is also tiny. 5) The controls are not very good. Although there are three sensitivity settings, it is very easy to scroll past your selection and accidentally click on an option you didn't want. 6) The controls are very intuitive. You don't really need to read the owner's manual to figure out how to use it. 7) I only paid $60 for this, so in spite of the few drawbacks, I definitely got my money's worth.   Bottom line: This is a very good unit, especially for the price. I just recently paid $60 just to replace a battery in my kid's iPod! This is the second Creative product I have owned and so far, I'm happy with it. I had my first Zen for over two years and I have never had a problem with it, unlike my experience with several different iPods, which breaks down every six months or so.
