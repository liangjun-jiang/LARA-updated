<Title>Bad mp3 player Ideas
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only way to power this mp3 is to plug it into a computer. If your battery is low, you must get your computer NOT another battery, or battery charger to fully charge the Network Walkman. The cost of running a computer for power of a Walkman is Madness. It's cheaper to buy a lot of new batteries or a battery charger. It just so happens that the power company and the vga monitor, etc... does not support the Bean. The sliding cover is difficult to control, since it acts as part of the charging, playback and hold options. The Bean design is to hold in your hand palm between fingers. If you put it in your pocket, there goes that sliding cover. So one should walk around holding the bean in their hand. When I charged the bean and left it unused for a couple weeks, it discharged fully and I needed my vga monitor, Intel processor chip, the mother board, USB port, power supply etc...computer again. It also has a very unfriendly user interface. No neck strap (except China model)

<Title>Love it
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this as a gift just yesterday and fell in love with it. I had been searching for the right Mp3 player for months when I happened upon a walkman bean ad in a fashion magazine I was reading. Its look was unique, it stood out from the others I had looked at. Although pink is not my favorite color, (I would have preferred blue had it come in the one-gigabyte format) this pink is irredescent and pleasently between shouting hot pink and icky baby pink, and I have to say, I don't mind carrying around (and flaunting) my pink bean. Anyhow, onto more important specs. I was a teeny bit worried when I read all those "reviews" about the bean having hissy audio, but, after using mine non-stop for the past day, I can say that is not an actual issue. The only time my music is hissy is when it's supposed to be (Shiina Ringo). Another rumor being that it is made unusable by a two-foot drop is also false. Accidentally, of course, my bean fell out of my pocket (a good three feet from the ground), made hard contact with the floor, yet, with my headphones still on my head and attached to the bean, I could hear there was no halt in the music, nor degradation of performance. All the buttons still functioned. And I let out a sigh of relief. The screen is high-contrast and easily read from two feet away. My bean also has two "screensavers", quite a surprise to me, as they were never mentioned in any reveiw or by sony themselves. Yet it is one of my favorite things about the bean. The first screen has strawberries, cherries, bananas, grapes, apples AND oranges skimming across the screen. That one always puts a smile on my face. The one that really made my day though, was the sky screen. When you set the time on your bean, as the day progresses, you get a different screen. In the morning, you get a little sunshine with fat little birds flying past. At midday, the sun is shining with clouds and jet planes flying past. During the evening, the sun sets, with thin, foggy clouds floating past and seagulls flapping into said sunset. Once it hits 7 p.m., or 19:00 (depending on you preference), The crescent moon comes out and stars sparkle behind it as little clouds whiz by. The last screen is the time-and-date display, which are shown inside bubbles. The bean can repeat and shuffle, which I have mine set on all the time. However, now for the sad points. It is   advertised as being able to hold 695 songs. Mine has 194 with enough room left over for four more songs, but that's on high-quality. I'm sure it can hold more if you're NOT an audiophile such as myself. Also, as I have read in other reveiws, the hold button is a pain. That's because it is not a button of its own, rather, it is the difference between closing the usb-port's cover most of the way and all the way. Not a major problem, but it can drive you buggy until you're used to it. Now, the only terrible problems I had in this experience were not about the bean itself, but what came with it (the earbuds included with my bean were lop-sided, the 5 free music downloads included had an illegible redemption code), and I have to say, I wouldn't trade it for anything! I love it more than the hi-fi cd player that it's replacing (believe it or not)! The SonicStage software needed to use the bean is an easy setup, not the best, but better than others I've sampled. Overall, I find this to be a great Mp3 player and reccommend it to anyone, who, like me, would rather not buy an iPod. This is the first, and probably the only Mp3 player that I will own or even want to own. I sleep with it under my pillow. If it wasn't so small, I'd give it a hug.

<Title>The Best mp3 player(it really ROCKS)
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well i m a big fan of sony and sony has proved it is the best my making such a stylish and flexible mp3 player bean.its very lovely.and sony music format atrac3plus provides good sound quality and smooth music than mp3.i have encoded my songs to 64kbps and even 48kbps  u can feel a bit difference at 48kbps just slight but at 64kbps u cant differenciate the sound difference and mine has hold 305 songs at 64kbps hm still i have many space for my songs hm most probably 200 songs i can load but i dont have time to.well still i have 300mb plus free space and also it can hold data files also.hm sony has never compramised on the soundquality it is heavy in bass and also good in treble.The feautre why i ask for it is that its battery is unbeatable as compare to others.u will get tired but it wont.just intially charge it for 2 hrs or less untill full then all the time it will charge in 3 mins.which is quiet amazing if u use supersave mode then u r battery will last for ever.hm onc thing that i wish it should have that sound equlizer should be in fm too.well it is flash memory based and is quiet fast and easy to acess then others.it has a display orientation to handle it in right or left hand.well the sound quality amazing battery stamina unbelievable unstopped music hole day.and sonicstage software is very easy just searching of tracks in the software is bit difficult and conversion takses a little time.but u can put more music in it.u can put 35hrs of music in it at 64kbps and 45hrs on 48kbps.hm it is unbelievable so the choice is yours.well i dont compromise on soundquality and it is very difficult to find the difference between the 128kbps mp3 and atrac3 plus at 64kbps i would say that sony digital format is very compatible even u can play ur atrac3plus music files with windows media player.what else u want go and get one for u r self and usb is also not frimsy neither it is breakable mine i have to hang it with my usb and it stays.hanging its made in malaysia i love it in pink.best mp3 player ever.one more feautere which i forget to write is AVLS system which is sony best system which prevents u from hearing damage to u r hears by limitting the max volume.sony is simply the best no one like sony bean is awesome bcoz its made by sony in short bean is pack with the power of sony multimedia in a very elegant and fashionable style.well a thing which i meantion to tell is that its shuffle really moves u by playing the tracks which u have ever wanted to listen automatically it really rocks.well the sonicstage is no problem its quiet easy but u should have a sound knowledge u should read manual.hm still if u cant figure out then u can live chat with sony customer support without the need of call hm they are there to help u wich they helped me alot.hm nice customer support.

<Title>SKIP IT
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This Bean should not be allowed to carry the legendary Sony Walkman title. This thing is awful! The proprietary software wont allow you to play the MP3 files on another computer, you can upload MP3s without using the software to transfer files, but the Bean wont let you play them. Also whoever signed off on the design should have their head checked, I dont mean the bean shape, I'm talking about the clasp/mode-selector/flappy thingy...its flimsy and breaks easily. When it gets bent outta place through normal use, it is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to try to find the files, folders and to even switch it off! Forget it and save your beans for something else.

<Title>Disappointed about the OLED screen  
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Sony Bean 3 months ago, I thought that it was a very good MP3 Player, but now I can see that the screen of the Sony Company are soooooooo bad, I bought this MP3 player because it had 50 hours of playback, 1 GB, it had FM tunner, It was small and I liked the shape of it, also because I read many good reviews about this Sony Bean, but now the sceen looks very misty and the brightness of the scrren is very low. So if you are going to buy this Sony Bean or onother product Sony MP3 Player you will know this information, if it happens to me, it can happen to you or onother person........

<Title>Everything I expected & then some :)
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After much contemplation and reading both horrible and raving reviews on this player, I decided to take the risk and buy one.  I just couldn't resist the tiny size (fits in the palm of my hand), bean shape and with me being so girly, the pink color of course;)  After using an old Intel Personal Audio Player 3000 for the last 4 yrs that only held 50 mp3 songs (that was with a 128 memory stick added!) anything was going to be a definate upgrade!  All I have to say is this: If you can read an instruction manual, and are even half way computer savvy with installing some software (very easy to use - no installation errors either!) and following prompts, you will have no trouble with this player!  I have no idea why all these people are tearing it to shreds saying it sucks and is hard to use.  With most electronics I've ever bought, you normally do sit down with the instruction manual to figure out how to use all the functions!  When I got my last cell phone I spent at least an hour playing with it to figure everything out, and basically that's the same thing you will do with this.  Like a gal said a couple comments below mine, the slider cover is not a big deal, it's not "loose and wobbly", if you happen to flick it in the hold position, flick it back!  The entire hour I fiddled with it, it never slipped into that position anways!  As for the hissing complaint, I hear none!  The only way you would, would be if your mp3 track was ripped and recorded onto your computer/downloaded off the internet with a hiss in it - it's all about the quality of the tracks you are putting on it! Or if you are listening to the radio and certain commercials have a hiss - which a lot do as well (when songs came on it sounded perfect).  Otherwise it was dead silent switching between tracks.  It has awesome sound, however I knew I wouldn't like the ear phones that came with it, as they were the hard plastic earbuds.  I opted to buy the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia headphones instead.  They even come in a silverish pink color and match the player!  Plus they have super nice silicone covered buds in different sizes that fit snug and feel wonderful like they aren't even in your ears!  You can also purchase the Sony Bean CSE31ARM armband so you don't have to carry it around and worry about dropping it!  And one last thing - the screen savers are my favorite part...the floating fruits, sky, water are so dang cute:)  Ok, if you are a guy you obviously won't care;)  But for a girl this is the ultimate girly mp3 player!  I'd take this over an Ipod anyday, since they are bigger (even the minis) and because everyone has one!  I like to be unique and haven't seen anyone carrying around one of these yet.  I give this player and the fontopia ear phones an A++++++++++   Go buy one now! :)

<Title>Should've saved for an iPod mini :(
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was very excited about ordering this mp3 player (even if it was refurbished).  I was disappointed, maybe because of my anticipation?  The downloading software didn't work for me on the first day, and it chooses to act up at random times.  I didn't see why I couldn't just drag-and-drop mp3 files from folder to folder like I was so accustomed to.  True, it does have a 695-song capacity, but if I had had the chance to do it again, I would've saved for an iPod mini--which is alot sleeker and less little-girl-play-toy looking.  This is a nice mp3 player, though, and a nice one to have if you're not willing to spend alot of money (I got my refurbished one for $80).  A nice little trinket for pre-teens, but not sophisticated enough for "older young adults."  Also, it makes this annoying beeping sound (I don't know if I'm doing it wrong?) whenever I try to skip or play back a song.  Is that normal?

<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The size of the player fits perfectly in my hand and the pink color is cute too. The menu button is easy to use except the hold feature is little bit annoying. I am still trying to figure out how to use the SonicStage software. But for anyone who wants to listen MP3 format music, it is better to download the MP3 file manager software from Sony website. You can use the drag and drop feature once you download the software to your player. But I am only able to drag music files from my MP3 music CD which I don't know why. Overall the player works great once you figure out how to load music to it.

<Title>not usable due to SonicStage
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1.  (if you don't believe SonicStage is B A D then google it up or look at the other Sony player reviews since they all use the same SonicStage)

<Content>The Sony Bean is junk; the access door is weak and breaks easily. Mine broke after using for 2 months, the warranty is 3 months but since this was a Christmas present, the warranty had expired. Sony offered to do a exchange for the unit at a price that exceed the purchase price by $30. I would never purchase a Sony Bean again. Additionally I am very disappointed is Sony's proposed resolution to the issue.  I now have an Ipod - it works great

<Title>Not a long term mp3
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 in 2005 when it first came out because I thought it was cute... and it sure is cute but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It does have amazing battery life. I remember being able to charge it for five minutes and it would last for hours. The built in USB plug is handy but the issue I had with it was that the cover that hides the USB is very flimsy. In fact, this was the first thing that broke. I had this MP3 for less than a year when the cover was on the verge of falling off and the main button that is used to control the volume and tracks was jammed. If I attempted to raise the volume, it would switch to another song. Soon after that I was unable to turn it off because of the jamming button and I was unable to keep it charged for long.   This is a great MP3 only if you take special care of it and this is very hard to do since it very easily gets damaged (mine was damaged because I used to carry it in my bag all the time).  I loved the sony bean, but it just is not practical.

<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I Love this thing! Had it for over a year now. It pretty much did what I needed it for. Totally portable fits in my hand. Shaped as a cute bean. The size of the mp3 player was rather convenient for me. I just stuff it in my pocket and there it stays. I also like the built in USB. College student, so whenever I am running low on batteries I could always recharge it at a computer. Super fast charge as well, 3 minute charge gave me about 3 hours of music play. Fully charged it lasted for days. I listen to this thing everyday usually in 2 weeks I need to recharge it again. I also like the ear buds that came with it. Asymmetrical cord allowed me to have the ear buds around my neck instead of putting them away all the time. Pretty nice I recommend this to people that are on the go and want something super light.  Holds a nice amount of music.    Downside is the program that comes with it. Converts all the mp3s to an Ogg file. Its a bit annoying. I use this program only to transfer songs onto the mp3 player other then that I don't use it.

<Title>Better than my daughters Ipod
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>*I just want to edit my review here real quick. A little update. My daughters IPOD died a couple of weeks ago. After all the trouble we had over the past year, now it is done for good. I reset it (Yet again), and then the next day it completely crapped out. We took it back to the store (still under warranty), and they had to replace it.... Wouldn't trade my Sony "Bean" for anything...  Now back to my original review...*   My g/'s daughter has an Ipod nano. My friend at work has an Ipod nano. I do all the music for them. The Ipod is ok, and all, but this has been far better in my opinion. I got this as a gift 2 years ago. The Battery life is stll awesome.   I am not sure how so many people are having trouble keeping theirs together. The USB cover is not that flimsy. Just don't beat it up, and it will last plenty long enough.   I have never had a problem with a song being corupt. My G/f daughters Ipod is constantly found to be corrupt, and I have to reset it back to factory conditions, and reload the music... She is having that problem again, but is at her dad's house. This is the 3rd time since last Christmas...  The ear buds suck, but so do about every pair I have ever tried... Sound great, but are very uncomfortable. My g/f's bean has 500 songs on it. I use a higher quality file, so mine will probably hold 350, but I don't even have that many songs I want on it right now...  Take care of it like you should anything like this, and it will last a LONG time...  Plus the FM radio function is great. Try that on an Ipod without paying the extra 45-50 bucks for the FM radio add on...  Oh,  and 2 years later, my controls still work like brand new... Treat it right and it is a far better but than Ipod...

<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a Sony bean for about 18 months until I dropped it and broke the volume/song selector toggle.  Actually, that was the fourth or fifth time that I had dropped it, but the only time that did any damage.  I really wish that this device was still available, as it seems that Sony discontinued it.  Mine didn't have a ton of memory, but it was unbelievably easy to use.    I loved how easy it was to switch between songs, playlists, and repeat styles on the go, no need to even take it out of my pocket.  I have not found a single other mp3 player that lets me use it on the go without pulling it out and looking through things.  I hate the design of iPods and the newer Sony players are nowhere near as easy to use on the go.

<Title>Sony Bean Sucks
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Buying this product was a huge mistake.  I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect.  It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.   The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect.  All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect.  It makes adding music to the player because of share rights.  Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless.  Customer service is terrible.  That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole.  I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I HATE YOU SONY!

<Content>I was not happy with the MP3 player when I recieved it because the slider was broken. I had to send it back for a new one. The second one that I recieved was in excellent condition when I recieved it. My next step...download songs. However, I then realized that you have to use SonicStage 4.0 to move songs from the internet or personal computer onto the player. I was not able to install this program on our main computer and when I called Sony they were no help! I then put the installation disk into an older computer at our house and it worked. Needless to say it is a hassle to have to go through all this work. Finally I got a few songs onto the player, but then I had trouble getting the USB to pop out when I moved the slider. I think that Sony needs to make the player more friendly with other computer programs and work on the slider!

<Title>Great mp3 Player , bad software.
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no problem with the sony bean(walkman)unit itself. I put it on shuffle for a 12 hour shift at work and it plays beautifuly. When I tire of the mp3s, I switch over and listen to fm radio. I can go several days before I have to charge it and it charges directly from a built-in USB plug, so I can even charge it on any USB plug that has power. I have downloaded mp3s from several locations, and while the software(sonicstage) will give me a warning about the mp3s being from another computer andnot being able to work, I have never had a problem with them working.    The Sonic stage software is easy to use as long as you don't try to upgrade it. I used the disc straight from the box and it wanted me to upgrade to a new version almost immediatly. I made several attempts and gave up when I noticed all it would accomplish is making it "easier to burn cd's" I use a dedicated burn program that is more compatible... BUT HERE is the cincher.  When I decided to cut off the Sonic stage from having access to the internet every thing seemed fine, but every time I would restart Sonicstage a program from sony called SsAAP.exe would trip all of my spyware software...I looked at this software and it was refered to as a hard disc analyzer. i took it off the start menu but it continued to show back up every time i started Sonic stage. so I would check msconfig... and lo and behold Ssaap.exe was back on my start menu. I finally just removed Ssaap.exe from the program file and have not had any problems since.  So.. While I don't have aproblem with My walkman whatsoever... I do have a Problem with sony putting hi-jack software to moniter my hard drive.. buyer beware. great hardware but you need to adjust the software.  And I still can't download my 5 free songs from Sony's "CONNECT" music service so I don't even bother there are enough other sources for MP3s. that work fine on my player and don't automatically cost 99 cent for every song. I'm sorry! I'm not paying 100 dollars to download a muti disc album when I can buy the actual CD on Amazon for 30 bucks.

<Title>Great little Bean
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my bean.  I was going to get an ipod,but I could no longer find the mini's and I don't want one that could play videos.  That is what a TV is for.   I needed something to take to the beach and work out with. This is perfect.  I have had no problems with the software at all.   It is easy to use and very user friendly.       I have yet to read all the directions for it yet. I can do the basics, download music, use the software and most importantly listen to the music I download.   This is a great little bean for anyone who just wants to listen to music.   I haven't even used 1/2 the memory space yet.  I am thinking about buying these as gifts for a few of my family members for christmas.      I do recomend buying an armband for it, though.  I am in the process of buying one today.  It is to hard to hold while working out.    I highly recomend this little bean.   It is perfect.  Being a girl, I love the sparkly pink color.  It is perfect for the no longer 20 something woman (32 to be exact) who wants to listen to her music without spending a fortune.   Wouldn't trade my bean for an ipod.

<Title>I am veeerrryyy disappointed. =(
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok everybody, this product was not a good buy for me at all !  I strongly encourage you not to buy it because it is very poor quality.  Problem # 1 - My uncle gave me a CD with all of the songs that I wanted to put on my Bean. This CD was from the free section on Music Match. We figured it was easier this way because we wouldn`t have to purchase the songs from Sony Connect. The transfer was succesful, but then after about 1-2 months of listening to them, they stopped playing. When I tried to play the songs, the Bean would display a sign saying, "CANNOT PLAY." All of the songs that I had gotten from my uncle would not work. Only the sample songs would play.   Problem # 2 - After Problem # 1 had occured, my father called Sony and they said that the bit rate was too low. This was fine with us because it meant that we would just have to get all of my songs from Sony Connect. After we called, my Bean worked only because I had downloaded one of my albums onto it. But still, the buttons wouldn`t work and it would also stop a song over and over while I was trying to listen to it. Unlike other MP3 players, there is no way (that I know of) to ajust the sensitivity on the Bean, so it makes the problem even harder to deal with. So my father printed out the manual to it and we tried to find the answer to the problem. That mission was unsuccessful.  Problem # 3 - I haven`t used my Bean in quite a while, but yesterday I decided to charge it up and see if it would work. I took it out of the case it was in and I went to plug it into the computer. To my surprise, it wasn`t plugging in because the built-in plug would not snap into place as it usually does. My father and I have not yet figured out a solution to this problem and we are going to take it back to Sony and see what they can do.  Overall, folks, this is a horrible MP3 player because it will give you a lot of problems. The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is because the color and screen are nice and because the sound is pretty good.

<Title>Flimsy flash drive cover does not impress
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I knew from the beginning I did not want an ipod because everyone had one.  My sister owns a Sony NW-E507 Mp3 Flash player and she enjoys it a lot.  So, I thought I would try the Sony Walkman Bean because I thought since the NW-E507 worked so well and we already had SonicStage installed on our computer (I also did not want the same Mp3 player as my sister).  Well, when I got the "bean" I thought it was pretty cool.  It had a built in flash drive which was very handy, however the flimsy cover did not impress my very much.  I was almost positive that within a week it was going to break... and I was right.  Another thing I did not like about the bean was that the control buttons were small and it was difficult for me to turn up the volume without stopping the song or changing albums.  I am usually adept when it comes to technology but this Mp3 player is a little bit tricky.  I must say one positive thing about it and that is changing the time and date settings was easier than on the NW-E507 (plus, the name is cooler. ha ha)

<Title>Another example of Sony's failure to keep in touch with consumers
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The bean is small, battery efficient, and has a nice overall look to it. Thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product. This is NOT an mp3 player, it is a TRAC player. You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take. If your looking for an mp3 player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mp3s into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you. This device is the Stalin of mp3 player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs.

<Title>I don't like the hold button...
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The bean Mp3 player is really cute in color and shape... but I dont like the way the hold button is on it... It is really annoying especially if you buy the case for it... The ear phones are the worst, they don't hold in when your just sitting there, I can just imagine what would happen if I was in the gym running... However, if you buy the sony MDR-J20 ear phone, they are comfortable and hold pretty well... you won't be able to turn it up to maximun volume it is waaay too high... Oh another thing I want to comment on is the amount of songs that fit on there.... NO WAY does it fit 950 songs! I did an average of the amount of songs I already have and the free space left and I realized that it will probably only fit 300 if you're lucky... All in all its a cute mp3 player, it doesnt have the greatest features though!

<Title>Sony Software is the Culprit
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.  As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly. I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste. As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.  Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..  It is absolutely infuriating!

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item initially because of the price, compared to the IPOD's.  I LOVE it! My husband has the video IPOD and his battery needs charged every day.  I have never had to charge this MP3 player yet! It goes for 50 hours- I ordered the mini sony speakers for it so I can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere.  The only downside is that Sony quit making the armband for it so I am having a hard time finding a holder for it. It fit my needs perfectly-

<Title>Bad design.....flimsy toggles.......JUNK
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months.   I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.

<Content>Short and quick. Software is easy to use, but because Sony uses ATRAC, you can't play the songs on another program (Windows etc.) you downloaded or saved from a cd to the SONY program.  But the program is very easy to use. The player itself is very small (including the buttons).  I purchased it strictly for the gym and long plane trips.  It hold a ton of songs (500+) Why you need more that that I don't know.  It also has a FM stereo receiver, so it is cool as well. In total, it is compact and easy to use.  Perfect for the gym, running fanatic.

I do not like the fact that you pretty much are forced to use sony software but it is quick and easy to use.

<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wrote a great review on this little bean 2 days ago.    I am now editing it.  For some reason it wont let me change the amount of stars I gave it. I would now give it 1 star.  The darn thing just broke on me.  It slipped out of my fingers and actually gently hit the floor ( the cord breaking some of the fall ) and the control stick broke off and the thing is almost useless now.  I really think that a mp3 flash player should be more durable.  This stinks, I wasted 120 dollars.    Time to get an ipod.   Mike

I returned my first one because the first time I got it, the cover feel right off. So I bought another one and it worked fine for a couple months and then the MP3 player has a formatting error and I don't know how to undo the format error.

<Title>Unbelievable Battery Life, But....
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that: (A) I'm not a big fan of Apple and (B) I've had a good experience with Sony Walkmans.  However, its apparent to me that NO company that makes MP3 players is getting it quite right.    Anyways, perhaps I'm a little biased towards Sony (Sony is a music company, Apple is a computer company...barely), but I have to say that this is by far the best MP3 player I can find.  Most notably, the battery life is unbelievable.  It's specified at 50 hours with [ATRAC3] 64 kbps.  My girlfriend is using it at [ATRAC3] 128 kbps and it's been going for 30 hours so far.  That's twice as long as even the other FLASH players out there, not to mention the HD players.  Clearly, Sony's years of experience building portable music players has taught them how to get battery power right.    Other pluses:  The software is very easy to use, but like all other software-managed players, you're going to be tied into using the software.  If you want drag-and-drop loading, you've got to go with a Creative player and they seem to be abandoning their line of FLASH players.    The price? It had to come down sooner or later.  Creative wanted $199 for 512Mb.  The Bean offers 1Gb for $149.  Now for the minuses:  User interface?  A little less than intuitive.  I needed the documentation to figure it out (I'm a degreed engineer, by the way) but only to clarify a point or two.  It's a little awkward moving up the directory structure, moreso than moving down.     Mechanical?  Well, it's a FLASH player, so you should be able to punt kick it, right?  Well, it's got a delicate little cover for the USB plug (the USB plug is spring-loaded and pops out for use when a cover on top of the player slides back) and a five-position hat switch (like the figher pilots use to trim their jets out) that seems like it could snap right off.  You can buy an accidental damage protection plan and I have a feeling I'm going to need it because of these two mechanical design decisions.  Overall, it's a great value for a 1 Gb FLASH player and as long as you don't drop it (who knows, maybe you can drop it, I haven't tried to yet, but I BET you can't...), it's pretty darn easy to use and you REALLY WON'T RUN THE BATTERY OUT...EVER (seemingly).

However, both my bean and my sister's have since quit working without any apparent cause.  My sister sent hers in for repair, and it came back good as new... only to quit working again a month later.  I am not going to bother with getting my bean repaired... My advice: do what I am doing, and spring for the I-Pod Video.

<Title>I love my Bean
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This past Christmas weekend, I had the opportunity to set up both a 2GB iPod Nano (for my daughter) and the 1GB Sony Walkman Bean (aka Network Walkman) for use on my computer.  These are some random observations with regards to the Bean:  - In my opinion, setting up SonicStage (Sony's music service) is a little easier to set up than iTunes.  The interface for transferring your music is very intuitive.  - You are required to register your Bean through SonicStage before you can use it. (Very easy to do.)  - 5 free music credits came with my Bean, but you have to register a credit card with the service (same as with iTunes, I believe) before you download your 5 songs.  - I purchased new headphones.  The headphones that came with the Bean are not as good as those that come with the Nano.  I don't like the earbud-type of phones anyway.  - There is no "hissing" noise during playback, unless your music has the noise in it before you transfer it to the player.  Music quality for all of my songs is crystal-clear.  Being able to hear solid and thumping bass with no "tinnyness" is a must for me when I'm listening to my music, and Sony does NOT disappoint!  (The Nano has fantastic sound quality too!)  - You *CAN* transfer your music in mp3 format to the Bean, as opposed to Sony's proprietary format.  Simply click the Settings button before you start the transfer and chose mp3 as the format.  - The interface on the player is pretty simple to understand.  As with any player, you just have to scroll through the options in order to see what the thing is capable of.  (I'd make sure to set the volume settings to manual instead of using the preset volume settings.)  - Sony allows you to use the SonicStage service with your Bean on up to 5 computers.  You are required to register each location.  May seem restrictive or invasive to some, but isn't a problem for me, since I only use my Bean at home and at work.   Overall, I am very pleased with the Sony Walkman Bean (price, setup, transfer interace, music quality) and am loving showing it off to people!

<Title>The Worst DAP
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't normally write these things, but this is a special case...  I have 7,000+ MP3s. The bundled software - which MUST be used to transfer files to the player - took well over two hours to  create a library. Even WMP can do it in less than 15 minutes. So far, so bad.  Once I finally got a library created, I found that I could not use my MP3s without a time-consuming and glitchy conversion to what (I think) is a proprietary Sony format. This is crap.  I returned this player and got a Samsung YP-T7J, which I am very pleased with. Drag-and-drop, no terrible (and boy do I mean TERRIBLE) bundled software supplied or required, and no compatibility surprises.  Skip this one, people. It's REALLY bad.

<Content>I had a Video IPOD $399 and the Irever player and then I bought this. I won't be buying another player coz im stickin to Sony Bean. I hate the IPOD Battery life n Size. This is tiny player with an amazing battery life.  If you are looking for a player with features like "Slide Show", "Menu based browsing", Video, "Large Capacity", then you better look for a Hard Disk based player. This is an incredibly small flash player- high on battery- and good music quality player. I gotta say the s/w is not as equiped as IPOD, but then an IPOD won't last for 40 hrs without charging, and video IPOD feels like a big cell phone in my hands. IPOD nano is susceptible to screen scratches. Negatives to this player would be the 1) Small browsing button. 2) Not so trendy s/w. 3) Moving USB drive If you are lookin for a high battery-small-good sound quality  MP3 player then this is well worth the money.

<Title>A good player for the price
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my bean a month ago, and I chose this mp3 player mostly because it has a low price for 1 GB and I trust Sony to make good quality electronics. Overall, I am satisfied with it, although there are a few annoyances. This is my first mp3 player, so I don't have much to compare to other than what I've heard from others.  Pros: -The battery life is amazing, and it doesn't take long to charge up (less than an hour for a full charge, which gives you almost 50 hours). I don't know how long the battery will last (I've heard horror stories about iPod batteries), but so far it's fine. -If you use Sony's Atrac3 format rather than mp3, you can fit twice as many songs as you can on other 1 GB players. The sound quality of this format is supposed to be worse, but I honestly don't notice much difference. -The controls are simple and take only a few minutes to learn. -Sony's Sonic software is simple to install and use. -I love the pop-out USB connector. -The FM tuner is a nice feature and definitely an advantage over iPod. -The design is very nice, which is very important to aesthetics-obsessed people like me. -As always, Sony's sound quality is excellent.  Cons: -The packaging is misleading when it says you can fit 695 songs. That's only if you use the Atrac3 format. I initially used mp3 and was surprised when I filled it up with only about 200 songs. I was forced to go back and reload everything in Atrac3, which is a smaller and less-quality format. -It takes a long time to load the songs onto the player.  -I hate having to use proprietary software to upload songs, although I know there are very few mp3 players that actually let you drag and drop, so this isn't any worse than other players. -The headphones are terrible; they simply wouldn't stay in my ears, especially when I was exercising. And the white *does not* go with the black bean, in my opinion. So I picked up some over-the-ear headphones for $10, which are much better. -the USB cover is flimsy and feels like it might snap off, but so far I haven't had any problem with it.  The bottom line: For the price, this is a pretty decent player. If you want to use mp3s and not Atrac3s, you might want to look at something else. But if you're just looking for a no-frills, cheap mp3 player that will hold a lot of songs, this is a pretty good one.

<Title>good price / memory, bad construction
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The price for a 1 gb MP3 player is very good, but I was disappointed in the construction of this Sony product. I recognize the Sony brand for quality, and was therefore disappointed at the flimsy construction of the operating switch. It was quite difficult to switch back and forth between the FM radio player and the MP3 player functions. Many times the switch "slid" betweem these functions. Meaning you are listing to the radio one minute and a digital song the next. Perhaps I had a uniquely misfunctioning product, but in general I would stay away from the Bean. I returned this product within one week of owning it.
