<Title>Best  Flash  Drive  Player  Out  There
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The creative zen v plus is a great player overall. It is the same weight as the nano so technically you can say they are the same size since it is shorter but thicker than nano. The creative has excellent audio quality, and photos look great. I was able to easily watch a 1/2 hour video without any problems. The Line-in recording quality is also excellent as is the voice redording. My product has never froze either, so now they have probably fixed this problem. Next I will list the main Pros and Cons.   Pros: Scratch resistant surface, video playback, line-in recording, voice recording, photo support, great audio quality, color variations, skip-free music, audible compatibility, compatibility with MANY music services.  Cons: No user-replacable battery, joystick is somewhat small.

<Title>Product Has Bugs, Customer Service Won't Help!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why:  The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.    All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.    So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.    I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.   By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.    Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers.  I hope this helps anyone looking at this player.  Jeff

<Title>Zen V Plus 2 GB gets the job done.
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's small enough to fit in your pocket.  It's easy to use.  It has a user defined graphic equalizer (as well as handy presets).  I play music with other people and it really comes in handy when I want to record a bit of a tune to learn.  The display is quite nice too.  For the money, you just can't go wrong.  It also allows you to copy data files to it for backup.  Both of my kids have iPod's and I'll take the Zen any day.

<Title>The player is not recognized by your computer if you don't install the creative software
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The best thing about the Zen plus is how compact it is. You ll forget it's in your pocket. The interface is very user-friendly; the quality of the sounds is really good.   The creative software is very easy to use, but you'll have to install the creative software if you want the Zen Plus to be recognized by your computer in order to transfer any data. So it's all right if you are always transferring music from the same computer, but otherwise you'll have to carry the installation CD around with you. I wanted to be able to take and give music easily when visiting friends and this is not possible unless they perform a full installation on their computer.

<Title>Excellent all round MP3 player
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got one of these with my birthday present money after I returned a Zicplay MP3 player that was faulty and was not good enough as an MP3 player in my opinion.  I love this Creative Zen V Plus MP3 player it looks really good and is small and it is very easy to use. I have owned an iPod Nano before and I do prefer the Creative to my old Nano. I am not knocking the Nano because that was a very good music player to but it just my preference. I really like the look of the Zen V Plus and the ease of how it operates. This MP3 player also has some good features which I like which some other MP3 players do not offer. It also comes with  a voice recorder, inbuilt radio and you can play mini video clips easily on the Zen. It operates with a little joystick that you can move up and down etc and it has a separate pause/play and back button. One of my reasons for also getting this player was because I wanted something a bit different from the norm this time so I went with the Zen.   You can view your pictures mini or full sized with this MP3 player and you can browse your music playlist whilst your music is playing. Music can also easily be dragged and dropped to your music player.  I find the Creative software very easy to use and I have no real gripes at all. I own a Apple MacBook Pro and I can use my Creative on my Mac by using  XNJB software or on my Windows partition of my hard drive. On the Windows side the player is recognised by your computer even without the software but it is a bit basic so I installed Creative's software.   I bought my own headphones for this I bought some Sennheiser PX200 white ones of Amazon. The Creative headphones were a bit to big for my ears as they kept on falling out. I suffer from small ear syndrome lol and all small headphones that I have tried are like that so that is not Creative's fault. The sound though of the actual MP3 player is fantastic 10/10 in my opinion. It can do loud and its sounds great when connected to MP3 speakers doing it.   I bought a wall charger for this so that I do not just have to rely on charging my MP3 player through my computer. Make sure that you do not just buy a standard USB plug as that will not work. Even though i can live without one I would also love to see some kind of dock for this player.

<Title>a review on line-in recording
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a d.j. and I was in the market for a recording device. I really needed a product for post reference of my d.j. sets. After looking at dat, cd and hard drive recorders I realised I only needed something to listen to myself afterwards and not some big, bulky or expensive piece of machinery. There are many line-in recording devices out there but I only needed something small in flash space since my previous Creative mp3 player(20gb) was not even full yet. I decided on this player based of my previous experience with Creative products. I have had the 2gb V Plus for about a month now and I love it. I plug the player into my receiver via the head phone out using the included line-in cord. I will say you must set your levels correctly beforehand. I usually listen to my player volume at around 18-20 so I make sure to turn the volume up high on the receiver so i can get a decent recording without having to turn up the player above 20 in order to hear the recording loud and clear. The player also has the option of recording at either 128 or 160kbps. Unfortunately it only records in WMA and not mp3. The recordings are tagged with date and time for you. I usually go back in a computer and re-tag the file so it's easy tell recordings apart. I would not recommend buying this particular player for recording an artist demo cd as the max 160kbps WMA is far too compressed a file for a professional sound. As I only needed a device for immediate playback and documentation of my d.j. sets this product has lived up to my expectations and surpassed them on many other levels. Bought directly from Amazon with free shipping for less than $100 you just can't beat it.

<Title>Buyer Beware - Display issues (check creative website)
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned my creative Zen V for less than four months and the display stopped working. When I checked out Creative's website, there were a slough of customer comments indicating that they had the same problem and decided to either throw the player away or wait months for repair. Two additional problems: Creative Zen V's only carry a 3 month warranty on labor. The 12 month is for the parts only and does not cover the labor involved in repairing/replacing/shipping the item. Creative customer support does not exist (for the most part). You are able to use telephone support for a very short while without cost. After that, the only means of communicating with Creative is via e-mail. Moreover, if you lose the original book that came with the player, you can no longer access the customer service telephone number (check their website and try to find a number to call).  Buyers beware.

<Title>Bad "good" product
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my daughter at Christmas- it was so popular I ordered it from 4 different places and they all were out of stock before I finally got one. It didn't work right from the time we took it out of the box. As soon as we installed the software and plug in the MP# player, the computer wouldn't recognize it. It would freeze up and then the next day after charging, it wouldn't power on at all. I read a LOT of reviews before purchasing it and was very excited about the product, but when it came time to replace it and stayed away from the Creative Zen. I just don't have time for trouble.  If I had all the time in the world I would purchase another one.

<Title>Functional for reason I bought
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I read the reviews on several different MP3 players before buying this one. I bought it to listen to Netlibrary books because of the ability to bookmark. As other reviewers have mentioned it does have problems locking up although I have noticed it mostly occurs when fast forwarding or rewinding for a long time. The headphones that come with it are not as good as I would have liked as they have foam covers which seem to fall off rather easily. The manual also doesn't explain very well how to access additional menus which can be accessed by holding down the back arrow key which brings up an additional function menu depending on the screen. The battery life is OK, the buttons are small and I have inadverently recorded things when tring to adjust the volume, but overall the functionality is fine for the reasons I purchased it.

<Title>Good.  While it works.
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my Zen V Plus about six months ago and have enjoyed it very much until it quit.  It went from working fine to not working without any dropping or other abuse.  The display froze up and multiple resettings would not help.  I could be just picky, but my prior mp3 player lasted two years and probably still works except I bought this better(?) one.  I now have a Toshiba Gigabeat.  If it turns to trash, I will listen to the radio.

<Title>Awesome, But....
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This Creative Zen V Plus really is exceptional: it has a great design, it's really easy to use, and it's a great investment!  However, as to be expected, this player has its flaws. I have owned two--the joystick of the first's broke, but fortunately it was within warranty and I was able to obtain another. I enjoyed the second one for about 8 months until a fairly common design flaw kicked in and the screen faded away. Now the display is completely black, and I'm navigating it blindly. I won't give the player a bad review because it truly was awesome while it lasted, but I'm really disappointed with regards to its durability.

<Title>Will never buy a Creative MP3 ZEN again
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As I emailed Creative, the product should work out of the box. The one I got had a battery that could not be charged. The other thing I noted was that it came with a large amount of memory resident proprietary software. This means that you can only synch the Zen on a machine that has the creative software installed. I sent the whole thing back and feel fortunate that Amazon issued a full refund.

<Title>Stamp out poor quality products - don't buy this MP3 player!
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's true that if I loved this product I probably wouldn't take the time to write this review but between the product and the completely inadequate customer service from Creative -- they don't even list a telephone number in the documentation that comes in the box or on the website; so much for the free 60 days of telephone support - unless you have access to pigeons or Harry Potter's magic. The player has frozen several times (corrupted file?) and the battery gives up after 6 or 7 hours, then takes at least that long to "fully" charge again. Very disappointed with the overall performance of this player -- bought specifically because it supports DRM e-audiobook files downloaded from the local library. I intend to return it and try something else -- from another company besides Creative Technologies.

<Title>Better than an IPOD
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the second Creative MP3 player I've purchased (the first was a Creative Zen Micro Photo), and I'm very impressed.  It's small enough to fit easily into my pocket, but the color screen is still quite easy to read.  Both of my Creative players require me to reset them once in awhile, but it's easy to do and therefore only a minor nuisance.  What really makes these players better than an Ipod (which was the first MP3 player I bought) is the ability to copy/paste music to and from the player just like you could with a thumb-drive.  I don't have to use Itunes, I don't have to work hard to get my music off of my player, I can simply copy and paste.

What you pay is what you get...its really worth for its price 6. It was tested by the hearing organization...so you can adjust volume to 18/25 and its scientifically safe to not damage your hearing...    Cons ==== 1. Bad video compression (files get larger than original when transferring, like ten times bigger than a common mpg file) 2. Creative media source doesn't sync mp3/wma tag changes (you have to actually delete the file from the mp3 player) 3. Voice recording wont be understandable if you want to record a class or something (you have to be very close to the person who talks) 4. When recording with line-in theres a back noise in the resulting recording... (I'm not really sure about this)

<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is not a high end player, but it's survived the treadmill at the gym. The display is clear enough, although the buttons are not intuitive. You'll hit the wrong buttons until you get imprinted with the Creative Zen way. There isn't a lot of volume, and am I the only one who hates ALL MP3 ear phones? The Zen software interface is functional, and it loads songs easily enough. However, electronic copyright protections are still in the primordial ooze stages. There is slime is all over the uploading process, even for legally-owned music. If you're expecting high end, go elsewhere. If you want a functionally rugged MP3 player that no one will steal, then choose Creative Zen plus.

<Content>this little player was just what i wanted.  it fits lots of songs (but not my whole collection, by any means) and has great sound quality.  i had some problems with it freezing when i first turned it on (!!) but i called the help people and got a quick answer--all you have to do is use a little pin to hit the reset button and start over.  i haven't had a problem since, but if i do i know there's a quick fix.  also:  you probably don't need to load all the software they give you; it'll just clog up your computer (and might be the cause of the freezing).  try just plugging it into your usb first.  the help desk guy said they are all configured to work with programs we already have--windows media player, etc.  my computer recognized it automatically.  i mostly use it with my rhapsody-to-go membership, which is, in my opinion, the best way to use this little thing.

<Content>I own the 2gb white-green...it looks really nice and it feels good in your palm...but there are just so many things wrong about it! 1.it doesn't come with a wall charger and the original one is 20-30$...I've tried other wall chargers but they don't work 2.you can't transfer music without installing the software which takes ages to install and it's hard to use...without installing it the computer simply won't recognize it, not even as a flash drive 3.it's pretty much scratch resistant but you if do scratch it even a little bit you won't be able to see anything under the scratch or around that area on the screen 4.battery life is 8-9 hours 5.if you connect it to your car system or your desktop speakers the sound is very poor...I've tried other mp3 players and they had great sound and great volume I wouldn't buy it again.

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I agonized over which MP3 player to get my wife for Christmas.  I settled on this one based on price and features.  We like to listen to audiobooks and a little music.  So far this has been easy to use.  It is small and lightweight, and the controls are very intuitive.  Thus far is has been a great product.

<Title>Overall: very satisfied.
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before i purchased this, i read so many bad reviews and was afraid. However the price was very appealing, so i decided to purchase it. When it arrived, it was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. It was even smaller than my cellphone. The design is very nice and fits well in the palm of your hand. It's much cheaper than the ipod! Plus it holds a lot of songs, pictures, but not very good for videos. The screen is too small for videos and when the videos are converted it takes up a lot more memory. The radio function is very nice if you ever feel like listening to something other than your music. Although i was very satisfied with this product, there were some cons to it. The thumbstick is very small and can get annoying. The play/pause & back buttons are located on the rightside, making it easier for left handed people but harder for right handed ones. I also disliked the earphones since they were very uncomfortable. I would highly reccommend this product to everyone. Great deal.

<Title>Great Music Device
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this tiny little mp3 player.  It came with a chord, so I can hang it around my neck when I go walking or exercise.  (My niece's did not, so I had to put it in my pocket or carry it in an awkward pouch.)  The battery life is very good.  My only problem is that I can't get the video I purchased to download to the program.  I've tried to find help, but I came up empty handed.  This could be the fault of the device or maybe my own.  I'm usually pretty good with electronics though.  (BTW, if someone knows how to get a WMV video to upload, I'd love to know too.)

<Title>There's nothing like an ipod!
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 12 y/o daughter requested an ipod but instead I purchased a zen v plus. I have an ipod for 3 years and never had a problem.  Within 1 month and 12 days the screen went blank.  You hear the music but no screen.  What a waste!  I should have purchased the ipod nano.  I hope creative give me a full refund so I can pay the extra $100 and buy a nano.  Buyers beware and stick to the reliable product, IPOD!

<Content>Ordered the Zen Plus to use while walking. I can't believe how much it has helped my exercise program. Subscribe to Yahoo Music and have downloaded many upbeat songs to enjoy while walking. My daughters have the Zen M but always seem to "borrow" this one while running. It is so lightweight and the FM stations come in when they wouldn't with other players. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs a small media player. Sound quality is excellent. It will kick up your exercise program!!

<Title>Good documentation is essential
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There is a small booklet provided with this but only gives the most general information.  You can print out a more detailed user's manual, but it isn't all that helpful.    The booklet warns you on page 3 that "DO NOT connect your player to your computer before setting up the software."  How many people read all the manual before testing it out?  They could have put this warning on the outside box, or on the peel off screen protector that has to be removed from the player. Also, I appreciate an explanation of WHY you should not do this and what might happen.   My player went dead the second time I tried it, and I feared it was due to my connecting the player to the computer before loading the software.  It was only from a review on this site that I learned you can reset it.  The menus are confusing and definately not "intuitive" (although I am middle-aged so it may be "intuitive" to a teenager.    On the plus side, the sound is very good--much better than I expected.

<Content>Even the 12-year-old (who has a Nano)was jealous. It's smaller-therefore cooler! It comes with a necklace length strap. It's able to download music off any music site - (Nano is only compatible with iTunes.) It has FM radio, and an organizer/contacts feature. You can record (via the included "line-in" wire) right off your CD player - no computer needed to record. The video is easy to load and very easily viewed. The menus are easy even for my older relatives to use! The earbuds are of good quality, but don't fit my ear.

<Title>Great...WHEN IT ACTUALLY WORKS...TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased this on March 27, 2007.  Stopped working in July, 2007.  The little reset button on the side was unresponsive.  Plugging it into the computer didn't do anything either.  With all troubleshooting options exhausted, called customer support.  Turns out there's only a 90 day full warranty.  If I wanted someone to help me it would cost $12.95 for the call.  I could send it in and if they can fix it, they'll charge an additional $25.00 for the labor.  Why would I want the same defective one patched up and sent back to me just for it to break on me again?    I also have a SanDisk Sansa m250.  It also stopped working, but at least with them, the tech call was free and they sent me a brand new one...no hassel AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!  Stay away from CREATIVE ZEN...they are a company full of EXTRA CHARGES.

<Title>great little MP3 plus it has an FM radio
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was worried when I purchased this product because there were several bad reviews. However, I took a chance.  And, I'm glad I did.  I love this little MP3. Plus, it has an FM radio which is great at the gym (...at my gym you have to tune in to an FM station in order to hear the TVs that are mounted above the treadmills).  I followed the set-up instructions to get it started "to the letter" and it works great.  CAVEAT:  It crashed/froze a coupla times but I think that's a "user error" problem.  Don't push the "back" & "forward" areas at the same time.  If you do, it'll freeze.  However, it resets without a problem.  It doesn't come with an A/C adapter but you can purchase an inexpensive one on-line or purchase other "bundled" products for it like a case, car adapter and loads more.

<Content>I got 2 of these as gifts and would have been better off burning my money. Both stopped working within a week! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBNXVY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-3661815-6954340">Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player (White/Green)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QGGIJK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-3661815-6954340">Zen V Plus 8GB Black/red Carry Music Video Clips & Photos Eng/fr</a>   Yes you can reset them and gain back SOME of the functionality with one ... but after lots of research and calls on a bad connection to Zen's tech support in the Phillipines, the other is still not working at all. If you want something reliable, GET SOMETHING ELSE. On the other hand, if you want to frustrate people and make them feel unliked and unloved ... just get 'em a Zen.

<Title>Great player but useless for people with large hands
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative makes great MP3 players, but I din't like this player much. In the current market one can find better options within the same price range.  Pros: - 1. Small size(also a disadvantage too) 2. Feature rich(FM, Video, EQ, themes etc). 3. Can change the screen orientation(Rare in new players too) 4. Bright screen 5. Available in many trendy color combinations  Cons: - 1. Ultra small size joy stick. Don't buy this player if you have large fingers. Its a pain to navigate through small stick. 2. Feels plastic and looks plastic too. 3. Sound quality is just above average, but could have been much better. 4. Poor battery, I got just 8 hour palyback time. My previous Sansa use to give 16 hours for single charge.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing claims to be 2 GB, but it's not.  It's 1.7 GB.  Then you find out that all standard movie files have to be "converted" to work on the player.  The "conversion" process takes a very long time.  After that's finally done, you discover that your 166 MB movie file is suddenly 618 MB--almost half your space!  None of this is mentioned in the product's false advertising, but I'm here to let you know.

<Title>Good unit, but has a design flaw
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have one of these as well as a 1 GB unit. They both perform well, as expected - I use them to make Old Time Radio programs more portable.  However, both units showed the same problem. After a few months of service, the plastic cover that goes over the 5-way navigation button splits in half. The pieces may fall out, or stay inside jamming the nav button. It lasts long enough to outlast the 90-day free service, so it then costs $25 to send it back for repair (they actually send you a new one).  Based on this, I wouldn't buy another one. They have just released a 16GB unit at about $250 but the design is the same - so BEWARE, the nav button wil break in about 4 months or so.

<Title>It works but the software doesn't
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product documentation does not mention anything about Windows Vista.  I installed the software from the CD and it sort of worked but would not recognize the player when plugged into the USB port.  Some googling got me to Creative's web site but it wasn't clear there either.  Eventually I found a support forum that said not to install the software.  They want you to use the built-in Windows Media Player.  The Windows software works fine but I wasted a few hours finding that out.  The player itself has worked well and I think it is a good value for the price.  I've only had it a month so I can't comment on reliability.

<Title>Excellent features, good value
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was actually looking to buy the Zen Stone Plus which is what I considered over the iPod Shuffle because of reports of the device being rendered useless if the clip becomes mangled. So there I was at Fry's with an array of mp3 players at hand but after I've played(or attempted to) with the Zen Stone it seemed very slow and cumbersome, it was hard to get from one point to another. But when I stepped to the side and picked up the Zen V Plus(I bought the 2gb version) it felt, while very small, good and the controls were more intuitive. I've owned 2 iPods, a Mini and a 20gb U2 iPod and I don't miss any of the shiny metal or lousy click wheel that was impossible to use in the car without almost killing someone on the road. The battery life on those iPods declined rapidly, down to nearly just an hour or two of play time after a couple of years, rather disappointing for the price paid. This time around I went back to a more tactile and full featured.(Hi Apple, when are you going to put a radio in your iPods? And iTunes, is that a joke? It is the most resource consuming and computer crashing application I've ever had the misfortune to install) Since I'm against iTunes (which also cripples any older iPod models with an "update" thus forcing you to buy their latest and greatest ) Anywho, the Zen V Plus was my choice because the interface is logical and similar to the iPod if not better in my opinion, it is compatible with any sort of music management software (Windows Media Player, Media Monkey, whatever), it has great features that sync with your Outlook calendar, you can create your own calendar notes and task lists and a contact list using the software bundled in with the player. I've already loaded it up with music, video and pictures and it picks it all up easily.   The good stuff- -The box comes packed with everything you need, sort of. A lanyard, decent headphones, a USB/charging cable, line in cable (for recording from other devices), a little drawstring bag (which I will be using to store the other in-box goods).  -The display is crisp and vibrant, not the greatest but it's more than adequate for everything. I don't see myself watching movies or a lot of video on this thing though, the screen is a little too small for serious movie watching. -Value, for the price I'm very satisfied already with this player even more than when I got my iPods. I have a large music collection but I only want to take and end up listening to a handful at a time and 2GB is plenty for a couple of weeks and I can just add a new playlist to refresh it.   Ok, so the downside I've noticed in this little gem- -The directional joystick thing is small, I mean SMALL. I have small hands and short nails and with the case I bought for it on you can barely feel the top of the joystick over the case. I can see some fumbling around while at the gym (the reason why I bought it, something light and "clippable")but like the other reviewers, I'm sure I'll get used to it in time.  -There aren't many accessories available for these guys, I bought a 3 case set and while they fit perfectly, the clip is atrocious. The flimsiest thing I've ever seen. I can't imagine this clip being able to hold on to anything let alone live through an hour at the gym, I'm about to find out tomorrow! I've had no luck in finding a slim case with detachable clip. There are leather cases with clips but are much too bulky for my needs and I don't understand the logic of buying a case that increases the volume of a tiny player, it seems to defeat the purpose of buying something small. -Short USB cable. It's about a foot long maybe more. I use a laptop so it is just fine but I can see this  being a little annoying for other users that still have to reach around for usb ports. It might be good idea to buy a longer cable at the same time if you have bending over issues. -The case I bought covers the volume controls but its not hard to just press over it unless you have a darker color player and dark case, then its a bit more fumbly.  In short, I'm very much over the iPod hype and I don't see myself buying an iPod again soon. The Zen V Plus functions well and above my needs at a  friendly price point. If you don't mind the lack of accessories as much as I do, I say give this one a shot.
