<Title>Rock solid, looks sharp, best looking display I've seem

<Content>I've had and reviewed several digital players in the past. Most MP3 players come across as following the same cutting edge trend. The first thing I noticed with the Truly MP310 is its more sophisticated look. It's solid and seemingly well built.   Now grant it, this is more than just an MP3 player, perhaps a bit too versatile for the casual music listener. It supports music, digital books, FM radio, voice/line-in/FM recording, games and photos. You can set your wallpaper or theme, similar to windows. The menus are as easily navigable as can be expected for a multipurpose gadget. Keep in mind that this kind of versatility comes with a learning curve. Expect to use the reference manual once in a while. It comes with a quick start guide which is of limited help. The full manual is on a disk.  I like the style of the earbud headphones. They're comfortable, built solid and look sharp, but the sound is a bit bassy and the cord could be longer. With that said, Earphones are cheap. Go out and get whatever headphones suit you.   The LCD display is about the best I've seen in the MP3 mode. It's big, bright, colorful, and easy to view in bright sunlight. It very clearly gives all the expected information including artist and song name, track number/total tracks, volume level, play mode, equalizer mode.  The player does come with some well built accessories; particularly the carrying case and arm band. They're made with a heavy black nylon. This is to say the player can be worn on the belt or arm. All the buttons and display are accessible while in the case.  Speaking of the buttons, they're responsive, well laid out but a bit small. The volume, forward, back and menu buttons are on the front and the equalizer and A/B buttons are on the side. I like a player that you can just reach down and operate without looking. You'll need to look at this player to hit the correct buttons. As mentioned, there's a dedicated button to access the equalizer. This is a bit uncommon but a convenient feature. I find myself using it more than I thought I would. Usually the equalizer is buried in the menu. There are standard genres settings for pop, rock, classical, custom and so on. The player locked up on me once while downloading but playback seems to work well so far.  The FM reception is much better than expected. Frankly, most FM receivers in digital players don't work well. You can select the quality of stations you want (how strong a station you want the thing to pull in), low, medium or high and then scan and this puts the stations into memory. I pulled in the two strongest stations in high and 19 in low. Stations come in decent in low with a minimum of fading in and out when moving about.  I'm impressed.  For the pictures, there's software on the disk for cropping and converting to a useable format. Pictures need to be converted to an LGO format in order to work well. After a little playing around, the software is simple, easy to use and relatively straight forward. The pictures appear a bit grainy but viewable. Pictures with good contrast work best. The ability to crop helps too. The player comes with some pictures already loaded, more for demo purposes than anything else.  You can listen to music while reading an ebook. There're options for a slideshow, the ability to name preset radio stations, an adjustable timer for power off, display options and so on. All and all, this is, but not just an MP3 player that you would load music and go. If that's what you're looking for, there's plenty out there. This is a digital media player (pictures and sound) that should be learned to be fully appreciated.

<Title>A Good Player with Problems
<Date>Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this a couple of months ago. I am quite happy with it. It's really cute looking and has lots of features for the price. You can listen to music, record voice recordings, listen to the radio, play games, read ebooks, and look at pictures. The sound is good, but when you look for a particular song the artist's name is first so if you have a couple by one artist you won't know which is which. Also there are no shuffle or playlist features. The voice recorder works well and it counts down how much space you have left on your player. If you are in the exact right position the radio works, but if you move it around or cross the room it gets fuzzy. So it will definitly not work in the car. You can record a song on the radio, but it will not be very clear. The games are fun and easy to understand. You can also listen to music while playing them. I don't have an ebook, but I think the screen is too small anyway. I don't have pictures either. For 1 gigabyte the player holds quite a bit of space, I have about 4 hours left on mine. All in all it's a satasfactory mp3 player. There are some problems, but for the price, excellent!
