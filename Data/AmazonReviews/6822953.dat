<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>+ The most important: the SOUND is great (iAudio/Cowon is well know for it). + The resolution of the SCREEN is awesome (better than I expected) and to be able to watch movies in a "widescreen" format is great. + RECORDING from TV is very good, you see it on the A2 like you see it on your TV and it has a feature that lets you program the start-time/end-time of your recording (kind of like TiVo) + The NAVIGATION MENU is very intuitive; my friends use it right away the first time they get their hands on it without the need for explaining. + You'll find the built-in speaker useful sometimes, and they sound loud despite of being small.  - The CARRYING CASE is made out of leather, looks good, but it doesn't provide any protection for the screen, and doesn't have a belt clip. - You might find it a little heavy, but JUST a first (is only a couple of oz more than other PMPs).  A few tips: * You don't have to install the software (which I found useful) if you don't want to, just drag & drop your files using the windows explorer. * Download the DivX movie converter [...]. * Get the "zCover echo for COWON A2" it's great for protecting your A2 and specially the screen (which is the best feature of the player) * There's a remote control available for the A2 (sold separately) which lets you do a lot of things without getting your A2 out of your pocket.  So why getting the A2 instead of an 80GB iPod which is only worth a few more dollars BIGGER SCREEN, lots of useful features (radio, voice/radio/TV recording, download pictures directly for digital cameras, could be easily used as an external Hard Drive). And finally because it has pre-installed Codecs to play almost  all movie and musics files, this will SAVE YOU TIME, just put in the files and enjoy.  ***Keep in mind that this is a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP) so you should get it if you like downloading music videos and have a lot of photos to show to your friends or like to watch movies every time you have a few minutes to spare. If 90% of the time all you do is listen to music and your music library is small, you should just get a 4GB or 8GB smaller and more portable player***

<Content>It seems that Jet Audio may have spammed the jet audio reviews with "quick delivery" items.  I've been waiting 2+ weeks for the Cowon A2 after ordering from Jet.  And getting through to customer service...grab a snickers...  UPDATE:  Dec 14, 2006  Well, we did finally receive the Unit about 3 weeks later than expected...but at least it did arrive!    As for the A2. It's a gem.  Bright, crisp screen and powerful sound output when played through car stereo.  The other reviewers have summed things up well (multi file format support is so nice).  The A2 is highly recommended...

<Title>A great device - particularly nice for cardio workouts
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I workout at an LA Fitness where at least one out of two people have ipods of some variety strapped to some portion of their body.  I couldn't believe that ipod was the best tech out there and I didn't want to be locked into itunes or any other proprietary systems.  That said, I got the A2 with the specific intention of 1) listening to mp3s through my cars stereo and my home stereo and 2) watching shows while doing cardiovascular exercise.  For both of these things, the A2 has been a huge success.  Not only can I watch episodes of South Park while on a bike or an elliptical machine (and I assume running, as well, but my knees forbid it), but if I want, I can switch over to FM where it autoscans the entire FM band in about 10 seconds and picks up all the TVs that are in the gym.  If I'm still not amused, I have my entire music collection.  Not that this is at all a reason to get the A2, but you certainly will feel the ipod envy at the gym from others around you.  I haven't used it for weight training yet (as in, listening to music while weight training), but I don't see this as being a problem as long as you have pockets.  You do pay a price for the 4 inch screen and long battery life - the price is size. [...] - it includes some side by side pics of the A2 with other popular devices (ipod, for example).  The size is not a problem for me but it's something you should, of course, keep in mind before making a purchase.  Outside of the gym, the device has performed excellently.  It's interaction with my PC is simple - just like any other plug and play device, so no proprietary programs.  I haven't even installed the stuff that came with the device as I haven't yet needed it.    The sound quality of the A2 is superb in my car stereo or with headphones and I have also used it to watch shows or movies through the AV out on my TV at home - the picture is great.  Battery life has not been a problem (and I don't think it will be).  [...]  Update: Used it as a VCR last night to record The Office - worked great.  Quality is about the same as a VHS tape when you replay it on your TV, but for purposes of recording shows and watching them at your convenience, it's plenty good enough for me.

<Title>most fun toy ever!
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my A2 for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I've been using a dell DJ almost 3 years now and was ready for something a little more robust. After lots of research, I settled on the A2 and it didn't disappoint. The video quality is excellent. I can keep myself amused with hours of everything from Friends to Harry Potter while logging mile upon mile on the treadmill (the battery life is excellent). Transferring files from the computer to the A2 couldn't be easier. No software required. The joystick is still taking some getting used to, but it's a small price to pay for this little gem. The external speakers are decent if you're in a quiet room, otherwise headphones are definitely required.

<Title>1 year and counting...
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well after more than a year of using my A2, I still love it very much. I use it everyday at work where I listen to music at my desk (battery life still nearly 17 hours audio only). I travel frequently and love how it works so well playing music through car stereo or into headphone for the airplane. The hard drive is handy for moving files off the camera, as well as for when I can't seem to find my USB drive. I enjoy the oohs and ahhs from coworkers and pilots walking by when they see my own background image up, or a series of music videos or a movie rolling. The connectivity is simple and no programs are required since it shows up like an additional hard drive. I even formatted it and loaded the menus from scratch without any trouble. Very easy to use regardless of the gadget factor. I love recording my DVDs for the road, as well as my favorite tv shows, with no quality problems. Video playback is always smooth and all audio file sound as if I were listening to them at my home computer. The protective cover leaves the ports and buttons open for easy access and makes a great handle or stand. Don't worry about drops or knocking it over, usually turn off, and on again, plays just fine (even dropped from about 4.5ft up while on and playing video!). I bought my dad a Creative Zen portable media center, and he still can't keep his hands off my A2. Even my completely technically challened girlfriend loves playing with it while we drive.

<Title>stop doing research this is the one....no doubt
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>after 2 weeks looking at every word written on the portable media players out there the COWON A2 is the most bang for the buck. I LOVE IT. this is the coolest little thing any media junkie could want. i have my favorite movies, music,pictures,auido books...etc right in my hands, my car..everywhere i go. this is hands down an ipod killer. there is other players out there with similar features..namely the ARCHOS line of products..the cowon in my opinion is made better...has cooler features and is more versitile than the archos line.ive had no problems at all with this machine.it performs all tasks with no problem..the firmware update is great and super easy to do.the jet shell software is great and very usefull for working with your files. if there was anything to say it would be that out of 1000 possible corrupted files maybe 1 or 2 agrivates the cowon(it may freeze) and you have to shut it off an put it back on, which in the big picture of electronics is pretty expectable.i bought the arkon car mount for it and now i have mobile video for those long trips or snail crawl traffic days. for the car i figured it would be great to get a bunch of music videos since you cant really watch a movie and drive this is a great option. anyone that see's this thing is amazed by it. most people think all there is are ipods or rip offs of ipods out there.boy are they wrong. also i was worried that if i bought this somthing better would come out soon and make this look elementry,but this is not the case.its so far ahead that it will usable for years.its all you need. if somthing else comes out you wont worry because your already happy with your a2. besides look at all the poor ipod sheep...baaaaaa. make way for the lion called cowon

<Title>Video iPods bow before the a2...
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did all the research and this is by far the best PMP out there.  Pros -Excellent screen with high resolution and wide viewing angle -Plays tons of different video formats -Extremely good battery life -Neat video output.  Plenty of times I've been over at friends house at whipped out the A2, plugged the component cables into the TV, and watched movies. -16:9 widescreen is a MUST for movies.  On 4:3 PMP screens you actually lose alot of screen because so many movies are in letterbox format.  But with the A2 every ounce of the screen is put to use. -Tons of extras  Oks: -Some think that 30gb is too small, however I find it quite satisfactory.  Of course you can't put EVERYTING you own on it, but do you really need to do that.   Put a movie on the A2, watch, then replace it with another.  Cons: With the included pleather case (which is nice and protects the screen) attached its a bit bulky...but it cannot helped because of the screen size.  Its still very portable though, especially during jacket weather.

<Title>Why would you want an Ipod?
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had very specific criteria when I was looking for my next MP3 player.  It had to have  1)at least a 29gb hard drive, 40GB preferred 2)no software necessary to transfer files, and no restrictions on transferring or playing files 3)video capability without a complicated encoding program 4)built in microphone  For these features, I was willing to pay up to about $400.  My Cowon A2 cost about $270 and met all my expectations.  You don't need to install iTunes, or any other crummy software- you just plug it into any computer with a USB 2.0 port and treat it like a hard drive.  You can put anything you want on there, and hook it up whenever you need it without any software.  The screen is excellent for watching short videos, and it has speakers so you can show other people without needing to pass headphones around.  Even better, it has TV out through a standard a/v cable (like you use with a camcorder to a tv) so you can show your videos on someone else's TV!  It even has a/v in so you can record into it.  I used the a/v in to set up a wireless surveillance system at work.  The battery life is excellent, navigation is easy and intuitive, and the case that comes with the A2 does a fine job of protecting it from scratches.  And ironically, even though I could care less about brand appeal or trendiness, everyone that sees this thing wants to know what it is, and when I show them what it can do, they're always surprised.  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  If you are a power user looking for a media player, you will not regret buying the Cowon A2.

<Title>Worst customer service ever!
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I wish I had done a little more testing of this unit before the 30 day Amazon return period was up. Tried it out and was very satisfied with the picture quality and sound through the demos. After owning it for about 5 weeks, finally loaded music on it and took a road bike trip for about 4 hours. Battery died at 3.5 hours. Fully charged it up and tried again, this time dead in an hour. Charged again and did a test playing only music, made it about 10 hours this time. Haven't found anyone else in the reviews who has had this problem. The spec says 18 hours of audio and this is due to the larger battery. Never tried the video. Tried contacting CowonAmerica through email, phone and signing up for their online help site. They have to verify your email address before you can enter the site. Got a email verification back and tried to logon, no luck, said email address was not verified even though the email I received from them said it was. I was not willing to take the risk of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE for a device I paid over 300.00 for. I loved the A2 when it worked, easy to load music, great sound, and the video demo was crystal clear. Sent it back to Amazon for a partial refund and will probably buy an Archos, as I was able to contact their service department by phone in about 30 seconds. Great machine bummer service.

<Title>An Awesome Personal Video Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Because I hate boredom when I travel, and I have a lot of digital media, I decided to look for a personal video player. Through a lot of searching, I stumbled onto the Cowon A2. While I had never heard of the company before, its screen size, build quality, video support, long battery life, and positive reviews all convinced me to try it out. Here's what I've discovered:  Pros -- Excellent video quality -- Plays XVID/DVIX files up to 720p -- Awesome sound quality; comes with BBE sound processing (which is really cool) -- Nearly 10 hour battery life when watching videos; even more when just listening to audio -- Comes with a radio -- Can act as a host for other devices (MP3 player, camera, etc.) -- Build quality is very good -- Supplied power adapter is 110V - 220V, despite the fact that the plug says that it is only 110V -- Unit allows you to start watching your videos where you left off if you open files from the "Recent Files" section of the menu  Cons -- GUI is okay; it isn't as intuitive or fast as I'd like -- Joystick's center button isn't easy to press; but after some practice, you get better at it -- Volume can take a couple of seconds to react to your input when you are watching videos -- Fast forward and rewind is non-linear and can quickly zip to the very end or beginning of a video file (respectively); stopping exactly where you want to takes some practice and intuition -- Not great for MP3s; the audio quality and interface are excellent, but the player itself isn't the most convenient way to move through your music without looking at it -- At some point, a few small particles of dust will find their way under the display's glass screen; but this is only visible when display is viewed under direct sunlight -- Watching video in direct sunlight is next to impossible  Despite the cons, which are annoying, I truly love this player. On trips across the Atlantic I can watch movies for the entire 9 hour flight and still have some battery life left. Personally, I would only recommend this player to other people looking for a PVP (if you listen mostly to MP3s, then I would recommend a dedicated MP3 player). All the other video players either have poor battery life or require you to convert all of your XVID/DVIX files to their proprietary video standard, which takes time. So, with the Cowon A2, if you have a lot of XVID or DIVX videos you can simply place them on the hard drive and watch them. However, if you do come across a standard that isn't supported, Cowon does include a free video converter. All things considered, you shouldn't be upset with this player.

<Title>Excellent PMP, but relatively hard to find.
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item for my girlfriend for her birthday back in May and have used it a bit myself(mostly reading ebooks, but also the occasional tv show/movie). She loves the thing. She hooks it up to the TV using the supplied composite/RCA cables and watches/records shows. She brings it to work and listens to music, and store data on it. Since it supports so mnay codecs its great as a music player but it is quite bulky/heavy compared to an ipod, but, of course, it isn't marketed against the ipod/SSD based media players.  The screen quality is, to me, unreal. Best lcd screen I've ever seen. NO ghosting/artifacts, even during fast motion. Nice vivid colors, and even good contrast(for an lcd). Of course, glossy screen helps the colors stand out, but it can also increase glare, though I've not had that problem, even while riding in a car during daytime(in the passenger seat, of course!).  The speakers aren't terrible, but they can sound a bit tinny (though not as much as I had expected). Still, I've heard worse speakers on laptops, and you can always plugin the adequate, though uncomfortable, supplied earphones.  The thing that really surprised me, however, was the quality of the video-out. Truly excellent! I don't know if there is some upscaler included(though I seriously doubt it), but video comes out looking as good as broadcast(ditto on recording from the tv with it).  Now, while the video was excellent, the sound was disappointing. The tv-out jack has the three sections you would expect from a regular RCA connection(composite video, left &  right audio), but I swear the sound  that the tv output was monoaural, but not just that, it sounded like the actors were speaking from inside a large drum, with a sort of cavernous/echoey/tinny quality that's a bit hard to describe but results in sound that, to my ears, has greatly reduced dynamism/range.  Now, since I haven't used this as much as my gf her thoughts, or at least her complaints, what I can recall of them, would probably be useful. From my recollections, her only complaints are that it doesn't support pdf (this bugs me as well, since you have to convert ebooks to .txt format{i.e., basically no formatting] and you end up with words wrapped over two lines, and footnotes appearing in the middle of a page, etc.), and the hd/battery are not upgradable. Now the hd isn't really much of an issue since she's got many seasons of various shows on it, along with copious music files and books, not to mention the raw data she has on it(I believe she's got a few linux distros stored in it), and she still has many GB of space. The battery, thus far, hasn't been an issue but it's only been cycled, I'd estimate, maybe 100-150 times at most, so maybe in 2 or 3 more years it'll show some wear, but right now you can watch something for about 4-6 hours on a charge, and read a book for around twice as long (you can probably extend it if you turn down the brightness). She also loves the gui. She took to it immediately, and moves about it rapidly.  For my part, I'm not fond of the joystick/button. I find myself navigating the menus and accidently pressing down on the joystick and thereby activating a movie, opening a book, etc. Also, the joystick itself I find a bit slippery, as though my finger will slip off it and punch a hole in the screen (no, I'm not pressing THAT hard, but that is the image that comes to mind). A small mod could fix that bit, however.  Those few nitpicks aside, this is a great PMP, though I have little to compare it to(basically just laptops, and a few portable dvd players that my niece and nephews have), but when I was shopping around for a PMP the things that stood out to me regarding this unit over an Archos were: the fantastic number of codecs that are supported, the near constant firmware updates(I'm still waiting on that pdf update, dammit!), the relatively low price(at the time), and the user(NOT editor) reviews I'd found around the web.

The picture is very clear and colorful and the 30gb hard drive has proven to be more than enough. I use clonedvd to mobile to convert all my movies without any  compatability issues. Very simple drag and drop . I really enjoy the ability to record directly from the satellite with time recording. I would have given the unit 5 stars if the TV function would work in the US.

<Content>I was skeptical when I bought this that the battery life could possibly be as good as they say.  It is. I managed to have videos nearly the entirety of a flight to Hong Kong.  My only complaints are that it can't charge through USB while playing and the battery isn't removable. That means, you can't use an external battery to charge/power it once the internal one dies. But, considering the stellar batter life of the internal, that's not a big problem.

<Title>Such highs. Such lows.
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'll try to be frugal with my words, since I'm sure that most just want the pros and cons.  Pros: -Best codec support for portable device. -Excellent sound quality for portable. -Excellent display quality. -Larger HD than most. -Bundled JetAudio software is robust and great, when it works...  Cons: -Unit began locking up after only a few weeks, and upon reformatting and sending to Cowon, I was informed that they could not replicate the problem (which was odd, because it would happen several times daily when I listened to FLACs).  **I reformatted again, and have had it lock up only twice in the months since. -Somewhat bulky, but what can one expect, given HD and display size? -HD is larger than most, but not nearly large enough.  Unless I want to upload files 2-5 times per week, I'd prefer a minimum of 250 GB. -No WiFi. -Navigation is no picnic.  I don't mind the controls too much, but menu navigation is poorly designed, and menus display file names rather than tags, causing files with long names to be truncated in the menu. -Recent files list is not best method.  The player stores a list of your 10 most recent files played, bookmarked at the stop point.  What would be better is bookmarking the stop point of every file played. -Screen is impossible to view in daylight (but I've yet to see one that isn't) -JetAudio software crashes my PC 25% of the time that I use it (to the point that it requires reboot). -Line-out A/V quality leaves much to be desired.  Using headphone stereo output as line-out to receiver sounds better than the provided A/V output.

<Title>Best PMP in the World!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research of the best personal multimedia player. I considered buying Ipod, Creative Zen and Archos as great competitors of this Cowon A2. I got the 30gb. The reviews not only Amazon but also other website caught my attention. After a year of research,  I finally took the risk of buying something not even so popular in the public. This Cowon A2 PMP is the easiest little machine to maneuver even in recording videos, movies, transfering songs, files is a breeze; it is so easy! no extra software needed;  even a first grader can easily understand the set up of its buttons.  I did not even read the manual and I am not a technology person,  but when I received my Cowon A2, I started playing with it right away upon taking out of the box. Its button set up is very straight forward. The sound quality is amazing! I LOVE MY COWON A2 SO MUCH! It is not cheap, but I now understand why?  Although, I wish someday, they will make a Cowon with 100gb and has the ability to take digital still pictures as well. Highly recommended item! jd.

<Title>Slim, Compact and perhaps the Future of Portable Entertainment
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My daughter just saw my A2 for the first time, (she's 22) and BEGGED my to buy her one. So much for first impressions. The unit is small and sleek and easily transported in a pocket or purse. But let's begin with the manual. It's flawed, to say the least. It doesn't explain all the functions and fails to address several issues.       For example, it shows an item called a DMB and a tv logo. But this is for a Korean who wants to access a tv signal in Seoul. Since I'm in Arizona, that's a problem. The main function button allows things like fast forwarding of videos, yet this is not even mentioned. The manual type is very small and hard to read. The illustrations, likewise. But the player is pretty intuitive to use and playing with it for a while allows you to figure out most of the functions.       Now for the best parts. The screen is crisp and clear. Downloading  from a DVD player or the tv is easy. I can also copy a DVD to my computer and download using the USB to the A2. And I have a Mac, which they says won't work with the software. W-R-O-N-G! It works just fine with my iMac G4 without any special softwware. Downloading does take a while, but so what? You can move items into folders and rename them at will. I dumped the Korean subway maps that are included as photos and popped in my own photographs in the jpg format.       I also have a tip: download the manual in PDF from their website, convert it to a txt file, and move it into the text folder. Then you'll have it on the screen if needed. I figure you can load about 28 2-hour DVD movies and 500 mp3's, which are also a breeze to load. And still I have room for 100's of photos. The sound through the earphones is good and better with better earphones. I can't wait to take it  on airplane trips to avoid the in-flight movies and pick from dozens of my own, played on MY schedule.      A final word. It would have gotten 5 stars if not for the poor manual and tech support guy, who told me it wouldn't work on Macs and not to even try. I did a lot of research before choosing the A2 for it's size, price and features. I wasn't disappointed and if I ever am, a know a certain girl that will love to inherit it.

<Title>The Best Player EVER!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player at the end of last year, and I must say I was HIGHLY impressed.  I carried it EVERYWHERE I went and used it for EVERYTHING!!  Some of the many uses were: -Recording movies and shows from the TV -Holding my files for protable storage -Holding my many many many music files (sorted by artist and type...made easy by folder use) -Reading Dante's Inferno in TXT format -Showing off pictures if my kiddies!! -Watching Sponge Bob The Movie and Bambi using the built in speaker on the LONG trips to grandma's house -Blasting music while cleaning (bought some computer speakers for 20 bucks and WOW!!) -Uploading TV shows on YOUTUBE -Burning DVD's and putting them on the player to view...  Now you may ask why I said in the beginning that I WAS highly impressed...turns out some kids thought it was a PSP and stole it from my bag when I went to use the restroom one day...  I was very very very sad and upset...  But after having an IPOD video with it's awful battery life (this A2 can really really last!!) I cannot go back to ANYTHING else.  I will be buying another one...but this time a 30 GB instead of a 20.. ;-)  Oh and everything you need comes with it..unlike other products (cough cough IPOD)where you have to buy everything seperately...  A++++++++++!!!!

<Title>DOA Sorta - Tech support non-existant
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice picture. Lots of features. Long battery life (sorta, see below). Easy to use. Pushing down on the joystick to select items is a little hard. Sometimes the selecter would move to another item instead of selecting the item that I already had highlighted.  My boyfriend and I bought these for each other for Christmas. We went ahead and started playing with them when they arrived two days ago. They got here about 7pm. We charged them until the light went out which indicated that they were full. Then we upgraded them per the instructions provided. We loaded them up with video/movies. Watched about an 1.5 hours of shows. Shut off the device. In the morning it had 4/4 bars on the battery. I watched 2.5hrs of stuff. Battery was then at 2/4. Turned it off and set it down. Came back 2 hours later and it was dead. So it died in less than 24hrs.  After trying lots of stuff it is still a brick. I cannot reach tech support as their phone number gives you a recording that says use their website. I was never able to get anyone on the "Live Support Chat". I created a ticket on their site which hasn't been addressed yet.   I am very disappointed with this device and especially with their support. I do not like nor do I have time to sit at my computer for hours waiting for them to answer the live chat request. Atleast with phone support I can carry it around and do other things while I wait.  DOAs do happen. I understand that. Its the support you receive afterwards that counts when it does.

<Title>Exceded expectations
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked at a number of different players before settling on the Cowon, which I had never heard of before.  I had been looking for a way to "offload" shows from my Tivo, and this player works great.  I just record directly into the player, and then burn to CD.  The CD plays directly on my Philips DVD player.  I also download video podcasts off the net, then play them on the TV through the player, or just use the case as a stand, and watch them (or Tv shows) on my breaks at work.  I listen to podcasts most of the day, and the battery rarely goes down 1 "bar".  The screen is large and clear enough to "show off" anything I have recorded.  I live in the boondocks, so directly comparing was imposable, but I must say that this is the rare electronic item (other than my tivo) that was even better than I thought it might be. I also use Linux most of the time, and this player works well, playing all my OGG files. There are a few "cons".  The joystick is aggravating when you are pushing in, and end up nudging one way or the other.  It might be easier for a right hander.  But once you get used to it, it works.  Also, I have audio sync problems on some WMV files, Xvid and Divx work much better.  Be aware that it won't play .mov or .mp4 either.  Be sure to do the upgrades, and use the "recently played" as a great bookmark, especially when you listen to long podcasts.

<Title>Great System
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really used to like my Zen Vision M, but when i broke that, I decided to try the Cowon. It really is the best PMP out there. Well, the newer Cowon supposedly due out soon will probably be even better, as this one is a couple years old now, but even the A2 has been worth every penny to me.   Some of the things I've used the Cowon for:  1. Digitizing audio cassette tapes. 2. Recording lectures and notes for school. 3. Audio and Movies...works well, and comes with the cords to hook it up to the TV.  4. Recording Movies and TV shows-- very nice feature. pretty decent quality, too. 4. Storing pictures, and backing up photos I had on the computer. 5. Text feature is semi-useful, but PDF support would really have made this thing a dream machine.  The battery is amazing.   The navigation is ok, not great, and there is no problem working it with Linux, except for the conversion software, which doesn't work on Linux.  The control pad is sometimes a little difficult. It seems to select something you have to press it down from a little to the right. When I try to press it directly down, it usually goes back a screen instead of entering the selection.   Overall, awesome, and I've very happy with it.

<Title>Nearly perfect in every way
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In looking for the best media player, I had a very short trial of the Video iPod.  The screen was way too small.  Then I thought I had found a great player in the Archos 604 WiFi.  Much better, since I like to watch movies, but I decided to give this one a try.  After a few days, the Archos is going back to the store.  Here's why:  Screen:  The Archos screen is good, but not nearly as bright at the highest setting.  There's an anti-glare coating on the screen, which makes images much lower in contrast than the Cowon.  The Cowon screen must be seen to be believed.  It's better than my television.  The shiny surface of the screen can be a bit of a problem in bright light (seeing reflections), but that doesn't come up very often.  Sound: The Archos has decent sound, but it's not loud enough.  Turn the volume all the way up, and it's just barely acceptable (for me).  On a plane, forget it.  The Cowon sound blows away the Archos... there are many settings for sound enhancement, quality is noticably better, and the volume goes much higher.  Video: What bugged the heck out of me was that Archos wanted me to pay $20 for decoders for common video formats.  The Cowon plays everything I throw at it, for free.  And it comes with a cable that allows me to play videos to a TV.  On the Archos... yep, it costs extra.  Recording: If you want to record on the Archos, get set to pay extra for the necessary bulky accessory.  With the included cable on the Cowon A2, you can record off the TV... even set it to turn on and record something on your favorite channel, then turn itself off, just like a DVR.  Amazing!  I must say that this is THE most impressive electronic purchase I've ever made.  Passes the time at my kids' sports practices, and cool for lunch breaks at work.  When I travel, the battery lasts long enough for a cross-country flight.  The Archos died in a few short hours.

<Content>I am very happy with the Cowon A2. The picture is beautiful and the interface is easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the USB Host doesn't work with all USB devices. It will not recognize my HP camera or my Lexar Pen drive. I tried it with a ScanDisk Pen drive and it worked fine. It would be nice if the case that comes with the A2 also held all the wires and cables. Or a bag that holds both the A2 and the cables.

<Content>Cowon A2 with all its functions is really a piece of modern technology - no doubt about it. The quality of both audio and video is stunning. Recording and USB/host functions make it very useful in the sudden need of documenting something or downloading data from another device. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the leather case cannot be carried by the belt. I think, I will need to sew me another bigger pocket to my trousers - this PMP is simply too big for a standard one.

<Title>Dead Cow
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Cowon A2 a few months ago at Amazon for the purpose of viewing educational vidoes during the daily commute to/from work. Don't get me wrong, this player has the best overall features in its category, and performed superbly the first week. Then the bottom half of the display turned into semi-transparent lines.  Cowon's website was no help. A firmware upgrade didn't help.  Now today, less than 3 months after purchase, the unit died and will not reset.  My usage was less than 1 hour a day 5 days a week.  This is BS.  $360 down the drain.  I do NOT recommend this player.

<Title>Terrible -- Didn't work from the start
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I was really hoping to love this like so many others have.  I ordered it for a long trip to Asia, and looked forward to watching videos and listening to music during the 24 hours I'd be spending on a plane.   Unfortunately, the A2 was dead on arrival.  It turned on only to show a big red "X" over a picture of the unit.  It wouldn't connect with my computer, so a firmware update wasn't even possible.  I don't know if that was even the problem -- I'm thinking now that it was just shoddy construction, as I've seen a few posters both here and on Cnet complain that they received DOA units.  Not only that, but Cowon's support was a joke.  I was basically told "too bad -- return it to Amazon."  Wow, thanks.  But since it was -- at this point -- three days before I was going to leave the country, I couldn't send in the defective unit and get a new one in time.    I will definitely always hold it against Cowon that they screwed me out of having entertainment for my long journey.  I've now purchased an Archos and it works beautifully.  I highly recommend it, and I recommend you stay away from Cowon.

Coz of its flexibility and easy transfer system they have. The music quality is definitely better. Not to mention about their 4" display. Good companion for anyone who travels everyday on a train or bus.   Cons: A little bulky and so inconvinient to slip into ones pocket. But if you are carrying a backpack then hat shouldnt be an issue too.

<Title>Dissatisfied
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The unit is good looking and the LCD screen large clear and bright.  I bought this unit to record videos w/camera attached.  The toggle button used to navigate switches between icons easily but when you try and select one it jumps to another.  The same way it does when selecting folders.  When in record mode it fades out to a gray screen and turns to snow.  Several times when powering up the top of the screen would appear in the middle of the display and the top part would be fuzzy.  The most fustrating aspect was the customer service or lack of.  There is no working phone number to reach the company.  You can however submit a service ticket which is low priority and work in progress.  After 2 Months of no contact I finally gave up and returned the unit to Amazon which replaced it.  The new unit had all of the same faults plus a few more.  Returned to Amazon for refund.  If you are just going to use it for photos it is great if yo can get past the fustrating navagation process.

<Title>Do not waste your time with COWON
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this thing from Amazon - brand new. Arrived within 3 days and as soon as I try to use it - problem starts. First of all you cannot record anything from TV, cable or satellite box. Do not believe what you read in manual, it does not work. It does have nice display and plays most of the known video formats as soon as you copy files from your computer into gadget. My item works for almost 5 days and then just died on my hands from unknown reason. It just died. I could not turn it on anymore. All attempt to communicate with the tech support of COWON (JETAUDIO) turn out complete waste of time. All what they did waited until my time to return item will be out but lucky me I bought it with Amazon. Little push from Amazon and I got return merch authorization. I do not know yet if they going to charge me re-stocking fee but I already lost double shipping fee. First to get item and second to send it back. If it did not work brand new what will it do as used/refurbished????

<Title>It works perfectly
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this Cowon A2 (30GB) for a few months. I'm not going to really comment on the features, because those are easily accessible elsewhere. Suffice it to say that they're fantastic on paper, and it's not an Apple.  This product shines in the truth of its marketing claims. It does everything it should, with nary a problem! It doesn't freeze, crash, require reformatting, etc., as an older player I used to own did (the D-Link Roq-It 10GB... *shudder*). The latest firmware was preinstalled. All I had to do was plug it into my USB2.0 hub, and it worked. It's quite fast, actually running at USB2.0-like speeds. It would probably take around 45s or so to upload 1GB to it.  If you're wondering how this PVP does on streaming a video file to a television with the included AV cable, it's wonderful - I couldn't see any artifacts whatsoever. The video and audio were both smooth and clear, just like on the A2's built-in screen (only bigger and louder, of course).  The leather case is nice in most respects, but when the main flap and the side flap are open simultaneously (to see the screen and access the I/O ports), there's nothing holding the player securely in the case. You could just tilt the case forward and the player would slide right out.  I am so, so happy I bought this. Great design, fit and finish combine to make a PVP accurately rated as a top performer in nearly all categories at sites like [...] (who calls it "our favorite portable media player").

<Content>This product is awesome.  My wife bought it for me for Christmas and I have used it nearly every day since.  I have a long drive to work everyday so I copied some audio books on to the device and connected it to the AUX port on my car stereo.  They when I get to work I can pause where I was and power off the unit.  Then when it is time to go home I just pick the file off the resent items menu and it resumes where I left off.  This feature works for any file you open on the device and you can open almost any kind of media file, including txt document, all kinds of images and DIVX files (without converting, try doing that with your ipod video).  It hooks up to your TV to play media or record directly to the Cowon.  If you are a self respecting geek you need on of these devices.  I just wish if came in an 80 gig model.

<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a Cowon A2 after first buying the Archos 604 and realizing the Cowon can play back more types of files and has more features out-of-the-box, and even has the ability to play subtitles.  I had heard about the Cowon before buying the Archos, but hesitated to buy the Cowon because of the lack of name recognition.  That hesitation made me spend some extra $$ but got my gf a free Archos out of it(see my review of the Archos 604).  Anyway to get on with the review:  Pros: - Plays back every type of video file I have on my computer, regardless of format/codec/etc - Plays subtitles (smi only, not sub or srt) - Has FM radio - Includes all the cables you need to make use of all the features (video recording, playback to tv, etc) - Speakers are decent (better than archos) and there are 2 for stereo sound - Many sub-menu options for playback such as playback speed, selection of audio track or subtitle track, and frame capture - Carrying case is very nice.  You can just flip open and watch while the unit is still in the case, while the archos is more of a pouch that you have to take the unit completely out of to use. - Nice rounded design and white casing, compared to the industrial brushed silver look of the Archos (I like both, actually)  Cons: - I don't know how to turn off the radio w/o shutting down the unit! - Joystick is a little difficult to use sometimes.  I hit up instead of right, etc.  Might be a problem if you have fat fingers. - Does not have skip function (i.e., 20-30 seconds at a time), only fast forward - Some files I seem to get an error that the index is damaged or something and won't let me fast forward - As much as I like the case, flap hangs over the screen and you have to keep your finger on it to hold it out of the way. - No scheduler for TV recording.  Overall, I am very pleased with the Cowon A2.  For what it can do, I can overlook some of the design flaws.  Don't let the lack of name recognition keep you from buying this great portable media player.  To repeat what I said in my review of the Archos, the Cowon seems to be a slightly inferior unit, but that does not mean I would necessarily recommend the Archos over the Cowon.  If you just want a simple video player, or a more full-featured DVR, go with the Archos.  If you are more involved with digital video and think you have a little more technical savvy and know-how, go with the Cowon. After having used both, if I were given a choice between the two, I think it would honestly be a flip of the coin.

<Title>I love this thing !!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the cowon A2 last year (2005) for Christmas. And it was the best gift ever. Originally I got the Archos but as i looked through the book i realized what a hassle it was going to be to get video content and i sent it back. I'm so glad i did.  Simple and stylish with a fantastic screen and a beautiful leather case. You can plug this pmp player into any TV or stereo or dock that uses a standard mini-plug or RCA cables. You don't need to buy a special dvr station to record, just plug it in. The battery has a long life and if you run low just plug it in. Best thing for me is the variety of file formats it plays, and mainly xvid because online xvid seems to be king, its a high quality video format. If it won't play a particular file the included software will convert it. When i Play music through a stereo with it, the sound quality is better than my wife's ipod. I love it.....I take it everywhere with me. Music, books on tape, movies, TV, i've even made mp3s' of some of my favorite vinyl albums, slide shows of the kids. The people who have developed this did a great job and instead of trying to restrict access, limit content, or proprietize it they a have and continue to, with firmware updates, expand access and usability. There is no better pmp or mp3 player.  After a year of use there are only two cons i can think of; the radio reception is sketchy, out in the country where i live practically nonexsistant and you always need the ear buds for antenea, also they should really develop a wireless remote attachment.  But those are small compared to the pros. I love this thing !!!   Oh and i don't know what A. Nemets problem was i have recorded both from TV and a cable box (digital cable box) with no problem.  Reading the other reviews though i'm glad i have not needed support, but luckily in the year i've owned mine i have had no problems with it.

I have downloaded my most enjoyed mp3s of my collection and have taken to downloading and converting YouTube music videos of artists I enjoy (30gb is beginning to seem small).   I use it while waiting for appointments and other alone times. The screen is excellent but the controls do take some getting use to. I like the flexibility of the operating system though I suppose support for searching by ID3 tags would be nice. Have not tried recording from a video source yet but probably will in the future.

<Content>I really love having this portable media player. I first read many reviews about this PMP before making my purchase. The video playback is crisp and sharp. I especially like taking it to appointments where sitting and waiting is involved. The software easily converts the different movie files. I had to upgrade the system and by following the instructions at the Cowon website, I was ready to upload stuff in 10 minutes. I did buy the remote control and it's not that useful. My only complaint is when I want to stop movie/radio or music I have to switch to another icon and make another selection.  Overall, I do love having this gadget. Some people ask me if I can make phone calls with it...I wish. Wireless remote and wireless headset would be great. I might add that with the remote you can skip to the next song or movie. I had my Cowon since November and have not experienced any malfunctions.

<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The A2 did not disappoint at all from the day I opened the box.  Already loaded, I have 3-4 movies, about 100 music videos, 20 albums in mp3, 3 books in txt format, and in total have used maybe 30% of the hard drive so far.  The video formats I use are .wmv, divx, xvid.  My favorite part?  When I'm watching a video, I can finetune the LCD brightness depending on how dark or light the room is.  I can pan/zoom in and out of the picture, set the aspect ratio, increase contrast, etc.  This little player has more tweaking functions than my living room tv.  Now let's talk about the DVR functions. The A2 comes with every cable imaginable, and to record off the tv, I just plug it in and hit record.  That's it.  No extra kit to buy.  Same with audio.  I plugged an old cassette player into it and recorded the music with the punch of a button.  I read that the DVR is programmable, but honestly, I could never leave this player at home.  Last thing: I kept reading about how the joystick button is a problem. Yes, it's sensitive, but you get used to it and it absolutely should not prevent anyone from purchasing this masterpiece. By the way, the leather case operates as a kickstand so your player can stand up at an angle on a table while you're watching.

<Title>This is it!  The gadget of all gadgets.
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received my Cowon A2 a couple days ago.  I've loaded up a ton of my favorite shows already, and they look fabulous.  Haven't tried all the features yet, but so far this is what I have found.  PROS The 30gb capacity is great and I would recommend nothing less.  The size is perfect for carrying around, being about the size of a 2.5" harddrive enclousure, but a bit thicker.  It fits very easily in the hands and is not difficult or uncomfortable to hold.  The case is a nice, tough leather-like material that should keep it well protected.  It can be folded back when using the Cowon into some form of stand structure.  The menu is fairly easy to get used to, and relies on an tiny though simple joystick to move up and down the file folders.  Vids look awesome on this thing.  Very nice.  MP3s sound great, even without the headphones.  Text documents look nice with a white background that resembles paper.  CONS The interface is easy enough to use, though it is less than obvious how to stop a vid or mp3 currently playing.  Vid keeps playing even if menu is activated and I am still not sure how to stop it without starting something else or shutting the device off... a minor problem really. Also, really high resolution vids may not play without converting them.  I tried some HD vids and the device politely refuses to play them.  Though slightly lower res HD vids played without any problems at all.  So you probably won't have any problems unless you are a tweak-head that likes to push everything to the absolute limit.  For the other 99% of us this shouldn't be a problem at all.     Love this little box.  It's the only way to go.

<Title>Pretty disappointed
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really wanted to like this product after reading the positive reviews found on Amazon, but to me the Cowon A2 left much to be desired.  I've been looking into purchasing a PVP for a long time but I've held out because I was waiting for the one that had all the features that I wanted namely:  -An excellent music player -A player with recording capabilities built in -An Intuitive user interface -Excellent screen quality  The Cowon A2 achieved 1 out of 4.    Music quality is great on the Cowon, BUT, when I transferred songs over from my PC, there was a hiccup at the beginning of EVERY song.  Also, this device is not Play for Sure compatible, which was not a deal breaker for me. It would have been a nice feature to have, however, and I'm sure it will be a deal breaker for those who are suscribed to music services like Napster.  The built in recording capabilities of the A2 were also subpar.  Although they advertise they have a high quality mic built-in to the device, recordings tended to sound scratchy when played back.  Recordings from a TV source were decent, but there are other devices like the Archos 604 that have the ability to record with s-video, and component cables, which I'm sure make a huge difference in the quality of the recording itself.  Navigating the A2 was a nightmare for me as most of it is controlled by the annoying little thumbstick.  In order to make a selection, you have to click in the thumbstick.  Most of the time I somehow ended up backing out.  There's a trick to it and you might eventually get it but it was still very annoying to me.  The one place that the A2 shined for me was in screen quality.  Videos that were transferred from my PC, (not recorded from a TV source), looked awesome.  Unfortunately, the very same video had horrific audio playback on the device.  Although there was no problem with playback from my PC, the audio when playing the video on the Cowon constantly skipped, and for all intents and purposes, ruins the video.  If you are planning on purchasing a PVP, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I personally think the Archos 604 would probably be better, but reading reviews on that product suggest music playback quality on that device is not that great.  So that would leave the Creative Zen Vision W, but THAT device does not have direct line-in recording... Sigh, I guess I'll have to wait a little longer for the perfect PVP.

<Title>major power problem!! 
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This machine is great and convenient when it is ON.  Mine had a power problem from the time I got it. I thought I could fix it with some firmware updates and stuff, but I couldn't. When I found out from online that it wasn't just me having this issue, I decided to return it. Other than power problem, I really loved it. If I find a machine that works the same as this and doesn't have any power problem, I would definitely buy it.

<Title>Great Color
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first Cowon A2 arrived DOA so I returned it for another which has worked flawlessly since. Although some people have complained about navigation with the navigation "stick", I think it works great and like it a lot better than some of the units that use a lot of buttons! The Cowon A2 recognized both my   camera and my card reader so I can download my photos either way. I've loaded movies to it and they play very well. If the battery wears out you have to send it in(bummer). I've plugged in small CD player speakers into it and the sound is much better than the built in ones. The case it comes with is neat and it is great that it can be used to hold the A2 on a desk at the proper viewing angle! The colorful screen is just beyond compare. You've got to see it youself. It's a great buy.

<Title>Solid, value for money
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The A2 is a powerful player. It's intuitive to use and in my opinion, when compared to the archos is great value for money.   My only complaint (and it's not a small one) is in using the navigator dial. To drive the device, you push a joystick type lever around and depress to select. I want to say that 30% of the time I "miss"; navigating up/down and selecting at once resulting in the wrong selection. This is especially the case when I'm not straight over the player. Good luck to you if like me you fly economy class long haul. Incredibly frustrating..   But even in retrospect, it's a mighty player that's great value for money. Would recommend.

<Title>Heart breaking
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first one of these I got from Amazon. It worked great for almost a week. One day it was just dead, no light, no life when connected to the power adaptor, no response over USB.  Amazon were good enough to provide a complete refund - since they didn't have any more in stock.  So I bought a replacement directly from Jet Audio. This one worked for two days before a pattern appeared on the screen - it was part of the displayed image; only visible when the unit was turned on. It was far too big to ignore and, in fact, obscured the controls.  I duly got an RMA and returned it to Jet Audio. They are claiming the fault was due to damage. Indeed, they claim there is physical damage to the case itself. They sent a very blurry photo but even then it was obviously different to the fault that I sent it in with. A third of the screen was completely white on the unit in the photo.  At this stage they won't repair it until I pay $125. I'm just feeling like I'm being cheated and blackmailed. If I pay them off, I have no idea whether I'm going to get something that lasts more than a week anyway...  Any recommendations on the next best alternative player?

It's been over a month now but I have no complains yet.  There is one thing I want to see from Cowon though.  I referred this to so many friends and they all bought one.  At least sold 8 of them so far.  I wonder if Cowon will give me some $$ for advertising...

<Content>My unit was working fine until about 6 months. There is definitely a power issue. It would just run out of juice even though it was turned off. Then I would hear the harddrive running but there was nothing on the LCD. Cowon has not been responsive so I would have to say do not buy this product. I got sick of Ipods too but this is not a better alternative. Not good. 380 bucks out the window. Plus its too big. Who wants to carry something that heavy and big anyway?

<Title>Cowon A2
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The A2 works as advertised.  The picture is good and it is easy to upload songs video just about anything because your computer sees it as another harddrive.  You can rename files move files delete or add the same as you would to a portable harddrive.  The best thing is that it can record from the TV, radio or even from the output of an old tape drive.  The TV is simple to record I've used it directly off of my cable box the picture is good not great but good enough to watch without straining your eyes.  the only complaint so far is that the internal speaker is bad, really bad distorted and tinny, you can hear good enough but you won't be listening to music on it.

<Title>Outstanding Product - Best in Class
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is by far the best mp3 player I have owned or otherwise experienced.  The sound quality is second to none, and is fantastic with higher end headphones (I happily use the Ultimate Ears Super-Fi 5 Pro).  I previously owned the Creative Zen Vision M and several flash players and this was a significant upgrade.  I ruled out the iPod, Zune, and others because of a lack of Divx support.  I ruled out the Zen Vision W because the sound quality was significantly worse.  Pros: Unparalleled sound quality, Divx compatibility, excellent battery life, very easy to use (my non-techie wife who hates most mp3 players loves it), good size (not much bigger than the Zen Vision M), nice included case, easy to transfer files (functions as a portable hard drive), can display documents, FLAC support, radio included, great sound effects features (BBE/custom EQ/etc), excellent screen.  Cons: Processor could be faster, battery is not removable. Locks up once in a while, limited to 30GB (which can fill up fast).  All of the following are minor.    My uses: I use this primarily as an mp3 player (65%) and to replay video (30%), and as a radio (5%).   All of those functions work well.  I have not used it as a recorder.  Conclusion: if you travel significantly and want a great media companion then this is your product.  Easy to use, amazing audio and video quality, and hassle free.  At present, I cannot think of an "upgrade" to this that's available on the market (and I love to upgrade).  Not the smallest mp3 player, but really not much bigger than most full size players (I think the minor size difference is worth it - it still easily fits in a pocket).

<Content>Looked for a portable media player for quite some time and finally decided on the A2. Product arrived in a timely manner & in good condition. Went thru all the functions easily enough and am satisfied with the unit. Nice and portable, not overly heavy, lots of memory, couple of things though. 1) If a stereo plug is plugged into the av input jack plug all the way it will not record correctly. 2) When recording using video recording timer function the date is reversed when setting it up. Caused 2007/04/07 to record on 07/04/07. If you can overcome these minor problems then this is the way to go.

<Title>A2 Has Some Significant Music-Playback Deficiencies 
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have found my Cowan A2 to be an excellent portable video device, but I'm disappointed with some significant deficiencies it has when it comes to playing music.  First, the A2 does not recognize playlists in the .M3U or .PLS format (or any other)-- the playlist functionality is limited to creating an "on the go" playlist on the device, which cannot be saved after a power off.  Second, the A2 "reads" ID3 tags, but does not allow the user to browse music on the device based on the tags-- e.g., you cannot search or play songs based on "artist"  or "genre" etc.  Music on the device is organized strictly on a folder-tree system.    I recommend the Cowan A2 if you are primarily looking for a video device.  However, if music-playback functionality is an equally important factor for you in choosing a media player, the Cowan A2's lack of these key features probably makes it the wrong choice.

<Title>JetAudio products are great
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The A2 not only plays mp3's but also ogg, wav, wma and frac formats (way to go), but I belieave they can do a lot better. I mean if they wanted they could crush Ipod if only they get out all the potential of their products (like more functions) and make an effort to go multi OS compatible at software level. Also they should do something about their poor manuals and support page. I admit it's easy to follow in practice but it would be nice to have all the in and outs of the A2 on the website (to avoid killing trees). Maybe a forum?  I bought the A2 cause it was recommended by RedHat as being a great multi-format media player and at this JetAudio delivers, as well as having a friendly Graphical User Interface. I did have some problems with recording from the TV (picture freeze) but still can't say if this was a TV problem or an A2 problem and I haven't had time to play more with it.  So my summary on the Cowon A2 is: Do I recommend it? Yes. Can JetAudio do better? Absolutely.  Oh, BTW. Thumbs up on the communication compatibility with their other players.

<Title>Compare to others, then buy this !
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. The things that sold me on it were :         1. Battery life.         2. It's got a voice recorder & encodes direct to MP3         3. I love the fact that it's "folder view" , all my music on my PC is   organized by Artist then Album anyway, so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.Which leads to.................         4. Just copy mp3's & avi's on there like a removable USB drive.         5. A/V out to TV is cool.         6. A/V in to record video is a nice extra.  So far it's played every avi i've thrown at it.  I've got 15GB of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot I use the a2 mostly when driving. I got a nice FM transmitter that powers off the cig socket, sound quality is pretty good. Only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car ! I also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !) Mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade. I'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.

<Title>Excellent performance, build, and quality
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did some research between the Archos, Creative Zen Vision, and this A2 before I bought it. First things first, the Archos has some glowing reviews, and I've got no hatred against it, other than the subpar battery life (ofcourse, they offer a replacable battery). The Zen is slightly lacking in display quality behind the Archos and Cowon, but their audio quality is superb.   Which brings us to the Cowon: the main reason i bought this over the Archos was a) better battery life (though it's not replacable) b) extensive file type support and firmware upgrades (definitely good because they can always add future releases for better performance and new file types), c) it's cheaper than the archos, and d) it runs on linux.   Out of the box, they give you EVERYTHING. The cables are there for plugging into your tv, to use as a usb host, and ofcourse, the main USB interface cable. They include a quality case, and a little wrist band to hold on to the player (very useful). AC adaptor also included. the headphones are bass heavy, loud, and very clear considering they're standard inserts. i'm personally buying a more expensive pair, because i ride the train to work and need some decent noise canceling. you don't need to buy a separate pair of headphones if you're using the unit in a normal, not very loud, operating environment.   that brings us to the player itself. the interface is very clean, and support for all different video and audio file types is extensive. the picture quality is superb, to say the least. the playlist feature is great, and the joystick functionality is different than the archos, but still very good, especially if you're used to that kind of thing. best of all, battery life is fantastic. i get about 7 hours of video plus an additional 1-2 hours of audio in before it decides to die. this is FAR better than the archos.   sound quality is also great, really depends on your file type and how well the file is encoded. i watch some good quality recordings which really come to life on this thing.   recording quality is decent too. i've converted some old VHS cassettes to divx with the unit, and it does the job very well.   all in all, if you are looking for a great player with a decent price tag, and one that has all the bells and whistles included, this is the unit to go with.

<Content>I chose to purchase the Cowon A2 after a great deal of research.  And I must say that I am very happy with the A2.  It plays just about everything.  The sound and video quality are excellent.  I have loaded 7 full length movies, about 1000 photographs, classical literature and poetry(in txt), and about 150 albums worth of music.  I love that I now have some very delicate recordings from cassette and l.p. saved electronically.  While joystick use and navigating took some getting used to, it is now a breeze.  I sort my music by Genre, Artist, then Album, so the folder tree system is fine. I also have folders for individual tracks. The software interface is also a breeze to use.  Creating new files or sub-folders, re-naming or moving files around is a snap.  The A2 does not save "on-the-go" play-lists, but I've created a few as folders of their own for weekend road-trips.  I use the A2 everywhere...home, work and car.  The case is very nice and functions as a stand, but it needs to be open when recording or manipulating files so the unit is not secure during that period of time.  I recommend a "zcover".  Overall, I love the Cowon A2 and I highly recommend it.
