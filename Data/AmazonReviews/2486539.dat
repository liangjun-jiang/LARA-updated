<Title>Almost 5 stars, but the volume is too low!
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice improvement from the 604.  The higher resolution is much nicer for web browsing.  It also makes my pictures and videos look so much nicer!  The web browser works great and I love how it can do flash.  The only issue I have is the low volume.  MP3's are not to bad, but I can turn the volume all the way up with headphones on and it's just at a medium sound level (not loud at all).  Any movie ripped with 5.1 is terrible with headphones.  With the volume all the way up it is still soft and hard to hear.  The build in speaker is a little louder on this compared to the 604, but I just wish the headphone output was louder.  I was able to rip a movie with an MP3 soundtrack and increase the volume by about 200%.  This made a huge difference and it is now at least listenable.  I am guessing you need the docking station and have your 605 connected via SPDIF for the 5.1 sound to work.  Update 09/19/2007: Well I had originally purchased a 604, but it was defective and I returned it for a 605.  I only had the 604 for 2 days before I returned it, but I purchased the cinema plugin for it.  I called Archo's sales and they said they could refund the charge if I purchased the plugin for my new Archo's, which I did.  They even sent me an email confirming the refund.  After about 2 weeks I never saw the credit.  I called them today and they told me that it was a mistake and they could not refund me the 19.99.  I told them about the email and she said she already saw it, but told me too bad!  I was really shocked and will dispute the charge with Visa.  Still very poor customer support.  I still love the new Archo's, but that was really poor customer service.  Chad

<Title>Well worth the purchase if you buy the DVR station as well:
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605wifi is, for the most part, a great product. The interface is easy to work around in, and its out of the box capabilities are decent. Moving files to and from the hard drive, while not as easy as say an iPod, is a lot more of an open ended system that doesn't attempt to protect you from yourself in terms of locking the player to a certain computer. What you have here is a portable hard drive that lets you view your pdfs, movies and photos as well as listen to your music. It does each of these tasks efficiently and really begins to prove its worth when you take it on longer trips. Out of the box it also comes with a good file management system that allows you to delete files directly through the system menu, which allows you to make space while you are on the go and don't necessarily have a computer handy. This defiantly proves worthwhile when you access the expanding Content Portal and want to download a movie while you are on the move, but don't have enough hard drive space to support it. When you are around PC's networked wirelessly and have access to them, the 605 also allows you to stream audio and video directly from them, as well as download new files.  Now... to be honest, while those features are all nice, after I was done playing with them I never felt like they justified the price of the player as a package.  This is where the plugins come in. Most people will likely drop the $29.99 for the Opera browser, which is steep, but again is nice to have. The browser is quick and easy to use, and works better then most portable web browsers I have worked with. If you have used an iPhone, it is very comparable to how Safari works on it, which is defiantly a good thing.   The player only truly ever justifies its purchase though, when you connect it to the DVR station, which is bought separately. In any home theater system, this is a godsend of a budget component. The dock outputs to your TV and accepts inputs from many devices (in my case a cable box). What's nice about this is that you can use the combination as a more open ended Apple TV system that allows you to use all the wireless streaming video/audio/picture capabilities of the system, while having it connected to the TV. This saves a lot of hassle, say if you have a divx file you want to watch on your computer and do not want to go through the process of burning and converting it to something your DVD player would accept. With this system, you just connect to the network, navigate to the folder on your computer where the file is, and viola, it streams to your TV!   For those who don't own a DVR or want to make their recordings more mobile, the DVR station when connected to the Archos also accepts schedules of your cable programs from a list that is updated by Archos, and allows you to record from the TV either automatically or manually. You then have a mobile version of your favorite show that can either be moved to your computer, or watched like one would any DVR/Tivo program, with all the pause, forward and rewind features to get rid of those pesky adverts.   The Archos certainly has its faults though. Without the DVR station the battery takes forever (no joke) to fully charge. Furthermore, not all the features have been implemented yet, the content portal is slow to get the new suppliers, the widgets system is nonexistent as of writing this review, and current accessories are virtually barren aside from a helmet camera (that lets you record what you see while on the move), the DVR and some batteries. Even the official cases for the generation 5 line aren't released yet, leaving all current owners limited to using either the only supplier on the market (over priced and generally not a great case) or protecting their Archos with the factory supplied case which is quite possibly one of the most unpractical cases the company could have made. Finally it doesn't have the fun gimicky ease of use an iPod touch would have. It's bulky, thanks to the hard drive, and the buttons on the side (while very useful) don't do anything to help the 605's dire need for a little sex appeal.

<Title>great player but stupid power option
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing player..with the opera plugin you tube vids look amazing.. my only grip is the included accessories..there is  only a usb cord to connect to the computer..and this takers HOURS.. to charge the battery!  why a company would supply only this power source in the box is unbelievable to me..it makes the device virtually unusable without an accessory.. i can see charging exrea for plug ins but not basic power supply!  i would give it 5 stars without the power issue

<Title>Writing from this device
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far, so good. I'm writing this from my Archos 605, sitting in my living room.  So far I've only been testing the web browser which I bought as soon as I got this running.  The fact that I can write this right  on the device is pretty cool.  The screen resolution is awesome.  I'll write more later from the PC but so far I love it!   Ok.  It's been a couple of weeks - and I still love this thing.  Sitting in my easy chair writing this update from the 605 on my WiFi.  By far the greatest thing is the screen.  At 800 pixels wide, you can see a full-width webpage - everything is perfectly legible.  You can zoom in with a double-tap on the screen, but I mostly find that unnecessary.  NYTimes, Google News, etc. - all look great.  I was messing around with a colleague's iPhone the other day.  The Archos screen kicks its butt.  Pictures and movies look great.  Music is cool - support for cover art, etc.   Sound?  My only major complaint.  It's way too quiet.  Even with my noise-reducing headphones on - I had a very difficult time hearing soft dialogue on video playback on an airplane.  At home I can turn it up to full volume without hurting my ears at all - it's not even uncomfortable.  As far as I can tell, there's nothing you can do to make it louder.  It's one of the few disappointments I have had.  What else?  I'll write more from a computer later this week.  Although it's perfectly functional, it's still a pain to use this virtual keyboard.  Still 4 out of 5 - I'd give it 4.5 if I could.

<Title>It was totally perfect just at first...
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If it didn't break suddenly, I highly recommend this product.  Inexpensive, beautiful display, clear sound, fancy functions...  However, after 2 days, suddenly it broke... I couldn't believe it... I was just putting it on the desk and listening to my favorite music. I also used it really carefully because usually touch-panel products are so sensitive. However, it broke. If you don't want to waste your money, don't buy it.

<Title>Does not work properly with Motorola cable boxes
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two of the 605 30gb and the dvr recorder.  They work great except if you wish to use the dvr recorder in combination with a motorola cable box - then the dvr does not work as described.  This is a known problem discussed on other sites.

<Title>great product!!
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did alot of research before buying this and after several weeks bought the 605 30gb. I am happy with my purchase, but I would like to say that there are a few things you will need to realize before you buy this #1 I was confused about if this thing had a SD slot and it doesn't which was my own fault I didn't read the description better (the smaller one I think its like a 10gb not sure is the only one that has the SD slot #2 I bought mine to take on tripos and watch movies on and it works great (excellent picture and quailty) and after buying all the extra plug-ins was able to surf the web (now let me say this aint no laptop so if your buying exspecting the same speed as a laptop better save your money and buy one but if you are just looking to check your mail do alittle surffing and be able to slide it into your pocket after you got the best) #3 I would like to say that the customer sewrvice really SUCKS, and for the money you have to spend on this it seems like they would treat the customer better. #4My only real complaint with my 605 is thatthe battery is awful and since it isnt replacable that makes it a major problem (mine only last maybe 4-6 hours) I have to say I thought I might have made a mistake buying a 30gb but I have alot of music on mine and keep maybe 4-5 movies on at alll times but could easly have 30 if I wanted I just erase them after I get through and load on a new onefrom my desktop which is really easy (and I aint the most computer friendly person in the world). Oh one more thing the speakers?!?!?! Weeelllll lets just say it aint no bose sound system it is what it is a personal player and with the includede earbuds it works great but if you are going to trey and use it as a sterio you wont be happy unless you get that thing archs has you can set the unit into and plug up to that has built in speakers, my next purchase is gonna be a DVR staion I am waiting a few months for the new to ware off so I can get a refurbished or atleast alittle better price.Good luck with your decission and I hope I helped you alittle ans sorry about the misspelled words.

<Title>Good look and feel BUT web app and some other plugins cost extra!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player, had it for a week and returned it. I bought a charging kit from Gomadic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010ELOM8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-0542713-0191925">Car / Auto and Wall / AC Essential Charger Kit w/ Tip Exchange for the Archos 605 - Gomadic Brand</a>  Everything worked well and I was excited to try the browser.  When I selected the browser a window popped up saying that this "plug-in" needed ... which costs an extra $30 ... Doh!    Next I tried to use the MP3 player, which is where this device lacks the most. Get this, you have to load a playlist.  Otherwise you can either play one music file or all music files.  There was no way for me to select by folder (which is all I need), artist, album, nor genre.  Now on to loading a movie, which was a typical video I use with other video players.  When I clicked on play it said that it was only supported with an "plug-in" that  ... wait for it ... cost extra.  There are two types of video plug-in at $20 each. I decided it is not worth it and returned it. I bought it for three reasons which it was lacking in all three areas: 1) Play videos (not many video formats supported, other supported at an extra cost) 2) Browse the web (costs extra) 3) Play MP3s (GUI lacks)  In conclusion...  Pros: 1) It has good look and feel 2) video playback good (when supported) 3) screen is clear and bright 4) keys work well 5) good user interface in general 6) good weight (not too heavy) 7) good battery life  Cons: 1) Web Browser App cost an EXTRA $30 2) Some codecs (video formats like AVI) are not support ... BUT you can add some codes, of course this costs EXTRA of at least $20 3) MP3 player user interface is lacking. I could not find a way to play by folder, artist, genre ... MUST make playlist ahead of time and upload it to the player  cheers
