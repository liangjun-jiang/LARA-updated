<Title>EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS, BEST IN ITS CLASS
<Date>Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Initially, I was the dumb consumer ready to buy the big brand names like the new Sony NW 507 or a mini-IPOD. But then I decided to do some research and found out that there are other companies out there, like creative rio and samsung that put out even better mp3 players. I did alot of comparing and Samsung's MTX-6 was the clear choice.   I bought a refurbished model from Samsung mall for $86. It came with a 90 day warranty,(fortunately I haven't had to use the warranty, this product is made well) and delivered right on time. For 86 bucks I got 512 gb, FM radio, voice recorder, and a machine that has many functions to produce the sharpest sound. You'll be surprised, how the SRS WOW format on this thing blows I-PODs right out of the water. My brother has a 20 gig I-POD and the sound is much duller. SRSWOW provides a concert hall type sound.   On top of this, the MT6X is incredibly small and cool looking. In the looks department, only sony's nw 507 can compare, the creative muvos look cheap, and those white boxy Ipods will get old real-fast(like everything from the 80's, trust me.) I wear mine around my neck and its very comfortable to jog with.  The best part about the MT6-X is the fact it uses a AA battery, I just use rechargables and I can't tell you how convenient it is.  The 42 hr battery life is no joke, I've literally listened to this thing 2 days straight.   I used to think Samsung put out inferior products since it was a Korean company, but after I bought an LCD display from them, I was  surprisingly pleased, so I gave the MT6-X a chance, its not just a super deal, its the best in its class.

<Title>A wonderful buy.
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been researching different mp3 players in hopes to find the best one for the lowest price.  The Samsung YP-MT6X is just that.  It's easy to control, and easy to put music onto.  You don't have to change the file type, and it is great for holding other files as well, such as pictures and word documents.  I use mine for just about everything.  I put all my files onto it when I had to reformat my computer and it worked wonders.  The only thing is that I could probably use one with more memory, because I only get about an average of 120 songs each time I load news songs onto it.  And the voice recorded does not work very well, but perhaps that's just me.  One time I did I have some trouble with loading songs onto it, but I just looked in the booklet for possible causes, and did as the book instructed and everything was fine.  I love being able to put a single battery in and having it last me a few weeks or for a long car ride.  All you need is a pack of batteries and you are good for quite some time, and there is no obligation to charge it at all.  And the player is very light weight.  I do keep mine in the protective case, but I wish that it came with an arm band or something of the sort because it's hard to run with the player strung around my neck, but you can just as easily hold it.  I suggest buying this if you are looking at it.

<Title>iPod shuffle?  PUH-LEEZE!!!
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, you could get a shuffle...and pay for all the marketing, hype , advertising they do.  What better way to get people to buy a music player with no display (and little to no playback control) than to brainwash people into thinking its "hip."  What's "hip" to me is performance, quality and control...all of which this Samsung unit has.  And THEN some.  For less than $20 more than the worthless Shuffle, you get a DISPLAY (wow!), an FM tuner, better sound quality, and a multitude of menu options including sleep timers, playlists and adjustable EQ's.  It also supports a slew of formats including licensed WMA's and OGG.  The included USB adaptor lets you use the unit as a flash drive.  There's two adaptors included, a standard USB cable and a mini-connector that lets the unit plug right into the USB port (supports 1.1 and 2.0).  The nicest thing is that you dont have to use any proprietary software to transfer files...you can do it through Windows by dragging and dropping; by Windows Media Player, or any other software that allows synching between devices so you dont have to use the painfully slow iTunes program all the time.  The unit runs off of one AA battery for what seems an eternal 40 hours.  Also, it has the abiiltiy to record from a built-in mic, a stereo source (has a mini 1/8" stereo jack) or you can record from the FM tuner.  How freakin cool is that?  The display is clear and easy to read, and navigating through the easily labled menus is a breeze using the little joystick.  This thing is so packed with features that you would wonder why anyone would get anything else for the price.  I cant say enough about how cool this thing is and how well it performs.  If you pass this up for the Shuffle hype you need to have your head examined.  Samsung rocks!!!

<Content>this is an easy to use device that is perfect for the gym. it holds plenty of music and is simple to operate. earbuds are not so hot but for 10$ I added a more secure headset that doesn't fall out on the torture machines at the gym!  Love it!

<Title>Returned two players.
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had to return two players.  I went to Samsung website to check if there were any firmware updates available for the YP-MT6X player and there were two; one version was 1.101 and the other 2.121.  So, I installed the software provided by Samsung to upgrade the firmware to version 2.121 (downloaded from Samsung website).  I plugged the player and started the update process.  Everything seemed to be ok.  When I unplugged the USB cable the player would no longer turn on.  I had the same exact problem with the second player.  I contacted Samsung customer support, they were of no use; I was told to send the player to them for service.  If you buy this player, DO NOT UPGRADE FIRMWARE to version 2.121 or you will have problems.

<Title>Disappointed with this player.
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the YP-MT6X for two months, and I've already had to get one unit replaced because it would no longer power up after a firmware upgrade.  I had great hopes for this player because of its small size and the features that is has.  The problem is that this device seems to be pretty buggy.  The biggest problem is that the player will fail to see many of the songs that I copy to it (either from Windows Media Player's "Sync" function, or simply by dragging and dropping folders of music onto it).  After copying music to the device, and then powering up the mp3 player, the player will simply not see some of the songs.  If I navigate to the folders where the missing files should be, the player simply displays a message that says "No Entry".  I know the files are there because when I plug the device into a computer, windows can see all of the music files without any problems.  Both YP-MT6X's that I had did this.  The first player I had died when I tried to "upgrade" the firmware to 2.121 from samsung's website.  I used the firmware updater from samsung's site, and it said everything went fine, but after unplugging the player from my PC it would not power up.  I see at least one other reviewer has mentioned this problem as well, so I am not about to attempt this on my replacement player.  Samsung should not provide the 2.121 firmware on their website section for the MT6X if it causes your player not to power up after you install it!  So apparently I am stuck with the 1.111 version of the firmare that the unit had installed at the factory.  So in short I am left with a buggy player that can not see half of the files that I copy to it.  Changing the music on the player is extremely frustrating due to the "missing files" bugs.  I have not figured out a way around these problems, but I suspect it has something to do with a limit on the number of folders that can exist on the player because I can usually get the player to see the missing files by randomly moving them to different folders until the player finds all of the missing files.  Needless to say, this is a very frustrating process to go through every time I want to copy new music onto the player!  Perhaps if you can get a player with firmware 2.121 on it these issues do not exist, but I would definately recommend that you stay away from players with firmware 1.111.  You apparently can not upgrade the firmware on these units to 2.121, and they are very buggy!

<Title>A good mix of form, function, and price.
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player suits my purposes of listening mostly to podcasts to and from work.  As mentioned in other reviews, it connects easily to xp without the Samsung software.  I use media player to sync my podcasts and Windows Explorer to drag and drop music folders.  You could cram about 16 hours of podcasts onto this thing since they are usually recorded at the 64 kbps quality.   After 2 weeks, I'm still at a full 3 bars of battery life - with the single AA battery included - after using the player everyday on my 45 minute commute and playing with the features at night.  It feels great not to be tied to a charger.  For those buying refurbished, make sure that all accesories are included.  There are 2 usb adapters: a cord and a small plug.  The case is not pretty, but it does seem to offer protection.  I have not played with the line in encoder yet.  The player is small enough to tuck on top of my phone while it is in the cell phone pouch of my briefcase.  It works great with my old school tape deck car adapter; there are even specific audio settings for use with speakers, car adapters, etc.  The menu is a little funky, but I have yet to mistakenly advance a song while trying to up the volume.  The screen is clear and I love the option that lets you see how much time is left in a track.       Other reviews posted since I bought the product have really slammed the product for its not supporting the 2.1 firmware.  My player has the 1.1 firmware and I have no intention of attempting to upgrade after hearing those horror stories.  I'm not sure of the benefit of 2.1, but as of right now it does not seem worth the gamble.  I want to note that the Samsung website includes instructions on how to install the firmware.  Written in some pretty rough Konglish, they instruct you to remove the battery when upgrading along with some other specific steps.  I'm not sure whether those installing the the firmware would have followed these instructions or not.  I have also read that the 1 GB version has trouble dealing with a great number of folders, plus 40 or so.  I assume this would hold true of this 512MB version as well.  Personally, I have experienced no bugs.   Since it's my first mp3 player, I resisted the 5 star rating.  That said, I would be surprised if a comparable iriver or Creative impressed me as much as this little player has.  The display-less Shuffle loses on paper alone.  With the tiny Ipod nano (2GB-$200 and 4GB-$250) announced, flash players will probably make some nice advances over the coming months in terms of memory and displays.  At the moment, though, I am loving my $110 Samsung MT6X.

<Title>FIRMWARE UPDATE TO VER 2.121
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you wish to update your player to version 2.121 you MUST FOLLOW INSTRUCTION provided as a pdf file from Samsung. Before the update, you MUST REMOVE THE BATTERY and hold the play/pause button while connecting the player and starting the update software! I had version 1.111 and upgraded to 2.121 in this way with no problems. If you do not follow these direction your player will not turn on as I have found out the hard way. I had contacted Samsung about this problem and although the technical support was of no use when I called, I later saw that the instructions were posted on Samsung website the same day that I called.

<Title>Good workhorse MP3 player
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the Samsung player for a little while now. I really do like all the features, the screen and the fm player especially. The menu is a little confusing, but I have quickly learned to adjust the volume and songs without looking while jogging, an arm strap may be better than that neck strap. I have not upgraded anything and after reading other reviews I will not try, but I do not know if I'd miss any features.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loved this player until it failed to boot.  This little player has great sound and useful features.  I used to about 3 months and it no longer boots.  It will go through the flash screens and then hang showing the free memory.  This is the second MP3 player this summer.  The last one that failed was a SanDisk.    Who makes an MP3 that does not fail?

<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I listen to a lot of music on one battery.  I have spent 4 days listening to music all day at work on one AA battery.  The FM tuner is really useful when I want to listen to news or the radio.  The voice recorder comes in handy now and then, plus I can record from the radio or from the output of another device.  I have dropped this several time with no ill effects.  Pros: Great battery life!  Uses AA battery.  Voice recorder, FM tuner, 512MB is actually a lot of music.  Small size.  Great sound.  Seems durable. Cons: Needed to upgrade firmware to make software reliable.  Interface initially not intuitive, but it is easy now that I am used to it.
