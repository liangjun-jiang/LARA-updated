<Title>nice device, lousy instructions
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one and because it came with really bad instructions, I crashed it the first day. I returned it and downloaded the manual from the archos web site and tried a new one. It is in fact a great little player. Easy, good sound, tiny and cute. Please, if you buy one, download the manual and read it before you try to hook it up to your computer to fill it with music.  If you unplug the USB cable improperly you can kill it. Also, this unit does not come with a charger other than the computer USB cable. Not a problem, I bought a USB cable DC charger at Radio Shack.  
<Overall>3

<Title>Linux friendly

<Content>Wonderful MP3 player.  Far better than the "defective by design" iPod series.  Very Linux friendly.  The Archos connected up to my Mandriva Linux system without a problem.  
<Overall>5
