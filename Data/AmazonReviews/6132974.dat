<Title>Nice design VERY POOR QUALITY

<Content>This could be a great product, but it is a piece of junk.  I bought one and returned it because the earphone jack caused the sound to come on and off.  I bought another one from a different vendor, thinking it was unlikely I would get the defect a second time.  WRONG.  Same exact problem -- the ear phone jack is bad.  Now all of a sudden the thing is turning itself off and then on again.  And forget about getting ANY help from TrekStor at all. I plan to use this one until it dies, which will likely be next week, because it is too much of an aggravation to return it, but I won't be buying any more TrekStor products.

<Title>Nice basic mp3 player

<Content>While it's not outstanding and can't go shoulder to shoulder with the $100+ players, it does what it's told; mp3 playback is fine and, with a nice headset, the sound quality delivered is up to par with all modern players.  The player doubles as a good USB2 thumbdrive as well, so it's a solid allrounder for all situations. The only letdown is the startup time (around 5 seconds) and the fidgety menu, which takes some getting used to.
