<Title>Amazing player! Buy it!
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first MP3 was an IRIVER 128mb player (still use it) and was amazed how you could download and listen to music on such a small device.  But I decided that maybe it was time to get a new player since the 128mb was a bit small in storage.  I researched till I was numb. The wealth of info is so staggering that it would choke a horse. I wanted to convert my entire collection to (lossless) digital and wanted a player that could support all the formats. It was down to the Iriver Clix and the Cowan D2. In the end I decided to get the Cowan D2. Mainly because it supported all the formats like Flac, Ogg, Wav, etc...Clix doesn't support Flac. Also the monumental reviews on the D2 raved about its sound quality. So I purchased it and all I can say is "WOW". It definitely lives up to the hype! What a phenomenal player. I am by no means an audiophile. I have a descent ear and buy the best that I can afford but damn... this D2 is amazing! The SQ is unbelievable.  I listen to it with a pair of Senn px100 (ditch the buds that come with it). I am now in the process of ripping my entire collection to digital. I bought an Audio Technica USB turntable to convert my LP's (a monumental task) and can't wait to hear my old LP's again. The Jet Audio software that comes with the D2 is very good and very easy to use. I ripped some classical CD's in seconds and couldn't believe the SQ with the D2. And the kicker is, I HATE classical music. But with the BBE sound enhancements and different Equalizer settings it is a real pleasure to listen to. Also, most people say that on a portable system, you cannot hear a difference between different formats such as .wav and MP3, but I can; and I do NOT have a great "ear" for music as most but I can definitely hear a difference in SQ between them. But this player. I really can't imagine any other player sounding as good as this one!

<Title>Quantity AND quality :)
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first, i had doubts about the media player because i have never heard the name "Cowon" before(And it was a present for my boyfriend, so i wanted it to, well, not allow it to be a load of "garbage" as one might say.) After reading the other reviews, i decided to take my chances...And i must say, that i am proud that i got it :D The sound was amazing, although the F.M. radio can have a bit of a static, ( but everything would be fine under the right connections) The only thing that i disliked about this media player is that it does not have speakers, and the pen was put out badly (The pen was the size of approximately the size of a dollar coin, and triangular in size, with no slot to store it in) On the other hand, it IS touchscreen so the pen was optional to use. Overall the media player was a great buy, and my boyfriend loved it.He said that he was about to get something similar from SAMSUNG before.The Samsung cost more, and had less features.After getting it for him, i have to admit i got a bit jealous, and am considering on getting one myself =] Another BIG PRO would be the battery life... 50 HOURS?!?! lols that is great for people that forget to charge their electronics once every few times.The visuals on the screen is also amazing, along with everything else. Long story short, i baught the Cowon D2 4 GB Portable media player (Black) for my boyfriend, and it was a great buy :)

<Title>Absoulutely the finest PMP for the money.
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cowon has significantly raised the bar in the PMP (Portable Media Player) market with the D2. The sound is amazing, and the 16 million (24 bit) color screen simply has to be seen to be believed.   The 74mw amplifier in the Cowon D2 provides enough power to drive even the most demanding headphones. Likewise the 5-band EQ section with each band featuring adjustable frequencies to 12db and the inner 3 bands featuring adjustable Q widths will allow music lovers to tailor their listening preferences. Most MP3/PMP players would stop there, but the D2 also offers sound shaping through technology licensed from BBE, a company that has been providing recording studios, musicians, and sound system engineers professional sound reinforcement for several years. The combination of bass enhancement, MP enhancement, stereo field enhancement, and 3D surround enhancement allow you to tailor the sound to your particular tastes. Having 10 user-assignable slots allows you to easily store these combinations that can be used with music, movies, different headphones, or even different users.   One would think that a 2.5 inch screen is just too small to watch, and I was one of those detractors, but not anymore. The 16.7 million color screen faithfully reproduces images with a crisp and clear viewing area that you quickly grow very accustomed to watching. Although you have to convert your videos to the specific size of the screen, the provided software does this with ease in a variety of formats.   Probably the best feature of the D2 is the touch-screen interface, which is well thought-out and intuitive. The interface is activated by touching the screen, and virtual buttons appear which are surprisingly easy to navigate, even for people with large fingers. However, those who want a tactile interface aren't left behind, as the three-button pad can be set to skip, pause, or rewind when placed in lock mode. MP3s tagged with embedded images will be displayed as songs are playing, which I found to be a very cool feature; I've spent several hours re-tagging my media collection with these images for the coolness factor.   The battery life on this device is amazing, almost insanely so. Cowon claims 52 hours of battery in music mode, or 10 hours in video mode. While I have not tested these to the extreme, I did watch two movies and listened to several hours of music with my battery meter only dropping one (of four) 'bars'. A note on the battery -- Cowon devotes nearly half the volume of the D2 to the internal lithium-polymer battery, which results in a "thicker" device than some others, just over 5/8 inch. This battery can be charged over USB, or using the provided A/C adaptor, which charges the batter much faster.  The Cowon D2 is expandable with an SDHC compliant slot, meaning that any SD card you have will work in this, as well as the newer high-capacity SDHC cards, which currently are available in capacities up to 8GB, with cards in 16 and 32 GB being announced. Connectivity is through a standard min-USB cable. You can operate the D2 in standard "mass storage" mode where you just drag and drop files into the folders, or you can operate this in MTP mode which is supposedly compatible with Microsoft's "Plays For Sure" program and other subscription based services. I cannot vouch for this, but I have no reason to doubt it.    I've waited for about three years to upgrade my MP3 player, waiting for the perfect player to come along; the Cowon D2 nicely fits that bill. I was looking for a player that had the following qualities (in order of importance):  1) Awesome sound 2) Standard USB interface (no specialized USB connectors) 3) Drag and Drop (no special sync software required) 4) Expandable memory using standard media (SD/CF) 5) Firmware upgradeable 6) Replaceable/standard batteries  Unfortunately this device doesn't exist, but the Cowon D2 comes pretty close; 5 out of 6 ain't bad. It will be interesting to see what products Cowon comes up with in the future.  I've spent a good deal of time telling you what I like about the D2, now I need to tell you what I don't like about it:   For such a large player, it would be nice to have the ability to create playlists. I have yet to see a truly functional set of playlists work on this player. Sure, you can browse through music by artist, album, genre, folder, etc... But since I have such an eclectic collection of audio, it would be nice to organize it in the way I want.   The included stylus/kickstand is pretty much worthless. Sure, you can navigate with your fingers, but that makes for a smudgy screen. A normal stylus makes this a bit easier, but there's no way to attach it to the device.   On a rating of 10 stars, I'd have to give this 9.5. It's not perfect, but it's as close to it as anything I've ever heard of.

<Title>Amazing product
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I got tired of my Creative Zen Vision M freezing up on me I decided to get a flash based player rather than a hard drive one.  I'd have to give up a lot of space (going from 30 to 8 in this case, including the SD card) but it was definitely worth it.  At first I had to decide between the new iRiver clix 2 and this player, I picked the iRiver and within a week felt like it wasn't living up to what I expected, it was nice but it lacked too much compared to the Cowon D2 (I knew this because my friend has this player).  I was disappointed that it was only 4 gigs and not loud enough for me.  With the D2 I have 4 gigs and a slot for an SD card, another 4 gigs, so it's double the space.  As soon as you install the newest firmware you'll be on your way and ready to listen to music from the SD card as well as the player.  The battery life is great, very small and compact, touchscreen works wonderfully, and again the sound is just amazing!  And it's even better with the right pair of headphones (in my case I got the Westone UM2's, also on my friends recommendation).

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had high expectations about the D2 but got extremely disappointed with it. I used to have a clix that I lost and after reading about the D2 I felt attracted to the 2.5in screen, which is very nice, the SD slot, and battery life. Once I received the D2 I got very annoyed with its unintuitive interface. I eventually got it going and was able to transfer video and audio, both played with great quality.  So, why didn't I like the D2? It has some great features, but the interface requires a lot of taping to get it going. The stylus pen can't be put away, it just hangs from an elastic band, not the most elegant function. It felt bulky compared to the clix and I missed the flash games, I am a Sudoku addicted! I saw that flash is now supported by the D2 with the latest firmware but you have to go looking around for games. Maybe I got too used to the simplicity of the clix. I also realized that battery life was never an issue with my old clix and read that the new screen, though smaller than the D2's, is beautiful with its AMOLED technology. The  D2 does work with napster to go.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I haven't purchased a music player since my 128MB Rio more than 5 years ago, so I don't know what the competition is like, so keep that in mind.  Having said that, the D2 did not meet my expectations.  I have no interest in images, text or videos.  All I wanted to do was load some albums on and be able to easily navigate to them and play.  I also wanted to be able to see the album art, especially when navigating.  I guess this was all too much to ask.  I got the D2 and attached it to my PC running Windows Media Player.  WMP detected it right away and started syncing (whatever that means - it copied my entire library onto the D2). So far so good.  I turned on the D2 and tried to navigate.  First of all, no album art, just gray squares where the album art could be.  Second, navigating consists of scrolling through an alphabetical list of every track on the device.  This stinks.  Well, it turns out that getting album art is a generally painful thing, that WMP makes look easy.  You cannot get it seamlessly, you have to work for it.  The art needs to be embedded in the MP3 file, and WMP won't do it for you.  Other nerd oriented programs like Media Monkey will do it, but with extensive hand labor (manually click every album and select/confirm the album art).  I went through this procedure, only screwing up about a dozen tracks in the process (tagged and renamed with incorrect information).  I have not yet gotten Media Monkey to work with the D2 itself, so I'm back to using explorer to drag and drop music files onto the D2.  So much for "syncing".  Then back to the D2.  Still gray squares!  The album art comes up, but only when the album is playing, you can't use album art to navigate.  Major disappointment.  Now it becomes painfully clear that there is approximately zero documentation with the D2.  The CD has a user guide, but it hardly scrapes the surface (half a page devoted to the music player).  After trial and error I found my way to a screen that lets you sort by album or artist.  It literally takes about seven screen taps to get to it, and if you stop clicking for more than 5 seconds, it reverts back to the player screen, forcing you to start over.  Very annoying.  Incidentally, the default is also for the whole screen to go black in 10 seconds, which is also highly irritating when you are trying to figure stuff out.  Bottom line is that I didn't get what I wanted from the D2.  I don't know if any other players out there are better though.  The interface is just plain annoying, compounded by the lack of a manual, so everything is either trial and error, or beg for help on the on-line forum.  The album art thing is probably a fairly global problem, though if the D2 could read the album art from the album folder, it could be kind-of compatible with WMP - you'd still have to drag and drop the music instead of syncing.

<Title>Great media player, lousy radio
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cons: radio useless unless you have a strong signal, pointer/stand is useless as stand, video files need to be massaged with Cowon's utilities, some problems registering on www.cowon.com site, usual earbuds, case is extra  That having been said, I love this little unit. It is software standards based (uses UMC, so it appears as two disks on my Linux system [internal memory and SD card memory]), hardware standards based (no proprietary cables for data upload and download), seems to support every media format on Earth, and is expandable with SD memory. I use the SD chips as my library, keeping only  my most listened to music in internal memory. I do wish that there were some way to move files around without use of a computer, but oh well. I did buy the suggested leather case for it, but had to cut a slit so that I could swap memory cards without taking the D2 out of the case. Their latest firmware (2.50) supports Flash, but I have not seen any Flash applications for it yet. Their user community seems to be quite active. I previously used a Gen 1 iriver clix and hated the proprietary file transfer and cables. Would I buy this unit again, knowing what I do now? You bet.

<Title>Pick a side and the choice is made
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are two kinds of people.  Team 1 are people like me, who use laptops for work and never have their notebooks out of sight for more than a couple of days.  Team 2 are those lucky people who have laptops or desktops and have not turned them on in 6 months.  If you are a member of Team 2, stop reading right now, this product is not for you.  Save the money you don't spend on internet access and blow it on a four hundred dollar I-Pod, cause that's what you need.  BUT, if you are member of Team 1, this is the product for you.  I keep my library on my laptop, video, audio or otherwise.  My player does not need capacity, it needs performance and that's exactly what this product provides.  It has great audio quality, stunning video and an unbeatable battery life (50hrs+!).  It quickly an easily interfaces with my PC and my laptop, transferring files quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  Use wise, it is well engineered.  Small and light enough to fit in a pocket unnoticed, yet not so small or light I forget it is there and sit on it or send it to the cleaners.   It is easy to use without the stylus and supports every file format imaginable.  For the price, it is unbeatable so long as you do not need the 80 gigs.  Drawbacks would be that the screen will scratch if you are not careful with the device (put it in your pocket with your keys etc.) and it does not work with MAC OS.  If you are on Team 1, stop thinking and just buy it, you will not be sorry.  Team 2, I have no idea what you do with your lives that you do not need a computer all the time,but good luck affording your 1st, 2nd and 3rd I-Pods because they will all break.

<Title>Best MP3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third Cowen/iAudio mp3 player to buy.  I love this D2.  Great battery life.  Charging takes about 4 hours and even though it says it will last 50 hours, I've found it last around 30 to 40+ hours and that's real life useage - using the radio, mp3 and video player.  Comes with Wall charger or you can charge it with the usb cable.  Video Screen is very bright and movies play great on it.  You have to convert videos using their software to play. The Software is easy to use, but if the movie you want to convert is an hour long, then it will take at least an hour to convert it.      The Mic is very strong, so you can't hold the unit in your hand and record or it will pick up too much scratching noice, but it you lay it on a table and don't hold it while you record, it's very good.  I've had the unit for about 2 months and they've made 2 firmware updates since then that you can download.  Example - one firmware update gave the unit the ablitiy to be used as a notepade and draw on the screan with different colors, sort of like the old paint program.       Positives =   Battery, Screen clearity, sound, video size, you don't have to use any software - just drag and drop songs onto the player.  It acts as a hard drive if you want to put other files on it for storage.      Negatives =     You have to buy the special line input cable from a resellers website for about $10 and also the video output cable, also around $10.  There are no games and no calculator on the unit, but hopefully a new firmware change will add those soon. It does not play audio books from audible ( even though a sales person said it does ).

<Title>Best player for audiobooks
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use the D2 primarily for listening to audiobooks from Netlibrary and Audible.  The D2 has great bookmarking, a reliable resume feature ( that has to be enabled by checking it.)The tap on the screen interface is a breeze to use and hard to screw up. Best of all, it is the only player that has a time elapsed bar that can be tapped at any point to move immediately to that part of the file. So if you are using a 20 hour single file Netlibrary book, you do not have to hold the fastforward down for ten minutes to get back to your place if you accidentally lose it.

After a little help from my vendor's tech support I was able to transfer video files( my lack of tech ability, not the D2's). I am thrilled with the level of audioand video fidelity. Of course the screen is small, but for long air journeys with the entire "Police Academy" series as your alternative,it becomes quite acceptable. I am an opera devotee, and I have a number of live concerts on this device and I am satisfied. I would recomend it to anyone.

<Content>I bought this to replace a hard drive device which died when dropped. Unfortunately the levels of memory offered with flash devices is simply useless. What kills the D2 for me though is the software. Worked fine till I upgraded the firmware. Now the device doesn't support flac! The Jetshell software which ships with the product no longer recognises the existence of the device though the computer sees it. Can't upgrade the Jetshell software unless I get on plane to go home and dig out the serial number of the old installation. To sum up Cowon products are just not worth the trouble.

<Content>What no one seems to mention about this little beauty is the txt reader. With ABClit converter I converted most of my ebook library over and transfered it over onto my D2 with no problem. The text reader is convenient and easy to use - I've already read two full-length books on it, and I've only had my D2 for a few days. The screen is large enough to actually be able to watched subbed anime on, and this is surprising for me, because I don't have the best eyesight in the first place.  Transferring files over is easy and the design is simple and easy to use. This is a great PMP for the more tech-inclined who don't want to spend a lot of money.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The versatility of this model is great. The touch-screen will not appeal to all users but I find it extremely easy to use. Speaking for myself I love it.  Sound quality is among the best I have experienced. There are dozens of user selectable settings to tailor the sound to your personal taste. This unit works well with Windows Media Player. I did not care for the bundeled software.  I love the built-in SD card reader. The images display beautifully but high-res take a few seconds to fully render. Zoom and pan work well (very logical functionality) but again they take a moment to render.  Battery life is incredible. The battery will last more than 45 hours under heavy use.   Playing video requires some determination because they must be the right resolution or they will not play. This is my only complaint of this unit - but with only 4gb of storage this unit was clearly not intended to be a serious video player. For that reason I tend to largely dismiss this minor shortcoming - but potential buyer should understand this limitation.   Last but not least you're not tied to the restrictive / proprietary formats that Apple / Mac force you to go with. I hate the proprietary nonsense.

Flash games downloaded from the Internet will probably not work, but this "perk" feature is not widely used anyway. Overall an excellent media player, recommended.

<Title>Best for the Price!
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I researched for a new mp3 player after my Sandisk Sansa e270 got destroyed, and discovered that this, the Cowon D2, was the one for me.  From the box, the D2 came with: the player(obviously), headphones w/ one pair of foam tips, AC Adapter, manual, software CD(Jet audio), stylus, and a dummy SD card.  Even when this nice player debuted a year ago, it's still the best around. I updated the firmware to 3.51b(3.53b was too buggy), and now I can do almost everything in this little thing! Music, video, text, flash player(games, apps), dictionary, drawing pad, FM tuner, recorder, you name it.  UI: The 2.5 screen is very bright. Bright enough to see under sunlight. It kind of has a rubbery surface. Very scratch resistant, but I'd still use a screen protector just in case. The touch screen is very responsive. Some may not like it b/c then they can't use it blindly, but you can make the top volume buttons to skip tracks in hold mode.  "Virtual motion" is not as good as I expected, but still a nice add. My favorite part is that you an skip around the scroll bar by just tapping it just like you do it on your computer. User interface is kind of weired at times, but easy enough.  Music: Sound quality is very good. Not as warm as the iRiver, but still very good, and it sure blows the Sansa and iPod out of the water.  Not to mention the very customizable sound--BBE, Bass, MP Enhance, 3D effect, Stereo enhance, and EQ presets(or a 5 band user EQ). You can also use the 'EQ filter' to change frequencies of each band. You can even save your customized sound and make them in to presets(total of 10). Even with the stock headphones, the sound stage is noticeably wider and makes listening more enjoyable. It's like the music has finally become 'alive'. There is no hissing and everything sounds clear. Imagine how good it will sound through quality headphones!  Other features: Pan, Play speed(&lt;100%) Audio snobs mention that it has not enough bass and too much highs, but an average person WILL be satisfied with the sound.  Video: I don't really watch video so I can't really say much about it. As far as I can tell, it's sure sharp, crystal clear, and immensely smooth. 30min clips on the go would be nice, though you'll have to convert them with the included software. You can use the sound enhancements for video also. You can connect it to your TV, but you need a special cable for that($10) and it won't fill the whole TV screen.  FM Tuner: This is the down side of it. The reception is pretty poor. I am able to get most of the local channels, but almost all come out staticy and mono(even when it says 'stereo'). Cannot use sound enhancements for radio. Still usable, but I don't really listen to radio.  Text, Recording: Text is readable, but your eyes might get tired after some time. Bookmarking available.  I don't use recording, but it's good enough quality for a mp3 player. Noticeably better than my Sansa. Line in recording offered.  Dictionary: Only 3.xx firmware can have dictionary. You'll also have to download the dictionary files and transfer it to your D2. Not a hassle. To me, the dictionary really comes in handy. It has Kor-Kor, Engl-Engl, Kor-Engl and vise versa. It uses virtual keyboard, or handwriting recognition. I don't see this as a gimmick. The definitions are surprisingly detailed and has almost all words when I search. It even has slang and course slang words. Select a word and save it to a 'word book'. There, you can 'Exercise' and 'Quiz'. Pronunciation also available, but it takes up more space and I think it's only Korean(I myself haven't tried it).  Others: Calculator and Scientific Calculator is a nice addition, but there are known to produce errors and solve equations incorrectly, so don't use it. Note pad is good to take notes on the go, or draw when your bored. Flash player is nice. You can download .swf games off the internet and play them on the D2. You can choose between two types of controls before you play: arrows or touch. So if the game uses both, you can't play it. Also you can't put big flash files, otherwise it's too slow and unplayable(&lt;300kb is good in general, but depends on the game).  Customizable wallpaper. Changeable font colors. Alarm and sleep timer, etc.  Overall: Pros:  *Touch screen(con for some) *good audio quality *loads of features that I refuse to mention again *sturdy *SD slot!!(internal and external can be browsed at the same time using ID3 tag browse. No lags what so ever.) *battery life(said is 52hrs for music but probably around 30 with all those enhancements and use of SD slot)  cons:  *thick? *radio reception *some (minor)bugs  The price is so cheap for what it does. I would like to say that all my iPod nano friends were jealous--dreadfully jealous ;) Nano is basic cheap crap compared to this. Absolutely no reason to buy it over the D2, and the only reason you would buy an iPod classic is for the 80GB memory.  If you're looking for a new portable player, have the money, and are sophisticated enough, then look no further.

<Title>Wow!!
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I was skeptical of this unit. But after I bought this I have to say that this is awesome. Here's a list of things I like about it and why I bought it:  1)	A++ Sound quality!!! This is no joke. 2)	The Audio enhancements like BBE, Mach Bass, EQ, Surround sound, ect. 3)	Plays FLAC files!  4)	Has Radio 5)	Has Sleep, wake up to music, and you can schedule it to record radio. 6)	Plays movies. Although I bought it for music enjoyment, I plan on using it for movies at work.  7)	I like the Size of it. AND I like the build quality. It feels nice and solid, not feather light where it would slide everywhere.  8)	The screen is beautiful and bright.  9)	I like the GUI. I wasn't sure if I would at first but I as it turns out I like it a lot. It's a really neat feeling and it looks cool to navigate through touch screen. You can use the stylus or you can use your finger. I use both depending how I am feeling.  10)	SD Slot for more memory expansion!!! Yay! 11)	 Battery life is A++! This is important to me because I am constantly fiddling with it using battery life. And my FLAC files take a lot of juice also. It's important for me to have a player that I don't have to worry about going dead. I can go two days of playing, at least, without recharging.  12)	The Stylus. A lot of people don't like how it is attached to an elastic string which attaches to the player. I thought I wouldn't either, but I actually like it like that. It looks neat, it is different, and it is actually more convient because I don't have to slide it out like my Nintendo DS every time I want to use it. I can just grab it and wella!    What I don't like about it:      1) Ear buds that came with it. Throw them away!  On a side note, this is a good thing    because when I buy an mp3 player I want all my money going into the quality of the  player itself, not the ear buds that I will be replacing anyways.   With the new lower price that this unit is going for, I feel like I got it for a steal.  I'm still trying freaking out on how I got such a good deal with all these features and sound quality. This is my Second Cowon, I used to have an X5. You can't go wrong with this company. I don't understand why anyone would spend the same amount of money or more and get less features on other name brands. I guess you have to surf the internet a lot to find out about hidden gems like this one, because you'll never find it in a store.

<Title>Excellent piece of technology - Audible and Yahoo Music compliant
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased an Sansa and realized it was not audible compatible -- if a primary goal of yours is audible compatibility do your homework -- make sure whatever player you choose works with the platform.  The D2 works well with Audible -- no problems experienced in the 4 months I have owned it.  And the D2 works with Yahoo -- Music -- I prefer not to buy each song -- I would rather have unlimited downloads to my player.  If you intend to join audible (great service by the way) two pieces of advice would be to get the $100 discount on players purchased through Amazon for a membership and secondly read the reviews on Amazon for any audio download you wish to purchase.

<Title>Great for both Music and Video
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The are really only 2 potential drawbacks to this excellent music and movie player. The player is extremely light and portable but the screen you are looking at is 2.5 inches. That's pretty small, so be sure you dont mind a screen that size for video. The only other possible drawback is that viewing movies and TV shows means first converting them with the software provided with the player. If your computer doesnt have the proper codecs already installed, the conversion will fail. For techies who know about codecs this isnt a drawback at all, but for others it might prove frustrating to try to get video files to play on this device.   If you are like me and download lots of videos that others have made, you need LOTS of different codecs and versions of each codec. So I can honestly say I have given this player a good test of its ability to convert and then play a variey of different video source files. This is easily the best portable multimedia player currently in the marketplace of this size. Perfect for commuters who might want to watch a movie rather than listen to music. The touch screen interface is simple and straightforward and the display is very bright.   You might have trouble viewing in direct sunlight but that is true with any LCD display on the planet.   There are plenty of professional internet reviews out there if you google around and it has been getting high marks just about everywhere. If you download and watch a lot of movies and TV, this device is quite impressive. It doesnt hurt that you can insert standard SD memory cards to increase its storage

<Title>Excellent Player
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was looking strictly for a player that had excellent sound and would play various formats, ea flac & ogg. The D2 performs up to my expectations. There are plenty of reviews extolling the virtues of the D2, so here are a few tips.  Before loading any songs, save yourself several hours of frustration and format the D2 and the SD card. All the problems I was having disappeared on reformat. Get a decent set of headphones or earbuds, makes a huge difference. Search the cowon forums if you have problems. Lot of good answers there. Be sure to check the forums BEFORE upgrading the firmware. Seems to be quite a few bugs in the new firmware. I don't use the video or radio so I can't comment on them.

<Title>awesome!
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Other reviews/reviewers point out all the features, which are all great.  The best thing about this player is the sound.  The sound is full and rich, even when turned up really loud (it can get LOUD).  You can turn bass up without distortion (I hate the Ipod for its awful sound quality - their headphone drivers are extremely underpowered), and you can drive lower impedance headphones than the crappy ear buds that come with portable players (The Cowon does not come with great ear buds, and you have to get something better to appreciate the player's sound quality)  The only thing that I don't like about it is that the album art picture in the music folders must be called cover.jpg and my music folders all have a folder.jpg (this could be fixed in a future firmware update).  But that fact hardly bothers me at all and I am so glad I bought this player.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Korean manufactured--to high standards. It's production reminds me of the Japanese, before they began to outsource everything. This is one of the best quality players on the market. Being a perfectist, in general, I cannot find anything wrong with this player except the following:  a. The text reader should be better, making the text file's fit the screen so that one can truely read them. And a set of ebook plug-ins should be available for reading the numerous ebook formats. Truly, though, this is not designed to be a book reader.  b. The headphones could be a little better so that the wires don't get tangled so easily.  Other than these two things, the player is PERFECT! It's built like a tank. The screen is great. Even videos look good. The menus are very intuitive and the touch screen is a dream. It also plays .ogg and .flac files, which means that you can get a loss-less format of superior quality. The playtime for the battery is fantastic--I charge mine about once a week, which is ridiculously unimposing.  I listen to interviews, lectures or audio books, primarily. I have yet to listen to music. But I have a feeling that music lovers will want to upgrade the headphones, even though the stock ver. are good, I suspect the player can out do the stock set.  If you're looking for a paper-thin, tiny player, look elsewhere. The player is about the size of a credit card and slightly thicker than a chapstick. But is choice!  A respectful bow to Korean, quality manufacture. Wake-up again, Japan. The "garlic eaters" are besting you. :-)

<Content>Man, man, man,,and women, let me first start buy saying, the Cowon new D2 mp3 player, will change the way you listen to music, and also broaden your listening arena,, I frist purchased the new Creative Zen, but after I had to return it twice, I realized it wasn't (THE ONE), for me, locks up when ever it wants, sound was ok, (not loud enough for me), even with newer headphones,Sony's Mdr-ed21lp, it did'nt sound much better. So here comes my new player, I was about to return the Sony headphones because I thought,, if they sound like they did with my Zen I didn't think they would sound any better with another player,,,,Oh was I wrong CowonD2 brings your music to life,, you can really hear so much detail in the music, sounds that you probably won't recognize without this player,,, the volume rocks,,,man the volume goes up to 50 maxing it out,,, but you many never have to go that high,,, at #20 everything,, I mean ever sound no distortion in bass,mids or treble,,, I'm still toy around with all the features it has,,, downloads is so simple,, if u have Rhasody or Rhasody to go simple plug the device in an your on your way,,,, the picture is flawless,,,, but I tell you,, If your a music lover,, like I am you will be blown, away by the sound quality the player offers,,,,I mean it, if i could buy this for a first time Mp3 owner,, man no doublt this would be THE ONE,,,,,, go get it youll will not be disappointed that's a promise

<Title>Mixed feelings about the Cowon D2.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My new D2 just arrived this week and I have to say, initially, the touch screen navigation was kind of cool.  That wore off very quickly when simply trying to find specific songs in the music library.  You almost have to go digging for the song you want.  My music is tagged properly through both itunes and Windows Media Player, but for some reason not all songs showed up properly tagged. Also, some of the touchscreen functions didn't always work on the 1st, 2nd or 3rd tap of my finger. In addition, the music browser functions could be better.  The scroll down movement didn't always respond and I hated the fact that I had to tap at a song mulitple times to just play the damn thing. The sound quality, as stated by others, is great.  It's better than an ipod's, but it's about as good as my old Rio Forge that's still going strong or my 30gb Creative Zen Vision M.   I think this is getting sent back though, I'm sorry to say.  For about $150, I want my user experience in a small mp3 on-the-go player to be intuitive and effortless which the D2, sound quality aside, is not. I hear the new Sonys are fantastic so maybe I'll look at one of those.

<Title>Not Recommended for Macintosh
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't recommend the Cowon D2 for use with a Macintosh computer.  I purchased the D2 as a Christmas gift for my wife so while gardening she could listen to PBS FM radio, an audio book or music.  I chose the Cowon because there are no ipods with built-in FM tuners and it is listed as being compatible with a Mac.  I had no trouble getting files in, but not in an organized fashion.  The problem is that the supplied software is not compatible with a Mac.  Even though I put the files in folders before transfer, they all ended up going in as one batch of individual files.  I downloaded detailed instructions from the Cowon website but the instructions didn't help.  This makes it very difficult to access a particular CD, artist or audiobook.

<Title>A perfect audiophile PMP
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>D2 is in a class of its own; it doesn't compare with any of the other popular brand Personal Media Players (PMP).  PROS: . Loud and crystal clear sound with way too many options to make it sound the way you like your music, e.g. Graphic Equalizer with several settings, EQ filter, Mach Bass, BBE, Surround Sound (fake), Stereo Enhancement, etc.   . Solid build quality. . TV Out and great video . Non-proprietary USB port for PC connection and charging.   . Downloadable Flash applications. . Fully customizable User Interface. . Multiple supported audio formats. . SD card expandability.  CONS: None.  I would have however liked a removable belt clip.  I use it with decent JLabs JBuds earphones (~$20).  I can't imagine how great D2 will sound with even better earphones.  If you are looking at this review, click on the Add to Cart button because you really can't go wrong with this little gadget.  I did a lot of research and tested some brand name players, but finally settled for this one.  The two players that made it to my short list included D2 and the iRiver Clix.  I haven't tried the Clix yet, but dropped it because of it inability to support expansion.  After using D2 for a few days, I am proud to have made the right decision.

<Title>Not user-friendly AT ALL - buy a better known brand!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This unit is AWFUL! We spent a combined total of at least 10 hours working with this thing before finally feeling pure discust at the time we'd wasted so went and bought the Apple i-touch instead (which worked amazingly well right out of the box with absolutely no learning curve required). Some people may have the time and interest to work with the thing and have great results, but I can think of MANY things I'd rather be doing with my time then that.   I'm not a techno-idiot, I'm often the person people come to when they need help with something technical (computer, software, etc.) That being said, I'm not a trained Techie type either - but historically it's a rare electronic product that I can't figure out with a minimal amount of time. Not so with this thing!  Unless you are super techno-savvy with time to spare I'd pass this thing on by. It would be one thing if they actually offered decent support for it, but if you've read any of the other reviews at all, the support number is pretty much useless.  Take Home Message: Don't buy this unless you're a super-techie with nothing better to do than spend hours figuring the thing out. If you want  something that "goes" right out of the box, pick a better known brand.

<Title>The Best Audiophile PMP For Its Price
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After much researching, I purchased the Cowon D2 4gb player.   My main requirements were:  1) a player that had terrific sound, 2) a player that had long battery life, 3) a player that played videos well, 4) a player that had expandable memory, and 5) a player that was in the $200-$300 price range.   The Cowon D2 excels in all of these categories, and even with an 8gb card (giving me 12gigs of memory), I spent less than $300.   I agree completely with those users that find the Apple products easier to use out of the box; moreover, the Cowon does not have the UI (especially the coverflow) of the Itouch.   However, despite this, the Cowon is not difficult to learn by just using it, and I consider myself a novice when it comes to electronic devices.  (The manual that accompanies the product only gives the basic functions anyway.)   First and foremost, the Cowon D2 sounds amazing.   I have compared it to several players (the Apple iPhone, the Archos 605 and the Zune 80gb second generation.)  The Cowon simply blows away the competition.  I set all of the players to a neutral setting (no eq or special effects on), and played them all through my Sennheiser HD-595 headphones.   The Cowon had a better soundstage, better stereo separation, better highs and lows and better detail.    The Cowon gives me over 50 hours of battery life when playing audio files only.   If I only play videos, I am able to get about 12-15 hours.   These results are much better than the competition.  The Cowon plays videos once you have converted them.  (I convert my videos to avi files, and the Cowon does just fine.)  You can use the jet audio conversion program that comes with the player or other conversion programs, such as dvdClonemobile.   My only criticism here is that the screen is 2.5" measured diagonally, which puts some strain on my eyes if I watch videos longer than an hour.   This issue is probably very subjective; it depends in large part on your eyesight.   However, having said this, the quality of the videos is excellent (the resoultion is good and the colors are vibrant.)  The ability to expand the memory of the Cowon is a huge plus for me.   My Iphone cannot do this, and as memory cards get larger, the Cowon will soon have 20gigs of flash memory.   (I should mention that using an external memory card does not adversely affect the player's responsiveness at all.)  The Cowon D2 is a great value in light of the features that come with the player.  I actually paid close to $200 for the player, and I notice now that it costs $160.00 on Amazon.   (Recently, I saw it as low as $150.00.)   There is simply no player on the market that equals the Cowon D2.  I highly recommend its purchase.

<Content>Despite being a mac user, I really wanted to get away from ipod and this seemed to be pretty much the only other mp3 player that was compatible with macs.  Since it also had great reviews both here and on cnet, I felt pretty comfortable ordering this product.  Well, it may indeed be compatible with macs, but for the life of me, I could not get it to work.  I'd converted all my itunes stuff into mp3 format, but could not get any music transferred onto the player.  I'd read in some of the reviews that Cowon's instructions tend to be fairly cryptic, but since I'm pretty tech-savvy, I was not dissuaded.  Now I wish I'd been more wary!  I finally gave up and returned it to amazon and ordered, of course, another stupid ipod.

<Content>Hello all you confused shoppers,  If you really must know my opinion the I will tell you. But first how do you know I do not work for Cowon or Apple? Are you sure? First Cowon advertises mainly in the USA by word of mouth and to the tech geeks in their circles. Apple advertises to the masses because it can. IPOD is not better (well the interface is), not even the best all arround player.  Cowon is great from my point of view. Compared to all others it has the best sound and video options. It is also built like a rock (will not break like those mal-nurished IPODS. The reason it is thicker is the BATTERY-60 freakin hours of playback!  Hey if you just want to run with the herd go ahead, but if you are like me you want to know your options. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!  I hope whatever you choose you do not waste as much time as I have on MP3 players, but please get to know God through Jesus and meet me one day in place where we can laugh because we needed IPODS and D2's.

<Title>Very Versatile Player - AM/FM, Multiple music format, & Video
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This media player is an amazing product.     1. It supports multiple music formats beyond mp3, including open music formats like flac and ogg vorbis.  2. It includes an AM/FM radio that lets me catch up with the news when I feel the need to tune in NPR.  3. It uses flash memory, with an SDHC card slot that allows me to expand the memory capacity of unit as SD card capacities expand - now at 16GB and soon to go to 32gb and beyond.  4. The unit itself has a solid feel.  It does not feel cheap.  I was surprised when I picked up the unit.  It felt heavier than I expected - with a solid construction.    You'll want to spring a few extra bucks to get better ear phones than the ones that come with the unit.  I can't stand the ear phones that came with the unit, but that is really not what cowon is selling here.  The player itself is rock solid.

<Title>Very versatile!
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Cowon D2 is an excellent portable player. I upgraded mine to the latest v2.53 firmware, which supports all the standard audio formats, along with FLAC, APE, OGG, and even adds welcome support for AAC, which had been dropped from earlier firmware revisions (note that AAC files must have .aac file extension - .mp4 extension is not recognized)  NB: I suggest steering clear of the v2.51 firmware, it is full of bugs...  Due to the Cowon D2's powerful sound output, it should ideally be paired to regular (ear-muff style) headphones.  The problem with using the supplied Walkman-style earbuds is that they must be operated at a lower volume setting, and this leads to a *drastic* and very noticeable reduction in audio fidelity.     The Cowon D2 works MUCH better with standard headphones.  Since they need more power to drive them, this means the volume can be set much higher (without necessarily being louder), yielding correspondingly better sound quality (I hope that makes sense).   In this respect, the Cowon D2 differs significantly from older generation MP3 players.  Prior to the Cowon D2, I had been using a 1Gb Apacer Steno MP3 player, which sounds absolutely FANTASTIC when paired with Walkman-style earbuds.  The reason being that the Apacer's power output is perfectly matched for this type of mini earphone when operated at standard volume levels, having been engineered with their use in mind...     So you can imagine my surprise when I discovered that these exact same earphones plugged into the Cowon D2 sound utterly crap.  This is due to Cowon D2 having a much higher power output compared to older generation MP3 players - meaning that you are forced to set the volume to a rather low level when using Walkman-style earphones.  Low volume setting = DRASTIC reduction in audio quality !!  So the first thing to do when you get your Cowon D2, is to DITCH the supplied earphones, and invest in a pair of regular headphones.  These will be a MUCH better match for the Cowon D2's higher power output.   Trust me, you won't look back!  I find Cowon D2's interface to be superb, and the touch-screen/LCD display very gee-whiz yet practical.  On the minus side, it does not come with a protective pouch (fortunately they can be purchased cheaply on ebay).  Although the Cowon D2 itself is worth 5 stars, I will only rate it 4 stars, due to the lack of a pouch.  And in my belief, the Cowon D2 ought to come supplied with regular headphones instead of Walkman-style earbuds.  The high power output of Cowon D2 is a very poor match for earbuds, plain and simple!

<Title>Ipod who? Zune who?
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. What makes it the best? 1. 16 million color 2.5 LCD touchscreen.  2. Battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video. 3. The best sound, it has how much tweaks, its sick. You can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. Has BBE,Wide stereo, enhancement stereo etc. 4. The volume is sooo dam loud. I had a Zune and the volume level was at 20, the lourdest it could go. The D2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune. 5. You can encode AVI video bitrate at 1.5mbps.Also have WMV which you can encode at 768kbps. 6. No need to install to transfer files, it works like a USB flash drive. 7. You can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black, you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own. 8. The touchscreen is smooth and flawless. WHen playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info, Hz etc. Something that is lacking on the big boys.  9. Has tv output, also has a recorder to record conversations. 10. Can view .txt files. 11. Can view pics at very high pixels. 12. Fm tuner, you can record from the FM radio. You can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps. 13. Has a SD slot for more storage. Get a 8 gig SD for a total for 12 gig. Imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig SD. 14. Great support, firmware updates are always available.   Plus sooo much more.

<Title>Time to jump
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had an extensive collection of great music with a focus on Cuban and American Jazz but room for any 'Good' music.  I'm pretty much tied in to all things graphic and video and haven't made the jump to mp3 players much to the chagrin of my audiophile friends.  A few weeks ago, I made the decision to jump and asked a friend what he thought I should go for.  He had a few ideas and concluded that I should check out the new Cowon D2.  I ordered it a few days ago and with help from my friends started a-rip'n and a hew'n.  Well, the D2 showed up a few hours ago and I've set it up.  The graphical interface along with the jet interface makes life easy.  The interface is easy enough to get your arms around and the sound quality is great.  I ripped everything at 224mps and couldn't be more pleased.  No "Con's" here, just a solid product.  Come in, the water's fine.

<Title>video, audio, fm radio, and photos too
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having researched portable media players such as the Cowon A2 and Toshiba Gigabeat V30 I was ready to spend considerably more than the price of the Cowon D2.  The electronics store in Melbourne gave me an 8% discount off the advertised price, and I was happy to buy the item which I had never even heard of before!  There was no reason to give me a discount, they have been selling well.  In comparison with those larger players, the D2 has a smaller screen, and has much less memory.  But, to make up for this there's an SD slot which is handy for viewing photos from my digital camera.  Other features such as touch screen make this an attractive product.  The software that I got with the box includes the PDF manual (version 1.3), a program for converting video, and a browser for transferring files.  I needed to upgrade the video conversion program "JetAudio" as the version on the CD did not recognise my device.  The PDF manual on the CD was up to date.  The date of the CD material appears to be January 2007.  The problem with this player is that you have to format video before it can be viewed - the resultant files are either AVI or MWV and you can choose a range of quality options, but it seems that regular AVI or WMV will not play unless they have been converted.  Why is this a problem?  Well the conversion time appears to be only slightly less than the duration of the video, in other words a fair bit of waiting around.  But I am trying out different conversion options to see what works best.  The speed will be improved on a faster computer with more RAM.  Luckily, transfer to the device is a very quick process.  First Steps - here's what I suggest that you do: 1. Keep the plastic protective film on the screen - this will protect it. 2. Loop the stylus / stand device through the catch provided on the player. 3. Check out the forum [...] 4. Download and upgrade the firmware and JetAudio software on your D2. 5. Start converting video files using your upgraded JetAudio software. 6. Start saving your 24 favourite FM radio stations into the preset list.

<Title>Stunning Achievement
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, first off ... R.Cheek deserves a round of hisses for his lame 1 star review.  Its a shame reviews like that are not removable!  0 out out of 9 people found it useful .. and R.Cheek decides to give no details on why he thought this fine player was "junk" and what problems he had.  I researched players for 6 months before buying the D2.  There is a new BIOS update coming for the D2 that will allow it to accept SDHC cards (HC = high capacity) so this little baby can be jacked up to 12GB (4 built in .. and 8GB on a SDHC card).  Infinite capacity if you consider multiple cards!  The screen is gorgeous.  The touch interface is sublime (intelligent, detailed and well constructed).  First week I got it I did not have to recharge it!  Amazing battery life of 50+ hours.  Movies are watchable on the small screen .. but hey its small.  Sound quality of movies really makes them immersive ... and sound quality of music is superb.  Volume is awesome and super customizable equalizer settings are all you will need.   Radio is good and has many presets.  Congrats Cowon ... this is THE flash player out there.  the SDHC abilities  and 50 hour battery are wonderful.  Sound quality is tops.  All around this is a stunning achievement.

<Title>So far the best in class, but not perfect.
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cowon D2 is close to the ideal portal video device among those available as of early 2007, but competition is not far behind. (For example, check out Dane-Elec 4GB Meizu MP3/MP4 Portable Media Player.)  Unlike music, movies are generally not interesting enough for repeat viewing. Even if you find something worth seeing again and again, wouldn't you want to do so on your 50" 1080p LCD HDTV coupled with 1000W Dolby Digital surround sound coming out of a $3000 7.1 speaker set? Logic therefore dictates that portable video should be designed for viewing either the TV shows you TIVO'ed the night before or special interest materials.   Since I don't watch TV any more, I get interested in such a device for watching operas and educational clips on my long daily train rides. The selection seems wide at first, ranging from using my notebook computer to buying a portable DVD player to video iPod or PSP. But the first two options give only 2 hours of viewing time, not to mention the incredible bulk involved. iPod and PSP are both expensive, proprietary, short on storage and not specifically designed for viewing video. They also do not fit in a regular-size pocket well. This is important because the commuter rail is getting more and more crowded and I prefer riding it without carrying anything. The Cowon D2, in contrast, is single-mindedly dedicated to portable video, comes with cutting edge components and actually smaller than I would have preferred.   Its 2.5" screen is the same size as iPod but with better resolution. Unlike iPod, the screen occupies much of its face. Thus there is very little wasted bulk and the whole thing fits easily into my shirt pocket. Also, unlike iPod, the screen is touch sensitive, so there is no need for many buttons or wheels. Its Lithium Polymer battery provides a whopping 10 hours of video time, by far the best in the industry. D2 has 4GB of flash built in, enough for several DVD's worth of MPEG4 video. The SD expansion slot allows additional storage flexibility and possibility. Even the earphones are fairly decent, giving out reasonably crisp sound. It even has a FM radio.   Although I am immensely pleased with D2 overall, I do have a few minor gripes. D2 weighs just 3 oz, but is 0.65" thick. This is a little thicker than the iPod. Ideally, I wish Cowon could use a 3.5" screen but also make the device thinner (maybe 0.45"?) to keep the same weight. While they are at it, they may want to consider switching to a transflective LCD because the D2 screen is not visible under sunny conditions right now. But for a sale price of $190, I may be asking for too much.  The "pen" pointer is a clever design, as it doubles as a stand when you want to put D2 on a desk. While being stowed in the pocket, it does create a tiny mess, however, and I am somewhat concerned that it may scratch the screen. It would be nice if it could be inserted into a tight-fitting slot in the style of Palm Pilot.  I do recognize that I have been nitpicking so far. The real problem as well as the only reason why I am not giving D2 a 5-star rating, is the PC software that comes with it. D2's firmware is fine enough and frequently updated, but the conversion software is limited in features (e.g. no merging capability) and buggy in execution. Sometimes it would simply fails to convert the images properly without any warning. Since it is also slow, I tend to leave it running overnight. It is quite frustrating to go halfway through the video next morning only to have it go blank. According to the forum, JetAudio's inability to handle VOB files seems well known.

<Title>What is there not to like!
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, I read that you should not take this model when you go to the gym. Thats gibberish! The sound is is better then outstanding, the menues are super easy to operate and the battery just keeps going on and on and on. The pictures i trnasferred over to the D2 are fabulous. I hane to tried to movie mode yet. Oh! heres a tip. If you want to add an 8 gig exention card download the regular version of 2.41 not the bata. The beta does not work  with higher capsity cards. So, don't tjhin anout it, buy, uoi never regei. One last thing, there tech service section has a lot to be desired.

<Content>The player is great.  Probably one of the best I have used.  I am having just two small issues.  I can't seem to put my music into any kinds of categories and have it work.  Also, can't figure out what is the best format for songs I load onto the player.  Like mp3, or wav, or wma, etc.   Other then that it works really well for me.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OE2OPG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-1498525-9784724">Cowon D2 4GB Portable Media Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Cowon D2
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is really a great product. In my opinion the only reason it has not captured the market is because of the lack in marketing and does not have the traits of "great customer service".  The quality of the sound is excellent and has plenty of audio features like a 5 band equalizer, surround sound, BBE and other bass enhancers. The video quality is great too. Supports almost all kinds of music formats. The JPEG viewer takes a  second to display a focused picture but eventually displays very good clarity. The touch screen is awesome and fairly easy to use once accustomed. The voice recorder works really great. Awesome quality and great mic. Have not tried the in-line recording as yet. My only dissapointment was the FM reception in doors. The FM receiver definetly lacks. But over all a great product and would recommend it.

<Content>It's best mp3/pmp I've ever had. I had an iPod before, but it broke and i was looking for something better to replace it. Battery life is really good... It's over 40 hours, and video is around 8 hours. Great sound quality,videos look really good despite small screen, radio, and SD card slot if u want to put more memory.... Trust me you won't regret buying this.

<Title>Great Player - Sound, Battery Life, plays video, extra storage space.
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is one of the best mp3 player that I've owned. It has great sound (comparable to Iriver), great battery life 50+ hours, and plays more video format that the Iriver clix.  I own an Iriver clix also, which I gave to my son after purchasing this product.  I feel this product has more to offer than the Iriver Clix.  This player also view pictures and video way better than the iriver Clix.  The only drawback to this media player is the "touch screen - PDA like controls."
