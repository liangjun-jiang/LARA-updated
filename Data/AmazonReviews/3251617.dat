<Title>Great little player - Great Music Service!

<Content>This is a great little basic MP3 player. The multi-color LCD screen is a nice touch, and the voice recorder is decent.  Plus right in, drag and drop your songs and away you go! Not much more to it, though I would recommend using better headphones than the ones that come with it.  Emusic's service is, IMO, perhaps the best of the digital music services. There's no restrictions on your songs, so you can burn them or copy them to your MP3 players as much as you want without them getting "locked" like Itunes. There's lots of hard-to find treasures, and with this MP3 player you get 15 songs a month for FREE for 12 months.  
<Overall>4
