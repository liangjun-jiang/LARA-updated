<Title>Excellent for the price

<Content>This is great little MP3 player for the price.  It does stop from time to time but I'm not sure if that is the fault of the files or the player.   I highly recommend a memory card if you are like me and look to put tons of stuff on it.

<Title>Works good

<Content>Pretty good - have not used it with an SD card yet. It records good too, just make sure it is stationary. Not a stellar review because it is not a stellar peice, but it is functional and works for what I got it for.

<Title>Not to user friendly
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave this to my brother for Christmas it is quite a nice looking mp3 player, however it feels kind of cheap and is not to user friendly. I have used much better. Another thing is you will put mp3's on it and it will only put the ones it wants to put, when u redo it then some of the previous songs you had will remove by themselves but when you go to the delete mode on the mp3 all the songs are there but wont show up in the play file. I also hate the fact that you have to buy batteries for it, the first day my brother used it  the batteries were used up so either he buys a battery per day or he gets rechargeable batteries.I like the head phones though much better than the ipod head phones.  You hear the song loud and crisp thats the best thing about this mp3 player the head phones.

<Title>works like a dream
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item specifically for use with the public library system.  It is on the list of compatible devices (for digital rights management).  It was very inexpensive (compared to others on the list), easy to navigate and does exactly what it's supposed to.  My only complaint is the accompanying earphones, they really need some cushy covers in order to stay in my ears... so I use an different set.  I'm really happy with the Coby MP3 player all the way around.
