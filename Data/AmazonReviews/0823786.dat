<Content>Got this on sale at Fry's for $19.99.  Mine was missing the installation cd for some reason, but after some searching, I was able to download the software from Creative's website to save a trip back to the store.  It's really easy to use - it works just like any USB thumb drive/memory stick.  You can just drag and drop music files onto the player - it shows up as an external drive once you plug it into a USB port (assuming you have Windows XP).  I used the free Creative MediaSource software to convert both CDs and mp3 files stored on my computer into .wma files to save space.  (Hint - unless you're a serious music geek who's worried about unhearable sound quality, I found that when you convert your music into wma format, you can set the rip format to WMA, Stereo, 64 kbps, which is the lowest "quality," and be able to fit a ton of music onto the player.  I have about 40 songs on my player right now, and it's only a little over half full.)  The software is very easy and intuitive to use - a lot more so than the MusicMatch software.  I used to have an old RCA Lyra mp3 player that was a royal pain in the butt when you wanted to add or remove music - this one is 10x easier to use.  It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles (no display screen, FM radio, or easy way to organize the music to play in a particular order), but if you're looking for a cheap player to store a couple of hours of music on to listen to while working out, riding a bike, etc. and don't want to drop a bunch of money on an IPod or other fancier MP3 player, I would highly recommend this one so far.    
<Overall>5
