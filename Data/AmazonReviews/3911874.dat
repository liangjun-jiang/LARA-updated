<Title>No complaints.
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What's not to love? It sounds great, has enough EQ presets to customize the sound to my liking for different kinds of music and for headphones or powered speakers, and I've never had the battery run down in a day's use. It also works perfectly with my Yahoo subscription music, and holds plenty. I have well over 20 albums loaded currently, and still have space for more. The radio works fine too, as does the voice recorder.

<Title>Overcomming Microsoft's Restriction On This Product
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Microsoft has forced Samsung to remove OGG playback and normal flash drive capability for this product from its United States server's firmware downloads.  So, unless you happen to run Windows with Media Player 10+, you'll need to grab firmware from Australia in order to use this product.  That aside, it's a nice player with great sound and easy access buttons...  Yet another reason to back away from Microsoft.

<Title>Avoid the headaches, use the Australian firmware...
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The major problem witht he new USB thumbdrive players is the copyright protection that wont let them work on any operating system except winXp/vista, because they have WMP10 and copy protection. Well, if you go to samsung.au and download the australian firmware you get ALL of the features of the american firmware, but none of the limitations on file use. I can now use my player as a drag and drop thumb drive, i never have to synch it and can use it with my win2k laptop! This trick works with many products as foreign english speaking countries do not have the legal restrictions the U.S. has! Enjoy!

<Title>YP-U2J is useless
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this device because I needed a USB key (it claims 2 GB) and wanted to listen to MP3's and FM radio also.  Not only does it not function as a USB key (some reviews have indicated that one can download new firmware to make it do that, but how many users have the skill or persistence to do that?) but my computer (Dell Optiplex 745) does not recognize it at all (thus Windows Media Player 10 cannot synchronize to it). Bottom line: I have a VERY expensive and not very good miniature FM radio.

<Title>Bigger is Better
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have used a 500MB version of this exact player every day for almost a year now. I download then play talk radio programs and then delete them. I put the player in the USB port, delete what I have heard and then sync new programs daily. It works great! The 2GB player is for my music. The one drawback is, it only works with Windows XP.

<Title>Great Player....UPDATED
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased this mp3 player to replace and older failing flash player. The yp-u2j seems to work great thus far. The sound is fantastic. The battery charges quickly and lasts at least 10-12 hours when used conservatively. It is apparently replaceable but you have to open the unit up which would void the warranty. It fully charges in about 2.5 hours via the usb. The fm tuner works quite well, even getting some stations that i cannot receive on my home stereo. The headphone jack is on the side of the unit and not the top so if you don't have a right angle headphone plug it may get annoying. I find it to have really nice sound.        The only real problem I have with it is that directions are not as friendly as they could be. I had an issue with FF and RW large files but i have discovered that you can manually adjust the FF and RW interval to be from 1 sec to 1 min VERY convenient as I listen to large 3+ hour files frequently. You can also change the skip feature from skip to next file to skip ahead at an interval from 1 sec to 1 min. This is a great feature that is surprising to find on such a small player. I think i now give it 4.5 stars...   The only negative is you must have WinXP and Media player 10 to manage files...

<Title>I recommend it
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being a mother of teenagers, I have some familiarity with MP3 players.  The most common cause of breakdown for my sons has been the unit into which one plugs the headset...it wiggles free and then you can't use your headset with your MP3 player.  I have not had this problem myself with this Samsung unit (though I am not a teen).  My only problem has been the breakage of the "hold" button, which I used constantly.  I will miss it but the unit performs well, has great clarity, is easy to plug and play and charge and drop songs into its folder.  I don't need its light use or its voice recording so do not use them.  I hope this is helpful to you who wish to not give Apple your business so that competition remains in the industry.

<Title>Good Player, Better Price
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Of course, all the cool kids have an iPod, but I just couldn't see myself dropping the money for the shuffle, the nearest comparable device.  The YP-U2JQB has 2 Gigs of Memory, which is a convienent size, made even more useful by the fact the the device doubles as a fully functional USB drive which, in my case, was one of my buying criteria.  It's strange to note how few devices out there have built connectors for interfaceing with a USB port; many other devices- even those that claim dual use as a USB drive- still require the use of an ancillary cable.  As for the sound, It's impressive how much sound this little device puts out, even with the included button headphones.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, the audio output is on the side, which is definately odd, but not unmanageable.  The cap fits on very firmly, which should help keep it from getting lost.  You can get other MP3 players out there with more features, or more memory, however for the price, this particular device is more than sufficient.  The only drawback that I saw was samsung does not include a lanyard, which seems to be a glaring oversite as the device has no other way to secure it to anything such as a strap, shirt, or pocket.  However, they are inexpensive and can be picked up at virturally any kiosk that sells celular phones.  As for the display, it is small, but bright, though this makes it slightly more inconvienent when working with files with complete ID2 tags (If you don't know what that means, then it probably doesn't matter).  The primary control buttons are easy to use, but there are additional buttons on the side which are quite small, possibly a wee bit more challenging for clumbsy fingers.  As for the "light effect", it's blue, and doesn't stay on for very long.  A feature that serves little other purpose than cosmetics... too bad as it could have made a neat little flashlight.

<Title>WARNING: This unit will not work with WMP 11, at least not yet!
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The YP-U2J will not be recognized by WMP 11, which is the latest edition of Media Player. The Instillation CD with the unit has the old WMP 10 to download in order for the unit to be recognized. If you have the new WMP 11, you have to "System Restore" to a time before you upgraded to WMP 11 then make sure you install the old WMP 10. [...]Samsung has a download center for the unit software, but the new drivers for YP-U2J are not posted for downloading as of 2/27/07. These drivers are needed for WMP 11 no matter what size unit you get, .5, 1, or 2 Gig. So be Aware of this before purchasing one.

<Title>Audio player functions conflict with USB Flash Drive functions
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Samsung YP-U2J 2GB unit a couple of days ago, and boy did it cost me some hours of lost sleep. I was told when I bought it that it was both an MP3 player and a USB Drive. That is both true and false...there is something few people know about. There are two modes of USB operation for devices like this. One is the old fashioned UMS (aka MSC) mode, where you plug it into USB and it shows up with a drive letter. That's what I expected, but I didn't get it. The other mode was devised by Micro$oft to protect subscription music. The other mode is called MTP (Media Transport Protocol). I was very disappointed to learn that my new YP-U2J defaults to MTP, meaning it ONLY works as a music player, not as a USB Flash Drive/Thumb Drive. Under MTP, you can't see the unit as a drive letter. You can only sync music with it from a Windows machine. Not good...  With hours of research, I learned that it's possible to download a different version of firmware for the Samsung YP-U2J which makes it default to MSC/UMS flash drive mode, which will work on any computer. There are some complications, so re-flashing the firmware is not recommended for everyone.  What everyone should do is to INSIST that Samsung implement a menu option to switch between the two modes, similar to what SanDisk has on their Sansa C240 and other MP3 players.   The sound on the Samsung YP-U2J is fantastic!

<Title>Works great!  Definitely recommend it.
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just purchased this model today from Best Buy.  I really wanted a small thumb drive/MP3 player.  For the money I thought this was a pretty sweet deal.  I saw the other reviews and was a bit concerned.  The good news is I did not experience any of the problems noted.  This device does function great as a thumb drive AND MP3 player.  I was able to throw some of my work files on it.  Yeah, it's using MTP, so what - this didn't limit my use of the device?  I was able to directly drag and drop MP3 files (unprotected) into appropriate directories and play them.  Yeah, you don't get a drive letter, but it shows up under the "Other" folder in "My Computer".  I simply opened it and started navigating through the file system on the device.  I did not have to use Windows Media Player.  However, I found I like using WMP to manage content on it.  And it does work just fine with WMP 11 (I'm using version 11.0.5721.5145)- I have sync'd with it - WMP 11 recognizes the device.  I'm not sure what the issues were with the other customers of this product.  I was not using this device with WMP 10.  My first use of the device was with WMP 11.  Maybe there are migration issues if you were using it with WMP 10 and migrated to WMP 11.  I did NOT bother with the CD shipped with the product - you don't need it.  Just get your WinXP system current (Windows Update), make sure WMP 11 is running properly, then simply "plug and play".  I'm really happy with this product and highly recommend it - works as advertised.  I hope the other customers can get their issues resolved.

<Title>Great quality sound, but useless without WMP 10
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Microsoft and it's attempt to enforce DRM by insisting that all music devices use MTP transfer protocol (meaning you must use Windows Media Player version 10, which also means you have XP, maybe Vista) have rendered what would undoubtedly have been a great little player practically useless.  Don't think you can easily flash the firmware either.  Samsung has bowed to M$ pressure and modified the firmware that used to be available on their global downloads so that you cannot simply grab one of those, flash and use as described by some other reviewers.  If you have XP, and WMP 10 and don't mind using it to transfer your files instead of simply drag-and-drop, by all means buy this.  Otherwise, look for that Plays for Sure logo, and run away from it!

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player and USB Drive
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is easily the best mini MP3 Player out there. So much so, I bought one after it was discontinued even!  NOTE: The US version of this player is an MTP device (not a USB Drive) that plugs into a USB port.  HOWEVER: By pressing the reset button (with a paper clip) and the play button, you can perform a HARD RESET of the player and install the Korean firmware on it ... Result? A full USB Drive! Search the internet for details on how to do this!  With the Korean firmware (yes, the menu text can be set to English), it is the BEST MP3 player on the market.
