<Content>I wasnt expecting anything big, but this actually has a joystick instead of the standard buttons, and the screen is very detailed. Very easy to use, just copy and paste and you are ready to go!!!

<Title>Great player that never got the press it deserved!

<Content>I was looking for a small MP3 player that would allow me to use an SD card.  I was hesitant to try the MyMusix, because it was apparently no longer in production.  Since the price was right, I decided to try it.  I purchased it a couple of months back and product reviews were few and far between.  I have been so pleased, that I am about to purchase another one to have as a backup!  The unit is great.  It is light weight and easy to use.  Battery life is excellent.  The only slight drawback is it doesn't remember where you were when you shut it off (or your settings), but this is only a drawback when listening to audio books.  It has a firmware upgrade that allows you to have folders one layer deep.  This allows you to have several folders of different types of music, and to randomize (or repeat) within just that folder, or all folders.  One of the primary reasons I was looking for an SD player, is that it allows me to use the same card in my Axim PPC.  I normally keep a card in my Axim that has both music and gps software.  I have a second card that I use for books.  I can now swap the cards between the two devices at will.  It's too bad this player didn't get a little more press.  I think if it had, there would have been many more SD MP3 player options on the market.

<Title>Great player, with minor hardware quirks...
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a great player, with good sound and battery life.  HOWEVER, keep in mind:  1. There are 4 versions of the firmware. 1.00.17 (stock firmware), which does NOT support subfolders, 1.0018 (update on the mymusix.com web site), 1.00.20 (update on the mymusix.com site, you need to be at 1.00.18 to install this!), and an unofficial 1.00.25 which adds saving and restoring of the default preferences, even when you drain the battery.  2. It's possible to insert the mini-USB cable backwards.  3. If the unit doesn't power up... CHECK THE BATTERY connections!. There's a metal pin that should touch the positive side (+) which doesn't always touch it (force it so that it gives enough pressure against the battery).  4. The contacts on the SD memory socket can get dirty or worn out  after much abuse, so it's better to just buy a high-capacity SD card, insert it, and leave it there. Do all the file copying and management through the USB cable and from your PC.  It's linux compatible, which was a big plus for me. I just plugged it into my linux notebook and saw a new drive on the Gnome desktop.  It weights almost nothing. It's great to have while exercising hooked as a "necklace".  However, the included earbuds are average. I suggest you get a better set of headphones. I use the Panasonic clip-on ones.  For more info and pictures, see my review at theinquirer.net.

<Title>Good, solid, basic mp3 plauer
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent mp3 player. Excellent sound quality, build quality, etc. Its only fault is that it just doesn't have enough features to fit my taste. For what it does have, however, it performs excellently. Here are some pros and cons:  PROS: -Extremely easy to use and upload music. On some other sites with reviews for this player, people complained that it was difficult to understand and upload music. I just don't see how that's possible! I'm far from tech-savvy, and I didn't even have to read the manual. I just clicked the SD card into its slot, plugged in the USB cable into the player and my computer (which recognized it instantly as a removable drive), went to my music folder and copied and pasted songs into the player, and VOILA! that was all there was to it. Even if that was too hard to understand, the manual explains everything even more clearly. -Nice and compact. It can literally fit in the palm of my hand (and I have a small hand). Even if its in my pocket I sometimes forget its even there! -Great sound quality. Even with the included no-name brand earphones, the quality was excellent. When I used some of my own earbuds, it got even better.  CONS (Warning: there are a lot more than pros, but these are really just annoyances that can be gotten over and don't lower my high opinion of this player in any way.): -Practically impossible to see screen without backlight lit. But I just set the backlight to always be on, and that solved the problem without eating up too much battery life in the process. -Scratches easily. Not as easily as an Ipod Nano (trust me, I've seen how those scratch), but still, a little roughousing with it and some pretty ugly scratches can show up. I cover it with plastic most of the time so there aren't too many on mine. I wish they made cases for it. -Flimsy battery cover. I wish it was attached to something, it can easily get lost (and I do NOT feel like paying $10 for another one on eBay) -SD card sticks out slightly. This isn't a problem for me, but it may be for you if you're worried about accidentally pressing the card while the player is on and losing or corrupting an expensive 1 or 2GB sd card. -*This is only for people who haven't upgraded the firmware* The player does not support folders until you upgrade on the mymusix website, and it does not save settings until you e-mail customer service asking for the 0.25 version (however, I recommend asking for the 0.24 version instead because in the 0.25 version you must manually select settings to be saved on restart and in the 0.24 version it automatically saves the last setting you selected on restart. It also resumes at the last track playing on restart (although not on the exact time, only the beginning of the track. -Not enough features for me. This player is a solid mp3 player, and that's about it. It has a hole for a microphone function and an icon on the lcd screen labeled "PRE" for an FM tuner function, but when I e-mailed customer service asking about them they replied that they were not supported for some strange reason. I was disappointed, but decided to get another SD mp3 player - the Coby MPC-751 - which supports these features. It's supposed to be coming in the mail today. Hopefully I'll have another good review to write soon!

<Title>Missed it by THAT MUCH!
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a review of the awesome little MP3 player that might have been. I love this little player... okay, I COULD love this player. I really didn't expect this review to be a gripe session, but unfortunately this player isn't what it could be.  I specifically wanted an MP3 player that would work with SD cards because they are inexpensive and reusable should my MP3 player ever become unusable. I almost bought a 4 Gig SD card for this but 2 GIGABYTES IS THE LIMIT. This limitation is unfortunate, but not a deal killer.   The sound is great, especially on the "Rock" equalizer setting. I would have thougth Jazz or Live might be better, but to my ears and my wife's ears all of the settings but Rock sounded a bit tinny. Again, so far so good.  This leads me to this player's first fatal flaw: You can't save any of the settings. Another reviewer said that this only matters for books. Wrong! EVERY TIME you turn it on you have to set the Equalizer (unless you like the tinny standard setting), then you have to set the song you want to start on (because believe me, you WILL get sick of the first 10 songs in the list). This is a bigger problem than it sounds like, because the player shuts off after only a couple of minutes. Answer the phone, set the settings. Get a drink of water, set the settings. Bio break, set the settings. You get the idea. It's excruciating.  And you know that big disk in the center that you see in the photos that you obviously use to switch songs? It's just decoration. That little tiny "nib" in the center is a "joystick" that you use to select settings/songs. It is a delicate operation that will make you stop what you are doing in order to tend to your player. Definitely not a one-handed operation. I tend to use the tip of my fingernail because it's just too easy to select the wrong thing because pressing down on the joystick is the select button.  But wait, it gets worse. If the player EVER touches ANYTHING it suddenly loses its mind and says "no card." The only recovery from this situation is to shut off the player, REMOVE THE CARD, re-insert it (carefully because other reviewers said it wears out) and--you guessed it--set the settings again. I can't imagine that the person who said it was good for working out has ever actually tried it. I got a "no card" within 30 seconds.  Again, I really wanted to like this player. As it is I think I'm going to hook it up to a Sonic Impact T-Amp and a power supply so that I can leave it on FOREVER so that I don't have to set the settings every time I want to listen to a song.  Finally, the shuffle function doesn't work. It repeats the same songs just a few songs apart, and if you ever skip forward to a new song and go one too far ("oh, I like that one...") if you press the back button it's just a random song, not the one you just saw.  If this player didn't have an unreliable SD card slot, if it could handle cards greater than 2 Gig, if it saved settings and had a real shuffle function, it would be great. As it is it's just not worth the trouble.
