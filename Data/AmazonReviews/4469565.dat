<Title>2 HUGE problems with this player!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>1.  It will NOT play any songs purchased from Itunes.  (Itunes songs are MP4, but this player ONLY plays MP3 format. Who knew???)    2.  There is a FUNDAMENTAL, SERIOUS design flaw with this player.  If you attempt to rotate/twist the bottom white band (which you must do in order to skip ahead to another song or go backward to a different song), the entire bottom cover of the player FALLS OFF!  Seriously, this happens every time.  I'm an adult and no matter how careful I am, I simply cannot skip to a different song without the bottom cover falling completely off the player.  BTW, I purchased 2 players, and BOTH have this problem.

<Title>Good Product, Good Price, Good for kids!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Shaker for my son (he is a year old, but loves music).  It came with some childrens songs on it, which was good for him.  I put a variety of pop, jazz, rock, and hip hop music on it and he just carries it around dancing and laughing.  The size is perfect for him and the built in speaker is the main selling point.  We have had the product for over a month with no problems.  We also use it while preparing and cooking meals. Thanks SanDisk for making an MP3 player for my kid.

<Title>Perfect for kids - and great for the price!
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched MP3 players for my 4 yr old for months before deciding which one to get her for Christmas. I decided on the Sansa Shaker 512MB (at the time I was looking they did not have the 1GB option). I could not be happier with the purchase. When reading reviews you could read 10 good and 1 bad and just not know what you are buying. Even though there were a few lower reviews for this I bought it anyhow. BOY, am I glad I did. The speaker function is great. My daughter likes the headphones and has no problem wearing them in the car or when we ask her to but otherwise she just plays it out loud and dances around the room with her sister.   It is a bit of a pain that you have to convert the files to MP3s but not so much of a pain that you'd not get the item. I transfer whole CDs at a time for her and it only takes a few minutes.   As other reviewers have mentioned, our "shaker" function does not work either - and trust me, she's shaken the thing! Not that big of a deal though. She knows how to move it to the next song by using the ring at the bottom. She also had no issues using the power button. You do have to hold it down for a few seconds but it makes a little sound when it's shutting off so she knows it's done it.   She's used it a considerable amount since Christmas and I've only had to change the battery once. It's nice that it just takes a AAA battery because you don't have to connect it to the computer to recharge it.  I did find that she was dropping it on the floor while dancing or she'd set it down and it would fall so I added a neck lanyard to the clip thing on the side so she can wear it around her neck. Voila! Problem fixed!  This is well worth the price you pay. My own MP3 player was three times the price and just died out of the blue. I'm thinking of getting one of these for myself except for it has no display, which is nice if you are an adult.

<Title>Perfect for Tweens
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My 10-year old daughter got this for Christmas from her uncle and she loves it.  I was wanting to buy her an mp3 player but the good ones were so expensive.  He discovered this one online and bought one for her and his step-children.  She loved the colar and how it was so easy to carry.  It is very simple to download the music onto the palyer and it holds tons and tons of songs.  My only complaint is that it goes through batteries fast which is way I did not give it five stars.  If you are looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for your tween this is the way to go.

<Title>My kids love it!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've now bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids (age 5 & 7).  For this age group especially, this is a great player as there's an integrated speaker.  The one downside is that it does only play mp3 files, so I sometimes have to go a round-about way to convert wma and m4p files to mp3.  (But, it can be done at no expense through iTunes, at least with a Mac.)  My 7 yr old got one for Christmas, and so far, we've had no issues with it.  (My 5 yr old just got one to be like her big brother.)  As with most electronic items, it can tend to go through batteries fairly quickly.  But, we've had less issues with that by switching to lithium ones.  Overall, a great, inexpensive player for younger kids!!

<Title>Good for the young and young at heart
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this mp3 player for my mom, who is not too tech savvy, so she can listen to podcasts of radio broadcasts that she missed.  Although this player is definitely aimed at children, it's also great for anyone in need of a simple player.  There are several features that made the Sansa Shaker the ideal purchase for my mom: 1) an external speaker, since she doesn't like using headphones 2) uses a AAA battery, this way mom doesn't have to worry about recharging through a USB port, or buying an extra charger 3) uses an SD card, this is actually good for me since I'm the one filling up the player, using my computer's built in SD-card reader it's extremely easy for me to get the podcasts on the device, and it allows for cheap memory expansion  I have to say that the quality of the external speaker is pretty good given the players small size.  The only downside we have discovered is that powering down the Sansa Shaker results in losing your place.  Not a problem with music, but more annoying with a long podcast.  Although you can fast forward through the podcast, it's a bit cumbersome to do with the "ring" control and no time elapse display.  Otherwise, mom and I are both extremely pleased with this product.

<Title>My kid loves it..
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 7 year old's b-day and we've had it for over a month now. She absolutely loves it!! She thinks that shaking it is so much fun, and so far it has lasted through all she's put it through. I especially love the speaker feature so she doesn't have the ear pieces in all the time, plus we can listen together if we want. I like the AAA battery and it lasts for quite a while, especially considering how much it's used. It was very easy to use even for me, this was my first experience with an mp3 of any kind and I didn't have any problems.  It was a bit of a hassle to load songs cause it doesn't take wma, but solved that by loading a free switch program to convert them to mp3. It also doesn't have a menu so you can't choose what song you want to listen to. Plus no shuffle feature, just goes through one CD at a time. It's ok for kids, they don't seem to mind much, but it is kind of annoying to listen to her shake through 25 songs before she finds the one she wants. That's my main reasons for not giving it 5 stars.   Overall, I'm very happy with and my kid loves it!

<Title>Good Enough
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old because I was sick of having her music blasting out of my laptop. I particularly bought this model because of the speaker - I didn't want such a young kid using earphones. So far, it's done pretty well. It goes through batteries quickly - but it only uses one AAA. Once in a while, it will play a new song really slowly, like the wrong speed on an old record player, but we just turn it off and back on and it's fixed. I'd say the biggest pain is that I had to work around all of my itunes music being protected in order to get them onto this device. But once I did that, it's been pretty useful.

<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i got this for my 5 year old niece and didnt really know if she was gonna like it or use it for more than a few days, but she loves her sansa shaker, its really easy and fun to use, and she loves to listen to music with the speaker on, which i find great cuz headphones can be dangerous at such young age. It comes with some stickers to decorate. I would have liked to have a bigger range of color to decide from thou, but its not a big deal. It sounds fairly good, obviously with such a small speaker you cant expect a lot but for its size, it does the work. Plenty of memory space. It makes a great present. Price/quality is very good, i recommend it.

<Content>My 2 1/2 yr old daughter was jealous of her 6 yr old sisters "music box"- aka MP3 player. We got her this and she is thrilled and can operate it herself. I like that you dont have to have headphones to hear the songs, there is an speaker on the end and the sound is great. I also like that you load the songs on a SD card, that can be replaced with a larger capacity is desired. Great product, wonderful value!

<Content>This is a really nice mp3 player with a clear crisp sound quality. My daughter really loves it. It is nice to have the option of either using the ear buds or just playing it without. However, the battery life doesn't seem to last that long (3-4hrs continuous play) therefore I would recommend chargeable batteries. I would highly recommend this to anyone because you would be happy with this purchase.

<Title>Fun product for kids
<Date>Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We purchased the Sansa Shaker for my four year old for his birthday.  He is a kid who loves to rock out.  We loaded tons of his favorite songs on it, and he carries it everywhere.  It's pretty sturdy.  It's already been dropped a couple of times and it has held up well.  Good sound comes from the top and it is very kid friendly.  He learned how to operate it in under five minutes.  This mp3 player is PERFECT for him.  The only thing I don't like about it is the battery cap at the bottom of the player.  At first we couldn't get it off and now it just falls off randomly when you try to skip songs.  It is difficult to get it on just right.  Other that that I would recommend this player for kids up to age 10-  Any older than that and you might as well invest in a real iPod.

<Content>I bought this for our daughter and myself when we're outside player, so we can have a little music.  LOVE the built in speaker, don't why they don't all offer that.  It's very simple to use.  Cons: You just have a straight string of music (so you can't make folders, like kids songs, dance, me alone music).  But that's fine for what we wanted it for.  It didn't have a radio.  I assummed they all had one and didn't think to check.  But overall, I think it's a great product.  I love the shape and size.  It's easy to carry around.

I bought this for my 8yr. old and my 5yr. old so that they would leave mine alone and it's the best purchase I've made in a while. Granted the speaker option does get a little annoying when both of them are walking around without the headphones in but they really aren't that loud. Once they figured out how to scroll through the music they were good to go.

<Content>I bought these for my nephews, identical twins, who turned 7 on October 9th and are in 2nd grade.  Their dad had a bit of trouble at first (he is an I-Pod owner), but called the 800 number, where he, in just a few seconds, learned how easy they were to use.  Since then, not only did he download music onto the shakers, he has downloaded some of their favorite CD's (I did not even know that you could do this) to the shakers.  My sis-in-law, said that these are their favorite "toys" and do not go anywhere without them.  They think that Aunt Anna-Marie is the best...I highly recommend them!!!!!!

<Content>This product plays only MP3s and .wav files - not just any music file.  You can't find MP3s anymore - just MP4s, .wma, etc.  Therefore, you have to buy another $20 to $40 in software to convert the files to use it on this device.  Very disappointing.  Sure the package says "plays MP3s", but you have to take that literally - I did not.

<Title>His favorite Christmas present
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Kids naturally love music and this is perfect for my 6 year old.  The simplicity of holding the button and shaking it to change songs is entertaining and exhilarating for him.  Buying from Amazon gave me a better price than the retail stores in my area.  Parents face the same challenge as with any other MP3 player.  If you down-load from iTunes, you have to have some way to convert the songs to MP3.  The one negative feature I found is the slide bar used to manually switch songs back and forth is so close to the end cap that my son will unscrew the end cap when he is trying to change songs.  Overall, he is in love with this toy.

<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player for my 5 year old Grandson.  He absolutely loves it! He was really wanting one for Christmas, but I was worried about the small size of most players.  This MP3 player was perfect for him.  Small enough so he can carry it in his pocket and large enough for him to easily keep track of it. Also, I was worried about purchasing an expensive gift which he could easily destroy.  Not so in this case. The price was great and he has dropped it several times and it just keeps playing.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the ear plugs were too large for him.  We had to purchase separte one for his ears, but they would probably be alright for an older child.

My 2 year old saw it and loved it so much that when came across it she wouldn't give it back because she loved the music coming out of it. So we got her one. She will leave it in places like other toys, but when she see it again she will grab it and oh, she won't to bed without it because it plays her lullabies :)

<Title>Love this MP3 player!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Both my kids, ages 5 and 6, received these Shakers for Christmas...They LOVE them and use them ALL the time. We did buy them different earphones that are cushy and sit on the outside of the ear as the one you stick in your ear are too uncomfortable so they always wanted to listen to the songs through the external speaker (which sounds amazingly good). Well worth spending an extra $10.00 each for peace and quiet! Bottom line, they work great!

<Title>Sansa Shaker Review
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was doubtful about this because it was so cheap - and my 8 yr old daughter already has a 2 gig mp3 player.  However, the fact that it has a built in speaker has made it her first choice - as well as that of my 5 yr old son - I got them each one.  The device works well, is easy to synch, and has had no problems so far.  I gave it five stars, because for the target audience - it is truly perfect.  Very easy to use, and has a built in speaker.  The kids don't care that it sounds worse than the AM radio in my 1972 Chevy Nova - they love it.  Highly recommended for kids needing something simple to use.

<Title>Not a quality product  and bad customer service
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my 5 year old son for Xmas.  It stopped working after less than an hour.  I watched him play with it, and he did nothing to cause it.  The battery had a hard time connecting to the player.  Well, after 3 different sets of batteries (just to make sure)we contacted Sandisk and their customer service was terrible!  Long story short, they admitted I needed a new one after an hour on the phone, but it took 3 weeks to get a new one; explain that to a 5 year old.    I gave this 2 stars because it is the only one I could find with external speakers, which I prefer so he doesn't need earphones.  The new one has been working, but we had problems turning it off once, and the only way we were able to turn it off was to take out the battery.  THis seems to be a flaw in this model.

<Title>1st one defective, replacement also defective - bad luck or bad part?
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered this item for my 7 yr old niece for Christmas. The shaker aspect never worked and within two days there was an intermittent static problem while playing. Contacted Amazon and they were awesome about sending a new one out right way. I inspected the 2nd one before giving to the child and right out of the box the second one also had intermittent static issues while playing with and without the headphones.   Returned both and will be looking for a more reliable MP3 player for my niece.

<Title>Go with an I-Pod
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very frustrating.  I been working with this shaker for over an hour.  It loads the music fine, but will say Uh-oh when trying to play.  I have changed formats and nothing is working.  A big waste of $30 + shipping times two.  Both of my daughters are very dissapointed.  I will be getting them I-Pods and sending these back to Amazon. This little "gem" had very few instructions and the CD that came with it didn't have much more information.  I'd like to think I'm pretty well versed with a computer and couldn't crack the code on the shaker.  Good luck to the 8 year olds out there- maybe they will have better luck.

<Title>Taking it back...
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave this Sansa Shaker to my 6.5 year old daughter for Christmas today. Tomorrow I am taking it back and getting her a different one.  The idea behind this product is great. Perfect for young children around 6-10 years old, sounds pretty good, downloading songs was a breeze, it has an external speaker which is nice and the ability to have 2 headsets plugged into it at once is really great.  The problem with it, (and I consider it a big one and the reason why it is going back), is the design.  If you look at it in the photo's, you will see the bottom most white stripe. This stripe is used to forward and reverse through songs by way of twisting forward and back. The sliver of pink below that actually screws on and off to reveal the battery compartment and memory card slot. The pink sliver screws on and off with less then one quarter of a turn, therefore, when you are advancing through music you are unscrewing the cap. I have a feeling that SanDisk knew this was a problem because the cap is secured with string. So, my daughter walked around all day today with the cap dangling from the unit.  I would highly recommend to those thinking of buying this to reconsider and research other MP3 players.

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS is you plan on using Napster, Itunes, etc.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When you purchase an "MP3" player these days, you're actually expecting to be able to play not only MP3 files, but MP4 files, WMV files, and so forth.  This device, however, only actually plays MP3 files, which is noted in very small print in the instruction manual.  Music download sites like Napster & Real Rhapsody use WMV format.  You can get MP4 through Itunes, but not MP3s.  So that means you cannot download ANY music from the big music download sites onto a Shaker.  MP3 is now an "old" format.  Unless you're planning only on ripping songs from a CD to put on the Shaker, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I got this for my son for Christmas & am very disappointed that I cannot download any of his favorite songs onto it.  The product description needs to be much clearer about the severe limitations of the product.

<Content>My 8 year old nefew wanted an Mp3 player for Christmas. I wanted to find on that was for his age. I found the shaker and thought that that would be good for Him. I think it was a little funny that he had this look of horror on his face when we turned it on. I guess the Farmer In The Dell and Bingo were a little too childish to him. I was happy to help him with the music. All and all a good Mp3 player.

<Title>For a 6 year old . . .
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player appears to be a good starter for my 6 year old.  It is a great size and has pretty good sound.  The speaker is great and a nice alternative to headphones.  I also like how easy it is to load music (no special software, you just rip a CD to your computer and then drag the songs from the folder to your device).  What I do NOT like is how the end cap keeps falling open to expose the SD card and battery compartment, and it's not like I can tape it shut because it is attached to the part you twist to advance to the next song.  I haven't tried the earbuds that came with it since I don't like in-ear phones for my kids.  If I were to choose again, I would probably get her the thumb sized Coby MP3 I got my 8 year old.

<Content>Santa brought this for our 8 year old daughter. It was on the top of her Santa wish list and so she was very excited to get it. But then she opened it. It never really functioned properly, which I figured was due to "operator error" (the 8 year old) so I tried myself to use it. By the end of the first day it wouldn't even turn on anymore. Very disappointing.  I don't quite know how we'll send this back to the North Pole for replacement...

<Content>Santa brought this for my daughter who is 5! We love it! It sounds really good and she can operate it while dancing! It was a little tricky to download songs on it--I tried to do it from itunes, but, I didn't realize that itunes had 'protected' files so it wouldn't let me just automatically download them to the shaker.  I downloaded them to a disk and then uploaded them to the shaker...sure, it was an extra step, but once I figured it out, it was very easy.  We love that it has a speaker--and, for the money, it holds plenty of songs and the sound is a good quality.  No complaints!

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my two girls.  They are 3 and five years old.  They are easy for them to use.  The volume adjust when they are wearing earphones so I don't have to worry about damaging their hearing.  Also, the external speaker allows them to listen without the earphones and to share.  Speaking of sharing-this great little music player has TWO earphone jacks!  They can listen together with earphones as well.  The set up was very easy.  I love that it comes with a place for a expandable card.  I can fill up two or three and take them with me when we trave.  They are never bored.  I not only put music on them, but children's stories as well.  They love it!!!

<Title>Not worth the $$$
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I would not recommend this product. The iPod shuffle would be a better buy, and definitely better quality. I purchased two shakers as gifts. The bottom cover continuously unlatches on one and the other shaker stopped playing after about 1.5 weeks. I tried troubleshooting by reconnecting to the pc, but it was not recognized. Sandisk said this is a recurring problem and to connect to the USB ports at the back of the pc. Haven't tried that step yet (but sounds like more trouble than it's worth). Besides, I've been successful at connecting iPods and digital cameras just fine to the front USB ports. The battery life is AWFUL! Required a new battery after several hours of on and off play. Even with brand new rechargeable ones! Hope to send this cheaply made product back and get my money back to use towards the shuffle.

<Content>This is a great product.  The kids LOVE it.  They can plug in 2 sets of headphones at the same time to "share" the music.  It also has an external speaker that plays the music for all to hear when the headphones are not plugged into it.  The only real down fall is that it does not recharge via USB port like our other MP3 players do, it takes 1 AAA battery, this is the only reason I didn't give this product a 5 Star rating.  As I said the kids love it,so it is used a lot which means changing the battery every 4 days or so.  We have found a solution, we bought a rechargable battery set so there's always a new battery charged and waiting without having to buy stock in a battery company.  All in all this is a fabulous player for kids.  It is sturdy, easy to use, easy to upload to, comes with some kid songs on it, fun to shake and play.  My girls are 5 & 7. Hope this helps.

<Content>We love this, which our 6-year-old received for Christmas.  She is very proud to have her own big-kid music player, yet it's more fun than her big sister's!  Our only complaint is that you need to reload the playlist every time batteries are changed (which has been nearly daily, because she loves it so much!).  Volume levels are good, sound quality good for her age group.  We LOVE that two can listen, and that it has a speaker feature.  Fairly tough, though sometimes the on/off button is unresponsive.  Would give 4 1/2 * if I could.

<Title>Kids love but sometimes skips
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Works great with earphones.  If earphones unplugged, it will sometimes skip in the middle of a song.  We purchased 3 for our kids and they all do the same thing.  Called the company and they said we had downloaded a song with a virus.  They know you are not going to be able to go back through 6 hours of songs and check each song.   Kids are happy with product and use it all the time.  I think it is worth the $30 we paid.  Big enough for kids not to lose.  Really easy to use.  Loved that you have speakers to share songs with friends and pretty good sound.  Definitely for kids.

<Title>Kids' Sansa shaker, good with reservations
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this shaker, with a couple reservations.  The little reservation: the earbuds are too big to fit into my kids ears and stay there.  I heard a lot of "mom, they won't stay it" and "mom, it fell out" on a long car ride, then I bought them a cheap pair of old fashioned "over the head" earphones and that fixed the issue.  The big reservation:  It only plays music in MP3 format!  As a non-tech person I didn't know the difference so all my old ITunes wouldn't play.  It's been a pain converting things, and I haven't been successful with all.  I bought these for my kids and they love them!  They're durable, the kids can operate them (ages 5 and 8) and the colors (pink and blue) mean that they always know whose it whose.

<Title>Good Player for kids, but not perfect
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for my son who is nine. He has been asking for an MP3 player like his big sister's (Ipod Nano) and mine (Sansa e280). This player is almost perfect for him. It has several notable features: 1.Simple battery - runs on 1 AAA 2.Easy to load and change music - you can plug the player directly into your computer using the included usb cable or you can plug the included SD card into a card reader. Using either method you just drag and drop MP3 files onto the card for the player. 3. The small speaker is surprisingly loud so you can listen with or without headphones. There is also one feature that keeps me from giving 5 stars - the battery/sd card cover. This is located on the bottom of the player and seems to come off easily. It is attached by a small lanyard, so it probably won't get lost, but the fact that it does come open so easily is annoying. the problem with the cover isn't enough to deter me from buying the player or enough to make me want to return it. Even if I did want to return it, my son wouldn't let me. He loves it.

<Title>My favorite gift--Sandisk scores a success.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a gift for a grandchild but liked it so much I kept it for myself.  Of course, I could rationalize my selfish act since the child is barely 3 and Sandisk insists the device should not be used by anyone under the age of 8.  The reason for the manufacturer issuing the precaution is no doubt the potential harm to young children abusing ear buds.  But forget the ear buds: what distinguishes this device from an iPod (apart from its smaller, salt-shaker size) is the built-in speaker.  It puts out adequate sound for a musician who wants the companionship of his favorite tunes without the encumbrance of earphones.  As usual, Sandisk makes no claims for its products with respect to Apple computers or iTunes.  It works out of the box for an Apple downloader--no installation of programs needed--but most likely offers less storage space.  So if you're an Apple person, you may wish to consider the one-gig model.  (I've had no difficulty storing 30-40 minutes worth of mp3 files in the 512MB model.)  Frankly, this is a novel product, one that fills yet another niche.  I hope it catches on and sees a few improvements.    The pluses: Simple, instant, effective, minuscule--whether you're an adult or little kid.  Above all, no earphones required, and the claim of ten hours' worth of music on a single battery seems about right.  The minuses:  1. The "shaker" attraction is misleading.  I thought it meant a child could shake the gizmo to make it play (great ploy, since kids won't play the CDs I give them); instead, shaking it merely produces weird sound-effects and causes (somewhat erratically) the song being played to be replaced by another song--providing the play switch is depressed.  If it played a song whenever it was shaken, it would be great for a one- or two-year-old (on the other hand, then I would have had to give it to my grandchild.)  2. The bottom cover must be twisted loose to insert one AAA battery as well as the storage card but is somewhat difficult to get reseated tightly, especially since it's part of the fast-forward control assembly.  For added "security," the bottom cover is attached by a thin "safety" thread that no doubt will be an early casualty.    Perhaps a better-constructed device would be one with a single ear bud (forget the stereo), which would free up more space for batteries, card, and FF control (which could be eliminated for my money), along with a more traditional screw-in cover for the battery compartment.  Still, unless it breaks within a week, this mp3 player that contains a built-in speaker yet is smaller than a whiskey jigger is a winner.

<Title>Good but details need to be clearer!
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought this for a boy who isn't quite ready for a regular MP3 player but too old for the FP3 player.  The price is great and I like the sturdiness of the shaker but I really felt a couple of things weren't quite clear enough!  Primarily the part where ONLY MP3 formatted songs and stories can play on this.  This is a big deal and for those of us who are amatures it can be a BIG fuss.  Yes it came loaded with some kids songs but really who wants them?  My kids have their own personal favorites and of course they were not MP3 formatted so I had to get an additional program to format them. I also did not like the fact there was no screen for the kids to easily find their favorite tune or story.  All in all a good product but it literally took me all night to get it ready to give as a gift since I am not really used to these machines and I had to find a way to format everything to work on this.  I only have 1 CD that is MP3 formatted so it was a pain.  Also,  You can't work with these files in Windows Media Player so I had to learn another way to transfer the files.  Not a deal buster necessarily but I probably would have gone with the same MP3 players his brothers have if I had known that I would have to do all this extra stuff.  This one is not great for stories but we can make them work.  This is not a complaint about the machine itself but the programming/formatting parts.  If you already have a lot of MP3 formatted stuff and you are not trying to use any stories, then you will have little or no problems.  Everyone I know, including myself, did not have much already formatted MP3 this includes our downloaded songs.  It just made the experience more of a fuss than fun.

<Content>I bought the 1gb shaker for my son for Christmas.  I have given it four stars because for the 3 days it worked it was great.  It was very easy to set up and start [once I found the batter compartment...just read the book], but it broke today and I cannot get it to come on.  I have been in contact w/Sandisk's customer service and they are replacing the player and even sending me the shipping label.  So, due to the customer service I received today, I decided its worth the 4 stars.  Hopefully the next one won't break so easily.

<Title>My kids love this!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My six and eight year olds love these Sansa Shakers.  They have proven themselves durable, as one has already been left out in the sprinkler overnight and still works fine.  They love to groove to their tunes and have everyone else hear them too.  They clip them to their belts and bikes.  They are a great deal and very kid friendly.  The only downside is the bottom always falls off when twisting the bottom to change songs.  It's attached by a string, but it's still annoying.

<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the perfect first mp3 player to give your kids....as long as you are able to change your music format to mp3 or pam wav files.  I was expecting to be able to download my daughter's music from our windows media player, but no, it all has to be changed to a different format to play.  Now I have to buy a program to be able to change the formats of my music so she can listen to it.  For me, it would have been cheaper and easier to get a little bit more expensive sansa player that I can throw any kind of music on than buying this one.  If I could put my music on it the way it is formatted originally, this would would be the perfect little mp3 player.

<Title>Does not work well
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Purchased the Sansa Shaker for my son who is 5 yrs old. I downloaded songs for him and it worked for a day and then stopped. I thought it was the battery, but it was not the case(i changed it to different batteries). It turns on, but then it shuts off by itself. I am very disappointed at this product. It did work only for one day. I buy things from Amazon.com all the time, but this product was not good. I am wondering if i can return or something. I would not recommend it. My son is very upset because he liked the product when it last.  Kelly

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter loves her Sandisk when it is working.  From the parent perspective, it was very difficult to load songs on.  You have to make sure they are in MP3 format and most computers automatically convert to windows media.  After we finally figured that out we have lost the songs completely off of the media card twice.  When troubleshooting, we found that the card was corrupt and needed to be re-formatted.  When you re-format a card you must erase everything on it so it is a little frustrating.

<Content>These are awesome little things. My children are 6 and 9 yrs old and they love their MP3 player! They hold plenty of songs for the kids to enjoy, and if you have a memory card and a card reader with usb, you can copy them easily from your computer to the memory card, which is supplied with the shaker.  Now the shaker, we haven't been able to get them to change songs by shaking, but they are easy for them to control volume and change to the next song.  The ear phones are a little big for the smaller ears, so I got cheap headphones to go with them. I would definately recommend them for any child that loves music.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player for Kids!
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  The external speaker is great, and when you plug in the headphones, the volume adjusts so that it doesn't hurt little ears!  That is a very nice feature.  The value of this item for the price is top notch.  One negative, however, is that you will have to convert the music on your computer to MP3 format for it to work on the player.  Ripping CDs to your computer nowadays usually results in an M4a or M4p format.  Itunes songs are in the AAC format.  Converting these songs to MP3 format is easy, but it will require a converter program.  You can find a program like this on the net, and they are usually free.  I use Protected Music Converter, but there are several out there.  Anyway, the review would be 5 stars if it played music other than MP3.  I definitely recommend this item to parents.  It is a great first MP3 player, and your kid will likely know what it is when they get it.  Mine did!  She said "A Shaker!" right when she opened the gift.  Funny what kids know.

<Content>This item was a favorite Christmas present with my kids, 8 year old girls.  A bit smaller than I thought it would be, but has surprisingly good sound quality for it's size.  My kids love taking it around the house with them and listening to their favorite songs. Easy to use controls that the kids can operate and fun features, like shaking to change songs and cool sound effects. The only problem we had was figuring out which songs (and format, MP3) we could download (itunes wouldn't work for us).  Otherwise it was easy to hook it up to the computer for downloading. Overall, we were impressed and would recommend this product.

Thank goodness it comes with a few kids songs preloaded since I couldn't download MP3 songs on my computer.  I don't think it would be suitable for an older child since unlike most MP3 players you can't see which song is playing but my little one doesn't care about that; she just wants to dance.

<Title>Fantastic kid's alternative to an iPod!
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 512MB Sansa Shaker in pink for my 6-year-old daughter.  She has long coveted her teenaged sister's $300 iPod, but there was no way I was getting her one.  I chose this because of several features:  *Size makes it easier to keep track of *Two headphone jacks for sharing with her brother in generous moments *Single AAA battery provides power *Pink color would be a big hit *The seperate speaker lets her listen without headphones *Easy copy and paste when adding music (no complicated iTunes to use) *No digital readout to deal with (child doesn't have to be able to read)  She's had it for a week, and I think it's become grafted to her body!  To her, it's just as good as her sister's.  It came with 5 children's songs included, so it was ready to use right out of the box until we could add more music for her.  It also includes one AAA battery, a set of earbuds, and a 512MB card.  To add music, just load the music onto your computer, then drag or copy and paste onto the card, and you're set.  The battery says it will provide 8 hours of music.  In practical use, she got about two days out of it, and that was heavy use.  Walmart sells these in a 4-pack for 99 cents.  The earbuds were a bit hard for sich a little girl to manage, but my mom gave her a set of earbud-looking things attached by a piece that goes over her head (it's a fold-up set), and these have worked perfectly for her.  The speaker doesn't have a loud capability, so I don't have to wake up to music blasting throughout the house.  Not bad sound at all for such a little unit, though you won't be DJing a party with it.  She's perfectly happy with it.  The 512MB will hold hundreds of songs; more than any kid that age could ever need.  If for whatever reason you decide your child needs more space, just pay $20 for a 1G card later on.  The size is a bit smaller than I had expected.  It appears to be the size of a pop can, but I'd liken it more to the size of a salt shaker.  Just the right size to grip in a child's hand, but big enough to find in a messy house.  The flat iPods can become lost under as little as a sheet of paper.  It comes with a D-clamp to attach to a lanyard, but does not include the lanyard itself.  The stores were closed on Christmas Day, so I just made one from an old shoestring.  Bottom line:  It comes with everything you will need to run it right out of the box, including pre-loaded music, and it has been a fantastic hit with my 6-year-old.  The battery life is satisfactory (keep more handy).  I love this so much that I'll be buying the blue one in November when my son turns six!

<Content>Got two of these for my little ones, 3&4 years. They absolutely love it and are better at the shuffle shake than I am. It was also a great bonus to have 8 preloaded songs, 4 children and 4 classical. This made them playable right out of the packaging. Other reviews comment on the difficulty of opening the device to change batteries, I had no problem seeing the twist arrows on the cover itself. Battery life is just ok, would be better if the device did not blink all the time when in use.

<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My sister bought this (in blue) for my 7 year old for Christmas and he loves it!  I think that the size and ease of use is fine.  We discovered  that iTunes is not compatable so we had to transfer a lot of songs to mp3 format but not a big deal if you know how to do it.  Even if you aren't a techie most newer windows media players will walk you through the process of changing the format to mp3s.  Which is what I did.    The only design flaw that we found is at the bottom of the player.  It twists off to replace the battery and the SD card, and is attached by a string, but it pops open often when changing tracks by the bottom "ring" or when using the "shake" feature.  It doesn't get lost because of the string, but it slightly annoying to have to keep putting it back on.    Otherwise, this is a great little player!  Highly recommended for the price!  My son feels very grown up now that he has his own mp3 player!  Mom in the 'burgh

<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought 3 of these for my children.  Easy enough for a 4 year old to operate and an incredible speaker that any age can appreciate.  The only thing I didn't expect, which the kids have difficulty working, is that the play/pause button needs to be depressed prior to using the "shaker" feature to advance to a different song. The battery that came with them only lasted just under 2 weeks (This could be from the power needed to operate the internal speaker).  Overall, I highly recommend the Shaker for any age!

<Title>great idea, EATS BATTERIES
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I found the Sansa Shaker to be a great way for my child to enjoy his music on the fly. The only down fall of the Shaker is its battery consumption. A fresh battery lasts less than 1 hr. My son wishes it would last longer. In these times of global awareness I think there must be a more sesnible solution. My son (8 yrs. old) suggest copying the built in rechargeable battery technology found in Ipod, Zune and many others. I could not agree with him more. I don't feel the makers of this product were concidering the environmental or economic impact of batteries when this product was designed. Although this product costs conciderably less that the Ipod, it will cost you more in the end. Consider this: If your child uses this product for 2 hours a week (about 2 albums of music) you could have bought 4 gig Ipod for what you will spend in batteries and Ipods hold A LOT more music and have built in batteries. Furthermore, batteries are one of the most environmentally poisonious consumer waste products. In addition, batteries are potentially harmful, poisonious to humans. The warning clearly states to " KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN ". So, why design a product for use by children in 2007 that needs a battery every 40 minutes or so? ...I truly do feel that the idea and basic function of this product are brilliant but, not very well thought out.

<Content>Great little MP3 player. Was looking for something my adult mentally challenged son could operate, and something sturdy--this was the one! He loves it--push one button and he can play all his favorite songs, give it a little shake and it changes songs. (He also likes the fact that it's cute!) The built-in speaker is a HUGE plus, as earphones are very difficult for him. One hint--don't purchase songs on iTunes unless you are tech savvy. It was complicated for me to download songs from that sight--you can't just follow the instructions included with the player.

<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son loves this thing.  The best part is the built-in speaker and the sound quality is great.  Figuring out how to get the songs loaded was a task and the fact that you can't load iTune songs onto them due to the format conflict really sucks, unless you can figure out how to convert m4a's to mp3s. So I gave 4 stars. But the price is reasonable and it's very durable.  The "shaker" part is kinda cool since you can change songs by holding down the button and giving it a quick shake, or you have the option of turning the base.  What we don't like is the fact that you can only skip one song at a time and you can't fast-forward, much like the iPod Shuffle.  But even that's not a big deal.  Overall we like the product.  It comes with a key-chain to dangle on the belt-loop if you choose, and earphones.

<Content>we purchased the Sansa Shaker for my 4 yo daughter for Christmas and she loves it!!  We looked at several "kid" mp3 players and opted for this one even though I believe the recommended age is 8+, and she has no problems controlling it herself. She finds the songs she wants quickly and easily We chose this for its built in speaker option, it works great (and dual headphone jacks). And also because her sister has a different mp-3 that also takes SD cards and they can share.  Overall, It had everything we were looking for and works great!  I just love seeing her dance through the house singing all her songs!!!

<Title>kid friendly
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this MP3 player for my 4yr old son- It seemed like the most kid friendly option.  The player is easy to use but fairly sensitive- needs to be just so for the shake to be effective. Even so, my son has mastered it!   The most annoying bit for me is the tendency for the player to "freeze".  This is where it is stuck on a song and I can not fast forward, reverse or shut the player off.  I simply remove the battery and all seems to return to normal.  This is definitely one of his favorite toys- and my CD's are no longer getting scratched!!!

<Title>Great for kids!

<Content>If you're looking for excellent sound, this isn't for you but this is for my 3 year old and I love it!  She can listen to it without headphones, which I feel better about.  It is very hard for her to push the button and shake it at the same time to change the song so I would recommend it for at least 4 years and up but I still love it. I figure she'll figure it out sooner or later.

<Title>Awful !
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was a highly anticipated gift for Christmas - and what a dissapointment!  Not only does the bottom cap (which holds the battery and inputs) not stay closed.  We had major problems getting our music onto the shaker - we have no problem with our other mp3's.  I think the design needs to also be re-thought.

<Title>Great MP3 player for 7-9 year olds!

<Content>We bought this for our 7 year old for Christmas.  She has ear phones as well as amplified speakers she uses with it.  The sound quality is consistent with the price.  It has plenty of memory for her. It is also easy enough for her to use without problems.  Remember, itunes mp4 are not compatable with this player.

<Title>Well worth the money for my 7 year old daughter!
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this for my daughter.  I was disappointed when I received the first one and the bottom cap would not stay closed.  I returned it and was immediately shipped a new one (received in 5 B. days) and this one worked fine.  One thing to mention, I learned that not all music files are in the MP3 format; and therefore cannot be used in this device.  We had to pass on some of her favorite songs, and download others that were acceptable (not a HUGE deal to a 7 year old). So when downloading music, be sure that the files are MP3 and you shouldn't have any problems.  Sound quality is "toy like".

<Title>completely awful
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have never felt the need to write a review about a product before but this one is so bad, I just had to warn others. We got this for our daughter for Christmas. She saw the commercials on TV and, as she loves to sing along with all the pop songs she hears on the radio, we thought it would be good for her. While it is very simple to use, there are just to many flaws for that to matter. As other reviewers have noted, the battery cover falls off literally all the time. After only a few minutes of use, I had to tape it shut. That poses a problem since to change songs you have to twist the bottom. The shaking feature would be nice except even that is hard to use. You have to hold the button in for just the right amount of time and shake hard or it doesn't work. Hold it in too long and the thing pauses or turns off. All of this is not to mention the biggest and worst problem of all, adding music. I spent most of a Sunday trying to figure out how to get music on this thing. WMA and MP4s do not work. I found this out only after spending tons of $$ downloading my daugther's favorite songs for them not to work. Then I had to download "switch" software to convert the files. Unfortunately even the converted MP3s will not work. The only site I've found that actually had MP3s is Wal Mart but be careful, Windows Media Player will convert them to WMA upon download. It's a mess and had I not thrown the package away, this would be back at the store.

<Title>Stopped working after 6 days
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It was relatively easy to upload music except for the fact that they had to be in MP3 format and without my husband I would never have known how to do that. My son loved it and it had pretty good sound from the speakers, but after less than a week it just all of a sudden stopped working! Such a disappointment...

<Title>Nice Item

<Content>Great item for kids, it would be nice if it had a song display to choose your music but you can easily skip through the songs. Can't easily remove the factory programmed songs from the shaker. My daughter loves it.
