<Title>It's Fantastic
<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using it now for testing purposes at work and i've been taking it home everynight, the speakers are amazing and can easily fill a room with background music. No distortion atall.  The screen looks amazing and everyone i have showed has been amazed at the quaility of the picture.  It has not crashed once on me and it's played all video files i have tried apart from wma but firmware update will fix that easy.  The output to TV is fantastic and i have tried it on a HDTV but with only (red, Yellow and White) cables i dont see how it can give HDTV out.it looks nice none the less.  The menu is nice and easy to use and it has an ipod style volume/skip feature thats touch sensitive. it's great.  I would however not pay $500 for it and think around $350-$400 is more respectable.   I do love it though and could'nt live without it now.  any questions let me know  Gwatemala@hotmail.com

<Title>The best portable AV player

<Content>I bought it when it first went on sale at walmart.com in Jan, 2006.  Design is superb with the clamshell protecting the screen.  It handles most formats without fuss and without requiring too much effort.  Picture quality is outstanding and sound quality dizzying in its capability.  The one nitpick is that they haven't shipped the HD cable that would allow HD hookup to a HD-capable TV.  Other than that it's been fantastic.
