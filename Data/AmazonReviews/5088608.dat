<Title>New or Used?
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although this little radio/MP3 system is pretty decent, the capacity isn't what I'd hoped for music storage.  The radio, however, was my main impetus for purchasing it, and it does the job excellently.  I am dissappointed, though, to discover that it was refurbished when I deliberately chose to purchase the only one offered on Amazon as New in Box, paid a little more for it for that reason, and when it came it was obviously used with a limited warranty.  Not so cool Amazon.

<Title>great  as portable speakers
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to use as portable speakers for my other portable players when I go out of town,or on cruses. It is small and plays loud!and is rechargeable,no batteries to buy.I knew it did not have much storage for mp3 files.   I also use it in the shower. Works great in there.You can hear it over the running water.  I don't think the radio works so great,at least where I live.It worked better out of town.It should have a bulit in antenna,like any portable radio does,not that dum plug in cord,that you can loose.   I knew what I was buying,works great for me.For a refurbised item you would'nt know it,looks new.(4 stars because of cord antenna)

<Title>Lousy for Podcasts

<Content>I don't usually don't have problems with installing new hardware (I used to work in IT), yet this system is a mess.  Software installation CD didn't come with it as the instructions indicated, creating software problems.  Philips customer service simply tries to get you off the phone and have you call back to talk to somebody else.  They've had me call back three times and now call another company.  I've been working on this thing for 3 hours trying to set it up, and it still won't recognize standard MP3 files.  I can't comment on whether the unit is any good, since I can't get it to store a single MP3.
