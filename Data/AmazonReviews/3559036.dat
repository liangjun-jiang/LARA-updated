<Content>My husband and I bought this little mp3 player for my daughter for Christmas from Sam's Club for only $19.99.  I can see why now!  I have yet to be able to add any songs onto it.  For one, the directions are rather vague, so I started adding songs to the player, but then realized that apparently I was supposed to create files.  Now I can't delete the songs that are now only listed in some sort of computer language on my computer-my computer keeps telling me that the device is disconnected, but it is still connected.  When I tried to call their tech support number from the website, I was stuck in some loop pressing the same numbers for 10 minutes.  When I called back, I was told their tech support guy would be back in a week (apparently there is only one person working it).  I guess I'm used to the ease of Ipod or even the Creative mp3 players.    Next time I'll remember that when it appears to be too good to be true-it probably is!
