<Content>Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

<Content>to anyone thinking of buying this ipod i would suggest otherwise this is the only ipod i have ever owned so i can not generalize and say that all ipods lack good qualitybut, this does. I had by ipod for no even a year (and took good care of it, not dropping it, carrying it in a protective case) and it died. Just randomly died one day the ipod with the sad face and the exclamation point came up. So thank God i had a warrenty, i got it replaced for free. Everything was great i got it replaced in July 2006, it is now October 2006, and the new one died yesterday. Same thing as the last a "hardware problem". However, now my warrenty is up so in order to get it repaired, i will be charged, and im sure by december it wil have broken again. That is not a chance i am willing to take. As of now i have promised myself to never again purchase a ipod. I am now lookin to purchase either a Philips 30gb mp3 player or a Zen mp3 player, hopefully i will have better luck with either one.  if you purchase this item, good luck =]

<Title>An Outstanding and Very Reliable Music Player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third iPod, and just like the one's before it, it has delivered consistent performance and high quality sound. The iPod is a great looking player and the color screen adds a wonderful dimension for viewing photos and album art. I never have to worry about developing or printing photos anymore; instead I load them onto my iPod to share with friends and family (it's a lot easier than carrying around a photo album).  I've owned this particular player for a over a year now, and have never had any technical problems with it. I used to use it on a Windows computer before making the switch to a Mac, and I experienced seamless integration with both operating systems. It is very, very easy to put music on it with iTunes. The iPod has the most simple, easy to use user interface of any music player on the market, and the click-wheel makes navigating menus, photos, and music effortless.  Another important point is sound quality. I have listened to my iPod through ear-bud headphones (included Apple ear buds), in-ear headphones (Ultimate Ears), over-the-ear studio headphones (Sony DJ Headphones), and desktop speakers (Klipsch 2.1 Multimedia Speakers). No matter what the medium the iPod delivers consistent, quality sound, even at high volumes, with minimal distortion. The entire frequency range is heard through the iPod, which is particularly important to me.  There is a reason the iPod has taken off in the past few years, it consistently delivers great sound and features through an elegant and intuitive interface.

It is hard to find hardware and accessories for it because they don't make it anymore. I would definetely advise to NOT buy this product. Used ones can be good if they come at a good price.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 20GB Photo Ipod uses a superb audio computer chip that surpasses the current IPOD classic model and previous IPOD video models.  The bottom line is that I previously owned  The 5th generation 30GB video for 18 months. I replaced it with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD it sounds better in my car and on my bose digital sound dock. I purchase an MP3 player for sound quality not looks. Hopefully apple will improve the audio computer chip for the current IPOD models. Until then if you want CD quality sound you cannot go wrong with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD.

<Title>piece of you know what...
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'd give this latest ipod less than one star if I could.  I've had two in the last week and they've both been pieces of crap.  The first one worked fine for a few days before it just wouldn't turn on one day.  This was about three days into it.  Thankfully Target took it back with no hassles and gave me a replacement.  I figured I'd just gotten a dud.  I mean hey...it happens with even the best brands.  I got it home, loaded it with music and again it played fine for a day or two.  The first time I went to charge it after the initial charge before I ever played it, it froze.  I unplugged it from the charger and it was frozen on the select language screen with the LCD lit up, which won't go off until the battery dies I guess.  Here's hoping Target is as cool about taking this one back.  I defintely won't be getting one of the same kind.  Maybe I'll pay a little more and get one up, or even better my money back.    I think it's because this is the first generation of the affordable color display.  Apple defintely has some bugs to work out of this sucker.  My first ipod still plays great so I think it's just this particular model.  Still, what a disapointment and a hassle.

<Title>Apple iPod 20GB Review
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the new iPod but now it comes standard with a color screen. The normal iPod's now come in a standard 20 gigabyte form and the high-capacity 60 gigabyte form. The 20GB holds 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos or 15,000 songs or 25,000 photos for the 60GB. This new iPod is a little bit larger than the original though, 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.63 inch weighing 5.9 ounces. But, they have upgraded the battery life from 12 hours to 15 hours, which is nice but I would like to see an iPod with a little more life. These are the supported audio formats: AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes Music Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, WAV, AIFF / Frequency response: 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Here are the supported photo display formats: Syncs iPod-viewable photos in JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PSD (Mac only) and PNG formats. The accessories that comes with this device include: USB 2.0 and Firewire 400 (with Firewire cable, sold separately), Composite Video (with AV cable, sold separately), and headphones. So all together this looks like a very good iPod. I'm probably not going to buy it though because I already have a 20GB monochrome screen iPod and I don't think I need another one with a color screen. But if you are a first time iPod buyer I would recommend this or if you need more room to store yours songs get the 60GB. It's a great deal and especially now you can't resist it (20GB iPod Photo now same price as old monochrome iPod, $299.99)

<Content>Well!! Well!! Well guys. What we need is a sleek, perfectly designed, aesthetically pleasing, great sounding player for music. Thats what the latest iPod Photo is. Photos? thats a goodie. Well what I am trying to say is, you cant compare it to any other MP3 players in the market. iPod is in a league of its own.  A device that does one thing perfectly and for long, is what we need. Offcourse we could have a camera on it, a voice recorder may be, AM/FM ow thats a must!!, Cell phone? Make it an organizer....How about a microwave? Yea Rrright... I have played with most of them.....iRiver, Zen, Sony...The all in one paradigm of thought, eventually leaves us with none in one. Being a hardware designer myself, I wouldnt buy an all in one device. Take the iPod in your hand look at it, play it, use it...you will realize that this was created by a buncha cool dudes with passion for design, looks & music. They certainly had problems in their earlier versions. This device shows that they really have made an effort to overcome them to please you. Not merely make it a 'throw in more' competition. I think I see a remarkable betterment in the quality and fedility of the music output. A 20G can hold a lot of songs in its stomach. I wouldnt use it for file storage because you can assemble a 100GB pocket disk that requires no battery, power or recharging for $150. So, I wouldnt go for more than 20GB iPod. No wonder it is so popular.   So, Go for it!! You'll enjoy it.

<Title>This is a great product! 
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great product. It's the new and improved iPod 20 GB, same price ($300). Runs up to fifteen hours, which means I can listen to it a few hours a day and charge it every three or four days. Things you'll probably need for this product:  1. A case. Definitely. It could fall or get dirty quite easily.  2. If you like to go for rides on bike, or drive a lot, you'll need a remote control. You can easily and quickly push the buttons to skip or go back to a song.  3. A recorder. If you attend a lecture, or if you're still in school, you can easily record stuff and go back to it. I bought iTalk. Crystal clear, and good. But make sure your earphones are out when you record stuff.  I like playing games in color (the four games: bricks, solitaire, parachute, and music quiz. In music quiz, you try to identify songs that you already have stored on your iPod), and being able to put the album pictures on my iPod. Plus, I can put photos on my iPod and look at them wherever (as long as I have my iPod with me.) If I go on a trip with my camera, and run out of space, I can quickly put the photos on my iPod and then take more pictures. I can take up to 20,000 pictures, so space is not a problem at all (up to 5,000 songs). Plus, I can also put a slideshow on. The scroll wheel is easy to use, although not at first. If I put my iPod in my backpack, there is a "lock" button at the top, so that even when the buttons are pressed, nothing will happen. Volume control is easy.  This product is great; I reccomend it to anyone who wants an iPod.

<Content>The color iPod is the best electronic item I have owned so far... and I've owned a lot. To summarize:  - The Click-wheel is awesome, simple and superb to use - The color screen is great, clear and bright - The sound quality is quite good, though the headphones could handle bass better - iTunes is equally simple to start with, has good enough capabilities. Handling audiobooks is slightly counter-intuitive - The battery life is close to what's reported, though using the backlight and skipping through songs drains it significantly - One capability I seriosly miss in the iPod is song search capability. That would be the icing on the cake.  So far, soooo good. Can't have enough!

<Title>Buy the protection plan!
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan when determining whether the iPod is a good deal or not.  Mine failed two weeks after the warranty expired.  My options?  Send them the failed iPod and $255 + tax and they send me a used or refurbished model with a 90 day warranty.  Basically they just want you to buy a new one.  Had I known that up front, I would have passed or at least made sure I bought the protection plan.  I got exactly 1 year out of mine and now it would cost me more to have it serviced than to buy a new one, so it is completely worthless.
