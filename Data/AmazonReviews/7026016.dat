<Title>Jusr Right for the Gym
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This my fourth Ipod, and second shuffle.  I bought this specifically for when I am at the gym or working in the yard.  THe clip is substantial, and will endure mistreatment.   And the price was reasonable.  I find the sound quality just fine (though I use third party headphones), and it saves some wear and tear on my 20 gig and 30 gig Ipods.   No install disk either-- if you have Itunes already, just plug and play. [...]

<Title>Perfectly small and useful, Clip is fantastic
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle this week and it is even smaller than I imagined it would be. Some of the reviews just go to show that some people will complain about anything, this item is awesome if you use this for what it's meant for, that is taking a random batch of 240 of songs from your music library and taking it for a run or bringing it anywhere for some music on the go, there is no problem with it whatsoever. Personally I think adding a screen would have ruined it, it's perfect the way it is. Sound quality is great, the battery life is good and the usb dock is pretty cool. For 79 bucks go get one, you won't regret it.

<Title>Comes w/janky old earbuds, otherwise LOVE
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Shuffle straight from the manufacturer today (took 3 days to arrive to DC from China, according to FedEx tracking).  I had to update my iTunes to 7.0.2, but other than that, the device was ready to sync right out of the box.  The packaging is exactly the same as the Nano, very efficiently packed, and no install CD.    I'd love to give it 5 stars like I gave the Nano, but my one complaint is big enough to deduct a star: The Shuffle does NOT come with the new, updated earbuds that come with the Nano, but instead ships with the old, round ones with the foam covers.  I mean, really Steve Jobs, how bougie is that?  Hopefully, this will change with later orders.  Personally, I much prefer the updated earbuds and never got a good fit with the old earbuds. I remain mystified by the functionality of those foam covers.  Also, I feel it's a bit dodgy for Apple to sell the new ones for $29 separately and include them as a pack-in for every other new iPod model except the Shuffle.  Granted, the Shuffle is the cheapest, but previously, all the iPod models came with the same janky earbuds standard, so to unload the leftovers on the Shuffles now hardly seems fair.  All that said, the Shuffle itself is fantastic.  Sound quality is great.  The USB-integrated docking system is genius, no more USB nubbin coming out of the player, though you CAN still drag and drop files onto the iPod on your desktop -- just like a thumb drive or regular iPod.    Finally, the design is super!  It looks a lot like the radio remote, a little wider and thicker, the major difference being that the Shuffle is cased in alumninum vs plastic.  Its clip is also made of aluminum and non-removable.  The Shuffle has a little light on the top that flashes either green, yellow or red and in various patterns, depending on whatever Morse code thing it's trying to tell you.  Like everything Mac, it's very intuitive, and you'll figure it out quick.  I was never into the old Shuffle, but I really like the look and feel of this one.  It's tiny enough to take anywhere, but solid enough to throw in your purse (or for guys, pocket/European carry-all) without being afraid it will break.  The clip is a big design improvement as well.  As much as I love Mac, iPod necklaces don't really go with everything.

<Title>Definitely Portable!
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my 2nd generation iPod Shuffle from Apple's website about a couple days ago. I love the weight of the iPod because you don't even feel like you're wearing it. The size is also nice because it's not bulky at all. The clip is great because then you don't need to buy any special armbands or lanyards in order to keep it attached to you while you're out and about. Also, when adding songs to the iPod, you can have iTunes convert the songs to AAC format @ 128kbps automatically to make the file smaller and still have the great quality sound. This is an awesome product and is my favorite iPod aside from the video of course. The only draw back is the possiblity of losing or misplacing it. For under $80 this is a very nice MP3 player and would make a great x-mas present.

<Title>Form, meet function
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At a time when most portable electronic devices seem to be engaging in feature wars, it's truly refreshing to see Apple go back to the basics.  With this redesigned Shuffle, they've remembered what's important: it's portable, and it plays music.  The design of the new iPod Shuffle is elegant in its simplicity. The player itself is tiny and sleek, with a simple 5-button arrangement to start and stop playback, skip backwards and forwards, and adjust volume.  The buttons are so intuitive that they can be manipulated without even having to look at them, a feat most portable music players can't seem to manage. Toggle switches for power on and off, and selecting sequential playback or "shuffle" mode (random playback order) complete this tiny package.  A small docking station is included as well, which allows you to hook up the Shuffle to a computer via a USB connection, to transfer music files and to recharge the player itself.  As to function, the new iPod Shuffle plays music, and lots of it. With about 1 GB of storage capacity, you can usually get around 200 songs on it easily.  There is no visual display to show song information, no capacity for video playback, and no options to plug in the various toys and accessories that other iPods can do.  But here's the thing: none of that is needed.  The new iPod Shuffle is a portable music player, and it accomplishes that goal handily.  The earbud headphones that come with it aren't the greatest, but you can use whatever headphones you want instead. Playback of classical, rock, or electronic music all sound good, and that's all I really care about in a portable music player.  The new iPod Shuffle looks great and sounds great.  It merges simple, elegant design with a good dose of technical wizardry to create the perfect blend of form and function.  If you're looking for a portable music player that just plays music and gives you a compact package, this may well be your best bet.

<Title>I can't believe i bought an ipod...
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked mine up at the apple store yesterday, and i am amazed by its simplicity and portability.  This is the first time EVER i have bought an ipod, and i am quite pleased with it.  I still miss the flexibility of other non ipod players, but i was amazed at how simple itunes was to use, and it was not as restrictive as i thought.  the sound quality from this thing was great, but still ins't par with the bigger non-mp3 players, but it was better than my small creative flash player   The clip was a great feature to have, this thing can go anywhere with me, and is sure easier than carring my old 20 gig mp3 brick around.

<Title>Warning: Old style headphones
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got my shuffle from apple store. It's sleek design is really cool and the sound is great. I love the ability of the clip on for exercise. The only draw back is that apple stiffs you when it comes to the headphones. Steve Jobs in his last keynote address toots about the new sleeker headphones. Apparently you have to buy the nano or regular ipod to get them. Its my first time having apple being cheap with headphones that can't cost them more than a few bucks to make. I'm sure I won't be the only shuffle buyer to register this complaint. Other than that it's a cool product.

<Title>like it, not impressed with longevity
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a 1st generation iPod shuffle and loved it, but it stopped working after 1 year -- wouldn't charge.  Sending it back to Apple to get fixed wasn't worth the inconvenience or the price tag -- especially not with the 2nd gen shuffle coming out.  Instead, got a new 2nd gen shuffle.  Have had it for a year, and same thing has now happened -- won't charge, and problem is not the cable/charger.  Once again, the inconvenience and price of getting it fixed makes it easier to just buy a new one.  I love the shuffle for what it is -- easy to take on runs, love the clip, ease of use, etc.  But am I really going to have to fork out $75 every year for a new one because of quality issues?  Maybe I've just been unlucky, but in my experience, this doesn't live up to Apple's advertised standards.

<Content>I love that the shuffle is SO small.  You can clip it on and not even feel that it is there, much different than my other MP3 player.  As a runner, it's great that it doesn't seem to bounce around-- you can't even feel it's there.  Also the lack of a screen is great for exercise, because I never get to look at the screen anyway, and it makes more room for larger controls.  It's very easy to feel for the control you want without having to look at it, which can be very important when running.

I love that it clips to my shirt, instead of some bulky armband, and I can just push the button to scroll through the songs without looking. Very simple, perfect for when I'm on the go or at the gym.

<Title>I just purchased a second one for music . . .
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my first shuffle for talk mp3s. It plays my very low(22kbps) bitrate MP3s without problem. At that bitrate the 1GB shuffle can hold over 50 hours of programming. Since I don't want to loose my place in a study I bought a second shuffle (an orange one) just for music.   The clip is absolutely perfect. You forget you have it on. I usually clip it to my collar and it always stays put. Since it's so small I always leave my headphones connected so I don't loose it. It's much smaller even than a book of matches. I use Sony Fontopia EX71s since they sound great and can be used either short or long.   I made the mistake of purchasing the new Sansa Express as a second player to save a little money, plus it has some additional features. After having the shuffle It spoiled me. Wearing the much larger Express around my neck was a great disadvantage. I can't imagine a better design than the shuffle for an active person.

<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved the Shuffle as a gift,my first MP3 player.  The first thing you notice is how small and light weight it is (2 quarters and a nickle).  Sound is great, very clear.  The clip is a nice feature.  It stays in place on a cotten shirt while shaken pretty hard. The headphones work better with out the little pads they come with. The docking station comes with the ipod and is also very small.  Packaged in a clear plastic box makes an excellent display for gift purposes.

<Title>Gift away your old shuffle and go for this cool little thing!
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My new shuffle gives me the ultimate coolness factor! The functionality is awesome too.  The shuffle arrived in it's beautiful transparent hard plastic box. It is really small, 1.5 inches long and 1 inch wide and the depth without the clip is hardly a few mm. The packaging is great too, even better than the last green cardboard box, and if you buy it from apple you can engrave it with your special message and also include a gift note which arrives in a tiny white envelope with a silver apple logo. My shuffle has my name and cell phone number engraved at the back from Apple in case it goes missing...though I don't think the finder would ever want to return it.   The "goodness" of a shuffle: I had always liked the Gen 1 shuffle too as it was small, and could slip into my tight jeans easily. Every time I wanted to change a song while at the airport in a queue, shopping for groceries or jogging I could just press the raised ring as I knew where each symbol was. I never needed to look at it or to take my attention away from what I was doing. It was light too, so much so that the weight of the headphones would sometimes nudge it out of my pocket and it would clatter to the floor. When I wanted to change the songs I just slipped it into my laptop. I had planned to buy a bigger iPod or even the Zune or Zenvision for my car so I could load my complete song collection (and get rid of XM) or for long plane trips where I might look at the screen. But for the everyday activities - jogs, work in the kitchen/garage/garden, or shopping trips I was happy with the low maintenance easy-breezy shuffle. So, the early pictures of the new shuffle blew me away ...I realized it was time to give away my old one...to my dad in this case, who loves listening to his books on shuffle, and doesn't want a screen.    The 2G shuffle: The new shuffle sounds just as good as the last one and the headphones tangle up less with a rubber slider. Did I tell you that the white and gray headphones co-ordinate perfectly with the gray and white look of the new shuffle? I love these little touches from Apple...(Can't believe Microsoft thinks the dull brown color of Zune is cool...) The port to connect the headphones is the same one you connect the docking station to load songs or charge it. The docking station is small too, white on top and barely 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide with gray rubber base with an apple logo that prevents it from sliding around. You'll need to download the 35MB iTunes software to your computer (in case you don't have it already) and then load up your songs on the shuffle and you're ready to go. When it updates software the light indicator is red, orange when it uploads songs and green when you eject it and it's ready to play. The genius is that there is no need for a separate battery indicator as the same light glows orange for low charge or red if your battery is very low. In fact the same light will tell you with a blink sequence if there are no songs loaded. Press the forward button once and it will go back to the beginning of the same song, press it twice it goes to the next song. Similar function for the reverse button. If you press the play/pause button 3 times it goes to the beginning of the playlist...If you have your songs organized you can load the list you want according to your mood and these controls are enough to take you where you may want to go.  I was able to load 180 songs on to my shuffle, which is more than enough for a whole week for me. You have to use iTunes but all my songs are from CDs or downloads from other sites and I did not have a problem getting them on to the shuffle with the iTunes software.   The only downside I see is that I'll have to carry the docking station to charge it or upload songs if I travel, and while the docking station is really small, it makes the shuffle less self-contained. However, given the look of the new shuffle I don't mind  too much. Especially now that I have a clip on the new shuffle, a feature I did not anticipate would make carrying the shuffle so much easier.  In fact, now I am in love with the convenience of the shuffle's clip that makes it easy to access and does not keep falling out with the weight of the headphones. The possibilities of where to clip it are endless. I've had it clipped to my T shirt neck, my office shirt front, on my leather coat lapel, or the jeans top pocket, or even my purse strap. Doesn't fall out and it's easier to reach the buttons.   By the way, all the people with negative reviews for 2G don't seem to be users. If I just want to make toast I don't want to buy an oven, even if it's available for the same price. If I wanted a screen on the shuffle I would get a Nano or something else. But the shuffle gives me what I want -not only does it play great music, it's cute enough to sit on my blouse. And does get some ooohs and aaaahs!   Now how about blue, red and pink metal shuffles...I need to color coordinate them with all my outfits! ;-) Update Feb 28, 2007: So Apple listened to me (!) and they do have these in nice colors now...love that orange..

<Title>Maaannnnnnnn...
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow, is Apple really that desperate? The original Shuffle was bad enough, but now they go and make another one! Now I don't have this, but it's pathetic just by looking at it. $79.99 for this thing. Who in their right mind (if you have one) would buy this remake of an already pathetic excuse for a portable music player for $80 when the Samsung YP-K3JQB is a measly $100 currently on Amazon?! The ONLY people who would get this shuffle instead of the amazing E250 are those can't stand the fact that Apple has finally made something completely unacceptable (well, the Nano was pretty darn close), those who keep saying that "they don't need a screen", and those who are so braindead that they get anything that has the "Apple" logo on it.  Yeah, I know, I'm stupid. I don't know what I'm talking about. In a way, I like this more than the other Shuffle. It's cool the way you can just clip it anywhere and go. But something as bad as the original shuffle should NOT be remade. It should be totally discarded, and make a completely new iPod. , and you obviously can't make a new shuffle WITH a screen. The price is ridiculous, it STILL doesn't have FM or recording or even a screen (the lack of a screen is the "key feature" of the Shuffle, but it's really the key blunder). It's obvious why they don't add the radio or voice recorder: they want to be totally separate from the other music players. It's obvious. Well, I hope you enjoy my review.  0 of 3,000,000 found the following review helpful  sigh...  As a closing note, I'd like to show you my beautiful poem. It's very appropriately called "iPods are Rip-offs"    IPods are Rip-offs by Michael Marcopolus    The iPod's not the only music player you can get,  It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met.  If they just knew what the other players had in store for them,  They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.   The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites,  But why not get a better player with more gigabytes?  SanDisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices,  Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.   The SanDisk Sansa E200 has many, many things,  An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings.  Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not!  The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.   The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal,  It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal.  Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player,  For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.   There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space,  It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place.  FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy,  The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.   The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video,  Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow.  The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter,  The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.   So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time,  The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime.  They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool",  Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.    Facts  1. Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player.  2. The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference),

<Title>Approaching Perfection
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I replaced an old iPod Shuffle with this little gem. Here's what I found:  Size: Phenomenal. It's about the size (width, length and depth) of a Halloween mini-Hershey bar (no kidding).   Performance: Longer battery life, better response time than old Shuffle.  Sound: Still great.   Easy of use: Unmatched. Attach it, iTunes loads it, off you go.   Disappointments: Earbuds that ship with it are poor; ships with virtually no info or instructions; requires latest iTunes update; uses docking station.    Notes: I normally hate Apple products, but liked my old iPod Shuffle. This unit is smaller, lighter, generally easier to use and a much better value than the old Shuffle, and dramatically better for me than other MP3 players on the market. I need good sound for my good music without a bunch of hassles. Nothing else gives me that package like this unit.  I was stunned when I opened my Amazon box and got this tiny little thing out. The pix don't do it justice; I think they have a twelve-year old holding the thing. It's almost comically little. It is significantly smaller than a "tiny" post-it note and slightly larger than a postage stamp. It is about the same thickness as a ball-point pen.   I get much better performance than my old shuffle. The battery lasts longer (which could just be battery fatigue on my old one) and the load-up time is much shorter. There is no screen, but to answer Mr. Rudeness the Poet, no, I don't care about a screen. I know my music. A screen is just more useless weight. I'm not going to be reading the screen when I'm working (or working out) anyway. The sound is good, the clip is secure and nothing could be easier to use. Update your iTunes (required), plug the thing into your computer and you're done!  I do NOT like the docking station concept. I liked the fact that I could plug my old Shuffle into any USB port and recharge it. However, that feature had to go to make the new one so small, light and high-capacity, so I'll live with it. I did not like the earbuds that ship with this unit. Also, if you like detailed instructions (or anything more than wordless cartoons), you're out of luck. Overall, though, I have not found a single product that comes close to matching this.

<Content>Get your 2nd gen iPod shuffle and a set of Shure E2c sound isolating earphones and say goodbye to noise, interruption and tension.  My Shuffle arrived last week and my Shure's were ready and waiting for the week's flight to Denver and back.  Sure I couldn't hear the stewardess but how much is there to saying 'water please?'         This teeny-tiny iPod is scary small!  Just how is it possible - battery, memory, computer, and plug all in a size smaller than a watch face.  It packs and travels easily.  [The dock is unfortunately the biggest piece in the package - look for somebody to make a USB to audio-jack cable soon (without the base).]  The sound is wonderful.    I"ve not tried wearing this combo through the TSA security check yet but I"m building up the guts to say "Are you just making small talk or is it something important?"

<Content>The design of the 2nd Gen shuffle is mindblowing.  First of all it is small, unbelievably small.  Once you get over that, you will notice how incredibly beautiful it is. The design and the production is top notch.  The attention to detail is something you would not expect in a $79 product, nothing cheap looking about this.  Oh yes, and it plays music, seamlessly.  The itunes integration is genius.  I own many ipods 3G, 5G, couple of nanos and as much as I love my new 8G nano, I love the shuffle even more.  It's almost weightless so its perfect for the gym.  I could go on and on but to hold one is to want one.  I guarantee you will not find a better way to spend $79.  I am buying one for everyone I love.

<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Nano 2 months ago after owning an IRiver for 4 years.  I loved the Nano until my wife "borrowed" it so I decided to order the shuffle.  I ordered it on September 30 and got it this past week.  A long time to wait but I thought it was only $80 so I could wait.  I charged it on Tuesday night and added a bunch of songs to it.  I have used it quite a bit since Tuesday and still haven't re-charged it.  I really do like it as it is small and clips to my clothes.  Wed, Thur and Fri I ran with the unit and it has been great.  Today I spent the day getting rid of leaves in the backyard for about 2 hours and it clipped to my jeans and never fell off.  I have to say though I really liked having a screen.  I will keep this one for use when working out or mowing or whenever I don't need to change songs.  I will be buying either another Nano or possibly a 30gig IPOD.

<Title>Unbelievable
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This shuffle replaced one I had for several years. Unbelievable sound, unbelievable size.  I don't like having to carry the dock with me when I travel. The old shuffle was nice because if you had it, you could plug it in. Now you have to remember to pack the dock, also. Still, bang for the buck, it can't be beat!

<Content>The tiny sleek player is fantastic for those who would love it. I bought it as a gift. Receipient liked it. Personally I bought a Panasonic mp3 1 GB player that plays on 1 AA battery for 80 hours and doesn't need itunes crap.

<Title>need better insructions
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>its my first portable audio device since cassetes, so i had a lot to catch up on. some of the things i was looking for answers for might be automatic or second nature to those familiar with mp3 or ipod devices. seems to me it doesnt work independantly from i-tunes, & i was hesitant to download that, just to use the music i already had on my computer. once i got past that & figured out how the library is seperate from the music on the device, it itself works fine. now i'm happy & very satisfied with it. yet bottom line some more detailed instructions would have got me up & running about 3 days sooner, online help was hard to decipher also.

<Title>Best entry point for a wary MP3 user
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My brother was not jumping on the MP3 bandwagon, so this Christmas I got him the Shuffle. One day later, he declared that satellite radio was not all it was cracked up to be and that MP3s are the way to go and he is busily ripping his CDs. Success.

<Title>THE UNTENDED UNDERLING IN THE iPOD FAMILY
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got a Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5TYQI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7208852-9341765">Stone Plus</a>. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why--Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Title>WOW...nice and neat
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you just need an mp3 player (or more specifically an iPod) that just plays your songlist then this is it. there is no screen to select the song you want, so you either play the list of songs stored on it straight or shuffle them (hence the name). When you are finished with that list, create a new list on your computer and upload it. This is something you need as your secondary iPod or give as a gift to someone who does alot of work or jogs alot and needs the distraction but won't have the need to search for a specific song. The ear pieces are comfortable and audio quality is WOW.

<Title>Don't believe all the bad hype
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Was a x-mas gift for my son and I was skeptical because I heard some bad things about it, but got it anyway.  Was the best decision, it works great and my son loves it!  He's only 6 yrs old so rather than spend a couple hundred on a nicer i-pod I decided to get this as his starter and now I'm thinking of getting one for both my husband and I!!!!
