<Title>WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

<Title>The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

<Title>Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

<Title>Brilliant!
<Date>Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

<Content>Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

<Content>I've had my Rio for about 4 months.  The other day I went to download some songs to it, and now it says that it only has 16mb of memory.  I don't know what happened to it.<p>Also, the 32mb of memory is not enough if you're like me and use the player all day.  If I bought another mp3 player to replace this broken one, it would have to have at least 64 mb of memory.  I could fit a maximum of 8 songs on the Rio.

<Title>Rio excellent player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got the Special edition 64 mb's RAM and a 32 MB flash card for 96 MB's of RAM.  Very nice, and skip free so when I work I don't have to worry about skipping like I did on my CD player.  Very compact, easy to fit in a pocket or even better it's got a clip if you don't have pockets.  Some people complain about batteries but I get the same performance out of a single battery in the Rio than 2 in a CD player.  It's not an issue to me anyway since I use rehargable batteries, but some complain anyway.  Download speeds to the Rio are pretty good, would like a faster download time though.  Anyone think of Firewire or USB?  As far as durability I accedentally dropped it on concrete and it still works perfectly.  Overall a fine product, I'd pick it up again after my experience with it.

<Title>Great little device for short duration play
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.<p>The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.<p>But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).<p>The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.  <p>There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.<p>In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.

<Content>I've had my player for just over a year.  No problems!  No skipping, doesn't have a mind of its own.  In otherwords, the play options (random...) never switch on me without my promt.  It functions very well.  Battery uses quickly.  It's only just very recently that it's beginning to die on me.  It plays, then won't.  It's something to do with the battery and the connection.  Also, the screen is fading from the top down.  This may be to slight rain sprinkles, or its visit to a sandy beach in the Turks (this occured in February though).  I am getting another!

<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This seemed like such a great idea: music that won't skip; I can record what I want. Then I got it.<p>The software is far more complicated than it needs to be, and it's unbearably time-consuming to put everything you want on the machine.<p>Then it there's not enough memory to record all you'll need for a long enough stretch.<p>I could go on for pages but won't waste your time with it. My last straw, however, was when, after I'd purchsed some additional memory, the lid to hold the battery in won't close. So the little, grandly over-priced toy is a total waste. <p>Stick to your CD player. Maybe it's not all the up-to-date, i.e., the hi-tech industry has replaced it with this little thing. But you'll enjoy it more.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>while this is truly great product which I enjoy. The limited playback time hinders the Rio. If your going to have mp3's on your computer it's more convient to use winamp for free then spend 170 for a portable version. It's  easier just to hook your audio output to your stereo and make mix tapes,  yes tapes then waste your time with the Rio. I suggest waiting for the next  portable player with at least 60 min. of playback otherwise, keep to the  tapes.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I was given a Rio as a gift, and I really thought I wouldn't use it, but it's been incrediably handy.  I now take it with me whenever I go jogging, because, unlike a c.d. player, it never skips. You can also easily move  between and within songs, unlike a cassette Walkman.  My only problems with  it is it takes longer than I thought it would to download songs to the Rio  from my computer.  Also, it's pretty hard to find free, *good* downloadable  MP3s on the Web (you'll get lots of porn sites when you try).  But to make  a mix from your c.d.s to take on the road with you is great.  The battery  doesn't last a super long time (about 12 hours I think), but it only takes  one.  I've recommended the Rio to friends, and I really enjoy mine.

<Title>Not bad, but far away from best
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Weve seen it so many times. Companies make a product that lookspretty cool, give it a name that most people will remember, andadvertise a lot.  Then it WILL sell, dosent matter how good the product actually is. RIO is a good example of that. And it was easy to do such a thing becourse the other portable mp3-players on the market are pretty anonymous. They dont advertise that much. Probably cuz they want to focus on doing a great player. Like the first portable mp3-player, MPMan. Its out in a new version that is far better than the RIO-player. It has flash memorycards, is easy to deal with and does even support other fileformats for storing. The main problem with mp3-players is the amount of space for storing music. To get near cd-quality you got to have 128kbps or more(156 recommended). The best solution to this right now i think is a player with a harddisk or cd-rom built in. Then you can store many hours and hours of music. But it makes a little bigger and more expensive player. So i think the next step from that is flash memory cards. They are small and can store pretty much and best of all they are replaceble. So, summary: Dont buy the RIO-player if not your only demand is to get a small player. Check out the other cool players instead.

<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I like the rio a lot, my big problem with it is the lack of storage space.  The parallel connection is VERY slow for downloading, maybe next gen will have 64MB and a USB connection.  The thing I like the most about my rio is  the fact that I don't have to carry my valuable CD collection around in my  car where they can easily be damaged by sunlight, mishandling or worse yet,  stolen.  With a cheap adapter I can plug my rio straight into my car  casette deck and I only have to worry about the rio getting stolen, not  $100's worth of CD's.  <p>I think the music industry is less worried about  the MP3 market stealing music as it is the Rio market stealing sales for  replacement CD's that are easily damaged or stolen.  Now the CD's I buy  stay locked up safely in my house.

<Date>Fri Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate of mp3, but I think that even with additional (and expensive) flash cards, Rio doesn't haven't have as much memory as I need. I really don't like listen to music at 64kbps,  although that rate is perfect for talking. 128kps is good enough for most  songs, but Rio only can take 30 minutes of music at that rate. I do  congradulate Diamond for the size and design of the Rio, however. There  already is a newer version that has double the space, but it looks like an  iMac. (Boo!)<p>One thing to watch out for is a tiny little hard drive  called Microdrive from IBM. It holds 340 Mb, which is good four about 6  hours of music at 128kps, and 12 hours at 64k. Expect that around  Christmas.

Although the headphones it came with have absolutly  no bass boost I would recomend buying your own pair. The software it comes  with cannot get any easier. To get songs onto the Rio from your computer is  so easy and takes VERY little time, about 15 seconds per song! This is a  great product and IS durable, I have dropped it numerous times and it works  FINE. It has never skipped... won't.

<Title>cool technology but don't run out and buy one just yet
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>MP3 players are truly a great idea, but this product is not very practical.  It only has 32MB of memory and the upgrade cost is almost like buying another whole player.  I enjoy using mine for exercising - it's  light and doesn't skip.  However, it is very touchy/quirky.  Don't bump it  or the whole thing will turn off.  And sometimes it will automatically  pause play even when I have the &quot;hold&quot; feature engaged.  The  technology is great, and I'd like to upgrade but I'm going to wait until  players can hold more memory or until MP3s can be further compressed.  This  would be one of the coolest products ever if it could hold your entire  library of music.  For those of you that can't wait that long, go for at  least 64MB.

<Title>Can't believe other reviews
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>First of all, I have used software named &quot;Streambox&quot; to cut down the size of my files.  So, instead of playing the selection at 128 kbs, I have cut it down to 16 kbs.  Believe me, the quality does not deteriorate  that much!  By doing this, I now can hold 100 tunes (mine are all jazz)--50  on each of my two 32 mb modules.  If I choose to do so, I just cut down on  the number of tunes, for example to 47, and replace them with three old  radio shows.  As long as I keep the number of selections at 50 or less and  do not exceed the 32 mb on each module, there is no problem.  Now for the  negative--Yes, it is rather cheaply made.  Bump it and it will turn off;  the battery compartment is not well thought out.  But, if you have problems  within the warranty period (one year), Diamond will replace the unit.  One  more thing--the cost of the 32 mb modules is beginning to drop.  I would be  lost without my Rio!

<Title>lacking memory
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>when I first received my Rio for my 16th birthday I was excited, as well as a little doubtful.  could such a tiny device live up to all its claims?  well, it's been a little over a year, and my Rio and I are constantly  attached at the hip.  it's little, it's light, it doesn't skip when I  exercise, and the software is so easy to use that even my mother has  figured it out.  the only drawback is that the onboard memory is limited to  32mb, which, for me, just isn't enough.  I can only squeeze between 6 and  12 CD quality (128 kb/s) songs on at a time, so I always feel like I need  to change the songs halfway through my day.  my advice is to splurge and  shell out the extra cash for the special edition Rio 300 with twice the  onboard memory (64mb), or even better wait for the Rio 800, which should be  out soon, and promises to be the best Rio yet.

<Title>Good Value
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Many people like to criticize the Rio 300 (and the newer model,the 600) because it only comes with 32MB of memory.  While thiscriticism is valid, I'd like to point out that the Rio 300 (and other 32MB players) are considerably CHEAPER than their newer 64MB siblings. ... <p>Think about it, folks, ...  A 32MB SmartCard, if you search around online, only costs about [30% of a 64 MB player].  If you're that upset about the skimpy memory on the Rio 300, simply shell out the extra sixty bucks and you'll still have saved yourself fifty-plus dollars.<p>As for memory, you can gain more music space on your player if you DON'T transfer songs at high bit rates.  For example, I typically transfer my songs (from an origianl CD) at 112 kps (CD quality) and sometimes at 96kps (near CD-quality, and believe me you can't tell the difference).  In short, I love my Rio 300 and will soon buy extra memory for it and still have money left over in my pocket.

I must say that the Rio is efficient on batteries, has very good sound with very little distortion (if it's distorted, it's probably the ripper/encoder that made the MP3), and since it's completely electronic with no mechanical parts, it obviously never skips.  I run with mine and use it in the car with a cassette adapter, and I love how light it is.  Despite all these pluses, there are a few things the wary consumer should know:..As for mechanics, the Rio 300 has limited onboard memory - I get along fine with the 32 MB, but at times, especially on long trips, I wish I could play more than about 3/4 of a CD at 128bps (about &quot;CD quality&quot;).  Be ready to shell out more for that flash memory add-on.  The case on the Rio 300 is relatively fragile.  Don't count on putting it through a lot of abuse, and be careful with the belt clip, as it may strain the thin plastic - - mine cracked, but a little superglue fixed it and it's fine now.  The bottom line: if you don't have a lot of money but you want that MP3 player, it's a good buy.  As for me, I'm about to convert to a minidisc player/recorder with a USB MP3 adapter.

<Content>When I first got this mp3 player, I had hardly heard of one before. I  started to use it and it was awesome, untill I found out that I could only  put about 6-8 tracks on it. I don't mind that much, but I would like a lot  more memory on it!

<Title>Portable relaxation machine
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had a PMP300 for a little over a year now, and the only complaint I  have is with the transfer cable. I had to return the first unit I got as  the cable was defective, and now it seems to be failing again.<p>I have a  32 meg flash card, and at 48k bitrate I can store 43 songs on my Rio. I  mostly listen to celtic and classical music to help me relax and drown out  distracting noises, and prefer a larger variety of music to near-CD  quality. 48k is supposedly AM radio quality, but I quess I'm no audiophile  as it works for me.<p>I will probably have to upgrade to a Rio500 or  something similar, but I won't go back to CD or even cassettes. It's small  enough to fit in a shirt or pants pocket, and it is skip-free unless you  bump it fairly hard.

<Title>Very nice gadget, i like mine.
<Date>Sat Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just got my rio , i got the older version with 32 megs of ram , instead of the new overpriced version with 64 megs. I find 32 megs of ram to be not enough memory for the music i wish to store for trips , or vacations  without computers for example. But for everyday use, I find 30 minutes of  music to be enough for my work day, after work I just upload new music for  the next day. It would be nice if it had more memory though. Now that the  price for the older model is dropped to 100 bucks after rebate I find it a  good value. I really like mine. I recommend it to people who like variety  in their music during everday life, and don't mind changing tracks everyday  or so.

<Title>I have hours of music at home but am stuck with 30 with RIO
<Date>Sun Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>first, for all the MAC users out there, here's a dime, call someone who cares... second of all, the RIO is an internet product for an Music format created by the Net, so if you don't have a net connection...again call some  that cares. The RIO is a great Idea, just let all the Technophiles out  there buy the 1st gen, then when it is actually worth purchasing (ie..has  more than 30 min of music time..etc) then the rest of us will purchase  it...

<Title>TRUST ME ON THIS ONE...
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This product is a GREAT idea. But if you want to get something similar to this that plays MP3's, you should wait a year or two so the memory increases on the product. because right now, it only plays 30 minutes of  music, which is about space for about 5-8 songs. My advice is to get the  MINI-DISC player for now. It will play a very long time's worth of music,  and you can buy MORE blank CD's to record more. Plus you can get songs off  CD's, Tapes, PC, 8-Track, and more! I'm sure there are lots of players for  that you can find at amazon.com.

<Title>Really terrific, but can't it be longer?
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>What can I say?         I love this rio. Usually when I go to listen to music, I feel it's a boring chore         that I have to do to help my sound be heard. With Rio , I have a lot of fun         making my life  happier. I hope you guys hang around forever! This is great, keep it up!  but give more space. I don't mind to pay twice, and I am not the only one.  BEST, EMANUEL MORSE, EAST NORTHPORT, N.Y.

<Title>Sounds like a good idea.... But leaves much to be desired
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I bought my Rio about 2 months ago. It plays perfectly, and I have no complaints with the performance. But if you are going to take this with you as a truely &quot;portable&quot; unit you are going to be stuck with only  30 minutes of storage for cd quality music. Maybe that's not a problem for  you, but personally I need more of a variety of music when I take this on a  trip. And the extra 32-meg flash memory cards cost $100!! That's way too  much just to hold an extra 30 minutes of music. I recently sold my Rio and  purchased a portable Minidsic player/recorder for $275. My advice to people  would be to save an extra $100 and go for the minidisc. It uses digital  sound, and does not skip. You can use it to record mp3's from your computer  and the blank 74 minute discs cost less than $5 a piece, as opposed to $100  for a 30-minute flash memory card for the Rio. Minidisc is a much better  overall value than the Rio. I would not recomend any buy a portable mp3  player until the storage can be greatly increased at a much lower cost.

<Content>I use my &quot;Rio&quot; on my Motorcycle. A CD player obviously is out of the question and the portable walkman AM-FM device loses signal strength at every turn and I don't like tape. I have added the extra 32 meg flash card  to mine to enhance the playing time.<p> I record at 80kbps for good quality  and 1 1/2 hours of music. (on a motorcycle at 60 mph, CD quality isn't my  main concern.) <p>For my application and similar ones I feel the RIO is a  great audio source. The lack of memory is a concern and the flash cards are  expensive. The download time isn't that bad but I would have preferred a  USB connection. The output level is a concern but 12 hrs of playtime on a  single AA battery is great.<p>Don't buy the RIO as a replacement for you CD  player just yet. If you have a need for non-skipping, lightweight and a  small audio source then the RIO is the ticket.

<Title>Great, but needs improvement!
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I borrowed one of these from a neighbor of mine. It's great, and I personally cannot tell the difference between CD and mp3. If you have the internet, it's better, because you can get free music and download other  programs to allow your CD'd to be turned to mp3's, so you can have your own  little megamix. However, there needs to be more RAM, or have something like  an Iomega Zip Drive attached so that you can have more space. But hey, it's  a start! A Great Start into the future of portable music!

<Title>Perfect portable tunes for people who exercise
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio is absolutely the best device I've ever seen for providing high-quality portable audio to those who work out. It never skips, a single AA battery will keep it playing for at least 8 hours, and it weighs almost  nothing. I used to make tapes to play at the gym, but now I just convert CD  tracks to MP3's and download. The compression software is included, and it  only takes about 15 minutes to compress an entire CD into MP3's. While it  is true that the Rio only plays for about 30 minutes in near-cd quality as  shipped, there is a slot for an extra 32MB flash card which doubles the  playing time. This extra memory costs about $90, but it's worth the price.  The Rio also ships with a $50 rebate coupon from Diamond, although I've  been waiting six weeks for my rebate check. All in all, if you're looking  for convenient, rugged high-quality portable audio for your workouts the  Rio is the device of choice.
