<Title>Excellent toy
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Frankly speaking, I am fan of Creative. I bought this player from Toshiba out of curiosity... and because it was on sell ;-). I am really impressed by the quality of this tiny Toshiba player. The body is metallic and gives the feeling of long lasting. Battery life is remarkable - 20hours for audio compared side by side with 15 hours of ZENV. Boot up time is also very short - around 1 second (much shorter than the 4...5 seconds for ZEN V). On the "dark side", Gigabeat has less features and options but nothing that I cannot live without.  Regarding the comment of our friend HappyBruin, I agree with him regarding the obnoxiousness of the iPod software (this being one reason for which I would never buy one)... But that is not the case of the Toshiba player. You don't need any software to use it - Windows will see it as a storage device - as simple as that! I am sure that he would delete his comments now if they would not be the property of Amazon.com; perhaps next time he will do his homework before writing such negative comments about a more than decent product...  Bottom line, the Toshiba player is a very nice designed and engineered player and I warmly recommend it (I bought it for $50 - FYI).

<Title>Not bad, but will not work with windows 2000 or or media player 9
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am real disappointed in this mp3 player. The product discription did not say it would only work with XP or Vista and media player 10 or 11. My work computer is Windows 2000, so I cannot use the player at work. There is no dock station. It can only work with media player. There is no way to listen to it except by earphones. I wish I had order a Zune or Creative. I ordered it because of the audio, which I am not impressed with.

<Content>Nice quality good sound. I only gave it three stars because of the ear phones are junk. If it had better ear phones I'd give it five stars.

<Title>AVOID!  Obnoxious piece of garbage
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a fan of Toshiba, I have two Toshiba notebook computers.   When I read about the U-series MP3 player I ran out and got one, it seemed perfect for me; small, sturdy, and simple.  Wrong!  This thing uses an iPod method of requiring you to load proprietary software onto your computer to use it.   Sorry, that's why many of us avoid iPods in the first place.     Toshiba wants to force you to use Windows Media Player 11, which, in my opinion, is a nasty piece of software.  Without it, your computer will not even see the MP3 player!   I guess they are determined to be as big of a pain in the neck as Bill Gates is...  Sorry, Toshiba, this is my computer, not yours.   I don't need you force-feeding me crappy software.  I'm returning the product.  I'm going back to my Creative MoVu and my wife is sticking with her iPod.  Avoid this product, it looks cute, but it sucks and is a waste of money and, more importantly, a waste of time!

<Title>Great Item
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased to use on motorcycle tours (10,000 miles this year alone) . I bypassed the PC software installation and was able to sync with Media Player immediately. I ripped tunes from CD's and transferred then to the gigabeat.  Guess I'd better read the instruction booklet for all of the other features like an FM radio!

<Title>loading gigabeat u
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I haven't had a problem loading the gigabeat without windows media player. I'm no computer wiz and it was my first mp3 player so the neighbor set up a folder to put the music in and it has worked fine. The computer 'sees' the gigabeat in 'My Computer.' You can do all functions from there. Later I did use windows  media player on my dad's computer and have had no problem there either. People said windows would restrict the music I put on it but that hasn't been the case.  What I do want is for Toshiba to put out their sport case for the U series 2gb. I can't find a case anywhere that will fit it.

<Title>Great player for a great price
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just got this last week, and i love it, its very slim, can fit in the smaller pocket in my jeans perfectly, the screen is small, and the words on the screen seem to shake when you shake it, but other than that it is very clear and readable. it has a great radio player on it (cant get that with any IPOD) with 10 presets and you can record songs off the radio with it. you can also put pictures on it, which is a cool feature as well. as far as music goes, its very good, the headphones that come with it arent the most comfortable in the world, but the sound quality is very good. it has the option to display the album cover of the song when it plays, while it is a cool feature, not good for the tiny screen, when the album art is up, you can barely see the title of the song. Also i was dissapointed that you cant actaully just pick a specific song you want to hear, you can only search by artist or album, which is fine, but it still would be nice if it included a function where you can go straight to the song you want. you need windows media player to run it, but i doubt thats a problem for you, most people already have windows media player on their comp, and if you didnt previously have an IPOD, you probably used it to listen to music anyway, so dont listen to the people complaining about that aspect. But overall, its not perfect, but this is a fantastic player, and the fact that its only $60 on here is amazing, your not going to find may players of this quality this cheap with 2gb a color screen, radio and other cool features. i highly recommend you buy this

<Title>Easy for beginners
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First time I used a Mp3 player. It was easy to use and did not have to download any software. Only updated my WMP. My computer is a few years old and even with a slow USB Port, it fully charged in about 90 minutes. Have recommended to others. Only drawback I have found is the earbuds are a little too large for my ears.

<Title>Excellent Gift Idea
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player as a gift for my girlfriend who's mp3 player no longer worked.  Before I gave it to her, however, I loaded it with music I thought she would like, and tried it out to make sure it was good. The sound quality was extraordinary, and the picture was great.  I don't recommend it for the pictures, however, but it fits a good amount of music on it, and it sounds great.     For the $50 dollars I spent on it, you can't go wrong... well worth it's value!

<Title>Wish it had better video display for album covers and text
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second gigabeat (already own an S-60)and is used primarily by my wife.  Small - easy to use, reliable, and tremendous battery life. I only dislike the cheesy graphics for the albums and that fact that the text scrolls when the track name is anything more than about 15 characters long.  My wife loves it - and it is compatible with both Rhapsody and Napster (we like the subscription programs because we download hundered of different songs a month and rarely like anything enough to buy them.)  We will probably buy another for the kids.
