<Title>Not Great - but not bad

<Content>I got this so I could download audiobooks from the library (iPod doesn't support).  It's fine for that purpose.  Audio quality is good, but the controls are very small and somewhat difficult to manage.  This is definitely not a device for people with large hands or coordination problems.  
<Overall>3
