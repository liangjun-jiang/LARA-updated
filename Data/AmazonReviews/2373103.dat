<Title>Elegant Package,  Easy To Operate, Surprising FM Tuner
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player, voice recorder, FM radio all-in-one is 1/4" longer and same width as my AMEX card and 1/4" thick. Five buttons on two edges control all functions while 1" X 5/8" see-through display gives needed info. Diplay was B in normal room light with my trifocal glasses and was C- with adjustable edge lighting in dark rooms. The built-in battery recharges from any USB connection. You will want a short USB connector, not the six-footer that is included - compactness is why you buy it.<br /><br />Windows 2000 and XP recognize the player at once when connecting with the USB cable. The player comes up as an external drive, so just move files with Explorer and you are set.<br /><br />Voce recorder is easy enough and did an adequate job recording me from my shirt pocket with decent fidelity. Probably OK on a desktop to pick up two or three people around the desk. Built-in mic is the only choice.<br /><br />FM tuner sensitivity was a nice surprise. Reception in my office was as clear and sensitive as on my Grundhig portable, and it automatically scanned in 30 stations on first use. (Presets can of course be manually chosen.) The earbuds are the antenna.<br /><br />A crummy cloth bag was included, but a small leather slip case with a pocket clip would have been so easy to do and much more useful.<br /><br />Sound with the included earbuds seemed fine to me - definitely a a few steps above entry level.The unit is nicely packaged and looks like it could be dropped a good number of times with no problems.

<Content>I bought this instrument and it was spoilt within 2 months.The navigation to songs isnt user friendly.Even though I charge the battery completely, the instrument turns off abruptly.Sometimes it never goes on.Tried resetting it, charging it..nothing works.I am not sure whether its a defect with the instrument or the product, but would never go for it again.

<Title>disappointing
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had great hopes for this product, and I read the reviews so I only have myself to blame, but this is not a very well built product. Catchy see through display is hard to read. On/Off is tough and not very intuitive. Sound was good. Radio was limited in its ability to "tune". If I had the chance, I wouldn't buy it again. Sorry!
