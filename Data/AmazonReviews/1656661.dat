<Title>not CD quality, but not bad

<Content>For me, it does what it's supposed to do. I've had no trouble tuning it in, but I'm in a rural area and haven't tested it in the city. The sound is better than some reviews I had read - it's definitely not CD quality, but neither is it tinny and unlistenable, unless you're into classical music. If I were going to keep this car I'd opt to replace the broken CD player instead. But for $25-30 this is not a bad solution. I have used it only with a thumb drive, not my mp3 player, which is a neater package in the car. Can't shuffle-play or select playlists that way, but oh well. The only problem I've had with it is, it grips the cigarette lighter socket so tightly, it pulled the socket right out of the dash. Maybe I need a new car.
