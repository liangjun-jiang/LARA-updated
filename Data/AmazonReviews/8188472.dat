<Content>This product is a great idea and will be fabulous when the bugs are worked out. The first one I recieved worked very well for a couple of days and then started freezing up while playing content. Then my computers began not recognizing the drive(both windows XP and Vista). Credit goes to Amazon.com for replacing it in a timely fasion. The replacement works better but will not download content from the Fanfare website, which is not all that important to me as the content is not all that great.

<Title>Works like a charm!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this thing.  It's cool if I want to take my downloaded vids to a friends house to watch on TV.  Also, I don't have a media extender in my house, so this is a cheap alternative to watch vids in another room.  The Fanfare site kind of sucks.  It has limited content, but the idea is pretty cool.  If/When Fanfare gets better, this item could get a 5-star review.  For the price and ease-of-use, you can't beat this with a stick.

<Title>Simple and Amazing
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I loved this little guy after the first time I used him. It's an extremely simple concept... put the files on the USB, plug the dock into your TV, and BAM! You're watching pirated movies faster than Universal Studios can catch you. In all seriousness, this thing is worth the money and then some. I bought the 4GB simply because I can't watch more than that amount of TV in one sitting but if you're hardcore and enjoy sitting for more than 5 hours at a time go for the 8GB. Maybe you should invest in a thigh-master while your at it.

<Title>Poor range on the remote
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why take a great concept and shackle it with poor range? This thing barely works 10 feet away. My chair sits about 11 feet away so I have to get up and take a step towards the unit to stop, pause, fast forward, etc.. When I called tech support, they said that due to the small battery in the remote, the power was only good for about 10 feet and that my only option was to sit closer or return it.  I was so excited that these were now available and I wouldn't have to lug my laptop around everywhere to play videos. As far as it's function, everything seems to be as advertised. I now have to seriously decide if I want to keep it.

<Title> Worth the $100. 
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Take TV works well.  The instructions included are a bit useless.  You need to slip the USB portion out of the remote control "base" to pop it into a USB port on your computer. You would think the instructions would include that small fact. That confused me. I opened the box and expected four components. Only three were there. Hmmm..    Even Sandisk tech support were confused when I couldn't "find" the remote control, could not direct me to do the obvious.  New product, bad training.   Once I figured it out, It works very well. I really like it.   Warning: Do not move downloaded ITunes video directly to the TakeTV.  It does not work.  Only use the specified formats downloaded without an attached video player mucking up the process.  Inexpensive, good product.  Better directions needed to be included with the product. Sandisk support needs to read up on their new products.  Very sweet to watch computer only content on the television.

<Title>Ok, some problems
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using it some in the past week, and it is a bit of a mixed bag.  The remote range is mediocre, and it is hard to tell where the IR sensor is on the player part, and when sitting on top of a tv it is often occluded.  I wound up leaving it on the floor or coffeetable in order to be within range with the receiver.  I also find the buttons counterintuitive and require a really firm press to actuate.  I found one divx encoded video wouldn't play, for no apparent reason, and another that caused the unit to freeze when going out of fast-forward back to play.  Both videos were well within the specs for resolution and bitrate.  However, I've been playing other stuff, and it is really pretty handy.  Amusingly, the "MPEG2 supported" (I think it was) spec on the box has been covered over with a black marker (it is still in the user manual .pdf on the usb drive).  Clearly another rev of the firmware is needed.  It would be great if the inexplicable long "load time" (load of what??) for playing the more lengthy video files had a progress indicator.  So, I give it... 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for kudos for creating a new category of device, basically.  For re-coding of video it doesn't support I'm looking into Xvid and associated utilities.  Haven't tried the results yet.  Beware that transcoding video is a sloooow process.  A 2 hr divx to xvid took 2.5 hours on a dual-core athlon 4400+.  A learning remote programmed to do the codes this one uses, and a firmware update, and it will be a 4.5 stars experience to use.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once I heard about this product I immediately logged on and bought it. If you watch as many downloaded videos as I do, then this is well worth the $100.  However, the remote is horrible. If I want to pause anything I have to stand up and walk a couple of steps before I'm in range.   This won't come up often, but if there's too much motion going on, the video will start skipping. The only time this has happened so far is during an anime with stars swiping to the right, a girl running, roses scrolling to the left, with random planets and moons moving diagonally.

<Title>Great for Mobile Video
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>TakeTV's intended use as a home video playback system is questionable.  However, I have installed a TakeTV in my car, replacing the kiddies' DVD player.  DVDs always got smudged and scratched, making them unplayable and causing a backseat toddler revolt.  I was able to fit about 14 hours of compressed video onto the 4GB model, which, since kids watch the same stuff ad naseum anyway, is more than enough.  I combined this with some aftermarket headrest video screens, and have a created a near-perfect mobile video system.  TakeTV could be better if 1) it played the next title on the drive automatically and 2) resumed playback from where it left off when you stopped it.  These may be possible through a future firmware update.

<Title>Software was buggy, product is solid
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Getting the Fanfare software to work on a Vista box which already had a lot of media applications installed was challenging. I ended up having to do a clean install just to get it to work.  If you have a lot of Divx content of your own it's worth buying if you're a traveler and want to watch your own stuff on a hotel room TV otherwise it isn't nearly as versatile as tons of other media players.

<Title>TakeTV does work, mostly
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>TakeTV works mostly as advertised. It will accept .mp4 files but only if they are .DivX or .Xvid. I use mine on a Sony TV. When using any of the TakeTV buttons, except the play button, the TakeTV puts out some sort of a signal to the TV that blanks out the lower half of the screen. Otherwise, the unit is fine and saves transferring movies downloaded from the Internet to DVDs to play on the TV.

<Title>Good, but not great solution to bringing video content to your TV
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After being so frustrated with two other devices advertised to provide content to your TV via wireless connection, I threw in the towel and purchased one of these right after their release.  All in all, I'm pretty happy with the device - very clear picture and easy to use.  Would MUCH rather have a wireless device to stream video, but they simply do not seem ready for prime time right now.  My biggest complaint is that you have to convert everything from and AVI file to a Divx compliant MP4 file.  Not a huge issue for me - but I'm a geek.  I would think others would have a much more difficult time with this product simply due to that one issue.    It's an extremely compact unit and I've actually been happy enough with it to have purchased a second identical unit for our vacation home.  The next generation really needs to have more video formats available or it's just not going to generate a lot of interest.
