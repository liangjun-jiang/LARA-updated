<Title>How to get it working again!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable.

<Title>Awww...c'mon...alive and still kicking
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received this device as a Christmas present last year.  It was my first and I didn't have a clue about MP3.  I have not had a problem with this device at all.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Things I liked:&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Easy to understand.  I downloaded through Window Media-never an issue.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Small and durable.  I have dropped this device a million times.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Great sound-----if you use other headphones than provided.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Only took a AA battery.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Things I wished would happen: &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;better headphones&#60;br /&#62;a display&#60;br /&#62;ability to change the order of songs in transfer&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Otherwise, I have had no issues. I will be purchasing this item for my 14 year old daughter.

<Title>Really Nice To Have
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has been working great for me. The headphones aren't the best so it sounds a whole lot better with good ones. Once the USB stick has been formatted on a Windows machine, files (audio or other) are easily transferred using a Mac in OSX. Having the removable USB stick to transfer files between computers is a huge bonus.

<Title>Great little mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the MuVo 64mb mp3 player. I actually got it through bartering on craigslist. I must say that I am VERY pleased. It's great that I now have a removable usb stick and the playback sounds absolutely incredible. It has surpassed my expectation. It is very simple to load songs/files onto. I can store about 13 songs on the 64mb version. :) Great for students, at the gym, while commuting (metro only hehehee), and just walking around town while shopping.

<Title>GREAT FOR WHAT IT IS!!!
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Long battery life, apprently indestructible, no moving parts, no display, drag and drop, totally unsophisticated but WORKS to hold a cvouple oif hours of songs for workouts, etc.  No playlists, but I simply plug it in to my USB port and replace the songs with new ones every few days. AAA batteries can be bought anywhere.  Of course you cannot compare this with a fuill-featured player, but for what it is it ROCKS!

<Title>Very nice MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ...  Yesterday, I ordered from Amazon, another MP player, this time I got me a bigger one. I am getting the Creative MuVo N200 512MB, plenty of music for me since my other one (64MB) is holding only 10 to 12 songs.  Now, if you wish to get a very small gadget that plays good music, I strongly suggest you get a Creative product, I do like them.

<Title>Great for Third World Travel
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this simple little player for third world travel.  Without having any bells and whistles, the batteries last a long time, which is important when traveling in areas where these might be hard to come by.  The simplicity of the controls makes it easy to use at night.  Its small size and its simple exterior allowed me to travel confidently without the fear that strangers in the bus stand thought I was holding something valuable.  I would recommend this player as an alternative to your Ipod for rugged travels.

<Title>Worked OK for first year or so
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When this device worked, it was great.  Small, could go running with it, and I remember excellent audio clarity.  But every once in a while it wouldn't work.  And I could never figure out why.  80% of the time worked great.  20% of time it really pissed me off.  A year later it seems to have completely stopped working.  Would probably have given a 5 if the player was more solid and tech difficulties/bugs had been worked out.

<Title>Very Unreliable
<Date>Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Like a few other people here, I'm having the auto-lobotomization problem big time. I had to do the hard reformat every other day or so, and it's presently not working at all.<p>Oddly enough, I got a 64 meg model as a gift after buying the 128 meg model. The 128 meg model worked fine when plugged into the 64 meg battery pack. Then they both stopped working at all. <p>I think Creative is very close to having a winner here. Using the thing when it works is a dream -- no goofy programs to load the device (which always seem to break or refuse to see the target). The fact that some people love it while others hate it make me suspect that they've got a really nasty QC problem in the assembly line.

<Title>Great product, but defective....
<Date>Sun Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I loved my MuVo, it's awesome. But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars.

Despite that, NONE.

<Title>The Simplest MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I received my MuVo 64 last week--no problems whatsoever. (My OS is Windows XP.)  This is the first MP3 player I've ever owned, so I'm not an expert nor do I miss the extras most of the other players have, such as the LCD screen. It couldn't be easier to use: separate the removable media from the battery pack, plug it into the USB port, drag &amp; drop your files, then eject the removable media. I bought mine primarily as an exercise buddy-makes my treadmill time go a little faster. Since these sessions generally last just 30-45 minutes, I don't need a large capacity player. The cord that enables me to hang the MuVo around my neck is a real plus; it's so lightweight (approximately 1 oz.) I hardly know it's there. The earbuds sounded OK, but a set of normal headphones (for ex, the headphones that came with my Walkman) proved to be a lot more comfortable. The only reasons for my not giving it 5 stars are (1) the earbuds, and (2) the need to press the play button for a few seconds to power up/down (I initially thought it was broken because of this).  Nevertheless, I love the size, weight, and sound of this gadget. A definite recommend for someone who wants an easy-to-use player and not looking for the extra features-a great exercise companion!

<Title>Great MP3 player with bonus portable storage feature!
<Date>Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After reading various reviews, professional and these user reviews, I knew this was the device for me. I was not disappointed. I was loading MP3s on it three minutes after opening the pacakage. <p>I am running XP home edition and had no problems getting it to recognize as a removable hard drive. Beautiful.<p>I mainly use mine to listen to music while jogging. You definitely need to get rid of the included earbuds. I threw mine into the trash after listening to the poor quality. Sound quality is great with my Sony earphones. Good bass as well.<p>If you are looking for a great no-frills MP3 player with removoable-storage capability this is the product for you. The reverse is true also. Both functions work great on XP and my Win2K system at work.<p>I agree with everyone that they definitely need to release some kind of armband for us joggers. Its annoying to have to carry in your hand and I don't trust the included lanyard.

<Title>nice job
<Date>Sun Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo 128 MB for my workouts and traveling. While I am optimistic about the traveling capabilities, I already enjoy this tiny device, which can hold 2 CDs in good quality, or up to 5, if you squeeze hard, for workouts and during work. The minimalistic user-interface appeals to me. The MuVo also works with NiMH AAA rechargables. <br>There are a couple of minor things: The sound is bass emphasized, which is not a problem with any earbuds, but becomes an issue when connecting it to the car or other stereos. Connecting to line-in, you have to max-up the volume. The earbuds that come with it sit really bad - they stay at most five seconds in my ears, and won't do for workouts; quick fixes available at your local CC or BB stores. Though I am able see the files in Linux, I haven't found a solution to employ Linux to move files onto it. And there are strange lapses in music, after it was accidentally getting a sometimes not completely avoidable discharge of statics and gym sweat humidity. <br>Still, for giving me *my* music commercial free in such a small housing for hours, and the ease of use, I rate it five stars. And it also transports regular files.

<Title>Perfect Product for the Right Consumer
<Date>Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3/WMA player by Creative Labs is just plain awesome.  True, it doesn't have an LCD screen, a clock, an FM tuner, or a built in stop watch; however, in exchange for these &quot;features&quot; what you do get is simplicity, ease of use, incredibly long battery life (12 hours on a AAA), unbelievable size and tremendous flexibility.<p>This device is so much more than just a portable MP3 player.  It is a hybrid portable storage device that can be used to transfer any file type from one computer to another.  In addition, it plays both MP3 as well as WMA formats.  I have found this to be a very important feature because of the relatively small size of WMA files.  The 64 MB model will easily hold 25-30 songs in WMA format.<p>If I had to sum this player up in two words it would be . . . wonderful simplicity.  I had this player out of the box, installed, and loaded with songs ready to go to the gym in five minutes.  (NO Exaggeration) There is no tricky software to learn or installation headaches to worry about.  You simply plug it into your USB port and then drag and drop the music files you want from your hard drive.  (I am running Windows XP; however, software is included in the box for Windows 98 users.)<p>The bottom line is that different people want vastly different things.  If you are looking for fancy menus, jog dials, and a lot of battery-draining bells and whistles, then look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for the simplest, smallest, lightest player on the market to take to the gym and to work that doubles as a really cool file storage device then look no further.  This is absolutely the product to buy.  I highly recommend it!!

<Title>Serious QC Problems
<Date>Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Do not buy Creative lab products.  After contacting customer service multiple times about a warranty item, I talked to one of their techs,   who said that they estimate 10% product failure on their products.  My options were to pay to have it fixed, with another 10% chance that the repair could fail, or get the broken part back.  They do not stand up behind their products.  Don't throw your money away.
