<Title>Lotsa Bang For Justa Few Bucks !
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted an mp3 player, but considering that im on a tight budget and techical stuff tends to confuse me i decided to get this little mp3 player - even bought it off Amazon theu an electronics vendor. My reasoning was that if i couldnt figure out how to use this i could stuff it in a drawer and not have risked too much money. WOW is all i can say about my experience in using it. Im admitedly a dimwhit when it comes to tech stuff and learning how to download stuff and all - but  with this mp3 player i had some of my most favorite songs downloaded to my pc and onto the player in less than 30 minutes ! the directions were a bit lacking in detail but even with that even i was able to use this - and im now thinking of buying another one from the same company . The ONLY downside is that i was only able to store maybe 15 songs on this but the designe is soo awesome that im sure ill buy another VIbe brand due to its simplicity - but with more storage. The player has nice ear buds and a ultra compact design that everyone will adore. ( about the size of 2 skinny packs of gum stuck together. Awesome deal anyday - and a great 'first' mp3 player .

<Title>The Vibe works fine
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered the Vibe based mostly on it's value versus price. It was under $20 and has 128MB of memory space, which is nice because I can get about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of music on there which is perfect for long distance driving - what I primarily wanted it for. It was a little confusing at first, as the digital read out screene is on a portion of the player the slides upwards to reveal the buttons, and I didn't realize this, and also the whole battery portion removes from the digital portion revealing the USB port to hook it into the computer. Finding out how to properly pull it apart was the hard part, everything else was easy. My computer immediately recognized it without even using the software start up disk and I was able to use my Windows Media Player to sync it up in under 15minutes. All in all I am very satisfied with this product, especially given it's price.  
<Overall>5
