<Title>FANTASTIC!!!
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Love my new Samsung MP3 player, I haven't put very many songs on it yet but so far so good. It has vibrant colors and a lot of different features. The navigation is pretty easy to understand and get used to. And its so easy to personalize by putting videos or pictures etc. It's definetly different from an Ipod in a good way. If you don't want to follow the crowd but still want something reliable than this is the perfect product.

<Title>A Snap To Use
<Date>Sun Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this player.  It is so much better than my last one from Creative.  Easy menu choices once you get the hang of it. Very good sound and lots of good features.  I recommend it highly to anyone wanting a low price but better alternative to the Ipod units.

<Title>this mp3 pales not only to the iPod but to the cheaper Sandisk mp3 players
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had an iPod Mini.  It died with no hard use in 11 months.  I bought this Samsung player at Best Buy for [...].  The player's navigation keys weren't quite as good as the iPod clickwheel.  The memory is tiny for a player that can do so much.  I like the addition of FM radio and games.  Here's the problem.  When only  28 days old, the screen died.  I used it about as much as my iPod Mini, which is not very much.  The earbuds are mediocre, the navigation buttons pale in comparision, and it's reliability is awful.  I was also annoyed because the price on the 1 gig Nano went down $50.  I got a full refund and went to Walmart.  For only $85, I bought a Sandisk Sansa m240 with 1 gig.  That's right, I gave up the color screen and games, but got twice the memory and saved $65.  I have had my Sandisk for over 3 months.  I use it everyday at school in homeroom and run with it on our treadmill for 30 minutes everyday.  This player was used more in a week than the others were ever used in half a month.  I was going to say a month, but the Samsung YP-T8 didn't even last that long.  Don't buy the Samsung YP-T8.  It pales in comparison to the iPod, the iRiver Clix, the Creative Zen V Plus, and even the cheaper Sandisk Sansa m200 series.  Actually, this pales in comparison to just about any mp3 player on the market.

<Title>Feature-Rich MP3 Player Is a Big Hit
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We purchased the Samsung YP-T8X 512 MB MP3 Player for our 10-year-old daughter last Christmas.  It was an excellent choice because it does just about everything you could imagine.  In addition to having a sleek, contemporary design, it has great sound and a brilliant colorful display.  With the software provided, you can convert video to MPEG4 to play on this little dynamo. I was able to store several cartoons including "The Grinch" as well as over 40 songs. You can also view digital pictures, record and play FM radio stations.  The unit has excellent picture quality.  The player also comes with a couple of games you can play.  My daughter loves the player and we have had no problems with it.  We are planning on buying another one for my 9-year-old son this Christmas.

<Content>This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I got one for my wife for the gym, and fell in love with it.  Very easy to use, nicely integrated software, allows me to totally control what's recorded.  Highly recommended.

<Title>There are better players.
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My daughter wanted this beacause her friend got one and liked it well about a month later she traded it for an ipod. With the player make sure you have the right program for downloading or you will have problems. Research it to. We also couldn't play video so check the direct X version you have and see if it is compatible first. My suggestion just get one of the new ipod nano's. We like the ipod a lot better.

<Title>It's not a keeper
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking to save my 10 year old son some of his birthday money so I shopped around for the best deal I could find. The Samsung YP-T8X 512 MB Music and Movie Player was the best deal I found with all the features he wanted. The Samsung is a nice looking gadget with all the bells and whistles but it's feature are hard to use. The software that operates the music downloads is not user friendly. When the program is opened on your computer, the window opens bigger than my moniter. The buttons you need to click are not visable, therefore you need to drag the window up to access the buttons. As soon as you release the left click on the mouse, the window that moves the page up falls right back down, once again not allowing you access to the buttons you need to download music and videos.  In my opinion, spend a little more money and shop for a quality device with user friendly software.

<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player is great for someone who likes music nad wants to be able to take it with you where ever. There is not alot of memory. ionly holds about 115 songs. The software messed up my computer so i could not get any videos or photos on it. Next the screen gets dust under it that you cant get out. It is just a great little player.

<Title>Netlibrary Friendly!
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player does work with Netlibrary/recorded books.  I purchased for Christmas, and I am pleasantly pleased over my Sandisk sdmx1 which played fine, but could only pause and play again.  This one has bookmarks and the ability to skip 10 minutes at a time to find the right spot.  Also has ability to play videos, pictures, read text documents, record and listen to FM radio.  Take a hike ipod... this one rules.  Ebayed for $26!!!!!

<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using that mp3 player for 5 months, and I love it so much. It looks neat and the sound quality is very awesome. The only thing that bugs me is that it does not have a search option to search for the songs. You have to go through 100 songs to to find a specific song that you want to listen. Other than that, it is pretty cool.

<Title>Well suited as an audio book player, maybe more
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you would like to listen to electronic audio books in WMA format with DRM (digital rights management), this player might be just the ticket.  I believe that IPOD cannot do this.  There are so many aspects to this player, I cannot give it a general rating that is fair.  But, I have tested it for its utility as an electronic audio book player and found it to be the best among three older Samsung players I tested.  It has a bookmark facility as well as a hyper fast forward/rewind that will allow you to find your place in a 16 hour WMA file (~250 MB) within a minute (tested).  You should not have to though, it auto-resumes just where you left off, and you can place a bookmark just to be sure.  Takes a little learning curve though along with putting up with boot-up time.  Note that it is NOT very well suited to playing back audio books ripped from multiple CD's.  It does not recognize folders as playlist items, a big drawback if it is used as a CD audio book player or a music CD player.  It only understands individual tracks, but it handles very long WMA tracks very well.  I cannot even touch on all the features and shortcomings of this device... but it is well worth owning just to play with it.  A perfect starter because its limited memory capacity has driven the price down.  You will find excellent bang for the buck, as it is a slick and capable device, until you want more memory.  I have done only limited testing using it for photo, video, music, and recording.  Feelings are mixed so far, but would give it a 3/5 at the moment.  As a player for for downloadable eAudioBooks from Net Library, it is at max a 4 given the BEWARE notice below.   P.S.  No longer available new, be sure your used unit has a wall charger and USB cable included.  Software easily downloadable from Samsung but is not needed unless you want to transfer video (why bother?).  Works as a simple flash drive unless WMA DRM is used... It worked with Windows Media Player 9 for downloading WMA DRM.   BEWARE: Battery is built-in and may not be user replacable.  An automatic 1 point off the rating.

<Content>Before I bought me a Zune player. I had this little player for like a year and half. Its a great player. Sometimes I still use it for voice recording for my exams in college. Since the zune does not have a voice recorder. I recommend this one.
