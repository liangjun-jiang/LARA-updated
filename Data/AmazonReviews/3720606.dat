<Title>Not up to par.
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Might as well be guaranteed to break just a few weeks after the warranty expires. A few of my friends have the same player, and all of theirs did the same. If you're looking to spend $80 on 90 days of music, this is the player for you. But if you're looking for permanence, don't stop here.

<Title>Great MP3 player -- if you own a soldering iron
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ILO works great for awhile. Then you'll notice that the left headphone goes out.  The headphone jack wasn't installed securely.  If you're handy with a soldering iron there are instructions on the web for fixing it (not from ILO, on a user message board).  If you're looking for an inexpensive mp3 player with a tuner this works great.  The display is good and the design isn't too bad.  You can expand the memory to include a memory card, so it has pretty good song capacity.

<Title>Cheap. A DON'T Buy
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had two Ilo MP3 Players die with one month. ILO is a Walmart brand, and has the typical, screw you, Walmart quality. Do not buy this brand.

<Title>Cheap and doesn't work
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had problems with this player, I couldn't hear audio out of one side and then the other went out too!  I did search the internet and found a solution but it involved taking the whole thing apart and putting tootsie roll wrappers inside!!  From that forum it looked like many others had the same problem I did.  I don't suggest wasting your money on this.

<Title>Good player for about 6 months
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had this player for around 6 months; I was working in Wal-Mart's electronics department and I bought it off clearance.  The player worked great for those six months; it was easy to use and transfer all types of music to.  I didn't have any problems with the headphone jack either.  The voice recorder even helped me during my journalism classes.  Then after those six months, the player just died on me.  It seems that the memory mysteriously erased itself, and I was unable to put any songs on it again.  It froze my computer when I tried to plug it in there again too.  To this day (its been almost a year now since it broke), the player still doesn't have memory.

<Title>16 hours playing time???  Try 3
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very cheaply made MP3 player.  Regardless what style headphones you use the volume doesn't go up loud enough.  Which is fine if your in a quiet room but for riding in a car or in a busy enviroment is falls short.    The 16 hours playing time is states is a bit exaggerated, at most I've got 4 hours one time with quality batteries.  The only pros I can come up with is the built in FM tuner and the voice recorder is handy.  Otherwise, steer clear of this one and spend a little more for a decent mp3 player
