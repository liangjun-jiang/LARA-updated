<Title>A great first MP3 player!  Cool features and a great price too!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sandisk's MP3 players have really come into their own.  Not only are they packed with features, but the price is reasonable.  Sandisk has come a long way from their original Digital Audio Player.  This model has tons of things going for it. - great sound, nothing not to like there - light-weight  - FM tuner - voice recording - ergonomic design - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible (for those who are into that) - USB 2.0 connectivity - replaceable battery!!!  The cons are minor in my opinion - limited shuffle features - built-in microphone could have been improved - mediocre backlight - slower transfer speed on older computers  For those needing more space, the Sansa M240 and M250 offer more space in the same form factor.  This unit is not ideal for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Sony's various models are all superior in that regard.  One thing I have to wonder is why Sandisk didn't include an SD slot in this bad boy.  I've already seen a few similar players with them.  I took a test drive and I liked it so much, I bought it as a holiday gift for a friend.  I would definitely recommend it.  I wanted to keep it myself, but I'm gonna get my own instead.  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Nice sound, Nice features, Nice price
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wouldn't say that this is a top of the line audio player, but with better headphones you can get a great sound.  For a little more, I suggest you get the M240 or M250, which have the same features, but with 1GB and 2GB of storage, respectively.  Why to buy this unit:  -Rock bottom price -Decent sound with your own headphones -Nice interface -Works with various music subscription services (somtimes requires firmware upgrade--see sandisk.com) -Has "Plays for Sure" software embedded. -Can be used to store any type of file (mass storage mode) -Can shuffle play -Comes with an arm band and player sleve for walks, workouts, etc. -Lightweight -Plays for 11 Hours on 1 AAA battery  Why not to buy this unit: -You want to use it with I-Tunes (not possible) -You want a unit with rechargable battery (buy rechargable AAAs, only option) -You want a unit with swappable media (SD or flash) -You want a unit that comes with good earbuds or headphones -You want a unit that has 1GB or more (see the M240 and M250 or a variety of other players) -USB modes can be confusing, causing unit to suddenly not register as a compatible music device with windows (easily fixed by changing modes back to music playback instead of mass storage) -controlls sometimes require futzing with to get what you want.  I recommend this player for a first-time player and for those who need a cheap player with good sound.

<Title>A nice mp3 player for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really the first mp3 player I have owned.  I initially looked at the IPOD's but was turned away from the price and also the fact that I had to purchase the songs from Itunes.  This player is simple to use, sounds really good, is very small and lightweight, and is a good deal for the money.  If you want to store 1000 songs, or watch videos, then this is not the player for you.  If you want something that's easy to afford, and can store around 200 songs, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this one.  I rated only 4 stars, as you may want to consider the 1G player as it would hold somewhere around 400 songs.

<Title>Happy, getting happier!
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Husband received this as a christmas gift.  It didn't work with his (older) W98 PC, but works great with my XP laptop.  I got it loaded and working in about 5 minutes.  Not slow as some have reported.  Could use a little more memory, but at this price I can get another and have my genres separated.  I was holding out for an iPod, but this little baby kicks! Better fitting earbuds would be my personal choice, but that's no big deal.

<Title>Good First MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good first MP3 Player. I don't listen to a very wide range of music, so 512 MB is plenty for me. The one problem with it was, we tried to use it with iTunes, but it wouldn't download to it. So we had to burn a CD then take it from the CD to the MP3. Overall, it is a very good product and its not very complicated to use.

<Title>SanDisk Error
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company.

<Title>A good Mp3 player, but.........
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good Mp3 player, and once it get even slightly smacked, its a dead Mp3 player, I got one of these "the square model, I forget the name" and that broke by being in my pocket when I fell, and I used my warrenty, and they gave me this, I had it for 2 days, and I dropped it by accident, and it was busted, so dont buy this if you think you might drop it, it is a good Mp3 player, but its too fragile.

<Title>I really found what I want!!
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this player very much.  First, it is very easy for using. I believe for any electronics, easy using is the first for user. Every step is so simple. You will never feel pain to find out how to use it.  Second, transfer songs is just copy and paste. That's it! Before I bought this player, I have a Sumsung 20G player. But transfer songs is so difficult. Many songs can't be transfered for no reason. But for this player, what you need to do is drag the songs and put it into player. Just like using a usb drive. Then, enjoy~~~~  Third, it can be used as a usb drive. I really need this function. I don't need to pay money for another 512M usb drive.  The last and very important thing is the sound is so great~~~~  The only pity for me is it can't be extended by SD card. If this works, I think that will be perfect for me.  But I like it!

<Title>YES you can create and use PLAYLISTS from Windows Media Player!!
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used).

<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got mine last night, and you don't need to even read the directions, its so simple. the backlight is good, and so is the radio. my only complaints are: it would have been nice if you could record radio, it is a bit hard to get the MP3 player in the case, and the armband is huge, but maybe i just have small arms.

<Title>Especially for first timers, this is your player
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had a personal MP3 before, so I found this one at erwincomputers, via Amazon for just under $24, including shipping.  Its a good intro to the world of MP3 and WMA, loaded onto, basically a flash drive with a player.  This player in particular is easy to operate in both transferring Windows Media files and replaying them.  Also, it's durable and nearly foolproof in that it just continues to play faithfully when the controls are locked.  It comes with a clear vinyl cover w/beltloop, but I just lock the controls and drop it upside-down into my shirt or jacket pocket.  I doesn't interfere with most activities.  Even if I ever decided to upgrade, I can't see any reason not to have one or two of these on hand. Oh yes, and the sound was much more dynamic than I had guessed.  You can hear all parts of the music in proper proportion and the little (cheapo) ear buds you get with the player are actually pretty good.

<Title>Have owned one of these for years
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player is basic and tough as nails. I purchased one three years ago for about $80. Figureing it was flimsy I also purchased an extended warranty. This thing will not die and for what they are going for now they are a great deal. Would definately get the better rubber case for it the one it comes with sucks.

<Title>I like this new toy
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ordered my Sansa m230 Sunday, was in the mailbox on Wednesday, and I was working out at the gym with my new toy by Thursday.  I didn't know an MP3 player could be this affordable, so I looked like a dork at the gym with my DiscMan up until this week.  (Okay, I'm an over-40 woman--I'm not into gadgets.)  I took this player out of the mail box, and had all my favorite songs downloaded to it (with my custom playlists) 2 hours later!  This is probably the best thing I have ever bought for less than $25.  I highly recommend it.  Go ahead and order the silicone case w/clip if you get this player.  The earbuds that came w/it are the best I've ever worn; somehow they stay in place very well for me.  Plenty enough volume to drown out the cell phone yakkers on the treadmill next to ya!  The only negative comment I have is that the tiny quickstart manual teaches you nothing about how to scroll thru the menu on the player or the menu's different features.  It took me longer to figure all that out than how to burn my music onto the thing.

<Title>Works Great!!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym.  They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them.  The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there.  It does drain the battery a little fast but I use rechargeable batteries.  It has enough space to save several songs to listen to while working out.

<Title>Ah, so so
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device.

<Title>Great Little Device
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recently purchased this MP3 player and am very pleased with it. It holds all of my favorite songs. I also like the little display window showing the current artist and song, and I like the fact that it includes FM Radio. For the cost, it is a very good buy----not the fanciest one out there, but just what I was looking for.
