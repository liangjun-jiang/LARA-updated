<Title>DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME  (with a MAC)
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item less than a week ago from a local retail chain.  It did not occur to me until after I got it home that my MAC would not work with it.  My husband told me that there was no way that it would work properly if at all with our computer.  So, luckily he felt sorry for me and took it back to the store:)  To my suprise and delight, he returned home with an iPod.  I am so much happier with this one.  Besides, next to the iPod, the Zen looks too much like a toy for my five year old daughter.  So, if you have a Mac or a really mean husband, don't get the Zen.

<Title>Good features nice sound
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my wife. Wanted something that looked cute!!! It is compact. The headphones provided with it are not that good. But otherwise the  sound quality is pretty good.   It is easy to sync and use. No need to install any creative software if you only want to sync music and pictures. You need the software for videos.

<Title>Better than IPod
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing.  Not only does it have the capablity to hold up to 1,000 songs (depending of file size), but the video quality is oustanding!  You don't have to subscribe to anything like Itunes and it is easy to download your own songs.  The screen is beautiful and the size is great for travel. I love my Zen and I have converted some IPod users.   I'm getting one for each of my parents as well!  This is a great all in one little device.

<Content>Great player,good looks and features for the price. Certainly superior to a similar I-Pod that a relative of ours has for less money. It has worked flawlessly since we got it. Easy transfer of data(without being stuck going through I-Tunes).

<Content>Having been new to the MP3 market; this is the way to start out the music quality is clear and sharp. The photo uploads are great so instead of just giving people a business card they can now see samples of my work. Great all round happy with the purchase it gets used daily,

<Title>Pretty in Pink
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the third Creative Zen V Plus I've purchased. All have been great. My wife lost her black Zen V plus, so we bought the pink one thinking it might be easier to spot if it falls under the sofa. The pink only holds 2-GB, but we use them mostly for podcasts and books on tape, so that's plenty. No problems with any of them (except the 4-GB is black and hard to find if you lose it:-)

<Content>I am 65 years old and sometimes it is hard to sink in.  It has taken me some time to learn all the things I can do with my mp3 player.The direction are not very good and you have to learn thing by trial and error.  I use my mp3 player to download audio books from the library.  It works great. I am thrilled with it. Lana Stites

<Title>convinient
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is very convinient for someone who just wants basic music.  It says that it can hold up to 1000 songs which is not true because mine is barely at 300 and it's almost full.  They also tell you it comes with 2GB of space, but that again is not true because it only comes with 1.8GB...you may say that it's only a difference of .2GB but that little bit of space really matters when you are running low on memory.  All in all the Zen V 5 plus is a good thing to have...It's small so it fits almost everywhere and it's very easy to use.    If you are looking for something to just put a few songs on then this may be the music player for u.

<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have really enjoyed my Creative Zen since I've had it.  The only complaint I would have is that sometimes it will just stop playing for no reason.  Hitting the play button will fix it so I dont know why it cuts out sometimes.  Other than that I've had no other problems!  The software is also super simple to use.

<Title>User Friendly
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very user friendly.  Only thing is I had to figure out things like how to delete something from the device without hooking it up to the computer to clear it.  Instruction manual is not very detailed, just gives the basic stuff and omits technical info.  But for us 30-somthings, I have found it's great for just listening to what I want to hear and nothing too fancy.

<Title>Display has quit working after three months.
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice player, but this one and a black Zen V Plus 2GB Black/Green BOTH have a dead screen after three months. I would send them for replacement but when I contact Creative about the warranty I got this......   RMA Fees & Details      * According to the data you provided, your Creative product is beyond the standard labor warranty but within the 12 month hardware (parts) warranty.     * The diagnostic and handling fee for products returned outside the labor warranty is US$25.00. To continue the on-line RMA process, you will need to pay the $25.00 fee using your credit or debit card through our secure shopping cart during this on-line process.    So I have to pay one third of the product price to get it replaced through factory warranty, I don't think so.
