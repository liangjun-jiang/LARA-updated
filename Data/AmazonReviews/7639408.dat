<Title>simple but useful
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a long commute and now use this solely for Audiobooks and it is perfect for such a use.  When I first bought it I intended it to be used for my morning jogs but I decided that I wanted something that held more so I wouldn't have to constantly update it according to how I felt that morning.  However, that is pure laziness as it takes seconds to update.  The battery life is also more than sufficient.  I don't know about other 256 MB MP3 players but this one seems great to me

<Title>A great starter/responsibility tester
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player was everything that it said it was. My daughter wanted an expensive MP3 player but I wanted to see if she could keep from loosing it. She hasn't lost it yet. I really like the fact that this comes with the FM radio... they all should. I say starter in my title because with the limited memory it does not hold many songs. Another benifit to the FM radio..

<Title>Not too impressed...
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...  Pros:  -good sound for the small size -good price -easy to use -I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.  Cons: -battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs -when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to. -putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.  I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me.

<Title>MuVo TX 256 MP3 player - broken usb connector
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I saw another review with a broken usb connector problem. It happened to my MuVo too. The connector is not really broken but is cleanly separated from the player (and attaches firmly to the battery unit). My MuVo player is now completely useless. The CL "Award winnging customer service" web site has no address or phone number to call for repair. Needless to say, CR loses me as a customer.

<Title>For Beginners
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this about 2 years ago, when it was first released and very expensive. It is still the only MP3 player I have ever owned and does the job. Compared to newer MP3 players this is a `toy', with limited functionality, memory, and lack of video, pictures, etc. It is extremely basic. The biggest problem is with battery life - it is horrible!! Absolutely horrible battery life. It uses 1 AAA and it eats through batteries like crazy. That has been the biggest downfall. The software it's bundled with is ok, but not very intuitive; I still have a hard time figuring out how to transfer music easily. The player is extremely compact and the headphones are ok - nothing fancy. I've used the voice recorder a lot and also the FM radio, and both offer good reception. The on/off dial is a button that you have to hold down and it takes quite a while to start up/shut down. You can scroll through songs, fast forward, rewind, and the songs seem to be played alphabetically by song title (unless I just haven't figured how to change that). This isn't a player for people who love music, because it doesn't hold too many songs - between 60 and 120. I've outgrown this, and technology has surpassed what this player is capable of; this is a bare-bones player that doesn't hold much and doesn't do much. Great for a run in the park, but the battery probably won't even last that long. Unlike others, this has never broken on me or malfunctioned. There are much better options available now in MP3 players, so look around for something better.

<Title>Total Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it.  It has never worked correctly.  When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me.  Now, it won't even turn on!  Unfortunatly, I did not register the product or keep any of the original paperwork, so the company won't do a thing about it.  If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!

<Title>Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....
<Date>Thu Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!  Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a "discount" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.   Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad.

<Title>Love it - Can't put it down
<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative MuVo is a 256MB Flash Drive that can be used to store music or data. All normal disk operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, rename and also drag & drop can be used with folders or files. When you plug the MuVo into your computer USB, it will recognize and configure the MuVo and then lists on the directory tree as "Removable Disk (x)" with x being the next drive letter.  In addition to music, you can use the MuVo as a Secure Data Key. To do this, I am using a program called "Password 2000" which I have installed on the MuVo that uses about 625K of space. When used as a Secure Data Key, a double-layer of protection is provided. Two conditions must exist before protected information can be accessed. (1) The owner of the MuVo must plug it into the USB jack and (2) the correct password for Password 2000 must be entered. This is very handy since the MuVo's portability allows your encrypted passwords to be used anywhere, on any computer. Once unplugged, your data is off the computer and safely back into your pocket.  The MuVo lives up to it's reputation as outlined by other reviews on this web site so, I won't duplicate that information.   On the down side, I found the Earbuds to be difficult to use as they kept falling out. Also, they don't quite match the audio quality of the Radio Shack (Koss) "Pro 25" headphones I'm using.  For it's size, weight, portability, and sound quality, I highly recommend this excellent product. Be sure to shop around for the best price. I've recently seen this product at a local chain store for about 33% less than the typical price.

<Content>The Creative MuVo 256MB Player is a great all-in-one product.  I got it after losing my Otis player.  I listen to a lot of audio books from Audible.com and there is a firmware plug-in from Audible to support this product for their download manager.   After experimenting for a few minutes everything works fine.  I have experimented with all the features and they work fine.  To have in one small lightweight package a flash memory drive, radio, audio book player, mp3 player, and voice recorder/FM radio recorder is very useful.

<Title>First CREATIVE experience
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My life is full of first-time experiences.  As a oblivious infant, I experienced my first time walking. As a 5-year-old, I experienced my first time how to read, and speak cohesively.  As a adolescent, I experienced my unbalanced emotions that I couldn't understand when I'm around girls.  And now, as a modern electronic-enthusiast,  I experienced my first time purchasing an mp3 player...or in this case, FLASH mp3 player.  ~REVIEW~  Let me get right down to this:  I LOVE this device.  Any newbie who's under the same shoes I am, looking for good mp3 player at its core, should place this player on their electronics checklist.  This review probably isn`t going to be THAT informative, because I don't know got-dang much about the selection of mp3 players.  I took me quite a while to find the best player on the market with the green I little have on my wallet, and I believe this CREATIVE product is the right choice to make; right on the features, and right on retail.  The "CREATIVE MuVo TX FM" player is cool, because like what it says on the box, it's not only a mp3 player:  it's a mp3/FM radio/microphone hybrid!  The player is small, it can place well into the palm of an adult's hand.  The screen is small too, but the buttons are big, and the text on the screen are quite readable, so the size is not that big of a deal.  Plus, it shows how much juice the AAA battery got left.  Like every music player affair, it has a standard play/pause, and volume button; the play/pause button also acts as a power button, but it's one of those power buttons where you press and hold it for a few seconds in order to turn off.  The scrolling gray thingy on the black width side of the player controls the rewind and fast-forward of the song whenever it`s pushed either left or right, which also skips tracks the same way, and pressing it can activate the selection the screen highlights or go to the main screen.  On the mp3 side,...well, it plays mp3 songs obviously, and it plays well, and sounds clear and flawless (it also plays WMAs).  Since I bought the MuVo TX FM with 256 Megs (approximately, meaning between 240 to 250),  it can plays up to 4 hours of songs with 128 kbps.  This player also has its own Equalizer, which is basically a bunch of bars moving vertically so the adjusted sound placement of the songs can be just right for the listener.  It contains its own sets of EQs: rock, jazz, classical, or if you're a EQ pro, you can customized your own EQ to personalize.  I can pull the black piece out of the white area of the MuVo, and use it as a separate USB hard drive, which was the greatest thing about it, because it's the easiest way to drag in any files (NOT JUST MP3) from the computer and put it in the device shown as a separate drive without out all that yes-or-no legal-disclaimer nonsense.  And I couldn't believe how fast the transmission is from computer to device; it took me almost a minute to put in all 25 4-minute songs.  The MuVo package does include a CD program, and with it I can convert my CDs into mp3s; there are other programs that can do that, but I don't mind this one.    One thing must be notified:  Licensed music files CAN'T be transmitted through point-A-to-B dragging, so you must transmit these types of files through a computer media program.  On the FM side, albeit without AM to back up, it sounds just as fluid as an mp3.  I can save a  preset to the radio stations, using the in-device menu, and up to 32 presets can I automatically go to any of my favorite rock/rap/whatever station.  The reception is good; it's not great, though.  Sometimes I have to wave my hands around like an airplane director with diarrhea just to hear the local college jazz station.  Otherwise, the FM radio is a wonderful alternate if I don't feel like listen to my personal tracks.  You go to school, and you were snoozing while your algebra teacher is discussing about the Pythagorean theorem, this device is effective as a microphone.  I went through the same situation, and this device works wonders as a listening stand-in.  And up to 16 hours can I record any kind of situation I want to hear again, or forgot to hear the first time.  Just a reminder, this takes up the same amount of Megs as the mp3s, so record it wisely...or not.  I made so much positive facts, the MuVo seems perfect, right?  Sadly, not true.  When it comes to putting the music files in the MuVo, I can't sort the tracks of my choosing, because the tracks are always listed alphabetically.  For that,  it became a time-consuming process to rename the whole files on the computer so the MuVo can list them the way I wanted, and that's tiresome.  The play/pause button has a tendency to get a slow response when I press it, and like everyone who reviewed this product, the uncomfortable headphone included in this device can make a person spend 30 extra bucks on a new one.  THE FINAL WORD:  Value.  If a media player has a ton of features AND it cost less than $150, almost nobody would ever stop saying "wow!", and with MuVo, I still have the habit of keep saying that.  Okay, it's not an Ipod, a Rio, or a Sony network walkman, and what I say is no different from every other positive reviewer for this item, but another positive review is just another example of why this is such a good buy and a good alternate for those who just wants to listen to music, no matter how much it can hold.  Don't distant yourself on this one.

<Content>USB 2.0, light weight, awesome sound, FM radio, long battery life, quality ear buds, and it took a total of 7 minutes for me to be up and running with this thing. I cant stress enough how easy it is to load it up with music. The software is great, it rips CD's, organizes music, compresses files, you name it. No cords no funky wires, just plug it in and the transfer is so fast. I personally dont needmy entire music collection with me, this holds just the right amount of music for my train commute and my jogs at night. This player is awesome.

<Title>Size Matters
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We all know size matters, and as tiny as the MuVo is, it's one of my sexiest gadgets. I've owned larger lighters.   This is my first mp3 player, so look elsewhere for comparison based reviews. As a first time owner, I am absolutely delighted. The sound quality is as crisp as a CD. The controls are simple and intuitive. It's tiny enough to fit into the smallest fashionable purse, but also comes with an easy-to-use removable belt clip and exercise arm band. What more could I want?   I bought the MuVo to go with Audible.com. At 256 megs, it will hold 2-3 medium length novels or one huge unabridged one. I could've bought a MP3 jukebox, but in comparison, even the iPod mini is HUGE. I don't need every song I've ever heard with me all the time. I'd rather throw on a playlist and a book and have a wonderfully tiny little device.  The software is so simple I never needed to open the manual. Plug and play, baby! The MuVo is also a USB flash drive, so no cords are needed. Just slide it into your USB port and you're all set. Loading files is simple and intuitive. If you already have audible.com, loading audible books is just as easy (IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only compatible with audible files at a 2 or 3 resolution. Higher or lower and they won't be recognized by the player.)   The biggest shock was the FM player. I owned a Radio Your Way for awhile and couldn't hear the songs over the static. My tiny little MuVo picks up even the faintest NPR stations with incredible clarity.   The included headphones are a bit uncomfortable, but headphones are cheap and easy to come by. I can't begrudge them that. Other reviews complain about low battery life. I get about 8 hours on my rechargables, which I find pretty reasonable since it's powered by a single AAA.   If you're looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player/FM reciever, with great sound quality, you can't go wrong with the MuVo.   ***addendum:  The Samsung Yepp is, in fact a tiny bit smaller. For people out there who want to rub it in, the MuVo is the sexy thong of the MP3 world while the Yepp is closer to a g-string. Less is what you see and less is what you get - the Yepp is NOT Audible ready and does not offer any Audible support. In addition, the Yepp does not come with either a belt clip or an armband (MuVo gives you both) so make sure your clothes have plenty of pockets. The MuVo is still the tiniest MP3 player in it's class, but there is a less classy competitor out there if you're looking for sheer Geek Chick Size Coolness.  The size difference is pretty minimal. MuVo: 1.4 x 2.9 x 0.6 versus Yepp: 0.94 x 0.94 x 2.2. It's really more a question of whether you prefer your MP3 player flat (the MuVo) or cubical (the Yepp.)

<Title>File System Error Fix
<Date>Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In general, I love this little machine.  It has all the right features.  It's small, but packed with goodies such as a FM tuner, a voice recorder, a 256 MB USB storage device with an integrated USB plug (no wires), and the sound quality is great.  A few small complaints.  First when the clear plastic belt clip holder is on, it's really hard to remove the MP3 player from the battery housing.  I guess it's not supposed to be removed with the belt clip on, but I'd like to be able to do that.  I ended up cutting a chunk off the clear plastic so I can unplug it easier.  Second, the headphones are poor.  The ear buds don't fit well and the sound quality is poor.  The wire has an asymmetric joint so the wire to one ear is longer than the wire to the other ear.  Ditch the headphones and buy a good one.  Third, I had the unfortunate experience of having the dreaded "File System Error" show up on the screen.  Don't know how I got it, but when it happens, you can't turn the beast on.  It just flashes the error message and turns itself off.  I can plug it into the PC just fine and it will work as a USB storage device.  Just won't work outside of the PC.  Formatting it didn't help.  Calling Creative tech support didn't help.  They told me to return it for an exchange.  I did a web search and found some people with similar problems.  They were all told to return it to Creative or to return it to the store for an exchange.  By an incredible stroke of luck, I stumbled on a way to fix this nagged problem.  I formatted it again (using windows explorer), but this time, I specified FAT file format instead of FAT32.  Voila!  It turns on and seems to be working just fine now.  So those of you who see the "File System Error" message, try that first.  You may also try to put a Label on it.  Perhaps that helps too.  Overall, I still love this little music machine and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Great little gadget for the price
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I won't give all the specs because those are listed in the spotlight reviews. I got this for going to the gym, and it's pretty much just the right size for putting all of my favorite up-beat music on to exercize to. Also it's holding up remarkably well considering it gets thrown into my gym bag with my sneakers.  The controls are very simple and easy to use. And contrary to the first spotlight review, you actually can skip to the middle of a song, you just have to roll the track-skip wheel to the right and hold it for a while (it's just not terribly quick). The menu is pretty self-explanatory and includes all the features you would want without all the bells and whistles. Also if you turn off the player while it is in the middle of a song, when you turn it back on it picks up in the middle of that song and remembers your settings including playmode and EQ.  You don't have to download expensive software that takes up all of your memory, but you have the option of installing software that the player comes with, or you can just drag and drop from your computer to the player. However you can't create new folders once the music is on the player - files have to be in the folders you want them in on the computer and uploaded that way.  Two criticisms: one is the microphone quality. If you are recording a person talking, it comes out slightly muffled and quiet and you really have to turn the volume up to hear. However seeing as this is hardly the most expensive, high-quality mic on the planet, it at least does its job.  Second, and this is minor, the player hooks onto the armband via the belt clip. The belt clip is fairly fat, so although the player is tiny, it becomes quite a protrusion from your arm, as opposed to say, ipods which go into a case that's flat against your arm.

<Title>Great and Little!!!
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first bought this product, I was a little skeptical because some of the reviews on this site said that it breaks easily after six months.  So i finally decided to just buy the damn thing and take my chances.  However, I bought an extended warranty for 10 bucks (from amazon) just to be on the safe side.  I am happy to say that after 8 months my mp3 is still working just fine.  The only problems I have with it are the following:  It doesn't have much room, especially when you want to hold files and music on it at the same time, you have to keep buying batteries for it and since I listen to mine all the time I usually end up buying batteries every single week, and for some reason the button used to increase the volume is a little jammed (but that could be from me always raising the volume.  Other than that I would recommend this product to anyone.  I personally like it better than Ipod cause it is cheaper, lighter, it just better.  If your a person that NEEDS 1,000+ songs to listen to, then Ipod might be the way to go.  But if ur like me and 90 or so songs will do, then definitely buy this wonderful gadget.

<Title>Great Device
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great buy for someone who wants a device to play good quality music for an affordable price. I have had this for a little above 2 months.  This is my first MP3 player.  I have very little knowledge about MP3 players.  However, I can easily say this is a good product.  This is great for someone who wants to spend a resonable amount for a Portable music player.  The sound is great, plays beautifully with a good set of headphones.  Its easy, just plug in a USB port drag and drop your file and you're done, it comes with software, but its unnecessary to install it.  Sturdy, I've dropped it quite a few times and no problems what so ever.  As long as you have Duracell or Energizer batteries the battery life is exceptionally long, about 15 hours.  Carry one extra and you can go an entire day with skip free high quality music.  The headphones are nice, not great.  If you have a good ear you might want to get some better ones, otherwise they work fine.  I don't quite use the extra features, but to write a good review I check them out.  The Radio for the most part has good reception, not to mention you can record it.  Voice recorder does an okay job, gets about a two foot range and you can hear it well.    Either way if you are looking for a music player with no special features, such as watching music videos, then this is a great buy for you.  Great sound quality, FM radio, easy use.  This alone convince me to buy it.  Simply because I'm not going to go out and spend 300 to 400 dollars on an iPod.  This is great if you want small and easily portable music with great quality playback.  My only recommendation is that you get a larger storage size.  I found because of the quality of sound, it brings out the irregularities of shrunk music to fit on it, I keep my music stored on it about 5MB, so the number of tracks are limited for me.  Actually I've considered buying another Creative MuVo MP3 Player with a larger storage size.    I don't know your preferences, but I was very satisfied with my purchase.

<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the MP3 player for about a month now, and overall Im pleased with it...it's lightweight, plugs easily into the computer, and has good sound quality. The earbuds are decent too. I've been using it in the gym and it works well for me.  I had problems when I downloaded music files using Windows Explorer...it's best to use software to download the files to the MP3 player. The software that comes with it is a little awkward to use, but not too difficult after some practice.   It does go through batteries rapidly! However, I've been loading MWA files on it, and they are supposed to drain the battery more quickly than MP3 files. I plan to experiment with this.  If you've got more money to spend (I didn't), I'd recommend an MP3 player with more storage...this unit holds the equivalent of about 4 CDs, so I'm having to periodically erase the MP3 player and load up different CDs. It doesn't bother me but it's something to consider.

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player with a radio for my walks....this fit's the bill, althought I had another one that only lasted about a year.  For the money...it's s good little unit but I think the next one will be an IPOD that will hold a lot more cd's and work with my home stereo.  I would recommend this to people who want some tunes while working out as it's small and no to expensive if it's dropped.

<Title>Value for Money....better display would help
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This chap is sheer value for money, triple the features for half the price of an ipod. Quite easy to use for the average buyer....would have helped if the display was a bit more ligible and the menu would stay for a couple of seconds longer, I bought this for my dad who is 70+, and it took him a while to get used to it.

<Title>I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT...
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player for my 10 yr old son for his birthday.  We downloaded alot of songs on it and it played for a week, then it would just turn off by itself while my son was listening to his music, so my husband and myself played with it a little to see if it was the batteries and it kept doing it even after replacing the batteries.    Finally, we just sent it back and got a refund.    After we got a refund, we went out and bought a SCANDISK MP3 player and he has been in music heaven every since.

<Title>Great little thing! Better than iPod nano
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is fantastic. Very easy to use, excellent sound quality, excellent battery life. The buttons are little small for those who have big hands, but it is extremelly light. The FM works great, and you can even record from the FM. It is really a pen drive, so you can just stick it in your USB port with no need for calbles to connect. I'd recommend, not only this version but all the others 512Mb and 1GB (blue and red)

<Title>Battery Life - Unacceptable
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have used the MuVo TX FM 256 MB for several weeks now and find that it does everything well except that battery life has never been more than 2 hours.  I have bought the best batteries available, not used the variety of functions available on the unit and the result is always the same.  Two hours or less battery life.  I've even used the "monster" batteries that are made for digital products.  Support from Creative labs has been a series of nonsensical emails that were obviously written by High School dropouts.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

<Title>Better by design
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most who purchase from Amazon.com I do read reviews and try and help others who may come along. On the plus side I do like the small conveinent size,with easy to use controls. It would be perfect for cycling. I  did have two concerns.  1. On page 12 of the manual there is a warning notice to wash your hands after use, because you "may" have lead contact with the cords.  It does not specify internal or external. Based on how harmful lead can be I didn't want to take any chances.  I don't think it matters on the size of the product and its components that contain hazardous materials. Warnings are usually there for a reason.    2. The Sports Armband has a poor design.  Unless you have 16 inch arms than it may work for you.  Having to gather the fabric to make it work felt odd and noticeable.  As for performance I never go that far.

<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The best of both worlds: MP3 - FMRadio in  a small very practical design. Nice features.  One failure: don't have Bass Boost, so I guess it could have more powerful sound. Anyway, it's good enough to keep.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had this for several days and overall I am pretty satisfied with it. I won't bother going through all the features here. The things I like most are: 1) pretty samll and light weight, good for taking it with you jogging 2) it's really a jump drive, so you can use it just like a jump drive  A couple of complaints: 1) The earbuds are very uncomfortable (at least for my ears), even though the sound quality is pretty good. I had to junk it and get a new one. 2) The belt clip holder could be much better.  Also, a previous reviewer complained about a warning label on "lead contamination", I believe that is the same "warning" they put on all Christmas lights. In fact, I think that warning is only for residents of California. :) The same reviewer also mentioned the size of the armband being too big, actually if you put it on the right way, it won't be too big.

<Title>Excellent small player
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After reading the other reviews, I selected this item as my first MP3 player.  I think it is great!  The sound is excellent;  it's a great size (for a 256 MB player);  it holds enough music to make it useful;  the radio is ok;  the battery life is impressive;  the price is right.  Some minor complaints:  the ear buds are too big to be comfortable;  the display is a bit too small;  the scroller is too touchy?  Overall, I'm satisfied beyond my expectations.

<Title>The earphones are large, but...
<Date>Sat Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not, I'm on my second MuVu.  I bought the 256MB NX almost a year ago for a pretty decent $119.99, and then I just bought the 256MB TX FM not too long ago for $99.99.  I agree with what most people say, at least in the flaws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earphones are large, and I'm a pretty big guy with pretty large ears, etc., and even I find discomfort with them.  What I did was sell the earphones Creative Labs packaged it with (which fetched around $10 on eBay), and I went out and bought new earphones.  The included earphones are special because they use the metal Neodymium, but Neodymium earphones are readily available through other makers (although the Creative Labs one is the best fit for the Creative Labs player), so it shouldn't be a problem to find an ear bud that's the right size for you.  Any earphone/headphone with Neodymium offers crazy bass than if you use an earphone without it. I think Coss sells affordable ones for $9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a lot of people were saying the buttons are too sensitive.  Well, the reason I'm on my second MuVo, and not switching over to something else, is because the buttons are simple.  I keep mine in my pocket, and I don't even have to take it out to see what it is I'm doing (unless I use something that requires the menu).  I mean, there are only four buttons (!)  I give props to whomever designed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My only beef is that the new MuVos come with a white battery case, and I looked at Creative Lab's web site, and found them peddling battery cases in different colors (I guess to keep up with the iPod Mini fad), and I really wished it would've came in gunmetal black (the original black color the NX came with).  Some people won't mind it, but I use mine at work and I don't want it sticking out like a sore thumb because you see this chunk of white, so I'm going to have to dish out $9.99 for the gunmetal black battery case (plus S&H).  And the radio's not that strong, unless you're outside or the station you're listening to has a strong signal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even then, its positive traits outweight the negative ones.

<Title>Great product with only minor flaws
<Date>Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have bought, but I am a techie so I know all about various computer related products. I had spent a couple of weeks looking for a decent mp3 player. I choose a Flash based player because I wanted to use it while I exercise (or when I start to actually) and a hard drive based player is just not a good idea for that. My requirements were that it have at least 256 MB of memory, have a FM radio and be able to carry more than just music. Having said that, I am providing a list of pros and cons.  Pros: Small Size: Smaller than my cell phone so it can fit in all my pockets and I barely notice its there. Connectivity: USB 2.0 is so much faster than USB 1.1. Loading music goes quick. Ease of Use: I opened it and within 5 minutes I had it loaded with music and playing songs. I give it to a few other people who wanted to look at it and they were able to do everything with it right away. Sound quality: It produces very good sounding music. I connected it to my speakers which have very good bass and all around performance and the Muvo was on par in terms of quality as my PC is. Buttons: The buttons are nice and big and easy to find. The power button has to be held in for a bit to turn it on and off. At first I thought this was a con but it is actually a benefit as it prevents accidently turning it on or off. One last thing, some people have said that you can't skip to the middle of a song, well if you press the dial forward and hold it there it will fast forward through a song. Same goes for reverse if you hold it the other way. Battery: The battery that came with it is a major brand battery and it has lasted a long time so far. I would guess at least 10 hours and its only half way done. Its only a AAA so thats pretty impressive to me.  Cons: Headphones: These things hurt! I have big ears and they still don't fit me. They sound from them when they are in is good but the discomfort of having them in outweighs this fact. Included Belt clip: The way the clip is positioned is great if you use it with the armband but if you put it on your belt it kinda digs into your stomach and I'm a really thin guy so its not my stomach causing the problem. It would have been nice if the player could be turned sideways so it is horizontal instead of vertical. That would have made the positioning much more comfortable while I am listening at work. Belt Clip Case-thingy: The rubber case covers only half of the player. Since it makes it really hard to take the USB part out of the battery pack, it would have been nice if the case covered more of the player to protect all of it or made smaller so its easier to take the player out. Lanyard holder: Creative could have spent the extra 10 cents and thrown a key ring in with this so you can attach it to a neck lanyard since there is a spot for one. Did I mention how uncomfortable these included headphones are?

<Title>An Amazing Thing
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo TX FM 256MB is perfect for listening to music outside your house.  It is practically weightless, at 1.5 ounces, and of course, it doesn't skip at all.  Perfect for if you are running, biking snowboarding, climbing, taking a stroll around the block, or sitting through a boring English class.  It is small and unobtrusive, easy to use and best of all it has an amazing sound. It can hold a surprising amount of music for its size and weight, right now I have about 4 or 5 hours of music on it.  But if you get bored of listening to your music, you can always add new stuff or switch to the FM radio.  it doesn't have a big antenna sticking out of it, it doesn't even have an antenna, yet it has amazing reception.  You can also switch from scanning mode, to preset mode.  It you ever have a quick though that you need to remember, but you have no aper, just record it, with 16 hours of recording time, you wont need a note book any longer.  So over all this is an amazing MP3 Player, that you should consider buying.  The only downside to it is changing the battery, but that is not too big of a deal, it has about 15 hours of it.

<Title>Creative Muvo MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After weighing my options whether to buy a dedicated MP3 player and an MP3-cum-USB storage disk, I decided to go for the MP3 USB disk combo. I shopped around and stumbled upon this MP3 player from Creative. It delivers good performance for its relatively cheap price. On the plus side, it is inexpensive, considering the fact that it is from Creative. It comes with features such as FM tuner, FM/Voice recorder and 256MB memory size for file/music storage. The software bundle is okay, although you may never need it if you know how to use Microsoft Windows media player 9.  On the minus side, the audio level is low, I wish the designers put in more power to its amps. Value for value, the Creative Labs MuVo FM MP3 player is a very good buy.

<Title>About fast-forwarding a song
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>One of the reviewers complained about the lack of a fast-forward feature, so he could not skip parts of a song.  There is a firmware update which adds this feature, and it's available from the creative website: http://www.nomadworld.com/downloads/firmware/wma-getfw.asp?nProdID=553&sProd=NOMAD%20MuVo%20TX%20FM  They call it the "Cue/Review" feature. After installing the firmware upgrade, you can enable the feature in your muvo menu.
