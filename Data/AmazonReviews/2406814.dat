<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i liked it because it was my first mp3 player and it's easy to control, my friend brought over her video ipod and i could even make my way around it.  nowhere near the experience though, but like i said great for beginers

<Title>Good idea, doesn't quite come through
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This flash drive seemed like a great idea.  Unfortunatly, the player has trouble playing most of the music files I transfer to it from my iBook.  The company says its compatible with Apple computers, but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs I transfer to it!

<Title>Item okay, but I'm no techno wiz...
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The item is okay for the purpose I intend to use it.  I've downloaded about 3 1/2 hours worth of music that I listen to on my pc at work, or when I exercise.  I have not used the voice recording function except to make sure it works, which I plan to use in classes.  Downside is that it does seem to "lock up" a lot, and I have to remove the battery to shut it down in order to start over.

<Title>I guess you get what you pay for -- of course could have paid a lot more
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one of these about 6 months ago and I used it a lot, especially when jogging.  Today it quit working correctly.  When I try to turn it on it powers up and then shuts off automatically.  Tried changing the battery; didn't help.  I paid about $40 for it so it cost me between $6 and $7 a month during its useful life.  Was it worth it.  Well, I enjoyed exercising a lot more.  In all fairness, and based on other reviews of similar products, I guess I could have paid a lot more for something else and maybe not had much better luck.

<Title>a mix of good and bad
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Picked this mp3 player up simply because it had a low price, and I wanted a player to use while exercising.  I had never heard of Coby so I wasn't sure what I was in for...  The good:  Easy to set-up and use right out of the package--didn't even have to install anything.  Simpy drag and drop mp3's from Itunes into the "portable device" icon.  This player is pretty small so you can use it virtually anywhere.  Runs on one AAA battery.  Decent little lcd display that so far only shows the song title.  From what I gather there are several options you can use, such as playlists, repeat, etc.  Have only had it one day so I haven't gotten into all that just yet.  The bad:  Seems a little flimsy...not sure how long this thing will hold up.  Function buttons and overall unit have a "dollar store" feel to them, kinda like a cheap toy out of a cereal box.  The ear buds included in the box are junk.  I guess you get what you pay for...maybe it will work for years on end but somehow I doubt it.  Probably would be wise to invest more money into your mp3 player purchase and get something with a longer shelf life.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the instruction booklet for this item is a joke.

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Basically this is a cheap item that should not be purchased. You can spend a little more and get a nicer and better equipped item. I bought this for my young daughter to download only minimal amounts of music so I thought for the price, this would be fine. However, it simply would not download songs. It continually 'locked up'. When it would finally download, the ear piece had static throughout. Finally, upon downloading  one CD, you were forced to erase that CD to download another. I have sent this back to the manufacturer for a refund. Upon telling the salesperson about my reasoning for returning the product, there was no questions. This is probably commonplace for this product.

<Title>great little product, but may be glitchy
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The navagation buttons are a little odd.  The music seemed to be glitchy, but  I think that was my software I was using.  It has been running fine for the last 6 months.  Doesn't eat up batteries that bad.  I use it jogging and has a hold button which is nice.

<Title>The Best Cheap Mp3 player  for  MAC or PC
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had this for 1 1/2 years.  I am a MAC person.  So I wanted the cheapest MAC compatible player out there. IT WORKS EXCELLENT!! For both types! No reformating of the drive, you stick in a MAC it reads it or stick in a PC it reads it. You can't use Itunes with it but the software in the box works fine. It does the job. You get what you pay for which is true.  Simple to use and drag and drop and your done.  I use this for work as well (transport files). TIP: if does fail go to the website and get the FIRMWARE UPDATE.  I had mine freeze up b/c I snatch it right out of the port rushing to meet an appointment. I got the update and it works again, Great! PS I have a NanoPod too, this is COBY player is still a great value.

<Title>junk
<Date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing didn't last long at all.  First month worked fine.  Second month, the files started to randomly get shuffled into other files.  Third month, the folder files were unable to be deleted off the player, and the screen gave foreign jargon instead of english, so I had to remember how to get to menu items by counting 'clicks' and 'ups and downs'.  Fourth month, the screen went out.  Bottom line, stick with a proven technology leader like Sandisk, who have been making quality flashdrives for years.  I've got one of their players and have had not one problem for nearly a year.
