<Title>Decent, not great
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for the water-resistant function (rain killed my other mp3 player) and the price. After a few weeks, here are my experiences:  - I prefer belt clip to arm band; band and the length of player can chafe some. Not alot but noticeable - probably a personal preference. - No off button is frustrating. Seems to die in my gym bag. - Sony software is a pain. No drag-and-drop directly into folder like other players. - Controlling player while running is easy ONLY if you are just skipping songs. Otherwise, you have to stop, take off the band and muddle your way through to perform other functions. - Charging via USB adds extra hassle, vs. simple battery.  Overall, once it's loaded, strapped on, and playing, it sounds good while exercising. And it's easy to skip song. BUT getting there is a bit of pain.

<Title>Great so far!
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player because I wanted a lightweight, water resistant player with an armband for use primarily during exercise.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the additional features-- lots of play options (shuffle within playlist, play all, etc.), FM tuner, "hold" position (inactivates buttons).  In addition, the sound quality is good and the armband is comfortable and secure.  The earbuds (which I think many people would choose to replace with their own), hook over the back of the ears-- I have used this player for multi-hour workouts without having the buds fall out or be damaged (so far) by sweat.  Great exercise player for the price!

<Title>Good value - one flaw
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the sound quality and the cool features of the device.  It is a great value for your money.  My only complaint is with the headphones.  They sound great, BUT, they just won't stay in place.  They don't fall off my ears, but they do get out of place which makes it hard to hear the music and makes me adjust them every few hundred yards.  If the headphones were to stay put in my ears through the run, this player would have gotten 5 stars from me.

<Title>Excellent accept few things
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i purchased this item nearly 1 month ago. Really amazing player but there are some points that makes make me give 4 star.  First - You have to use a cable for access via USB. Second - You have to use SonicStage(Very annoying program) for adding music to the player and can't even delete the music file without SonicSage.  you may consider this before buying it. But these are the only bad things i can say about this product. Very successful product indeed.

<Title>works great

<Content>I am not techno savvy, but this worked out okay.  I didn't see the problem with the software, it works fine.  I use it to mow, to run, to lift weights, to do anything, really, and no problems.  I sweat very heavily - embarrasingly so - but it has not caused any problems for this unit which was my concern.  The FM receiver works better than bigger radios I have wasted money on.  Overall, a good product.  It did not come with the belt clip, but the armband works fine and is big enough.  Pleased with my purchase.

<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only thing that is bad about this thing is the software you use to download music. But once you figure out to work that, it is really not a problem. Software doesn't seem to work with Windows XP media center version. I love the FM, mp3, stopwatch all-in-one feature. It is a very cool design. The headphones look ugly but I think they are the best when it comes to comfort. Other headphones hurt my ears after a while. This just hangs on my ear and is very comfortable. I love this MP3 player

<Title>Sony Should Keep Atrac/Connect. Why only use MS/Apple
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 2GB Hipstreet MP3/WMA player for 29.95 (locally).  After two months, screen stopped working.  I was told I if you have weight on any of them, they will stop working.  I did have a bag with two beach towels and nothing else on it. That day, this Sony player was 69.95.  I went back two days laters (I was told I could just bring back the other one and they would replace it free of charge--no go they changed and said I have to send HipStreet to manufacturer.  Now price of Hipstreet is 59.95). Now this Sony was 39.95.  This model was 1GB which worried me, since what I do with it is to convert Pimsleur language tapes on CD to WMAS and listen to them when I walk my poodle twice a day.  This needs a lot of memory. I have found, however, that the Sony-specific format called ATRAC actually takes less space than WMA and has a better-sound quality (not really that important for language sound files  anyway).  I downloaded the latest version of Sonic Stage Software, 2nd week of September,2007.  Now it is version 4.3. I like it WAY better than Windows Media Player. Why should I be forced to use Microsoft or Apple products (iPOD and iTunes).  Sony has something called Connect to compete with iTunes. They will be shutting it down in March 2008.  I think this is a serious mistake. The new players do NOT use ATRac as far as I can tell and will only use WMA/MP3 just like all the cheap brands.  The cheap brands mostly use replaceable AA batteries, not the internal one irreplaceable one that this Sony player has.  So the advantage of using both ATRAC format and being water-resistant over not having an easily replaceable battery will be lost.  Someone has a complaint that this player's battery does not last on a recharge as long as another Sony player from two years previous. But that guy did not read all the reviews. If that player had gotten it wet from sweat, it would have stopped working.  I am not a technofreak---I do not use Linux as, according to the tech columnist for the Wall Street Journal, it still is not as easy to use as Windows XP or Mac OS X (or whatever Apple has now). But why should I be forced to stick to WMA formats (Windows Media Audio) to get compression size down to 1/2 of MP3.  Or why should I be forced to buy an iPOD using proprietary software.  My son has one of these, and we do have the software to convert it, but my point is that Sony has a good product and a good software product that, in my opinion, is the superior to Windows Media player for CD/WMA/MP3 conversion, at least in it latest incarnation, Sonic Stage 4.3. This is again a serious mistake by Sony.  I actually did a report in a business class, listing the mistakes that Sony has made over and over and will probably repeat again (PS3--using BluRay, losing out completely with BetaMax, going to lose high-end laptop market to indestructible Lenovos and Panasonics, just as they did with desktop computers when they became commoditized).  Sony has here a unique and unusual product. They always do, but now they are changing the MP3 product line to one just like all the other ones. Serious mistake. Have you seen their new egg-shaped MP3 player, no headphones, shaped like an egg, only 1GB, going on sale for 350 dollars in Japan?  Another mistake.  At least they seem to be getting it right with their LCD monitors, partnering with Samsung. Also will lose the market of LCD-HDTVs eventually to Toshiba which has a much superior product to anything else in the market that is tied up in a legal dispute.  Sony..please keep both Connect and Sonic Stage/Atrac--to NOT do so will just be another mistake.

<Content>Since I bought this off amazon, I've only been using the radio.  I know that you need to use Sonicstage to upload songs, but what format do the songs have to be in to keep from skipping/clicking?  I've tried; mp3, atrac 3, and I've tried every bit rate in these formats.  Does anyone know what I have to do to get the music to play smoothly?  Other than that, the radio's sweet and it's shaped like a little cigar.

<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hello All ... First of all, if you already have this product, be happy. Its nice, with some nice features. Let me list the good points. 1. Its has cool looks. Flaunt it !! 2. The G-Sensor is cool. Counts steps n calories burnt. Shake n shuffle is a nice option. No need to push buttons !! 3. Has a custom equilizer.(no surprise though). 4. The wrist band comes with it. Real usefull for joggers / gymers. 5. The sports mode plays fast songs automatically.  Thats all I guess ...  now the real stuff, that the buyer want ...   1. Battery life is average. may need charging frequently than u thought. Only USB charge is possible. so need to have a PC or then buy a Plugable USB charger. 2. Needs Sonic Stage to put files in and out. The software has some restrictions on the number of PCs used. (I AM not sure). 3. The headphones that come with them are PATHETIC ... God knows why would they provide such low quality head phones. 4. The rotating switch need both the hands to operate, one to hold the base and the other to rotate the switch. One hand operation is possible, but then its difficult to see the display.

<Title>Good for jogging
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had it for over a month. Good overall MP3 player. Sound is good. The hold switch locks the buttons so that you don't accidentally push them when you jog.  The arm band stays in place. The earphones has a clip to wrap around the ears, but it still moves around so I have to adjust it often during my run. It comes with a variety of other functions such as stop watch, pedometer, calories measurement. Shaking the player resets some of the counters and there is a sport mode so that you lock the counter. With these extra functions, it's not that intuitive to figure them all out, so you have to read the manual.

<Content>I purchased this item online for 65 bucks.  I wanted something to use while I worked out.  The sound is clear and the unit works as indicated.  The only thing i found that could be improved is the armband.  The unit slides into a plastic sheath and then clicks in.  To release it and take it out is a pain though.  You have to dig your finger underneath the sheath and manipulate a little plastic piece that holds the unit in place which is not easy to do.  Other than that, downloading is easy, the controls are easy, and i would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable mp3/fm tuner.

<Content>This item came preloaded with music which made it incompatible with it's own software. The fix for this is the formatting procedure outlined in the manual. After we figured this out, we were in love with this MP3 Player.  It has so many great functions perfect for working out. You can even make your music fit your pace. It's a real winner. The arm band is perfectly comfortable. The player is easy to use with the manual instructions. I recommend reading the manual in it's entirety before trying to do too much with the player. And be sure to format the player before trying to load music with the software. It will save you some disappointmentand headaches.

<Title>Burned
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Let's dive right into it... The person who designed the hardware of this music player deserves an award. I use music players exclusively for working out. This is the first player that seems designed specifically for that purpose. The waterproofing and the pedometer are a God-send. I had lost 3 players before this to rust and short-circuit. The waterproofing is pretty important to me. The pedometer is simply useful. I keep track of how far I've gone and even cue the music to stop after a certain distance. Very cool. I can take or leave the tempo matching. (it is kind of insulting, I can't run fast enough to get the high tempo songs. :P)    Great, that was the pluses. Here is the reason I hate this player: the software. Notice how I kept writing "music player?" That is because this device doesn't actually play mp3s. It converts mp3 into a proprietary format. These files appear to be 2 or 3 times bigger than mp3s, judging by the number of songs need to fill the player up. (100 to a generic 1 gig mp3 player's 400 songs) Essentially, you need to use the Sony software to get the player to work at all. The software, in a word, sucks. I use Windows Media Player to manage my music. It excels in allowing me to sort media by upwards of fifty variables, such as "date last played," "rating," and so on. The Sony software has five. Also, it is difficult to create a handpicked playlist, while the player is attached, because the software transfers every selection as you make it!! If the person who created the hardware deserves an award, the software designer deserves to be shot. Thank you!!

<Title>Great for the price
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love the player.  Great hardware design with lots of features and customizations.  I got it for $17 and all I really wanted was the FM radio function.  I knew the sonic stage software would be a pain, and it is.  But it's usable.  Once you load your exercise music, you don't have to use the software again for a couple months. The battery will give you 3 hours of playback with just 3 minutes of charging.  This means that you can have full playback in only 45 minutes of charging.  This sold me on the player, since I wouldn't have to be buying batteries all the time.  If the battery is dead, I can plug it in for 3 minutes and it will last for any workout I'm going to do.    Here is the problem.  Every so often when it gets squeezed or shaken with something metal(Haven't figured out what causes it . . . Yet) It will reset itself.  If you are listening to radio, it will just start playing the first MP3 in the list and when you go back to FM it starts you at the station of the lowest number.  For less than $20 I'm willing to accept this bug. But if I paid full price, I would be very upset at this.    Pros: 1. 3 Hours battery charge in only 3 minutes 2. Water Resistant 3. Easy to operate without looking at it.  Cons: 1.  The software 2.  What's with this soft reset bug in my player. 3.  Sport features not available with the FM radio.

Problem was it died about after a years use.  I did use it regularly but i think the memory got corrupted, it could have been me just ejecting it when the comp was still accessing i duno, but i was peeved.  Also virtually no support acessory wise.  If ur arm band is busted or old and nasty, no way to replace it with ease, or in a timely fashion.  Have to call sony and pay mula.  lame  But all in all i was satisfied.  would have bought again cept for the allure of the new ipods lol.  I have gen 3 nano now .. and its considerably bulkier and heavier.   Recap Gym use Sony wins Home, starbucks, casual use, nano~.

<Title>Decent MP3 player.
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm pretty satisfy with the product. -The screen is pretty cool, it sort of rotate as you rotate the player up and down, so screen can still be seen at an angle. -The headphone is very nice, it fits my ear comfortably and sounds really great. Although it doesn't fit on my girlfriend's ear. If you have small ears, then you out of luck with this headphone.  The down side about this player is BASS is reduced in the player. Same song playing on my computer will have much stronger bass. When I plug the mp3 player to speaker the bass is very low. I guess it's a function to protect your ear while using headphone, so if you don't plan to hook it up to speaker then it's no problem.

<Title>Sony breaks ground in the mp3 field
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been trying different mp3 players and found this to be a great buy. Expecting the worst, I found this player to have an excellent sound stage; perfect even frequency with nearly no noticeable distortion at any volume. My ears are sensitive to treble causing listening fatigue. This player does not do that. I believe it to be the Sonics mated with the ear phones, the flat frequency range won't give you the range that will cause listening fatigue. With years as a guitar player and a past of car stereo competitions I would say I know a lot about sound. I would be interested in listening to the 200+ headphones on this. I would not expect much better. The bass is weak as stated in earlier posts, but it is plenty adequate and distortion free. I believe this to be a full balanced player and worth every penny I spent. Players tried: Sansa, Ipod, Creative zen. FM tuner works well also, with super low station drift if any at all.  Pros: 1.  Battery life 2.  Sound Stage 3.  OLED display (the cover acts as a lens to make the display viewable at any angle) 4.  The controls were easy to learn 5.  Light weight 6.  Comes with an armband 7.  Hold feature 8.  Ergonomic design 9.  Volume is not WEAK! 10. Small  11. FM tuner works very well, better than any model I tested.  Cons:  1. The software (I design software for a living and I found this hard to learn but figured it out)

<Title>Great player for exercise
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had trepidations about buying any Sony product, especially with any software, after the rootkit debacle but this player had all of the features that I wanted so I took the risk. If you want a mp3 player for the gym or any exercise, like I did, this is a great choice. The design of the band at the top to control the songs is outstanding. No fumbling with little buttons to skip a song while your hands are sweaty. You can lock the band by moving it downwards which is pretty smart. It takes a little time to familiarize yourself with how to use the band and the menu button to access the functions but is not too bad. I only used the Sonic Stage software to import existing mp3's and I did not find it difficult to use. I would have preferred a player that could play mp3 format and not have to create the .oma files, but again I had no problems so I can't really complain. You charge the player through the USB cable which is nice. No batteries and only one cable to mess with. I haven't tested the longevity of the battery yet but I used the player for 30 minutes and it charges back to full in just a few minutes. It is a little difficult getting the player out of the armband especially while it is on. There is a little clip on the bottom of the holder that hooks into a little hole on the bottom of the player, but that is a very minor complaint. I like the design of the headphones and they sound excellent. However, I prefer the standard over-the-head headphones anyway and will probably never use them, unless I use the player outside the gym. The screen is very easy to read and looks great. Overall, I think this is an excellent mp3 player for the gym and I am very happy with it.

<Content>This is really great MP3 Player. With all the additional features that it offers, its compact size with included arm band and durability Im really impressed with this MP3 Player. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasnt for the software packaged with it (SonicStage) - it can be problematic. My previous MP3 player was as easy as just plugging it in and simply dragging and dropping the .mp3 files as needed. If it could have only been that simple it would the perfect. I think anybody would enjoy this MP3 player - I dont care much for the headphones that come with it but to each his own.

<Content>Great product.  It is amazing something this small holds so many songs.  The 1 gb is perfect for loading "more than enough" songs.  Software is easy to use also.

<Title>too complicated
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this for my husband for father's day - at the same time I ordered a sandisk mp3 for my son at 1/3 of the price.  I added songs to my son's first- very easy and did not have to install specific software- it was already compatible with my computer's music software.  Then I attempted to add songs onto the Sony.  After figuring out how the thing works- it's neat  to look at but rather complicated to use-  I then realized that you actually  have to install specific software to download songs onto the thing!  I have 3 other mps players that don't require this- so I returned it and bought the identical one that I had bought my son. Both my husband and son love their mp3 player!  This one is too complicated- unless you have a lot of time on your hands and extra space on your computer!

<Title>Downgrade
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought the NW-S203F because my NW-E507 (looks like a cigarette lighter) had broken after two years' daily abuse and faithful service. Was a mistake. The NW-E507 was superior in absolutely every way. The NW-S203F has easily half the battery life of its predecessor, at least; the display shows only one line of text, on a narrower screen; the controls are less intuitive, harder to work. Have to go deep into the menu to change the play mode, for example. The design is clunky, fragile, with cracks to trap dirt and sand and an awkward catch on the top rim. Most importantly, the sound quality of the NW-S203F is significantly less clear and stunning than the player Sony put out over two years ago. It isn't the crappy headphones the player comes with: it just doesn't produce great sound.  As for the sports functions: the pedometer only works when the player is playing, which'll drain an already weak and flabby battery.  Overall, somehow Sony managed to take great performance and design, solid metal construction, decent sound quality, and, over two years' hard work, ruin it completely. The NW-S203F has very little to recommend it. My next mp3 player (and I'm sure I'll be buying one soon) probably won't be a Sony.
