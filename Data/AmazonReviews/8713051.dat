<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-2427411-7001231">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more! A  little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library.
