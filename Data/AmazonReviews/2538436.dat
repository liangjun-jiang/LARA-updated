<Title>Its been great for me
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the gigantic harddrive and easy intereface. I use this a lot and have never had any trouble. I am in college and I like to download books for class and listen to them while I exercise or work, that way I can study and not be stuck in the house, I am able to find a lot of audio books online that are compatable with this MP3 player. It is also handy because I can store data files on it like a flash drive and bring them to school for presentations. As far as durability goes it gets scrached up really easy but other then that it seems industuctable. The battery is fairly good I have never run out of juce and I brought it with my on a 14 hour flight, my only problem with its battery life is that it does not have the ablity to attach to any external battery for long trips. The screen is great for movies I have several full length movies on mine as well as tv shows and the picture quality is great, though it does kill the battery to use it. All and all if you buy this you will like it, it is a wonderful economical alternative to a Ipod and in my opion is better then my brothers 30 gig Ipod both in quality and usuablitiy

<Title>Forget Apple! This is the MP3 player for you!
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't say enough about Creative's MP3 players! No, they don't pay me, but darn it, they should, as much as I tell people how great they are! The battery life dwarfs iPods and the software - way better for keep track of your music. Ever asked someone for a copy of a song they have, from iTunes? Ya, good luck with that. I've given these as gifts because they're so easy to use and work so well! I don't travel anywhere without mine!

<Title>Zero Complaints
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is always really nerve-racking for me to make these kind of purchases because half the reviews for most products say "greatest thing ever," and the other half "terrible!" But the reviews seemed pretty good for the Zen 60 gb, so I decided to order it about 8 months ago.  So far, so good. It has held up incredibly well. And the 60 gbs of space is hard to fill. I am up to 45 gb, and I have everything I could imagine wanting on it already!  The thing I like most about this player may simply be the fact that it supports so many formats. The major concern I had with getting an MP3 player (and the reason why I didn't get an Ipod) is whether or not my various video files and sound files would be difficult to get on here. And, it isn't hard at all. I have had zero problems now with the various formats of videos I download offline and whatnot, and it supports my music file of choice, WMA, perfectly. It would be cool if it supported WMA PRO, but apparently NOTHING does yet....or at least nothing I have seen.   I love the program it comes with. IT couldn't be easier. I select my music from my music folder, and load it right in. It could not be any simpler. I do not use it to compress music-- my Windows media player does a great job at that-- but I simply use the program to add files that have already been ripped onto my computer.   Battery space is very good-- I have yet to not have enough battery power for the various times I have used it. It was great when I flew to hawaii. I switched between listening to music and watching movies without running out of battery power. It seems to go about 3-4 hours on video depending on the loudness of volume. Obviously that exceeds the length of most movies.  But the other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is getting a wall plug in and car adapter. I cannot stress how nice it has been to be able to charge this in my car, from a wall, and from my computer. Basically, there is hardly ever a time when I have to worry about it running out of battery power, because I can always charge it, from anywhere. I plug it in my mp3 line on my car, and listen endlessly. When I took a major road trip with my girlfriend, I listened to (and she watched) through a couple different movies. It was awesome!  So far so good with battery power, memory, and functionability.  It looks like at 192 kbps, I can fit about 600 full length albums on here, along with about 70 vids. Hard to tell. Right now I have 440 albums at 192 kbps, and 70 vids, and I am I still have 15 gbs left.

<Title>Excelente reproductor de audio y video
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compre el Creative Zen Vision M:60gb en agosto de 2007. A enero de 2008, sigue pareciendome una excelente compra. La capacidad es desbordnte. Tengo cerca de 40 cds en mp3 (musica comprimida!!) y todas han entrado en este reproductor de musica. No he tenido inconvenientes hasta el momento. Si bien la bateria no dura como lo ofrece Creative (en musica me da 13 a 14 horas, y no 16, pero es lo de menos!!) vale bien a pena para quienes hacen largos viajes, van en autobus, o simplemente desean toda su musica en un solo dispositivo. Debido a que tenia 30gb de espacio libre luego de poner toda la musica, empece a incluirle videos, y la calidad es magnifica. No uso mucho los videos pues prefiero la musica. La seleccion de canciones, y el facil manejo del menu, es fabuloso. Loas loas loas! Lastima que no sigan vendiendo la version de 60gb. Fui afortunado de ser uno de los ultimos compradores del Creative Zen Vision M: 60gb.  Ah, y lo mejor del Ipod: Creative tiene radio. Si te gusta escuchar noticias (como a mi), bien valia su precio.

<Title>Hitting the iPod Where it Hurts... (Everyone's a Critic)
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe some of the poor reviews for this item based on very minor flaws. Yes... it's thicker than the iPod but does that really affect it's use or is it just a fashion statement to have the thinnest player available..? How thin does it really need to be..? And as for the interface... I really don't see the problem. There are at least three ways to navigate the Zen and one doesn't even require the Creative software to be loaded on XP...  If you want to be a fashion victim then buy an iPod. If battery life isn't an issue then choose the iPod. If you like to be controlled by software instead of the other way around then ipod and iTunes is the way to go. If sound and video quality are not your prime concern (which would be an odd thing for anyone buying a music/video player) then go for the iPod. If you really must have a player that is a fraction slimmer that the competition, then once again, I urge you to buy an iPod.   However, if you want to buy the best at what it does, if longer battery life would be of convenience, if you require the best in terms or audio and visual quality, if you wish to avoid compatibility issues with video and audio formats, if you want to transfer music and video in a familiar Windows-style navigator and if you want all this at a price lower than it's nearest rival then you must, absolutely must opt for the Creative Vision M   In addition to the features hinted at above, the Vision M also has a built in FM radio, sound recorder with integral microphone, AV out facility for watching you stored videos on TV and much much more.   Buying an iPod is an easy (lazy) choice given all the hype, but anyone wanting to make a smarter choice in personal multimedia players would be well advised to look closely at what the Vision M offers. Don't be sucked in to the iPod hysteria.   I'd owned my 60GB variant for around a month at the time of writing this review and as yet I'm struggling to find fault with the player. The control interface is excellent and probably the most intuitive of any gadget I've ever owned. Only mind control would make navigation any easier. Loading media has been a breeze with complete hassle free transfers and conversions. I can't believe anyone would want to use iTunes after experiencing the Zen Vision's PC interface.   I'm constantly disappointed these days with products that fail to live up to expectation or designs and functions that miss the point completely. However, here is a product that is spot on. Currently there is none better than the Creative Zen Vision M.   The iPod is dead... long live the Zen...

<Title>Vision:M 60GB; Above Par
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Pros: + Comes with a plastic cover the screen out of the box. I left it on because it had no bubbles. + Best Video with good amount of space. + Best Sound Quality + Great Interface, in my opinion. + Most Formats + DRM compatible +Great battery life + FM tuner, built in microphone, and can act as USB host. + Great with To-Go subscription services. For $14.99 a month, I can fill up my Vision:M (all of it) with music, legally, using Rhapsody. The next day, I can fill it up again with new content. It will never cost me more than $14.99 a month.  Cons: - Thicker than iPod (pro in my opinion, I broke a Razr before) - Must be charged on a computer, unless another cord it bought - Comes with a silly pouch, and is difficult to find a case for the 60GB Vision:M (I did find it, I purchased it from Audio-Outfitters, and will update on the quality when it arrives)  My Explinations: Having built my own computer through a lengthy process of upgrades, I have learned to thoroughly research any computer-related product over $50 before I spend my money on it. I bought a Sound Blaster audio card for my PC, and was completely impressed with the sound quality. I even invested in some speakers for my computer, although I had no prior intention of turning my computer into a multimedia machine. Lucky for Apple and Dell, not a lot of people have the desire or know-how to research technology. Dell has created half-decent computers that are available to the public. The iPod became the first widely known MP3 player, and by all means, is decent. If you are looking for something more than decent, then this is the machine for you.  Its video, although not as colorful as a PSP, was way more colorful and vibrant than an iPod. After testing all three with the same video at the same brightness, I will say the Vision:M wins because it is able to play whole movies, is the most vibrant, and the PSP requires an expensive memory card to do so. The sound quality is the best, hands down. This is expected from Creative Labs. Its interface is awesome. Having had an iRiver, used and iPod, and still owning a PSP, it is best, in my opinion. It's great. The buttons are great for selecting things. Unlike the iPod, I can pause and go to the next song without my thumbs messing with the volume. However, the volume pad in the middle makes it easy to turn it up quickly. By starting in the middle and moving it down to the bottom, it turns the volume down at a fast speed. The size is no big deal for me. It is the size of a pack of Marlboros. Although Camels are my personal favorite (and slightly smaller), the Vision:M is no way cumbersome. The multiple formats make it easy to sync. In video, it does more than just MP4s. It does AVI, MPEGs, and DivX to name a few. It plays MP3s, of course, but also WMA and WAVs. It plays all common image formats. The USB host feature also makes it possible to get the video and images off a digital camera. The only thing the Zune has on the Vision:M is the WiFi transfers, but they expire. Digital Rights Managements (DRM) makes Vision:M win. Rhapsody To Go (my personal favorite) works flawlessly with the Vision:M. iPod only works with iTunes. Zune only works with Zune Market Place... The Toshiba Gigabeat works with Rhapsody To Go, but operates with Microsoft Portable Media Center. In my experience, avoid PMC! It has great battery life. I do not know much about the batteries of other devices, but it lasts 16 hours with just music, 5 with video. Additional features: the FM tuner is a nice feature, along with the built-in microphone (which records well, by the way). As I said it can act as a USB host for cameras. A side note, the software that came with the Vision:M ripped and transferred my scratched CDs without giving me an error. They were played in a CD player before and after, both times it would get stuck and skip. Windows Media Player would say "Unable to rip" on the tracks that skip. Creative records over the part that skips, and although the quality of the scratched part is lower, it has saved me at least $60 in replacing these CDs.

<Content>I had all my music on this thing within ten minutes of opening the package. It's so easy to use, the sound quality is amazing, just...wow! I haven't had a chance to even try out everything this has to offer- but I know I'll be impressed.  True, it's a bit weighty- but I didn't buy it for it's size. I shopped for quality, and I think this device blows the IPOD out of the water.  Great! :)

<Title>Buyer Beware - False Advertising!
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased this model because it advertised the ability to record radio. This feature was missing when I opened it though. I E-Mailed customer service and the reply was "Please be informed that Creative no longer supports the FM Recording feature." It turns out after threat of lawsuit the new firmware for the 30 gig model has this feature back however for this 60 gig model the newest firmware lacks this option. If the "Record Radio" feature is important to you please contact Creative and ask them if and when this feature will be re-incorperated. For now, this feature is advertised and not available. Be warned.

<Title>BEST MP3 MADE!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 3rd Creative MP3 Player.  I have ALL of my music in very high quality format (one step down from lossless) and ALL of my pictures.  It's amazing!  I love this player!  My only complaint is that they don't have a bigger one - I've already used up over 50 gb of the 60 gb and I'd LOVE a 100gb version!  Buy it though - you won't be disappointed!

<Title>Fantastic player, but 30GB cases don't fit
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is one awesome player; my coworker with an iPod is envious of the clear display.  However, the accessories are very limited. Creative's website lists this unit as the same size as the 30GB model which is incorrect; the 60GB is about 1/8" thicker so silicone cases just don't work without mashing the buttons.  Bummer!

<Content>I have had my Zen Vision M now for a month or so---It has the most amazing audio quality, AND the LCD screen is Gorgeous!!! The videos look so true to life!  The colors are High Def and so Beautiful.  I've had alot of Mp3 players to date but this one is just out of this world!!!  Please consider buying this one--I only wish it came with an even bigger hard drive--WOW!!!  I've purchased my second Zen Vision M yesterdy!!  I am truly hooked!!  I transfer my Tivo recordings to my zen and I sit back and watch extraordinary colors and sound!!!!  I've had a Dell, an iRiver, a Rio 600, Rio 800, creative nano and now the zen vision M (2).  So far it is my pick for the best player out there!! Everyone complains about scratches but to date I have none--just keep your player it the soft pouch supplied with your zen vision, you'll be fine!! I haven't tried an ipod yet--and I may never--The zen vision M is truly a WINNER in my book!!!!

<Title>*Mostly* better than an iPod, some things you should know:
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this way more than a comparable (and more expensive) iPod Video, but the player has some quirks you should know about first.  I picked this player because it has a built-in voice-recorder that I could use for interviews and to record school lectures, and the built-in FM radio receiver is a nice touch.  The Good:  The player works, sounds, and looks great, and is easy to use.  Another great thing is that it acts literally just like an external hard-drive, so you can put songs on it - or copy songs off it - very easily from any computer with a USB drive (unlike the iPod that goes out of its way to keep you from accessing your files).  You can record audio that is super long, there are FM radio pre-sets, a nice bright screen, and the controls have some very innovative features to make it easy to quickly find the album or artist you are looking for.  It also natively plays lots of popular video-formats, so if you're into downloading TV shows off the internet, you can usually watch them without having to convert anything.  The Bad:  Their software for putting songs and video on the player is just terrible, but luckily you can do it yourself with the Windows Media Player or the regular File Manager.  The FM Radio reception isn't that great, but works fine most of the time.  There are also some quirks you have to get used to:  -When listening to music, the screen won't turn off after a period of time to save battery (like the iPod) unless the player is "locked".  I hook this up to my home stereo-system all the time and always forget to lock it, then when I do, I have to fumble with the controls to un-lock it when I want to change songs or play-lists.  You don't have to lock it (and I've never had the battery die on me), but it just feels dumb to be wasting power to keep the screen brightly lit when I'm not looking at it.  -It takes some time to boot up.  I'm not sure how long exactly, probably less than ten seconds, but it is quite obnoxious when you want to listen to something and have to wait for it to start.  Once the player is on, everything else is quick (Switching between menus, loading files, etc).  -You have to adjust some of the controls to make it really work well. For example, one of the buttons comes factory-configured to make a completely random song start playing, which I see as a totally useless feature.  But with a few clicks you can easily re-program that button do anything else you want (like jump to the "now playing" window as I did, or the artist selection page or whatever).  Overall I really recommend it, but only if you are a bit nerdy and won't freak out about having to change some settings or use software other than what comes in the box.  If it's a gift for grandma, I'd say to stick with an iPod, which is meant to be super easy for anyone to use.

<Title>Amazing internal hardware, but with a casing problem
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say that the Zen Vision:M is a fantastically designed piece of equipment, as far as how good the electronics of the thing is. It can play most everything you can throw at it, especially most of the video formats used by groups puting television shows on the net. This was one of the main reasons that I bought the player (I am currently living in Korea, and the only way I can watch American television is by downloading episodes).  But there is a downside that has been present in both the 60GB model that I recently returned to Amazon as well as the 30GB model I previously had: annoying dust will get under the external plastic casing and onto the LCD inside. If you don't mind your portable media player having dust on the screen, than I guess I would still recommend this player for you, but for people like me, it will drive you insane.  Though the video playback is not as rebust and I will have to convert everything I download from the net for it, I will be going for a video iPod next, because of its better external manufacturing. I really with the Vision:M would have worked out for me, because other than that one flaw, it is a great piece of electronics.
