<Title>Great mp3 player for adults at a huge savings!
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my husband the black, "Pirates of the Caribbean" version (although he wanted the Pooh after I told him the choices I had) for his 35th birthday.  Priced at $49, but I got it on sale from Disney online for $39.99 with a $20 coupon code if you spent $50.  I ordered the grey "boys" case ($12.99) all for $32.98 (and free shipping)!  This is a fantastic deal for someone who wants an mp3 player but doesn't want to shell out $200 for an iPod.  Sign up for the Disney store online e-mail notices and see what sales they come up with.  Even if you pay full retail, at $49.99 the stick player is a savings over the others.  Closer to the holidays, I'm sure the price will drop or Disney will have another on-line sale.  The case has a spot for the stick player, has a metal cip and holds 4 SD cards, so you can have a total of 5-512 meg with you at the same time (2.5GB + onboard mem ~ 3GB player).  With the cost of the 512 SD cards so low (about $15 to $20 depending on where you shop online), this is a viable option vs the iPod Nano or mini.  Disney now makes the black "Nightmare Before Christmas" in addition to the neutral silver with the Disney "D".  They also have "girl" colors (pink princess, fuschia Raven, purple Tink) or the yellow Pooh, red Mickey and the red "Cars", so you can indulge your inner Disney.  Put it in the neutral slim grey case and clip it to your belt or purse, so one will know (unless you have pink earbuds)!  Disney offers a line of accessories including clip on headphones and a docking station (if you want a black one, you have to order from Best Buy's online store) but I think general accessories that fit the iPod Shuffle and other stick mp3 players should fit.  I think this is a very good product for an inexpensive alternative to a "grown up's" mp3 players that can run $200+ for the 1 to 3GB range, depending on brand.  Memorex did a very good job with this player and Disney is targeting the pre-teens but ut will work for an "adult" who doesn't mind the Disney brand.

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
<Date>Tue May 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter received a mix stick for Christmas as a gift and it completely stopped working in May.  I called Disney and was informed they would replace it but I had to pay $30.00 for the new one.  I would expect a $50.00 product to last more than 4 months...furthermore, Disney can certainly afford better customer service.  I will not buy this product again!
