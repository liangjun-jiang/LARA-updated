<Title>Good, not perfect
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched lots of hard drive mp3 players before buying one a year and a half ago. All the reviews I read said the Carbon was the best value for what I was looking for, so I decided to go for it because I-pods seemed over-rated and too expensive. I had no problem with it for about 7 months and then it stopped working for no good reason. Tech support sent me a new one and now all is well. It works fine, but there are some little quirks. The interface is not the most user friendly, and the clock refuses to work on mine, for example. Those things being said, I still give the carbon 4 stars because they aren't that annoying.  On the plus side, it can play lots of different types of files, has a built-in microphone and a long-lasting battery, which lasts twice as long and takes exactly half as long to charge as an ipod mini. It has a sleek look,fits easily in my pocket and doesnt feel fragile. I like the Carbon wheel better than the I=pod wheel. Someone on this site said they have had 3 different players and the wheel broke on all of them. I simply can't believe that that person wasn't just really really dumb. The wheel is perfectly sturdy. The case they give you doesn't have a belt clip and you need to take it out of the case to press the buttons, but you can buy a better one.  Rio seems to have really good tech support. I think they realize that their products are a bit quirky and they don't give you a hard time about getting a new one (this is based on my experience and that of one of my friends). All in all, I know four people who have a carbon (including me) and two of them broke and were replaced, so guess you just get lucky or you don't. That said, I know a few people who have I-pods that just cut out for no reason and/or don't charge properly, and they dont have good customer service to even it out because I-pods are so popular. So, in conclusion, this is not a perfect player by any means, but I'm happy with mine, and it's still a good value.

<Title>My third Rio product - this was a super deal!
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apparently unlike many of the reviewers here at Amazon, I have been pleased with Rio products thus far - first one was one of those little 126k MP3 players, then moved up to a Cali 256k.  I'm very accustomed to using Rio's Music Manager software as a result.  Anyways...I've been wanting to get a player that would be compatible with Napster2Go, but until recently most of the subscription-based players have cost $200 or more...too pricey for me :) so when I saw the Rio Carbon selling for $99 here at Amazon I jumped on it, and boy am I glad I did (granted, I've only had it for a week or so).  While I did have some issues installing the software and getting my PC to 'see' the Carbon I got a great deal of assistance from the forums at riovolution.com and rioworld.org - including a link to version 3.02 of the driver for the Carbon.  Once I uploaded that, it was smooth sailing...so far anyway.  The carrying case could've been better (what no belt clip???) but fortunately there are compatible cases out there - it would have been nice if the case that came with allowed the user to view the screen and the controls without having to take the player out.  Anyway - so far so good, in fact I'm considering buying another one for the hubby - being able to use Napster 2 Go is totally awesome!  I've downloaded 150 songs so far and barely used any of the Carbon's storage room...

<Title>0 stars - piece of *%$&
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've probably used this thing for 10 minutes in all the time I've had it and spent hours trying to get it working. Don't bother wasting your money.  First, it didn't power up at all.  then, it powered up but the pc no longer recognized it.  I finally got it all working AND charged up the battery, upgraded the firmware, etc.  Unplugged it to listen to it and what do you know?  None of the buttons are reponding.  It looks like it's cycling through the songs but can't hear anything.  Now it doesn't get recognized by the pc OR the power adaptor.  Nice.  Pushing the reset button does nothing.  If you do buy this, make sure you start TRYING to use it right away so you can get your money back.  I waited too long til the warranty was over.  I spend my whole day dealing with computer problems.  This was supposed to be a "relaxation device" for me!!!! :)  Just posting this as a warning - take a look at all the people who have problems with this.  I'm buying an Ipod.

<Content>I managed to get this player brand new for $69.99 during a clearance sale.  It is great for long commutes and work.  It works as advertised and I get about the stated battery life depending on current volume.  The only thing they should have changed was the carrying case.  You can't use the main buttons when the player is in the case.

<Title>I love it, and would buy another...
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 Player has given me hell.  But don't get me wrong... it's a love-hate relationship. It's incredibly attractive with a sleek and shiny back and an easy-to-maneuver front. It's lightweight and hold's in your palm nicely. The sound quality is great and I play it for long hours and it has lasted for a long time.  That being said, I've had my Rio for 10 months, and I've dropped it a few times (no practical protective case, really). Problems I've encountered have been it shutting off and bearing the message "Upgrader" not allowing you do anything. The best remedy I've found for this problem has been to plug it in to the charger, and it will typically take care of the problem. This was a recurring problem, but it has quit being a pain, and I've had practically flawless play with it the past few months. However, I dropped it recently and the wheel broke, which means I can not turn the volume up or down on the Rio, only through the output device (speakers). That's my own fault though.  You get interesting comments when listening to the Rio... "What's THAT?"... mainly because people are so used to the Ipod, but I would choose the Rio over Ipod anyday. Ipod's overrated.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has been two years since I purchased my RIO carbon, 5MB player.  I drop it at least once a week, it spends 25% of the time rolling around in my coat pocket while commuting back/forth to work, the other 75% is spent rolling around in the bottom of my purse.  Although it came with a case, it's not really practical.  You have to keep taking the whole thing out to change or search for different titles.  An improvemnt would be to have an opening which allows you to change your opions easily. Anyway, I dropped it one last time thsi week and the volume button came out and it won't work anymore. I'm buying another one! I see there is a 20GB Rio that has my name all over it!

<Title>Great Player!!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Both my wife and I have each had a Rio Carbon for over 2 years now.  Mine gets dragged (and dropped) everywhere.  I have wireless FM in my car so I can even listen to it while driving.  Neither of us have had ANY problems with our players, other than occasionally forgetting to recharge it.   I've dropped mine many many times without any problems.  My 7 year old borrows it all the time and it keeps on ticking.   I have firmware version 1.43.  I have 1,508 songs on it (WMA variable bit rate) and still have 20% of my hard disk left.  Haven't touched my CDs in years!  I like the long battery life and I fly overseas to India and Japan quite a bit.  It's nice having a long life MP3 player with on the flights so I don't have to listen to the canned airline music.  And I can recharge it off of my laptop when I'm in my hotel room or at work.   I have had no issues with the menu button or the little selection wheel.  If this one ever dies, I'll buy another one without any hesitation!  The only negatives I can say is (as others have mentioned) the case sucks and is worthless.  I also wish I could create play lists without having to use the Rio Management software.  I have gotten around this by using the `genre' as play lists.   I use Media Tagger 1.3.5  (which is freeware) to re-write the tag data on my music files.  Also as a side note, always have your songs backed up on a hard drive some place.  Even the best player can get lost or stolen and you don't want to have to re-rip, and re-download all of your CDs and songs you bought on-line!!!

<Title>Way better than iPods and half the price!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. It's a whopping 5 GB player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an iPod with comparable storage. It holds an amazing number of songs and I especially like the recorder feature. It's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! Both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. I agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that I wouldn't recommend it to others. Even if I hadn't been biased against iPods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("Buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! Never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), I still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.   My only complaint is that mine broke easily. I see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so I guess I got the token dud. I only had it for a few months and I dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything I do.   Here's my personal plea: It looks brand new on the outside and I hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when I know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. I checked Rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that I can check with? If not, do you have any general suggestions as to where I could start? Any type of stores or business that might offer this service? Thanks and I'd appreciate any help!

<Content>Very frustrating!  The Rio Carbon comes in an industrial strength plastic package.  I spent over 15 minutes trying to get it it open -- it is too thick to cut with scissors or slice with a razor blade.  Once I got it cut, I gashed my hand on the plastic.  I am no wimp -- this packaging is just crazy!  It could serve as the shipping container.

<Content>What a great little player (once my dad got the crazy package open).  It's about 3/4" shorter than the iPod mini, but about 1/2 wider.  Similar thickness, but more rounded.  Similar weight.  Like carrying another cell phone.    The rubber grip is nice too -- fits great in the hand.  One complaint: the shiny chrome case collects fingerprints and scratches like crazy.  After 2 days, the back is pretty scuffed just from sliding it across the table.  The iPod Mini has a brushed metal case, which hides scratches and fingerprints.

<Title>Incredible product
<Date>Sat Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Carbon for about two weeks now, and I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. First off, kudos to Rio for the sleek design; it's amazingly small and light, travels very well, and looks very, very stylish.   There are minor annoyances associated with the Carbon though. First off, if you buy this, make sure to have a set of good headphones / earbuds of your own with a gold plated plug. The packaged earbuds are crap, and anything uncoated apparently produces a lot of static due to some design error. Secondly, the back of the Carbon and the touchpad collect fingerprints like mad; being the neat freak that I am, I spend quite a lot of time polishing the bugger (annoying!).  Beyond these small grievances of mine, the Carbon trumps the iPod in both storage / battery life. Beyond the obvious 1gb increase, I'm never concerned about the remaining battery power (although I haven't tested the claim of 20 hours, I've never ran out of power, and I use this thing all the time). If you do buy the Carbon, make sure to upgrade the firmware; lots of small fixes and charging while connected via USB = plus.

<Title>Cool product - needs a little more thought put into design
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been a big fan of Rio/Sonic Blue products since their inception. The Carbon does have a lot of storage space for music, it the perfect size and weight (I use mine while working out and running).  Also, cool metalic backing like the iPod.  Ease of use.  Dislikes: battery goes fast!  6-10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged.  Also, battery guage is crude and not all that accurate.  Not precise.  Also, NO HOLD BUTTON!  That is probably the biggest design flaw - I keep hitting the buttons and pausing/forwarding/reversing songs unintentionally.  Lastly, the leather carrying case, while very cool, does not have a viewing window so to fast forward songs you need to remove device from case and manually fast forward.  Really needs to be a "cut out" to view buttons and the screen display!!!!  A note about RIO products: while cool products, good size and weight, they do tend to break rather quickly.  I'm not that rough on the equipment but previous 2 Rio products had problems that required fixing.  I bought my first Rio at Best Buy (yeah, they ripped me off) but got a cool protection plan that allowed me to trade in if product breaks within 3 years (for an extra $39).  You can return for same product or upgrade to the latest and greatest!

<Title>Great so far
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I chose to pick up this guy over the ipod mainly because the ipod uses itunes and aac. I'm one of those "bad" guys who prefers to pick up my tunes from p2p networks without the hassle of converting to apple's format.   Some pluses about the carbon: -Supports wma, this works really well with j river media center which allows you to upload and convert to wma on the fly. -great battery life, some people are complaining that they want a removable/replacable battery, but by the time the battery goes dead the player won't be worth keeping by then. -I personally like this design better than the ipod; as one reviewer said, I think the design appeals more to a male audience that finds the ipod a bit too toy-like. -I use this to also listen to audio books in the car (via the Belkin Tunecast II). The carbon supports the audible format, but I just rent audio book CD's from my local library and upload them onto the player.  -the 5 gig seagate harddrive can be removed, and it actually works in most devices that use type II compact flash (yes, it's that small). But from what I hear there are bugs with replacing a CF card back into the carbon.   Some cons about the carbon: -Like any other mp3 player, the stock headphones do not bring out the potential of the player. There are alot of earbud headphones on the market, but I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia for those on a budget (amazon has it for 27 bux). These earphones appear to be nearly identical to the MDR-EX71LP's, but the 71's have only a 15 inch cord because it's designed for players with a remote. The 71's come with a one meter extension, but the adapter looks bulky and the overall length becomes too long. Also, if you get static just put some clear nail polish around the base of the earphone jack to prevent direct contact with the metallic casing. of the carbon.  -the playlist feature cannot be edited from the carbon itself, and mine takes a bit long to process the playlists but only after I've uploaded new songs. (not a big deal, only about 10 more seconds and that's only after i've synchronized).   Overall, a very good buy considering the features, performance, and price. Plus, you avoid becoming an ipod clone.

<Date>Wed Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited at least a month after the Carbon came out to see what others thought, would it hold up, what bugs are present ect..  Then i made the plunge.  Overall its GREAT.  the battery life does last 20 hours.  You can even use a usb card charger i got for my palm to charge in the car with the included mini usb cord.  Holds a good amount of cds and love the fact i can listen to my audio books.  Any negatives are the power button.  With in the first 3 days the unit fell and the power button stopped working.  BestBuy exchanged it no problem but i made sure to get the 2 year warrenty extention with the new unit.  And this needs to build play lists in the fly.  I never used playlists untill i got this. But it would be nice.  How ard would it be to add this?   This looks so much better then the mini ipod and takes up very little room in a pocket.  If u use this in your car get the belkin tunecast II.  It powers via car charger.  Im tired of buying batteries for the tunecast I.  Carbon lasts longer then it does  UPDATE.  Im on my 3rd carbon.  This is the last try.  Love the player but something happened to unit and it wont power on.  Didnt drop it but did have a hard jolt.  IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM? If this one fails then i guess i get an ipod.  But damn it works so well.

<Title>A dissapointing purchase
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Prior to buying my Rio Carbon, I spent days searching the web for both professional reviews from major and smaller consumer electronic device reviewing sites, as well as many consumer reviews of the Rio Carbon. After reading all the hype and glamor everyone had to heap upon the Rio Carbon, I decided that it was time to finally get one myself.   Though the price was quite steep (around $270 after s/h), I was still very happy and satisfied at purchasing what I thought was a superb product. Upon receiving the Carbon, my first reaction was awe. What a cool looking device! Very sleek, thin, and fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. I then proceeded to carefully read the maunal and follow the directions step by step before even turning on the player itself. I charged the player for 3 hours just like the manual told me to do. Then went online to Rio's site and downloaded the latest version of the Carbon's firmware. I then proceeded to plug the USB cable into my USB port in my computer and followed all proper installation procedures to upload the firmware into my Carbon. One really neat thing that I noticed at this point was that when the USB was connected to both my Carbon and my PC, it would actually take that time to charge my Carbon through my PC's USB port! I then proceeded to take out the Music Manager CD that came with the Carbon, installed it onto my PC, and then surfed the web to update it to the latest version. Then started the task of uploading all my MP3s onto my little player. It was then, FINALLY, after a good excruciatingly long 7 hours after I had received the Carbon in the mail (after all, I wanted to make sure that I didn't do anything that might damage or deter from the directions laid out for my little expensive player), that I FINALLY turned on my Rio Carbon.   It was definately worth the wait. For as I turned on the Carbon, I was greeted by very cool red glow from the Rio logo on top of the player. And as the menu lighted up and displayed all the little neat functions of the Carbon. Such as voice recording mode, music/voice/audio playback, stopwatch, and a few others tweaks and settings.   However all little neat features aside, this was after all a MP3 player. And the whole reason for purchasing it was to play.....you guessed it......MP3s! I quickly pulled out the earphones that came bundled with the Carbon, plugged them into the player, and pressed play.  Much to my dismay, the sound quality was HORRIBLE! Maroon5 sounded like either a girl or a guy with a VERY high pitched voice. And my other MP3s didn't fare too well either. I couldn't understand if my player was just defective, or that this was normal for the Carbon. It occured to me that maybe a few of the MP3s may have gotten corrupted somehow during the transfer from my PC to the player (though I don't see how that would be possible). But the fact that ALL the MP3s didn't sound the way they were suppose to quickly ruled that possibility out of my mind. I pulled out my flash drive, uploaded all my MP3s onto it, and then transfered them onto my laptop to make sure the original files wern't the cause. And as I suspected, they played perfectly on both my PC and laptop through Realplayer, as well as Windows Media Player. Which left me with the conclusion that something was wrong with the Carbon. At $270, I was not overly eager to ship it back to receive a replacement that might give me the same results. So instead I opted for a full refund.   Overall this player had a great design, was a very good idea, but ultimately it failed where it counted the most. In its ability to actually play MP3s.

<Content>Great small player.  Price was well within reason for what it provides (I got mine for 250 online)  Pro's:  Small, light, sleek.  Real easy to charge (USB).  I've so far been happy with the sound (be aware, if you use an all-metal plug for headphones, it may cause distortion! Design flaw).  Thumbwheel and buttons all well placed and easy to use.  Been jogging with it several times without any skipping (very nice)  Con's:  Case.  Okay RIO, just why do you make a case that neither has an arm band nor a clip? Plus you can't access any of the controls while it's in it. Someone just wasn't thinking! The music software that comes with it is adequate, but watch the defaults if you like a specific way to load your music.    Small nits:  Playback.  I would like to be able to playback music by directory as well as "artist" or "genre". Yes, I know I could make playlists, but I'm lazy. RIO made some nice features including a clock and a stopwatch.  I wish they went the one extra step of adding an alarm to the clock (to wake me up) and a countdown timer to the stopwatch (for jogging).

<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon 5GB for over a year now. The feel of it is very sleek and comfortable. The user interface is excellent and easy to get used to. My son had a Dell Jukebox and now has an Ipod Nano, the Rio Carbon is much better than the Jukebox and just as good, if not better than the Ipod interface. The thumbwheel is effortless and is easily manageable with one hand. You can't do that with the iPod! The AC - USB power charger is great. I haven't seen other MP3 players with this type of capability. (I.e. the USB cable plugs into an AC to USB adapter.) Battery life has been very good. An excellent value!!

<Title>Rio- Good but cheap
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had a Rio Carbon for about 8 months. So far I've gone through two of them. I don't know whether I've gotten bad ones or what because the first one after about 2 months wouldn't do anything but display an "Upgrader" message and the second one's volume wheel became dislodged and doesn't work anymore. Now the company wants 100 bucks for another one. No one should have two go through two MP3 players or more.Thats why I think that it's JUNK.  I'm now thinking about getting an iPod because they don't have external parts besides the headphones. The overall design is good and the storage and software is satisfactory but I mean come on...  How many products are you supposed to get? Last time I checked it was 1.

<Title>The worse buying experience of my otherwise happy life
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> This is an ultra-inferior product. The little wheel on top of the player is as cheap as they make em'. Mine has broke 3 times now (in just 9 months) and this time RIO says they won't replace it - probably because they know it will just keep breaking and they will have to send me a new one every 3 months. The third time I tried not to even use the wheel as much and it still broke! Also, this player creates more jack noise than you can imagine. I lost an eardrum last month just trying to plug in my headphones to the player. 3rd - the system crashes quite a bit, and unless you carry around a tiny sewing needle, forget about resetting the thing.  Bottom line - don't waste your time or money on this hunk of junk. It will only lead to misery and despair.

<Title>Lovin' It
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon for about two years now, and though I had some initial issues, I was able to iron them out, and it works flawlessly now even though it has seen fairly heavy use.  I did have to put a piece of tape around the earphone connection, because the unit is made of metal and the earphones would crackle when the metal ring on the earphones made contact with the metal case.  The other problem was the player would go in about 50 songs, then shut off.  When I restarted it, it would be back at the first song.  In order to get past the 50th song, I had to run it to the 54th song, before it would play through the rest of the songs.  Fifty songs is a lot to thumb through one by one, so I realized it was an issue I would need to fix.  The neat thing about the Carbon, is it will pull up on your computer as another hard drive.  So I just right clicked on it and did a reformat.  That did the trick, when I loaded the songs back on, no more problems.  This feature also makes it so you don't have to use the Rio software to load the songs onto the player, you can just drag them over, though the software is very simple to use and probably loads the songs as fast as dragging them over.  The unit does have some improvements over the Rio Nitrus, for instance, instead of having a separate power cord, the Carbon charges with the same cord that hooks it to the computer.  Also the buttons used to scroll through the songs are sturdier than the one button on the Nitrus. Unfortunately, not all the changes were good.  Changing from a plastic case to the metal, caused the problem with the earphones that I mentioned above, and also, they took off the lock switch that was on the back of the Nitrus, which kept the settings from being changed while it was in my pocket.    The Carbon does have a case, unlike the Nitrus, but it's pretty worthless for anything except protecting the unit from getting scratched up, because it has nothing to hook it to your belt. However, the unit is small enough to fit easily into your pocket, so no big deal.  One of the most annoying things about the case is you have to pull the Carbon out of the case if you want to do anything more than turn it off or turn up the volume.  That's pretty lame, but nothing I can't live with.  I'm not sure exactly what the battery life is, but I know I've listened to it for eight hours straight and the battery life is down maybe half, so the 20 hour claim is probably not far off, which is pretty awesome.    By and all, though the unit could stand some improvements, it has served me well and if I ever have to buy another MP3 player, I'd definitely go with a Rio.

<Title>don't waste your money
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player less than a year ago and it is already broken.  I researched all MP3 players and this Rio Carbon received great reviews and seemed to have everything that I wanted.  It was great for about 8 months, although it would occasionally turn off randomly when listening to music. Then one day I turned it on and it had "UPGRADER" mode written on the screen.  I went to the Rio website and tried to install all versions of firmware which is suppose to rewrite the hard drive (and erase all music files on the player).  This did not work, and either did the countless phone call to Rio's support team.  All they could offer me was a refurbished player for $99. Do not waste your money on this MP3 player, I am not the only one with these problems either, there are lots of reviewers that have the same problem, and tapping it on the back doesn't do anything. If you do decide to get this MP3 player, I STRONGLY suggest getting the warranty.

<Content>... but at least the files inside the HD remain intact! Some times when you turn on you need to push the reset button,  so your configurations (volume, equalizer, etc) are lost. The files inside the internal disk aren't affected but this bug. Just because of that bug it will not receive 5 stars.  Even thought, it's much better than any iPOD. You can put any type of file inside. It recharges directly from the USB. AND IT'S CHEAPER than an iPOD!

<Title>An almost perfect little MP3 player
<Date>Sat Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is the first MP3 player I bought. I was first intrigued with the Apple iPod Mini that my nephew had, so i decided to look at other MP3 players.   The Carbon is almost perfect, and I feel a bit better than the Apple Mini iPod. It has 25% more capacity. I have placed over 800 songs on it and used only 60% of the hard drive. The unit is a bit smaller than the Apple unit but looks a lot cooler. The red backlit logo and rocker pad looks very svelte. The back chrome plate is prone to fingerprints and smudges. As previously mentioned, the only design flaw is that some headphone jacks causes static when it touches the stainless steel edges of the unit when plugged in. This is easily fixed by painting a layer of fingernail polish on the exposed headphone plug (but it should not be necessary). There is a lock function on the Carbon (it pays to read the manual) by holding the MENU button in and pressing the center button. The carrying case is very snug because of the odd shape of the Carbon and does not have a belt clip. The ear phones while sounding good, do not fit well in smaller ears (too large) so I had to buy a separate headset. I find the interface very easy to use with a tactile feel to the wheel. I find no problems using it. The battery charges either from the USB port of your PC or from an adapter that uses the same USB cable. The display is very legible for its small size and longer titles constantly scrolls laterally across the screen (cool!).  The Rio Music Manager is very easy to use. Unlike from what I read before, you CAN do mass corrections to the ID3 info tags. Select all the songs you wish to edit and open the properties and change the fields. The one thing I find to be an issue is that if you update any fields in the Rio Manager, it does not update the info on the Rio if the file is already in the Rio. The software just synchronizes songs that are not on the Rio, not if there are any changes to the ID3 fields.  The easiest way was to delete all the files from the Rio and resynching the unit. It is best to update the ID3 fields before synching the Rio.

<Title>Number 1 mini HDD MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>You've probably been hearing all about ipods (unless you've been locked in a cupboard for 3 years) and how they are the best and only MP3 player out there. Well, they're not (either) with the Rio carbon being THE player to get.  Compared to the ipod mini, for $50 less, you get 1gig more space, a plug and play interface (just plug it into any computer with win 2000+ and transfer files in explorer), a 20 hour battery (2.5x apples at least), better sound quality (I think anyway) and the list goes on. Better compatibility with audio formats (MP3, WMA, WAV), can use loads of music stores, not just crummy iTunes, a better navigation system (the non tactile everything is annoying). The wheel on the carbon is great, as you can just change volume like that. It's also more stylish I think, and will show that you're not a clone who has to get an ipod.  Other players are good, but just don't compare, with the Creative muvo2 having an awful navigation system, and the zen micro again going the all non tactile route (even for volume). Some players may be decent, but are double the size of the carbon (another one of its huge advantages). If more space is essential to you though, I suggest the rio karma, which is amazing value, playback, sound and navigation.  The one minor issue is the static issue many people mention, but I think it has been resolved now anyway, but a bit of nail varnish on the jack isn't that hard, but most earphones come with the plastic part as far as I've seen. The case is also not the best I've seen, but vaja make a superb custom designed case for $40 or so, which you can get for saving all that money from not buying an ipod!

<Title>Rio Carbon and Rio Karma
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had a Rio Karma for a year and a half.  My wife has a Rio Carbon.  I am writing in response to several bad review.  Sound quality: the Rios do a bad job on bad MP3/WMAs.  That's right, the problem is their files, not the player.  I have 2800 files on my Karma and the only ones that sound wrong are the ones I got years ago off the net.  Yeah, I can tell the difference on my $10k theater system.  Then again if you want hi-fidelity, wouldn't be playing through a lossy format like MP3s or WMAs.  There is the lack of lower frequencies, but through portable headphones the lack is barely noticable.  Quality:  I have dropped my Karma (20 gb hd) while it was on well over 20 times.  I have yet to have a failure.  Firmware updates worked fine and added lots of features (not just bug fixes) along the way.  Syncing has never been a problem.  I have been syncing using both Windows Media 10 and Rio's software with three computers since I bought it.  The ability to sync with more than one computer was the reason I went Rio over Ipod in the first place.

<Title>Carbon vs ipod mini
<Date>Sat Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most I probably spent over a week visting every web site that had reviews of mp3 players and read every review on amazon for all of the various players. All signs pointed to the Carbon as the right player.  My one concern was the ever mentioned design flaw with the metal casing and how with some headphones static whould be induduced due to direct contact with the metal.  A trip to the local store change my views. I found that all of the players that I saw looked and felt VERY cheap. I was actually disappointed with the Carbon as well.  What did catch my eye however was the Apple ipod Mini.  The feel and look of these players can not be ignored. I feels sturdy and yet not heavy. I thought there is no way I'm going to by an apple product when all I have are Windows machines. However the more I read on line the more I decided to strongly consider this unit. I was worried about the player not supporting wma files. However I downloaded the itunes software and was pleased to find that when you import a wma file it will convert it. The software lets you convert it to several formats (ACC, mp3). The default is ACC but I decided to go with mp3 even though they are larger then ACC mainly because I wanted to be compatible with playing files on other windows machines that didn't have the itunes software installed. I ended up going with the ipod mini and thus far feel it was the right choice. Great sound and a user interface second to none. I encourage anyone thinking of spending money in this range to go see the players in person and see if you like the feel of the players in your hand. You will see that the majority of these players look and FEEL very cheap even though they are highly priced. I was also wanted a way to clip the player to my pants, something that is not provided by the Carbon. In summary don't hesitate to consider the ipod mini even if you are a windows die hard.

I wasn't familiar with them so i am not sure how they should sound, but what I heard was unclear static music.  I looked up the songs online, and they did sound more enjoyable online, so i think maybe it is the machine itself.  Did this happen with anyone else? Were the songs supposed to sound like that or was it the machine?

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is a superior alternative to an iPod mini.  I checked around, read lots of reviews and wavered slightly before going with the Rio Carbon.  I have never looked back.  The playback and storage space is phenomenal.  I listen to audio books constantly and this little player holds a WHOLE lot of books.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think that the Rio music manager software sucks.  I have not been able to get it to work at all.  It gets hung every time trying to scan for files on my computer.  If I stop the scan it works okay to transfer files but not good enough for my satisfaction.  I have problems with static in the headphones but am hoping that the nail polish trick works.  Battery life is incredible and recharging is quick.  With the firmware upgrade, the player can be charged through the computer via USB which is really really nice.  Highly recommend this product!

<Title>Better than iPod Mini
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own both the Rio Carbon and the iPod Mini.  Personally, I prefer the Carbon.  I'm sure many of you out there are deciding between the Rio Carbon, the iPod Mini, and the Zen Micro.  As far as I'm concerned, the offerings from Dell and Gateway aren't nearly as competitive.  Here is why I bought the Rio Carbon (for myself).  I got an engraved iPod Mini for my girlfriend because it was shiny and pink.  Pros 1.  20 hours of battery life (Manufacturer estimate) - way longer than Mini or Micro (Micro has removable batteries though, but you'll need 2 of those batteries to equal Carbon battery life) 2.  5gigs of memory - 1gig more than Mini, does not need partitioning for file storage like Micro 3.  Drag and Drop interface - easy to load and unload than Mini or Micro 4.  Does not need Drivers - transfer files to or from any computer 5.  Smaller/Lighter than Mini and Micro 6.  Nicer looking (unless you like the different colors) 7.  Microphone for recording!  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it plus radio! 8.  Plays WMA files.  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it! 9.  Cheaper than Mini and Micro (street price)  Cons 1.  No radio 2.  Laggy interface 3.  Just one color 4.  No engravings 5.  Static when using metal plugged headphones (can be fixed)  Battery life: I haven't gotten around to timing the battery life, cuz I never need it for 20 hour straight, but it definitely lasts me through the longest days.  (about 14 hours or so)  All the battery life you'll really need if you recharge while you sleep.  The battery can be charged by USB, which is very convenient if you need that extra juice.  The usb cable also plugs into the charger (like the firewire cables for ipods), so you only need one cable when you need to travel around.  File transfer and storage: The claims about it being drag and drop are true.  It is so easy to put music in and take music out!  However, you'll probably want to use the software included on the CD (or from the website) to sort and organize the music and for mass editing of ID3 info.  The drag and drop feature allows you to use the whole hard drive as a portable storage device.  That's up to 5 gigs that can be used to store personal files!  (Way better than the Zen Micro's half-baked max 2 gig partitioning system).  File transfer speed seems standard fare for a USB device w/ a MiniHD.  Look and Feel: The overall quality of the Carbon does not quite match up to the Mini, considering the Mini uses a fully aluminum shell.  Keep in mind, the Carbon is by no means a cheap feeling device.  The back of the case is a shiny chromed metal (shiny, but scratches and smudges easily like iPods).  The sides of the case is rubberized, which is very effective in keeping the device safe in your hands.      The front shell is a glossy plastic.  The top and the buttons are also chromed, but I think those parts are plastic instead of real metal (I could be wrong).  Overall the player looks very sophisticated.  I was amazed by how thin it is, about the same as the Mini, if not thinner.  It's lighter, shorter and rounder, and fits in my hands better than the Mini.  I have less fear of dropping the thing when I'm holding it!  My friends are amazed at the size and weight.  The display is sharp and bright when backlit.  The red lights are cool too!  The fake leather case that comes w/ the player is poorly designed though, it could use a hole on the side for access to the buttons and display.  I took a razor and cut those holes myself!  Sound Quality: The head phones that come with the Carbon is pretty bassy.  I've found I need to pump up the mid range to compensate, but overall, sound quality is crisp and clear.  Please note that I am not an audiophile off any sort and not very good at judging this.  The reports that using headphones w/ metal plugs causing static must be true because Rio has thoughtfully included plastic extension wires for headphones to keep metal parts from contacting the metal in the shell.  The voice recorder is decent.  I've used it for class and it was able to record the lecture pretty clearly, although I had to set it close to the teacher's podium to do so.    Voice files are recorded in .wav files, pretty large...so keep that in mind when recording for long periods of time.  The high pitched whining the internal hard drive can be heard on the recordings, which is a nuisance.  User Interface: Rio must have decided to use a cheap processor in order to extend the battery life.  There are many times during its use when the user interface lags behind my inputs.  Keep in mind that the music has not yet skipped on me.  But there were several times when I would try to jog the volume or switch between songs and the display would fail to keep up w/ my inputs.  I was spoiled by the iPod's relative quick response.  However, this only happens when a new song is being played, which is understandable because the player has to search for the song and then read it into memory.  However, the lag is a tad frustrating, especially when you're trying to change settings for a new song.  As far as I have used them, it never occurred in iPods I've used.  The button layout and functions are very intuitive and easy to use.  The jog wheel is just as functional as the overhyped touch wheel on the iPods.  I've found touch sensitivity can be difficult for people without a delicate touch.  Overall a great buy.  Better than iPod Mini in my opinion.  I haven't tried the Zen Micro so I wouldn't make that comparison safely.  The Dell and Gateway players don't appeal to me.  So the Rio Carbon just might be the best miniHD mp3 player on the market right now!  P.S. about clipping electronics on your belt... Don't do it...It looks real dorky~

<Title>Excellent product for my needs
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After doing a lot of research on MP3 players I decided to go with the Rio Carbon.  I've waited a month before writing this review, and so far I have not had any problems with it.  Here's what I like about the Rio Carbon:  It's small.  It literally fits in the palm of your hand and it's half the depth of a cellphone, so it can easily share a pocket with something else.  It's lighter than a cellphone too, you wouldn't even know it was there if it weren't for the tunes.  Being one of the smallest harddrive devices, it's still 5GB, more than the iPod Mini.  Using and carrying the device is simple.  The scroll wheel is conveniently located for your thumb to use and it's easier to use than the iPod's wheel, which can be very touchy.  Playback features include an equalizer, repeat, shuffle, playlists, and lock-mode.  It also looks damn good.  Here's what I don't like: As far as I can see, there is no way to build a playlist from inside the player, they must be transferred from your computer.  When hooking up a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones, the Rio shutdown.  Why?  The plug has metal around it which made contact with the Rio, which I assume caused it to short-circuit.  Luckily it was fine and I tried again, getting it in without the metal making contact.  The sound quality was noticeably flatter than what comes out of the computer, which would have been a huge disappoint if I purchased the Rio Karma for home use (20GB is nowhere near enough for a FLAC player) - but I opted for a travel companion instead, and thus perfect sound quality is not necessary.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, I can hear the bass.  It's just not as good as an Audigy2 soundcard.  I would never disrespect someone else's opinion, however another recent review included some plain false information.  The Rio Carbon includes a protective carrying case, a USB cable, free songs, and a free 2-month trial subscription to the Audible network, which carries eBooks.  Overall, the price, size, weight, storage, and ease of use of the Rio Carbon make it a winner.  If you want to check it out, I've seen it in a few large retail stores, but wary the price, it's cheaper online.  Hope this helps.

<Title>Almost 5 stars but falls a little short in quality
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off - this is a great MP3 player from the company that could be responsible for the affordable portable mp3 player market. The Carbon stores a lot of music and data and sounds great. A _huge_ bonus to this mp3 player is that it is a 5GB harddrive. You can literally take this mp3 player and plug it into the usb port of any computer and all of a sudden you have a portable 5GB diskdrive at your disposal to transport data. Yes, that's right, you can listen to all your music as well as store data on it (I do it all the time.)   An even better thing about this mp3 player is the drag and drop feature. You don't need any music software like iTunes, Rio Music Manager, etc to put music on this great player. All you need to do (if you don't like messing with music software) is plug your Carbon into the USB port and start dragging music onto the player as if you were moving files from one disk to another - it's that simple. Once you're done and unplug the Carbon from the computer it will turn itself on and recompile a file list and create a new playlist of music (this takes about 4-5 minutes.) Isn't that awesome?? This is how EVERY player should work - INCLUDING IPOD. A HUGE plus to Rio for the aforementioned feature.   Now, before we get all giddy about this mp3 player there are a few issues with the unit.   If your Carbon has a serial number that shows it was made before (I think) December of 2004 you will need to call Rio and get a little plastic spacer ring or a headphone adapter. Why do you need to get that? On the Carbons made before a certain date there is an issue with the headphone jack. The headphone jack is plated/metal and you get a crackling/shorted sound with traditional headphones. Most headphones have a metal ring around the male prong of the plug. When this metal ring touches the metal ring of the affected Carbons you get a short of the electrical signal that is supplying sound to the headphones. As a result you get a nice crackle in the sound. Carbons fix is to send out a little plastic spacer or an inline headhone cable jack. Both of these have a PLASTIC ring that eleminates that sound. Both solutions work great and it's just a matter of preference on which solution you want to use. It's just a shame that Rio had this problem in the first place. Now - keep in mind - you are ONLY going to have this issue if the unit is part of the original batch of Carbons that had this design issue. The MAJORITY of Carbons do NOT have this issue and the Carbon Pearl does not have this problem at all. Actually, as I'm writing this review I do _THINK_ that Rio is shipping the players WITH the adapters included so you don't have to mess with calling them.   Now, another problem that you will immediately see is the carrying case that comes with the unit. The carrying case that comes with the unit is a simple holster with no belt clip and NO OPENING FOR THE SCREEN OR BUTTONS. What on EARTH was Rio thinking??? The carrying case is completely USELESS. You can't clip it to your belt and you can't control the player without taking it OUT of the case. Now, in Rio's defense they do sell a PROPER case with a belt clip and holes for the controls and screen for like $19 online.   Another issue I have found that pops up from time to time but not often enough to be annoying is player lockup. Every now and then the player will decide it's had enough of my heavy metal music and lock up. All you need to do to make it behave like it's supposed to is poke a little paper clip into the reset hole on the top of the unit. I've had to do this maybe 3 times in the year that I've had it. This is something happens to any mp3 player so this is nothing to panic about.   One other thing that is a plus for Rio is their firmware support. Rio has always been really good for keeping the mp3 player firmware fresh. There have been 3 or 4 firmware updates for the Carbon. These updates range from bug fixes to feature additions. I _highly_ recommend that when you buy this mp3 player that you go to the Rio ([...] believe) and upgrade to the latest firmware.   I have had my player for over a year and aside from the items listed above I have enjoyed this player and I am also thoroughly satisfied with the player. I happen to have one of the earlier refurbished models with the metal ring around the headphone jack. As a result, I had to get the little plastic ring but it works fine. I use this mp3 player as a portable diskdrive as well as a great mp3 player. I work out a lot and I take this into the gym and it works great.   So, overall - if you're looking for a VERY affordable 5GB+ mp3 player that also doubles as a portable harddrive this is what you want.   If you are someone that is looking for a good gadget-type gift for a geek in your family or a family member that loves gadgets then they will love this.   I couldn't give this 5 stars because of the design flaws that I mentioned before.

Though I was just a minute away from clicking BUY on CompUSA.com when I remembered this player.  It has more storage space (at 5GB -> iPod's 2GB), longer battery life (20h -> iPod's 8h). Though it may not be color and have all those features it is still a better buy. However, Rio went under so if you can find this player get it. I got mine for under 200$.  The software installed fine, but requires that Windows Media Player 9 be installed as well, which is silly. It's because WMA files that are protected with DRM use MP9. I have two PC (XP & Win98 SE). I have had no issues with the USB plug-n-play under XP, however the player will not install fully under Win98 SE unless you have a USB 2.0 port, which mine does not. It will go through the motions, but when you try & access the drive it won't show up in the drives list even though the Device manger says it there.  Battery meter is not accurate. The firmware seems not to accurately report actual battery life. I have used this in a cross country trip (LA to Arkansas) and was able to listen to 12 hours of music, and the battery didn't die. I charged it full on a Monday and it died (shutoff) by Saturday after midnight. I had 23hrs of music in 388 files (96kbs to 320kbs). It shut off on song 311. So the battery IS just over 20h.  All in all a very great buy over the iPod fad. If you can find it, get it. Plus, you can put regular files on it and playlists.  NOTE: Someone said you can't generate playlist. You generate a playlist using Rio DJ Music Maganer, by using the Playlist function. Or with your MP3 program; then put the playlist on the Rio. The playlist will be listed under Play Music/Playlists.  ADDENDUMS: It will seem to drain away while off. I started the stopwatch, turned Rio off, then 8 hours later turned it on - the stopwatch was still running. I wanted to know just how long the battery lasted. The specifications says 20 hours. But, I used the stopwatch function and (pausing it when it turned it off and continued when i turned it back on) found out that tha battery ran out after 10 hours 10 minutes. I'll try again to see if I can get it to last for 20 hours like it supposed to.  I upgraded the firmware from 1.42 to 1.95 and the Rio Music Manager software from 2.90 to 2.96. Upgrading the firmware reformats the Rio, so backup your music first.  I have seen a implementaion difference in how the drive is formated (Data and Media folders are separate) and it now supports the PlayForSure music service from Microsoft -- not that I'll ever use it, I'm partial to Real Rhapsody. Also you can now play music from seprate folders.  As for whether the battery will now display accurately, we'll see how it handles.  Once at work it wouldn't come on, so I thought I'de broken it some how (the power button looked like it was going to slide out); I was even thinking about buying a new player (the 6 GB model even); but then 'my voice inside' said to just take it home and recharge it. Turns out it _was_ just out of battery juice. HAH! I'm so paranoid!  I love my Rio Carby!

<Content>I purchased a Rio mp3 player and it broke within a month.  Fortunately, I was still under warranty.  After many "outsourced" telephone conversations, they finally sent me a replacement.  This model was "refurbished".  I had purchased a new one and they replaced it with a refurbished one!  That just doesn't seem right...   After six months it stopped working all together.     Please take heed to the poor reviews on this product... You'll be glad you did.

<Title>Good, not great
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this player for about 9 months.   The sound quality is very good, and the player definitely looks nice (subjective of course). The form factor is excellent, the player is light and the display is clear. The battery life is excellent, and using USB for charging is handy.  I do have one major gripe though. The response time of the player can be SLOW. I'm not sure how the firmware was written but it must be caching something or other. Every now and then it stops after I hit a control and it literally freezes for a few seconds. The worst case is actually when turning on the player. Mine takes around 30 full seconds to bootup. I know defragging the player's HDD reduces this but when you change your music you have to defrag again. I've read forums online and it seems most people's Carbons start up within 10 seconds... not sure why mine performs so poorly.  Some other gripes: Songs are only listed according to their ID3 tags (not folders) and the software has crashed on my PC to the point where I no longer use it.  Also, the part of my power adapter for the USB charging that plugs into the socket did not work when I received it! Fortunately I had an alternative way to plug it in.  However, since this is the first really portable mp3 player I've owned, I'm still very happy to have 5Gb of music with me anytime. I've used it a LOT.

<Title>everything but the voice recorder...
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my rio. It's tough, sleek, pocket sized and easy to use. I recomend it to anyone looking to use it as just an mp3 player. If you were however considering using the mic for anything other than personal voice notes keep looking. I purchased my rio with the hope to record and play back lectures. Unfortunatly the mic is not anywhere near sensitive enough to be useful, so i'm passing my little rio on for something new.   Creative Labs new Zen Vision :M is boasting a lecture quality mic as well as fm, 30gigs, movie quality olcd and an MS office linking organiser. Alot of reviewers are calling this thing the ipot killer and they might be right. I am so in love with these funky swiss army knife style gagets! If they can slap a phone on that thing, and get some internet access they might have a chance of taking down the crackberry too.

<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned four (yes four) Rio Carbons. I have purchased two and both of them failed within 6 months. The front panel controls are easy to use and in general it is a nice player. This is an excellent sounding player, unfortunately it has the following defects- 1. it is subject to failure from shock and a portable player WILL be dropped at sometime or another. 2. It has a combination volume control and selection wheel which is both over sensitive and too fragile if used during exercise or physical activity. 3. It is SLICK and (see above) has no attachment point for a lanyard or other device to prevent dropping it.   I had to upgrade the firmware upon receipt of all four players and cannot figure out why Rio couldn't get that done at the factory especially since two of these were refurbished warranty replacement units that came out LONG after the firmware upgrade.   Rios customer service is very good and I wish the player had been nearly that good

<Content>I have had my Carbon for almost a year now. I don't know what's up with those shock issues, because god knows I drop this thing enough and accidentally abuse it. The only thing that I can find wrong is that no one makes protective cases or skins for them. Sure they give you the leather case when you buy it, but you can't easily acess the controls. I personally have made my own plastic cover for it. The only reason I feel this is a big deal is because like iPods, the nice shiny backing gets scratched waaay to easy. I really recommend getting one of these, here's hoping you get as good a version as I have.

<Title>good product while it lasts
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ive had my rio carbon player for about 1 1/2 years and it has worked flawlessly until recently. for the first year i encountered absolutely no problems with the carbon and found that i liked it much more than an ipod, due to its size/shape and how easy it was to use, the only complaints that i had in the first year were fairly nitpicky in that the headphones stopped working after about 6 months (which isnt a big deal since headphones are easily replaceable) i also found it a pain to scroll through all of the artists to find a specific song that i want to listen to because this takes a long time (which is one feature in which the ipod is superior). the player is fairly easy to use and the software for the computer is also user friendly with easy playlist options and it is also simple to modify the title for the songs. it doesnt take very long to upload the music to the player and the player instantly recognizes what songs you already have on it so it wont waste space by duplicating the song on the player. i found the carrying case useless since you cannot access the front buttons while it is in its case and it is an extremely tight fit, making it difficult to insert and remove the player from its case, so i rarely use it. when i first purchased this mp3 player the stupid best buy employee told me that it could hold 5000 songs which is what made me choose this product over others, however i was extremely disappointed to find that it can only hold between 600-700 songs, and while that still is a great deal of songs this did not meet my expectations and it came nowhere near the amount of songs i wanted to put on it, making it sort of a pain to change my songs and go through all of them to pick and choose which songs i wanted to listen to rather than just having all of my songs at my fingertips. recently i have been having problems with my carbon player and have been pleased when i call the customer service center, they have been able to help me a great deal each time i call in getting my carbon to function again (i have called a total of 4 times in the past 6 months) however today i called them since my carbon player said it had no songs on it but when i plugged it into my computer it said that the player was full and they tried to help me as best they could but ultimately they told me in the sweetest way they could that there was an internal issue within my player and that i need to get a new mp3 player, which is disappointing since it seems like an mp3 player should last longer than 1 1/2 years. what surprised me most of all was that the rio employee suggested that i research the mp3 player much more before purchasing it (which i most certainly will do) and that i should really look at other types of mp3 players, basically telling me that i should not get another rio carbon 5 gb player. i will certainly follow this employees advice and do not plan on purchasing another rio product in the future, if you are considering purchasing this mp3 player i recommend that you do so only if you dont mind getting a new one in a year or two... but hey, you can do what you want, this is only my experience with one carbon, if you decide to get one hopefully you will have better luck than i did

<Title>Awesome Durable Product
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this MP3 Player as a gift for Christmas last year.  I love it! I have not had a single problem with it. I'm in the Navy. I just got back from a 6 month deployment where I used it heavily. It's so small that it takes up no room at all in my rack. I could carry it around in my uniform pocket. It's gotten dropped a million times and still works. It's had some books and stuff dropped on it. I've used it almost every day in the gym for a couple of hours a day and it's worked great. The only gripes I have are the speakers that came with it aren't as durable as the player. Those broke after about 2 months. The product support for this, cases and accessories sucks. I finally found a case by case logic that sort of fits it and straps to my arm. And the buttons are sometimes easy to hit and change the song or pause it. Other than that I love it. I would definitely recommend it and am going to buy one for my wife.

This tiny dynamo has it all in a device that fits in the palm of your hand.  The sound is great.  I loaded all of my favorite songs from my music collection and still have 2 meg of space left.  The only negative is the carring case.  You have to remove the player from the case to use it.  Highly recommended.

<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, you should probably ask yourself a question: Am I the type of person that forks over 200+ bucks for something that might not last me a week?   The first Rio Carbon I bought lasted me four days. I got it replaced with another one and it lasted me less than 5 hours. Rio has done an awful job engineering this product.   And my friends haven't had much luck w/ IPods (they die out after several months). This, of course, concerns me since companies are distrubting faulty products. If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, please wait for the products to be improved. I sure learned my mistake about it.

<Title>Best of Class - Great Size to Capacity Ratio
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been a big fan of the Rio hard drive MP3 players having owned a 1.5GB Nitrus for over a year and have played with the quite similar 20GB Karma for a while.  I loved my Nitrus, but my biggest complaint was that I wished there were just a bit more room.  The second I saw the 5GB Carbon, which is roughly the same size as the Nitrus, I knew I had to have it.  When my Nitrus broke, it turned into an opportunity to get a Carbon.   On a side note, hard drive mp3 players apparently do not survive 20 foot drops very well.  But I digress.  Pluses:  1)  The size!!!  Like the Nitrus, this is still the largest benefit.  It is smaller and lighter than the 4GB Mini-Ipod and about the same size as the Nitrus.  I can carry it in any pocket with no problems.  Not only is it small, but it is very lightweight.  I don't even notice it being in my pocket. 2)  The capacity!!  The Nitrus held 1.5GB, which was pretty decent.  The larger I-Pod Mini holds 4GB, which is obviously better.  But this puppy holds 5GB.  Right now is has four different music playlists and four books and I've barely put a dent into the amount of space it holds.  All this in a little-itty bitty package.  Brilliant! 3)  Volume control.  The Nitrus had two flimsy-feeling buttons.  Now you use the scrolling wheel.  This is so much easier, especially while wearing gloves or fidgeting through a case. 4)  The battery.  My old Nitrus ran forever, and now the Carbon runs even longer.  I rarely run out of battery on my Nitrus (I just had to charge it once every few days) and I've yet to run out on the Carbon.  I do hit the road often and it is nice to not have to tote a power cord everywhere I go for it.  Mixed Reviews:  1)  Voice recorder.  This would be great if there were a quick and easy way to make recordings.  Instead, you need to go through the menuing system and even then it takes a bit for it to start recording.  If you wish to make a quick note, it'd be faster to grab a sticky pad.  And the results aren't that fantastic.  It is really hard to figure out the perfect distance to get a good recording as it offers no feedback on audio recording levels (it's always too much or too little, never just right). 2)  USB.  You now use the USB to charge the Carbon and to upload/modify music selections.  However, the USB must carry a certain amount of power.  This renders my laptop unable to transfer the files or even synchronize.  But, when the Carbon is attached to my computer and is idle, my computer will actually charge the battery.  An annoying drawback is that when you plug in the power, the Carbon doesn't know if it is power or a computer hookup so it will power on.  Many a times I've hooked it up to power it and then come over to find it running.  Instead, you need to hang around awhile and make sure to turn it off afterwards. 3)  The case.  I almost put this in the negative column but since the Nitrus didn't even include a case, I decided to move it into mixed.  This is not really much of a case, though, but more of a protective covering.  You can't attach it to anything like a belt clip, so be prepared to buy a new case for this.  Believe me, you'll want it (please see earlier reference to 20 foot drop).  But I use the included case with my newly purchased case.  If you look at their online manual, the case actually looks nice.  Too bad the one depicted there wasn't shipped with the Carbon.  Negatives:  1)  Support.  Their web site is lousy while trying to get answers.  Software updates are a breeze, I'll give them that, but I can't figure out anything else.  It is nearly impossible to get a live body to lend a hand in times of need.  And as somebody else pointed out, this only comes with a 90 day warranty... though my Nitrus lasted over a year with no problems, except the lack of a parachute. 2)  Playlists:  You can only make them at the computer and they can often be difficult to make correctly (I often listen to audio books so they MUST be in a certain order).  I hate being on the road when I realize that the books got jumbled up.  This is also a big complaint of my mother's, who also owns a Rio. 3)  The cover:  The stainless steel looks awesome, but with certain headphones I get a lot of static.  Including their own earbuds!!!  Talk about a major oversight.  How annoying.  In the end, I would highly recommend this over any other player if you are looking for something in the 5GB size.  If you actually need 20GB, look at the Rio Karma.  That is a fine piece of machinery as well.  If you are insane and need more than that (why are you reading this review then????) then look at the I-Pods which sport hard drives as large as 80GB.

<Title>Use safety pin to insert in "Emergency Reset" hole!
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am enjoying my new Rio Carbon 5GB MP3 Player which I received for Christmas.    However, after a day of playing, it froze and needed &#34;rebooting&#34;, like any computer sometimes requires.  One reboots by inserting a nonsupplied pin (I used a small safety pin) in the &#34;Emergency Reset&#34; hole on the upper right of the top next to the player's volume control.  This fixed the problem immediately.   This one freeze-up which my Rio player experienced was probably the fault of the dubiously edited spoken word file I had been playing when it crashed (the file had long duplicate segments of audio spliced together on the end).  I have not replayed the file for a test of my theory, but I have used the player extensively since then with no untoward consequences.  I like the Rio Carbon's organically futurist design and easy operation.  I think it out-sleeks the iPod Mini in style.    The only odd thing is a noticable delay in response to control clicks when in the &#34;Recorder&#34; mode.  Click the upward &#34;&#62;||&#34; option and there's about a second delay before the solid circle in the diamond appears and thereby indicates it's recording speech -- and clicking the same option to pause recording likewise has the same delay.  However, the recordings are clear even without holding the small microphone close up.  With my Rio Carbon, I now enjoy spoken word and music audios from several sources by playing them amost anyplace anytime.  I've downloaded two 'podcasts', the lastest Internet trend which is based on the Apple iPod Mini and similar MP3 players such as the Rio Carbon.  'Podcasting' began a few months ago with advent of the iPodder program for Apple and Windows. (Technically speaking, iPodder is an aggregator for RSS newsfeeds containing MP3 enclosures.)  For the future, I expect podcasting to keep my Rio Carbon loaded with a stream of new content.  ITcoversations.com is a great source of IT industry conference talks, all for free, all announced via podcasting.  And, at 30 MB an hour, the 5 GB hard drive of the Rio Carbon is a good portable listening device for these informative geek talks about how the world's going to change as a result of what's happening in techiedom.  Another spoken word audio source for one's Rio Carbon player is Audible.com, from which I've purchased a couple of audio books (&#34;Masters of Atlantis&#34; & &#34;The Dream of Reason&#34;).  The Rio Carbon comes with info on an offer of a free month's trial membership.  This offer isn't advertised, but there was a coupon inside my Rio Carbon plastic encasement with the URL for the offer.  A free month gives an immediate free audio book (unabridged) and a free month's access to subscription audio (such as downloads of the weekday Charlie Rose Show interviews).  Best of all, it gives access to purchasing as many audio books during the month as you like at the heavily discounted price of $10 each.  Check out this option when buying.    The Rio Carbon 5 GB MP3 Player can utilize the special Audible.com format for spoken word audio.  Somehow this audio format not only compresses 8 hours into around 60 MB of file space, but also seems to speed up the reader's speech without distortion, thereby allowing only a little over two minutes per typical page.  Or maybe these professional readers are just very fast talkers. Yet it takes me about 3.5-4 minutes to read a page aloud, at my quickest.  Additionally, in regard to 'mobilizing' my music collection, I have been able to indulge my taste for the exotica of avante-garde classical music by &#34;ripping&#34; a few of my old audio CDs into MP3 VBR format.  For example, on my Rio Carbon, the noisy Edgard Varese is now only a few clicks away at anytime so I can give my nerves a jangle whenever needed on late weekend evenings, as a sort of aural equivalent of caffine.  ;-)  For background music in idle moments, or for &#34;spacing out&#34; in meditation, the Rio Carbon does an excellent job of reproducing the solo piano music of Dr. Will M. Tuttle's &#34;The Call&#34; album (I chose the 'Best' MP3 VBR format under the Rio Manager program and ripped the entire CD).  The Rio Carbon 5GB MP3 Player greatly enhances the value of one's music collection, by making it transportable and selectively accessible via customized 'playlists'.  I compared the popular Apple iPod Mini (4GB) and chose the Rio Carbon (5 GB) instead, and I have yet find a significant downside to my choice.    For scholars, students,  and other note takers, it is important to point out that the Rio Carbon comes with a built-in voice recorder feature.  If I recall correctly, the Apple iPod Mini has no built-in voice recorder.  All other things equal, and ignoring the 25% greater storage capacity of the Rio Carbon, the voice recording feature leads to the Rio Carbo ranking better than the iPod Mini.  Note: A recent review of the Rio Carbon and other MP3 players in the New York Times' Technology section states that there is a known problem in use of non-Rio headphones on the Rio Carbon -- they cause a 'static' noise.  But I've personally found the small earphones supplied with the Rio Carbon adequate because I mainly listen to spoken word recordings and have found a way to wear them comfortably.  My recommendation is to buy.  I did.  Yet keep in mind that this is a device designed to work in conjuction with one's computer (there's no other way of loading it with music & talk audio content).  Hence, it's not for technophobes.

<Content>After Months of waiting Rio finally released the Rio Carbon LE. I quickly snatched it up from Rio's wed site with a special deal. I loved this player for about 2 months when it stopped working!!! Rio's Customer Service is the worst I've ever had to deal with. When i finally got a hold of someone she told me that there was an error with the design of the LE and to send it back. I did so and still havent recieved a new one. They sent me an email saying it was shipped then the next day sent me another one saying that there on backorder. I told them to give me a refund, still havent gotten it. This all started about 4 months ago and I'm still without an MP3 player. I still want a Carbon but I'm nervous about buying one of the Carbons from Best Buy or Circut city to get the same problem. The Rio Carbon is the best player for its size(5gb players) but they really need to work on their service and support.

At first it was great. A few navigation gripes here and there but other than that it was perfect. Then I get a black screen and irresponsive buttons 3 days later. I reset the carbon. It works for 4 more days then it dies. Perhaps a change in the manufacturing might help fix this. As for me, I'm returning it for an ipod mini. From what I've heard it's MUCH more reliable.

<Title>Good features, no DRM crap, fragile scrollwheel
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had one of these for 3 months. Just broke the wheel, now it's useless, aside from being a slick-looking 5GB USB hard drive. Pros: Super-easy music transfer on Windows, just use Windows Explorer file drag and drop, or Media Player (yes, I know a lot of you think it's garbage, but I like it). No Apple or Sony-esque stealth DRM nonsense. Battery life and feature set as-advertised, no complaints. Cons: Scrollwheel fundamentally flawed. Rolling the wheel traverses very few selections, meaning endless scrolling across long lists. Worse, for me, like some other reviewers, I broke the fragile scrollwheel. Unlike others, mine is completely lost, so I can't even try to disasemble the unit and glue it back on. Also, the reviews are right, most quality headphones have metal jacks and will short out (how did they miss *this* in testing?!). Other than that, I loved it, but won't replace it because of the fragile wheel and the fact that the manufacturer is getting out of this business. If you'll treat it gingerly and you're willing to use the included plastic-plug headphones, it's a great value. If not, and you're DRM-averse, go with iRiver.

<Title>Solution?? Please read if you have UPGRADER MODE PROBLEM
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like my Rio Carbon a lot, regardless of the Upgrader problem which I was able to fix. After about 3-4 months, my Rio Carbon got stuck in the UPGRADER mode. After trying all the manuals suggestion w/ no luck, I read somewhere that somebody just gave it a tap in the back and that made it work (place the Rio face down in your right hand and give it a little tap or 2 in the back  with your left hand.) I tried doing it and gave it 3 taps in the back (I felt like I was burping a Baby) I connected it to the computer, the MP3 hard drive made a noise and the upgrader mode went away. All my music was still there and it is working  fine after a week.  Before getting the upgrader mode, I was downloading music from the Windows media player,I was not using the Rio program which probably cause the upgrader mode problem. Also, it looks like downloading upgrades cause problems on some Rios (must of the people w/ the Upgrader mode problem say that it happens after they do a software upgrade. So used the original software CD to reinstall the program or download that version. I do not guaranty that this method of fixing it will work for anybody, I also don't know how long it will work. I am not responsible for any damages to your MP3 if you decide to try it. I am just stating that my Rio worked after doing it. I figured, after trying everything else to get rid of the problem and since it wasn't working anyway,  might as well try it. It worked for me, so good luck.

<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Purchased Rio Carbon last January. After numerous calls to Rio due to faulty software, firmware, etc., I then had to have unit replaced three times! The scroll wheel broke twice! Rio has gone out of business, having sold out to another company.The price has dropped 30% for a reason.  Stay away!

<Title>Very good player, but alas Rio is no more
<Date>Mon Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The best features of this player are, in my opinion, the self-indexing ability (drag & drop music without software), the great battery life, the small size and good looks, and the high sound quality.  Also, some will find the Janus-DRM compatibility (for Napster & other subscription services) very handy.  I wish it had the ability to create playlists on the fly, and that the scroll wheel wasn't so crucial (if it breaks you cannot adjust the volume).  The first Carbon I had died (the hard drive stopped working and the player would error out to upgrader mode), but luckily the replacement plan I purchased came in handy.  Bottom line:  A great player for its time, but now with Rio out of business, there are probably better-supported alternatives.

<Title>$99 to repair after initial warrenty.
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Im yet another sufferer of the volume control wheel poping off. And since it did such with the volume low ....which in my opinion this player could use to be abit louder...this player is now completely useless as anything but a small audio storage device.  Another complaint I have is with the audio jack...using headphones that dont ahve a plastic stoper when connected to the device causes a great deal of static with movement.  And since Rio is going out of buisness...the product is no longer worth anyones time or money.  Never had any other issues with it....it was decent before this incident.

<Title>Stay away from Rio Carbons -- They're Highly Problematic.
<Date>Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am extremely disappointed with the Rio Carbon-- I would not recommend it.  In the first month, I had many problems with the player not starting, the player completely freezing, and the player constantly shutting down in the middle of play.  The final straw was when the jogger dial caved in.  The player had not been dropped or jolted in anyway.  When I sent the player in, they sent me back a "refurbished," i.e. USED player.  This used player was heavily scratched up on the back.  I did not pay full money for a new Rio Carbon only to receive a used one.  And now, I am having the exact same problems with this "new" player.  The jogger dial has once again caved in without provocation.  The player continuously shuts down in the middle of play.  And to top everything, the customer service is highly adversarial and certainly not helpful or sympathetic.  My advice?  Stay clear of Rio players.

<Title>Do NOT buy a Rio Carbon!!!
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I will never ever buy from Rio again! I had the Rio Carbon for exactly 4 months and it broke! I suspect it's the battery and you can't replace the battery. I called Rio Support, long distance, of course. Rio Support wanted $99 to fix it. Forget it! I will not pay $99 for something that will mostly likely break in 4 months again. I may be a fool once, but not twice. I am going to buy a Creative Zen instead. My niece had a Creative Zen for a little over 1 year. She dropped her Zen and it broke. However, the big difference is that she called Creative and Creative sent her a brand new replacement for FREE! Yes, that right! Creative sent my niece a brand new replacement, a new model too, for FREE. That's what I called great Customer Support. Rio Carbon should take a lesson from Creative. Rio Carbon SUCKS!!!

<Title>Doesn't Hold up!
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one for my 15-year old and my brother bought one for himself. The wheel on both became dislodged, ours after about 95 days (or just a few days after the warranty expired)and the other after about 7 months. Trying to get an answer on how to get them repaired was impossible and after many hours online and several faxes to Rio, we gave up. Instead we bought earphones with volume adjusment and got by without the click-wheel navigation feature. After 8 months, one of the units was fell accidentally off a shelf and onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of that! Recommend you check the warranty and talk to others about their experiences B4 you decide which MP3 to buy.

<Content>Only one person's experience, but I purchased this and had to send it back for three replacements to try to get one that would last over two weeks without suddenly going blank and dying.  I eventually gave up as it is too expensive to keep shipping it back to the RMA center.  As other reviewers mention, returning a Rio Carbon likely will result in receiving a refurbished model.  I ultimately went with a Dell DJ, which works well.

<Title>The Best - for now!
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a really volatile market, so watch for new products. Having said that, this is the market leader for now in my view.  I went from a Creative Jukebox to an iPod, and was quite pleased with it. But the case started to split and the battery life diminished, so I decided to try the new mini. But this little beast sat next to it on the counter and I compared the two. This baby makes the iPod mini look out of date and clunky, uncool even!  Touching wood, I have had no problems to date (3 months use) with reliability, but the useability is superb. I love the controls and the clarity of the screen, although the carrying case is badly designed.  But you buy one of these for the sound, and I recommend that you listen to one. Compared with the iPod, it gives a cleaner, sharper sound which is, I suspect, as close to CD quality as we are likely to experience on an MP3 player for some time.  Battery life is really good (although I cant say I have tested the manufacturers claims), way better than iPods.   To summarize, it is a real "feel good" machine. Try it and fall in love with it.

<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Carbon is by far and away the best portable audio device that I have ever used. Plenty of features and all are very easy to use. 5 GB of memory is more than enough, and certainly as much as I will ever need. Sound is incredible and is very easy to customize with the equalizer to your own personal liking. The only negative is the ear buds. Very uncomfortable, sub-standard sound quality, and constantly falling out of my ears. I purchased a set of "in the ear" buds from Radio Shack ($21.99) which completed an almost already perfect package. Awsome product!!!

Perhaps you're not a teeny bopper downloading the latest tunes from the net but a person who loves classical music and opera and need playlists for efficient storage/transfer.

<Title>A sleek little gem that holds a lot!
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had never owned a digital music player before I, on a whim, really, ordered the Rio Carbon "Limited Edition" (first 500 units made).  I travel a lot and wanted to be able take my music collection with me in the car and on the plane.  When I received it, back in September, I was amazed at how small it really was. I started loading it up with my CD collection, and found that I had plenty of room left over.  Syncing it with Windows Media Player 10 was a joy, as was the ease of use and the great sound quality.  I had never really thought about the Audible support, but I tried the free month and was hooked, downloading books and the daily New York Times.  I listened to Bill Clinton reading his "My Life" during a long car trip, and was enthralled.  The Carbon does Audible navigation very well, allowing fast forward and rewinding, skipping forward and backward through chapters, and has the ability to save up to 10 "bookmarks". It has the iPod beat here in many ways.  The battery life is truly astounding.  The meter will appear to show that it is low, but it will keep playing for hours more.  I do have some minor gripes - the user interface can be confusing in some places, where you have to know which of "click the scroll wheel", "press the menu button" or "press the OK button" you need for a particular function.  But I picked it up soon enough.  I would also like the ability to create playlists on the fly, rather than having to upload them, but that is minor. Lastly, the case provided protects the player well, but you can't get at any controls when in the case!  I do like that the controls are all findable "by feel", even if the player is tucked in my pocket.  I've now owned the Carbon for almost five months, and it is giving me a lot of pleasure.  If you're in the market for a small and sexy hard disk player, this is the one to get.

<Title>What's an iPod?
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing is perfect.  My ONLY issue has nothing to do with the player but with the leather carrying case.  It doesn't help much having to remove the player from the case each time you need to fiddle with controls.  The player itself is a dream.  It's smaller than the iPod mini but gives you an extra gig of storage.  I especially like its flat, smooth ergonomics.  It fits nicely in the front pocket of your jeans.  You don't realize it's even there.  It sounds great and it plays wma files which is very nice.  I don't care too much for the lack of lossless wma playback as those files carry huge file size overhead.  I honestly don't have a negative thing to say about this audio player.  I have one of the 500 limited edition models and am still as enamored with it now as the day I got it.  It's one of those rare products that actually delivers exactly what you'd expect from it.  And with some of the deals that Amazon has on this thing right now, I'm amazed that they aren't sold out.

<Content>This little player looks cool and has great sound but. About 20 percent of the tracks skip like an old record player.(I thought we were way past that!) Rio support's response was upgrade the firmware which had already been done. When I informed them of this they disappeared off of the face of the earth. I don't know about you but that is totally unacceptable. Whatever happened to SERVICE in this country.  Buy an Ipod and avoid this crappy company. It will work properly at least until until the battery dies.

<Title>Cool little mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was going to wait and save up for an Ipod but I found a good deal on the Rio Carbon and had to snatch it. It is a cool little mp3 player that sports a 5gb hard drive with built in voice recording. I like how it automatically sets up on Windows XP as an external drive and you can drag and drop files immediately. Made sure I downloaded the latest firmware for it before I started messing with the settings. The sound I would say is a little above average, had to mess with the equalizer to get it the way I wanted it. There are presets for Rock, Jazz, Techno, etc. The other good thing is that it accepts WMA files so I didn't have to convert any of my previous WMA tracks. I thought the menu access was kinda quirky, everytime you select and change something it automatically goes back to the audio screen and you would have to press the menu button again to get back. The volume button doubles up as the scroll button which is surprisingly fast to the touch. I like how it charges via USB and the battery life is a whopping 20 hours after one charge. Overall, I would rate this player 4 out of 5 stars. I would've given it a 5 if it wasn't for the menu access thing and the lack of a dedicated hold button (but can easily be done through the menu settings).

<Content>Great player. Very easy to use. I didn't even need to read the directions to use the software.  Excellent sound quality.  Very compact.  The only thing is the case is not very functional. You can't access the controls when it is in the case.  I bought a generic arm band case at Target so I can store it when I walk.  Definately worth the money over the Ipod.  Purchased at NewEgg.com $199.00, no tax, free shipping. That is $50 less than in the stores. I bought this over two weeks ago, and I have not had to charge the battery yet (after initial charge, ofcourse). Used it in the car with a FM transmitter and had very good quality.  I just order speakers for it.  I also purchased new headphones for it, but the ones that came with it were fine.  I just like a different style. I give this MP3 player 2 thumbs up.

<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Rio Carbon 5G Mp3 player does an overall good job. It's hard to find another player that has this much space for the price. A couple of flaws that need to be addressed are: 1. The player tends to freeze and need to be re-booted if the charge is low. 2. Books parts tend to load onto the player out of order even when you've synced them to the player in order.  The most common problem is that part 10 will come after part 1 of the book so if you're not paying attention you're suddenly at the end of the book. I've had the ending of a story ruined more than once due to this problem. CH

So I was WALKING to the gym last night and it dropped onto the GRASS and the VOLUME scroller popped inside of the unit.  CRAP!  My boyfriend looked at it and it died on him.   Yes, like you will read in all the other reviews..$99 is not worth it to fix this!!  I am so mad because I got a new computer and all the songs are not backed up.

<Title>the ipod KILLA!
<Date>Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided it was time for me to take the plunge and get one of those new fangled mp3 playin' pocket boxes. After much research, I decided to pick up a Rio Carbon. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but what an undeniably wise choice that was! Here are my pro's and con's:  PRO'S - This thing is BITE-SIZE! When I first opened the box, I was like, "where is it?" I carry it with me comfortably in my breast pocket. - Lots of space for the price. 5 GB for less than the cost of an ipod mini. You can't even find a flash drive, let alone an mp3 player, for that price. - It looks like a million bucks. This is one pretty gadget! - The bundled software was great. One of the reasons why I chose the Rio Carbon over other players was the fact that windows could recognize it as a removable drive so I could use explorer to add and delete files because I so detested iTunes. But I decided to give the Rio Music Manager a shot and it's great! If you have your MP3 collection properly tabbed, then you can just pick and choose the albums or artist catalogs you want to add and just click the send button. Removing albums is just as easy too. - The battery life really is solid. When I first got it, I was too excited to charge it up first and copied a few albums over and got about two hours of listening on one bar of battery level and it still didn't show any signs of running out.  CON'S - I did experience the headphone crackle mentioned by other reviewers (if you don't know, if you use headphones other than the one's provided, then the plug may be too long and might connect with the metal of the case and fuzz a little). I found that the problem was so minor that it wasn't worth remedying (all you have to do is put a piece of electrical tape around the headphone jack). It only crackles when you twist the plug around. - The case that came with the package is a little useless. The only knob you can work while it's in the case is the volume, and the whole fits so tightly that you'll probably brush a few of the buttons on the front as you insert it. - The included ear buds are pretty crappy.  In the end, I didn't feel like the con's were sufficiently detrimental enough to not give this player 5 stars. It's a shame that Rio has gone out of business because I heard they were working on a 30 GB version. But otherwise, it's only out-classed by the ipod mini in one department (the mini is 6 GB).

<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have taken perfect care of my Rio Carbon and really enjoyed it. Having read reviews, I knew the wheel may be susceptible to breaking (plus I am anal-retentive anyway), so I babied it.  I didn't even use the wheel that often - I didn't like it.  I'd always end up scrolling when I wanted to click,  and vice versa, so I usually just used the buttons instead.  Plus, the only times I used it was on the plane when I travel, so it was never in the least bit abused.  Regardless, I took it out of my bag the other day only to find the wheel broken anyway.  So, as long as I never have to adjust the volume, I have a great mp3 player.    I know they are trendy, and I hate that as much as anyone, but save yourself the headache and just get an iPod.

<Content>I had written a very nice review of this unit... but I had to delete it.  The unit seemed great for a few weeks, but very soon the problems started showing.  The battery was inconsistent and occasionally even when coming right off the charger would show less than half power.  The firmware was slow to add new songs and even to turn on the unit and begin playing music.  The included headphones wore out - the wires were frayed on the inside.  New headphones constantly had problems with getting a clean connection (no matter how nice a pair they were).  The volume know broke off so I couldn't set the volume.  I dropped it and the whole case broke apart.  I wouldn't buy one of these again... or even from the company.

<Content>Have had this unit since Jan. and like many other people I dropped it last week and the scroll/volume wheel broke. Very disappointing considering there is no other way to adjust the volume. Up to that point I really loved this player....battery life, ease of use, portability all good points. Anyway after a bit of research I decided that and operation was inevitable. Prying the unit apart was a little nerve wracking but once apart I found that a little super glue was all I needed to have volume once more. Still really like this player.

<Content>i saw this other review on this, and it said if your a kid wanting to fit in with an ipod, don't get it. I tottally agree. So far i've had no problems, it's just been a bit laggy when i scan through my music on it pretty fast.. then theres that thing when u select a track from the menu, you can't just bush the buttons left or right, you have to go BACK to the menu, and push "play all" which is tottally a waste of time.. unlike the ipod. Plus, the case really stinks.. i don't use it at all. one thing was that there was already a scratch on the mp3 when i got it. If you have a child, do not get this for them... they would much appreciate an ipod! Oh yea, don't even think about an ipod mini (not sold anymore) and it turns out that apple has to fix the ipod nano- it was faulty! i've had no problems so far.. it's working smoothly.. adults, buy it!

<Content>I'm all for paying for a superior product that I believe in but in this day and age of competition, there are a lot of similar products out there.  While the Carbon isn't perfect, it was my choice at the time of my purchase in October 2004.  But dealing with their customer service and the warranty replacement process has led me to the conclusion that I would gladly purchase a 5gb mp3 player from a "creative" competitor.  I can honestly say that I will no longer purchase any Rio products and will not advocate any of their products to others.  With my electronics purchases lately, I am learning more and more that it's not only about the product itself but a lot about the warranty and customer service that comes along with the product.  As for the Carbon itself, well.....only 90 days warranty and it died on me in 6 weeks.  I have been 2 months to date without my Carbon due to Rio's lacking and unacceptable warranty replacement process.  And it looks like it's going to be another 2 weeks before I get what is hopefully my final unit.  I just can't believe that I sent them a 6 week-old brand new looking Carbon (due to failed power) and they send me back a refurbished unit with a lot of scratches and even large pieces of dust dislodged in the lcd.  And they even told me that they were going to send me a new unit to replace my defective one and that it would take 3-4 weeks because they were expecting new inventory then.  6 weeks later, I receive a highly refurbished, scratched up unit.  That's messed up.  And over 2 hours of phone calls, etc., I have to arrange to send back the scratched up refurb unit and they don't even do anything about expediting my replacement even though they admit their faults.   Lying or incompetency.....call it what you may!  The saga continues for another 2 weeks.

<Title>Don't waste your money, buy an IPOD
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You know how everyone is comparing this, as well as all other mp3 players, to the apple IPOD? Well there is a reason. The Ipod offers features that the others can't fathom, and has the reliability and customer service that one expects when making a large purchase such as this.  My Rio is fine, but when comparing it to the Ipod I was only dissapointed. I cannot get an FM transmitter, and the file organization is pathetic in comparison. The case is awkard, and I only have one choice for cases. And of course, the interface itself on it just is not up to par. The Ipod has obviously been refined time and time again, and they have a very polished product. The Rio Carbon may be a good item in a couple generations, but they have a long way to go. The battery life is the one advantage that it holds over the Ipod, and that is a nice feature. In short, if you are going to spend this much money, you might as well buy a quality product such as the Ipod.

<Title>Great, unless it's broken
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Rio.  But, the first time I ran on my treadmill with it, I knocked it off the stand and the wheel got pushed in and no longer works.  Well, because I dropped it, the warranty doesn't cover it so I figured I would just mail it in and get it repaired.  Little did I know...Rio does not repair its products.  I can simply mail it in and pay $149 for a REFURBISHED one.  This is over half the cost of the original one...why would I pay that much?  Anyway, I just think they have bad customer service because the lady was not even nice to me about it.  So, if you are even remotely likely to drop your Rio, don't buy one because it will cost you almost as much if you break it.

<Title>The Carbon does everything I need, and more.
<Date>Fri Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I (like a lot of you I'm guessing) have searched and searched for the right portable music player. Well I found the Rio Carbon to be just the right one for me and my needs. I first bought/tried out a cheap RCA Lyra but it's functions and storage are severely limited, it was cheap ($39.00) but for even the most basic of my needs it just didn't to cut it. Next I tried the Creative Nomad Zen Extra, but found it's user interface very unintuitive and when I transferred VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files to it it would play them back at half speed (I'm guessing),  and I really didn't want to go through a long and complicated process to convert the VBR files to CBR (constant bit rate) that and the UI made me return this one also. Maybe I should back up here and lay out what features I really wanted from a portable player. The ability to work with multiple online music stores i.e. Musicmatch, Napster, Wal-Mart etc.. The ability to play long MP3 files (over 2 hours), the ability to turn the unit off and have it remember where I last left off in a long MP3 file and/or the ability to bookmark my position. The ability to fast forward a long MP3 file (skip through commercials), decent size storage capacity 2-5 GB, User friendly user interface, long battery life, excellent sound quality, all at a reasonable price of course. Well the Rio Carbon does all this, and more! What I needed some of the above features for is so that I can time shift/listen to my favorite radio show when I commute, and have the ability to just skip through the annoying commercials and station breaks. The Carbon lets me do just that, and if I want to take a break I can easily set a bookmark and come back to the same spot at which I last listened at any time I decide to do so.  I first looked at the Apple iPod but there is no bookmark function while listening to MP3 (or AAC) files. You can set bookmarks while listening to Audible (.AA) files but that's it, and if you shut the player off it automatically starts at the beginning of the track you were last listening to, so if you're an hour and a half into something and turn it off be prepared to do some lenghty fast forward button holding! There is a "work-around" to this which involves converting your MP3 files to ACC and then changing the file extension to .MP4b, but whenever I did this it shrunk the time of what I converted from 2 hours and 45 minutes to like an hour and a half, and I would find big chunks missing. The Carbon works with both Mac and PC, it works with Audible.com files also and it has a built-in voice recorder (if that is a feature that interests you). It uses the (very fast) USB 2.0 standard. Comes with a simple software program (for Windows XP, I haven't tried it with a Mac yet) The headphones/earbuds it comes with do lack quit a bit but I knew that going in and already have my own aftermarket ' buds. All in all this player has a very complete feature set and the sound quality is right up there with any other player I have listened to. I give the Carbon two thumbs-up and recommend it highly.

<Title>Better Then The Ipod Mini
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>During Christmas break I was very upset when I opened my gift to see a Rio Carbon MP3 player. I wanted a damn Ipod but, my parents being the good consumers they are said that the Rio Carbon was much better. At first I thought they were lying to make me feel better but  as I used it more and compared it with the Ipod,  The Rio is the better deal.  It has 25% more storage space than the Ipod mini.  It is also much smaler than the Ipod. Also had a great battery life.  I love the Rio and I am glad my parents got a great MP3 player!!

<Title>A Great Player!
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, my parents gave me the money for an mp3 player this Christmas, and after much investigation I got the Rio Carbon.  This is a great little player, I have played around with my friend's Ipod mini, but the Carbon has better battery life and more space for my music.  The only reason I didn't give this thing 5 stars is that the volume wheel is pretty fragile.  Mine broke, but the folks at Rio were very helpful.  They definately have some great customer service.  If you want an Mp3 player to take with you on trips, or to listen to on your down time, I'd strongly recomend the Rio Carbon, great quality AND customer service!

<Title>pretty good itunes integration
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I won't go over the ipod mini comparisons, as there's plenty of review material on this subject.    I'm pretty happy with this player, having an iBook/itunes as my home music library and itunes on WinXP at the office.  The Carbon shows up as a device on itunes mac os x after installing a simple plug-in, though it's a bit slow with an ibook G3 that has older USB 1.0 ports.  You can drag songs, albums, and playlists to the Carbon, but the playlists are not retained--it simply copies all the files to the Carbon.  I don't make extensive use of playlists, as I ususally just browse by artist/album.  The scroll wheel moves thru menus at a constant speed and doesn't accelerate, so it does sometimes take a number of turns (easier with two hands, I have to admit) to find what you're looking for.  However, for 5GB, the album and artists lists don't get unmanagably long.  Scrolling thru your whole track list would probably be too long, but I never do this--I always know at least the artist or album and can browse to there first.  There is no itunes plug-in for Windoze, but the device just shows up as a lettered drive, and dragging files directly from the file explorer is convenient enough (if you let itunes "keep your music organized"--see itunes prefs).

<Content>This is a very nice looking MP3 player.  If you are looking at this review that means you have already done your initial research on the smaller size MP3 players already.  For those people with too many things to worry about already, why make your life more complicated?  Get this MP3 player.  It is EXTREMELY easy to use!  From opening the package to listening 1st mp3, it only takes about 5 minutes!  Of these 5 minutes, 3 minutes was used to open the package.

<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It took me a few days to get it running because plugging it into the USB ports on the front of my system didn't work; it had to go in the back.  And this was not obvious.  We figured that out, and got the music on it.  The next morning I went to turn it and it was dead.  I've bought an IPOD and I love it.  Worth every extra penny.

<Title>Beware the 90-day Warranty
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased my Rio Carbon in October 2004.  When I first received it, it was automatically resetting after playing about 6 or 7 songs.  I contacted Rio Customer Support, and they advised me to "flash the firmware", which basically means load a new operating system.  After that, it worked fine for about 6 months.  I was very happy with this MP3 player during that time.  In general, I prefer to give new market products a try rather then migrating to the market dominator (in this case the iPOD).  My only negative comment is the cheezy leather case.  There is no clip or anything on it, so you have to put it in your pocket.  This was inconvenient for me while running because the earbud cable was stretched to the max, and since some of my running shorts don't have pockets I had to invent ways to hold the player in place (use your imagination here).  Other than that, though, I would have rated 5-stars.  BUT THEN...while adjusting some playlists and other functions a few weeks ago, it came to my attention that there was a new version of firmware available.  I don't recall if it was the the Rio Music Manager software or actually on the Rio web site, but one of the two suggested that flashing the "new" firmware to achieve additional capabilities and other marketing nonsense.  So, I went to the Rio web site, downloaded the new firmware, and flashed my player.  This was the beginning of the end.  Immediately, the player began resetting automatically again after playing 6 or 7 songs.  After about a week, it died totally.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get the player to turn on, light up, or respond in any way.  I immediately contacted Rio Customer Support, and they gave me a checklist of things to try.  I tried...nothing worked.  When I replied that the checklist didn't work, a different tech sent me another checklist.  This process repeated 5 or 6 times with a different technician each time, and I eventually began getting the same checklists again.  When I finally got someone to read my e-mail rather than send me another checklist, they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $99.  When I explained that the player died after a Rio-directed firmware update, they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $99.  When I asked if they actually read e-mails from customers or just issue pre-programmed responses, they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $99.  I then told them to relax, take a deep breath, and hold it until I send them $99.  I ordered my iPOD this morning.

<Title>Nice mp3 player very satisfied
<Date>Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I searched a long time before buying this MP3 player. I considered Olympus MR-100 (very hard to resist), Creative labs Zen micro for mid-sized and Sony NW-HD5 and Cowon X5 for large-sized player. Since I only have 5 GB of music collection, I decided to go for mid-sized. I own a Cowon iaudio 5 512 MB, and a Frontier Labs 1 GB. They are both good. The iaudio 5 has FM radio, voice recoder, line-in recorder and better Chinese support. I really like it, but I want bigger capacity, plus, I can't (or don't know) search songs. That's very annoying. The Frontier labs is very slow in starting up. Back to Rio Carbon 5 GB, I only got it yesterday, and I drag-n-drop most of my albums from my music, I am enjoying all my favorite songs right away. I saw the picture of Rio Carbon and I thought who would buy a ugly thing like that? But the real thing is really pretty and stylish, 10 times better looking then the picture. It felt good too in my hand. It's very easy to use. I never look at the manual as usual, I was able to set up everything I need. Unlike iaudio, you need to learn how to use it. It can display about 80% of my Chinese songs characters. So I am quite happy about that. I am very happy with my purchase, very satified so far.

<Content>So far, the carbon has performed as promised: compact, easy to set up and use, good sound quality. I primarily use it to listen to audiobooks, and so I like the bookmark feature, although I have lost my place by inadvertantly hitting a button that switched to a different book. I previously had an ipod mini, and the Carbon seems to be a better value so far, but I do miss the lock switch on the ipod that prevented the mistaken button pushes.

<Title>Great Compact Player
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>+Size, Value, Looks, Sound quality, Functionality, Ease of Use -No song delete, could use a better cover  I have had this player for nearly a month now and just love it.  It is easy to use and has several different ways to select the songs that you wish to play, playlists, album, artist, genre, etc.  Battery life is 13+ hours and I currently have over 2500 songs on it.  I just got home from driving 27 hours cross country (in two days) and I used it both days of over 13 hours each and still had battery life left at the end of each day.  I would recharge it at night and it was good to go for the next day.  It recharges from the USB cable and comes with an AC adapter for the USB cable to plug in to for charging.  This is a great little adapter and I now use it also to re-charge my Palm Zire as well.  The sound is great with the earbuds that it comes with.  I have a pair of Sony Fontopia earbuds and they do not sound as good as the ones that come with the Carbon.  I would like to have a better protective case that can be used to change songs, start, stop, etc without having to remove.  I also would like to be able to delete a song on this unit, but have yet not been able to figure how to do so.  I have read the manual and it does not mention how, so I assume that it is not capable.  Otherwise, the best compact, best for the value out there for under $200.  Much better than the iPod Mini.

<Title>Good, easy to use player for a reasonable price
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Rio Carbon about a month ago and have been using it almost everyday since. Loading songs onto the player is very easy, whether you drag/drop files or use the software the player comes with. The size and thinness of the player which makes it very portable for running/exercising or just taking it to work. The 5 mb the carbon comes with has been more than enough for my use, and I still have a lot more space I can fill it up with. What could be improved is the free cover that comes with it, which protects the player but also makes it impossible to navigate to different songs or see what song is playing since it lacks a clear cover to see the actual player. Also, the placement of the on/off button, menu button, and volume wheel makes the case design very impractical since you can end up pressing random buttons simply by trying to extract it from its case. Overall however, I am very satisfied with the product and it is a great, basic mp3 player with good storage space and price.

Exactly one week later, I've got it in my pocket during school, I pull it out sixth period to find that the volume wheel has been pushed inside the Carbon, making it impossible for me to change the volume.  So I take it back.  This time it only takes me 5 days, and viola!  Volume wheel breaks again.  It fell out of my hands 5 inches above my desk, and the same thing happens.

<Title>Rio is a great buy and addon to your computer system
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little Rio has been fun to play around with ever since I got it a week ago. It is smaller than my friends iPod Mini and obviously holds more, as many other reviews will talk about. It syncs well with my Asus laptop and everything is recognized. The program that comes with it, Rio Music Manager, really does a great job with making playlists (something I like doing) and keeping all your music is good check, to the most extent anyway. I am about to change my file formats over from mp3 to wma to fit more music on this light device. So that is a bonus from the one format iPod mini. I love the fact that I can just plug it in and it is instantly recognized as a drive. I haven't checked out the voice recorder yet. The headphones aren't as bad as what I expected after everything on the web. Yeah, there not Sony's and the sound isn't as sharp as the earbud style headphone, but they stay in my ear when I run and the sound on this beauty has no trouble in making me forget how much I am hurting. I have had some problems with the switching to music though. When the starting the Carbon, the loadup time is about 20 seconds. Also after it has loading up, for about the next 30 seconds it doesn't respond well to any changing of music, whether it be volume, track, or getting into the menu display.  Also, the shiny casing does get fingerprint/scratch marks VERY easily. In fact after only 24 hours of having the unit, the backside had a few stratches. I thought that that is something that Rio needed to look at. And dont bother about the case that comes with it, you will see that it may as well not come with the  player. I have put it somewhere and don't bother even messing with it. During a run, the rubber around the Carbon makes for good grip when the hands get a little sweaty, but a good belt clip/case would be nice (yes I have seen them for $60-$70, but that is a bit extreme for a case). When I first got this machine I thought "Had I put $200 down on something that will just sit on the shelf after a few weeks?", but now that I have got it and customized it a little, I strongly believe it will travel well over the next year. By then there will be bigger drives and smaller units anyway. Overall a 4/5 only because of the scrathes and sometimes slow HDD, but dont get me wrong, this is a beauty that you will be happy with.

<Title>Great product, but a few downsides...
<Date>Thu Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Carbon is an excellent product.  I have been using it for about a week and I haven't had a single major problem.  Below are my comments and I will try and avoid repeating what others have already stated about the pros.  Pros: - actual player itself seems very well made  - the buttons are well laid out - Screen displays quite a bit of information in very little screen space yet is still surprisingly easy to read - Doesn't need ANY special drivers to use this as an external storage device in Windows XP  Cons: - Battery life doesn't seem to be as long as the manufacturer states.  I average closer to 10-12 hours. - Load time is quite long at around 10 seconds sometimes - the scroll wheel on the upper-right is fairly handy and works fairly well except that when using the "click" or "select" ability, it seems a little too sensitive - Rio's included carrying case is almost worthless.  Can't see the screen at all while in the case - No FM tuner  This is another huge one for me:  When using certain headphones, the output is scratchy (pops, hissing, etc).  Most headphones including the ones from the factory don't have this problem, but I have a headphone jack that runs directly into my car's head unit that has major issues with this particular device.  No other devices including my laptop, cd players, portable dvd players, etc have caused ANY of these problems.  Based on the suggestion of another Amazoner's review, I used clear nail polish on the headphone jack itself but this only marginally improved the quality.  The scratchiness has dropped a fair amount to a more bearable level but by no means is it perfectly acceptable.  I think I might send this back to Rio for them to check out.  I also had the opporunity to use a friend's Creative Labs Zen Micro 5gb MP3 Player and I have to say that it was quite impressive.  While I can't speak for reliability or battery life, I did feel the layout of the buttons and menus seemed more intuitive.  Also, the look of the device was a little more appealing than that of the Rio Carbon especially with the blue leds lighting up every aspect of the player.  Overall, I have say that I am happy with the Rio as it seems well designed and has served its purpose very well.  I have used it every day with no major problems with the exception of occassionally reponsding slowly to various actions.  I would highly recommend upgrading the firmware on this device before using it if you purchange the Carbon at www.rioaudio.com .

<Title>Lousy warrenty, few features, questionable sound quality
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>To start, I bought a Carbon about 4-5 months ago back when Ipods were in high demand, so I ended up going with the carbon ONLY becuase I wanted an MP3 player and the place of purchase was out of Ipods. I thought at the time though: No big deal, I'll just take care of it and it will last a couple of years, and I will still enjoy it.   Things did not go as planned though. To start, the sound quality on the carbon at times can be a little weak. Some songs do not sound as good as they should even in a low quality mp3/wma format. The carbon also does not seem to play some ogg vorbis formated files, which is a pain in the butt. Another blow to it though is the lack of features it has inside it. There is no radio tuner, nor are there any 'visulizations' to watch or any sort of beat meters. No games either, so do not get this and think that it will totaly relieve a lack of boredom. This is strictly an MP3 player with a stop watch and sound recorder feature (and I haven't even really had a need for the recorder, so why the heck is it on here?)  The other gripe I have with the rio is that when I bought it, it was valued at about 250-280, which after taxes and a warenty plan from the place of purchase, came to around 300 dollars. That is pretty steep for just a 5 gig mp3 player with bare essential features.    Another weakness that the Carbon has is that it has a TERRIBLE carrying case. You cannot see the screen nor control it while it is covered in the case, so all you can do is listen, turn it off, and adjust the volume. Another weakness that the case has is that it doesn't cover the entire carbon. It exposes one of the most fragile and importaint parts of it - the sound wheel. And it just so happens that one day when I was pulling the player out of my pocket it slipped out of my hand and it landed on the sound wheel, lodging it into the player and thus making it almost impossible to change the volume (unless you mess around with it.) This gets to where the warrenty kicks in... (and if you wonder why I am not using the warrenty that the place of purchase gave me, I am in the middle of a move and becuase of that the papers are unavailble at the moment.) The warrenty that rio offers is only 90 days, and after that warrenty the ONLY thing they will offer to do for a damaged player (in any way shape or form) is to charge you a $149 refurbashing fee. That is way more than half the price of the product as it stands now!! This is rediculous. You can pretty much buy a new carbon (or another mp3 player) of equal or greater value for a little more than $149! Absolutly insane...  To top off all my griping, the earphones just failed, and now I will have to buy a new set of earphones or headphones so I can listen to the blasted mp3 player.  So overall, the Rio Carbon does cover the basic essentials of an mp3 player, and offers a decent amount of storage space. It sadly though has a weak sound quality at times, and the other features it comes with can seem to be useless at times. It has a sleek, although flawed design. The carrying case for it is terrible though, and the damage resistance it has is pathetic. The warrenty that rio themselves offers is terrible, and do not plan on getting any decent sort of replacement plan from them. It is hightly advisable to go with any of the other brands: Ipod, Dell, Creative... ect. I am very dissapointed with Rio, and you may as well be in the long run if you purchase the Carbon.

<Title>A beautiful product that lasts 3 months
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Carbon with high hopes, it seemed like a steal, and with the silver shell and red lights, was very good looking to boot.  Aside from a few minor quibbles, I liked it fine, until about the 3 month mark, or more specifically, 5 days after the warranty expired.  It pooped out with an "upgrader" message, and despite all my efforts, and 45 minutes spent talking to technical support, I couldn't revive it.  So now I have a useless 200 dollar hunk of metal, and wish I'd read a review like this before I bought it... don't make the same mistake I did!  Oh, and I'm not an isolated case either, check any Rio Forum and you'll see plenty of instances like mine.

<Title>Great look, feel, and ease of use
<Date>Sun Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: The Carbon seems perfect.  The look and feel are excellent.    The controls feel like they are made well.  (Time will tell.)  The overall design: shape, steel case, LCD, backlighting and work well and look great.  It is very small; smaller than my flip phone.  The sound quality is great.  The EQ presets are good.  (The included earbuds are satisfactory, but nothing special)  I even like the Rio Music Manager software that comes with the Carbon.  Rio Music Manager can automatically (or manually) delete old content, transfer new audio content, and keep the content on your Rio Carbon fresh and dynamic*.  You can specify what percent of old content should be replaced by new content.  You can specify the source from a play list or just a random selection of your library.  It's really easy to use if you don't want to spend all day picking 1000 of your favorite tracks by hand.  * from the Rio Carbon manual pdf .  Cons: The case it comes with is poorly designed as others have said.  It's sleek and sexy, but you can only access the power and volume control and can't see the LCD.  I found a generic pleather cell phone case with a clear plastic front panel (where the phone keys would be) that allows full access to all the controls and the LCD.  It's a little too long and a little too narrow, but close enough for $10.  Battery life does not seem close to advertised.  I got about 12 hours on my first charge.  Static is an issue on the steel case as others have said.  My Carbon came with an all plastic headphone jack adapter to eliminate this problem.

<Title>The Rio Rocks
<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>well there isn't to much to say about the carbon except that it rocks. this is my first mp3 player, ive had it for about 2 weeks now, and i searched around for the best deal and i found it in the carbon. i got it for 164 on amazon.com and then rio has a $20 mail in rebate so that totals $144 for a 5 gig mp3 player. that is the best deal i could find. the only thing the carbon lacks is a usefull case, the one that came with my player is useless and so i don't use it but its ok. the music manager is easy and the controls are easy. ive never had an ipod or mini before but ive heard about them and they would have to be perfect to justify spending like 60 more bucks and getiing 1 less gig of memory. if more people knew about the carbon then im sure it would give the ipod mini a run for its money. well enough about the mini, i want to talk about my trip with my carbon. i took my carbon on a grueling 4 day camping trip into the rocky mountains. at first i was hesitant because i thougt it would be to hard on an mp3 player but my carbon lasted just fine even through the bumby roads and the dirt and mosquitos, man i hate mosquitos, and my rechargable battery lasted the whole time. i must have used my carbon for like 17 hours. that is awsome. well anyway i am very impressed by the carbon and i would reccomend it to anyone

<Title>No More toting CD's around
<Date>Sun Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I decided to start reseaching mp3 players it was a daunting task. Most of my friends have the ipod or the shuffler. I would watch them go thru all the steps to down load the songs and it made me want to cry. I don't have boxes of CD but enough that I need a changer so I figured I was ready for the player. I found lots of good reviews of the carbon so I decided to take a chance and buy it. When I got it I was impressed right away with the sleek and compact design its also has a very cool display that is back lit to make it nice when you listen in the dark. it looked pretty simple with the ear buds and little carrying case. I could handle this... I read the quick start pamphlet while the cd was loading the manager to my computer. it took all of 5 minutes. before I knew it I had loaded a good portion of my music on my rio. I ran the cd on my laptop and ripped the music from there. it was soo easy. the battery time is great I listen to it all day at work with no problems. the quality is actually better than my disc man and it NEVER skips. I've even dropped it once and haven't had any problems. I've only had to reset it once and that was pretty easy I just plugged it in and used a paperclip to press the button on top, I didn't even lose any music!  it is very user friendly and the controls are very sensible. the only thing is the shuffle function has a tendenicy to replay the same songs too much. but overall it's great. I got the membership to audible that came with it and I'm in heaven I can listen to books and my favorite radio programs. over all for the money that was spent I think this was a very good investment. initinally I was worried that I wouldn't have enough space but I have almost all of my music on there only about 1100 songs and books and i'm doing pretty good on space. I would reccomend it for anyone that loves music but isn't a computer genius.

<Title>My experience with the Rio Carbon and Rio Customer Support
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the market for my first mp3 player and I compared all of the big names (Ipod, Rio, Creative, IRiver, Etc).  My findings were that none of them seemed bad but that one offered more value and that was the Carbon from Rio.  I liked the Carbon's battery life and the fact that it didn't need any software to use (you can just copy and paste your mp3s to it).  The Carbon costs less than the Ipod mini, and has 1gb more space.  I bought one and was very happy with it.... for the first day and a half.  On the second day it fell from my lap, and the scroll wheel located on the top right corner of the carbon broke.  I was very disappointed at how delicate the wheel was.  Rio customer support was no help-- they wanted $99 to fix it (nearly the price I paid for it just 3 days ago).  I did some searching online and found that my problem was not an isolated incident, but that there are many, many Rio Carbons out there with broken scroll wheels.  The wheel is attached at only 2 very small points.  It is just a very vulnerable point of the player, and I know that if I had bought an Ipod mini, it would have survived the short fall that my Rio took.

<Title>The best excuse not to buy an ipod.
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Carbon is the best 4-6GB mp3 player you will ever find. It beats the apple ipods, creative zens and sony walkmans.  Design: The design of the carbon is perfect.  It is small enough to  hold extremely easily.  The sides are lined with rubber, which makes holding it even easier.  The scroll wheel and controls are positioned to make it effortless to use with one hand, and it is so much sleeker than the ipod.  Screen & interface: This screen is backlit and well sized.  The interface makes it easy to browse and play music.  The provided software makes it effortless to add new music to the player.  A few things to know about the iPod:  iPod batteries die permanently between 1-2 years. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.  Also, when the ipod came out, it was new and innovative.  Now it is old and expensive.  THERE IS NO REASON TO GET AN IPOD AND NOT THIS.

<Title>Rio Carbon 5GB is pretty good.
<Date>Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So far this has been a good change from my mindisc player. Only have two things to comment on. One, I can't find an armband thing to strap it around my arm while I'm working out. My mindisc player had that. Two, I could fast forward between whole CD's recorded on my minidisc player. I can only fast forward through individual songs on my Rio. However, you can create playlists and play individual playlists, or play all songs from individual albums or artists. It's really small too, and charges in a couple of hours. The software for it is easy to use. I didn't want to spend $250 or $300 on a 20GB or higher player that is bigger. I only have 1.5GB's of music anyway, so I have plenty of room to expand on my Rio. All for $166.

<Title>Too Complicated for It's Own Good
<Date>Sun Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a casual user, I find the Rio Carbon is too complicated.  The documentation is poor and the e-mail support is worse.  Loading tracks is no problem, but setting up a playlist is.  I exchanged at least a half dozen e-mails with tech support and each answer was from a different technician but with similar suggestions.  Apparently they don't read the previous traffic, and they certainly don't want to answer specific questions.  Finally, after almost an hour on the phone with a technician I was told I needed to upgrade my Windows Media Play to version 10.  That hasn't helped at all.  The only solution so far is to Play All and fast forward to the desired starting point, and in the process I've learned that the battery life is less than 10 hours, or half the advertised life.  All in all this device does not live up to the hype and is not practical for the average user.

<Title>Nothing but good experience with the Carbon
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the Carbon for almost a year and I don't have any complaints.  The battery life is fantastic and I think the form factor is great.  Small enough for your pocket but still very easy to use with one hand.  I also run/excercise with this unit often and it has never skipped on me.  I would probably rate this 4 1/2 if that was an option because I wish the original case it came with was better (no belt clip or ability to view the screen while in the case) and I wish it had an FM tuner.  Other than that, I think it is a great player at a great price.

<Title>Stopped working after 1.5 months
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are clearly some quality issued regarding the Rio Carbon.  I won't say iPod is any better or worse in this department, as I've never owned one, but I will say on an absolute scale, the Rio Carbon is not to be trusted.  Look around, there are other reviews like mine.  My Rio completely stopped working after a month and a half for no apparent reason.  It's dead to the world.  I didn't drop it, I didn't get it wet.  I woke up one day, plugged in my headphones, and nothing.  it just didn't work anymore.  Thank god I was able to find the receipt!  I read reviews on here referencing Rio's bad replacement and warranty situation.  I will now have to deal with this, and I'm not looking forward to it.  I say go with the iPod.  I don't know if it's any more or less reliable, but I do know their customer service and warranty/service organization is much better.

<Content>I recieved my RIO carbon as a christmas gift. I loved it.. NOTICE I said LOVED!!! It died for no reason. I didn't even have a chance to wear the plastic off the back if it. It was not scratched, dropped, wet or anything...   I called Rio to see what they could do. I have yet to experience the drama that comes along with the exchange. But I am very let down because I liked it.   I hated the fact that I could not seem to get things to play in the order in which I wanted them. I have not even gotten a chance to experience listening to a downloaded book on it...   My advice is Get an IPOD I believe they are more reliable. Then when I asked my friend for his recipt from Radio Shack it was blank... the Ink faded... SO what am I to do now?  Save your $$ the Rio is not ready... It SUCKS!!!

<Title>Easy-to-use MP3 player
<Date>Sun Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Rio Carbon after much research in the MP3 world. I don't regret my choice at all.  I'll go over the aspects I disliked about the Carbon first.  1. Durability: The LCD screen scratches way too easily. Mine already has about a dozen small scratches. I highly recommend protecting your screen with PDA protectors. In addition, keep the thin, transparent plastic that the Carbon comes with on the back of the player; the silver back part tends to be a magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The front buttons also attract fingerprints, but that doesn't matter because you will always have to press the buttons anyway.   2. Leather carrying case: This case is just terribly designed. It blocks out the front buttons and the screen which basically prevents any use of the player. I cut holes for the front buttons and the LCD screen and then taped up the edges of the holes with electrical tape. When I placed my carbon inside and then took it out later, the tape scratched the screen badly. Be careful if you want to cut holes in the leather case. An alternative is to but a vaja case. They cost about $50, but they provide full protection for your player including the screen.   3. No hold button: Sadly, there is no physical hold button; the feature is inconveniently buried in the menu.   4. Static: With all that metal in the Carbon's body, static is created when metal headphone jacks are plugged into the player. You can either place electrical tape at the base of the plug or use nail polish to coat the jack. The electrical tape works the best for me and I have never heard static with my metal jack headphones after applying the tape.   5. Shuffle option: The Carbon shuffle option wasn't as good as I hoped for. I occasionally heard repeat tracks but it is good enough for me.    6. Non-replaceable battery: I don't like the fact that I would have to send in my Carbon to get the battery replaced when it dies. But then again, by the time my battery dies, I'll probably have gotten another MP3 player.  Now for the good stuff. 1. Sound: The Carbon gives an excellent sound that is free of hissing or skipping. I tested out the sound by playing my Bourne Supremacy soundtrack on my CD player and then playing the exact tracks on my Carbon. The two sound exactly the same!   2. Simplicity: This is the real strength of the Carbon. It is so easy to use the player; I figured out how to use it without looking at the instructions. You can access a tracks by name, artist, album, genre, or year. The jog wheel, used for volume control and scrolling,  works like a charm. The front buttons, consisting of play/pause, fast foward, rewind, stop, and center buttons are simple but versatile. The menu button is also good but it bumps you back to the now playing sceen sometimes.  3. Battery: The Carbon's battery is very good but isn't as good as it is advertised. Rio claims the battery can last for 20 hrs. Mine gets about 13-14 hrs. In any case though, this is very superior to the mini and Micro's battery lives.   4. Size: The Carbon's small frame is very pleasant to the eye and to the hand; its rounded shape gives it a high tech look and feels great in your hand. at 3.2 oz, it is much lighter than the micro and the mini. I am very impressed that a device this small can hold almost 5 GB.   5. Storage: Rio claims that the Carbon can hold 5 GB of music. In actuality, the Carbon can only hold around 4.6 GB of music because about .4 GB is needed to run the machine.  This is still more than enough storage for me, since I only have loaded about 175 MP3 tracks at 96 kbps, taking up 554 MB.   6. Screen info: The Carbon's screen holds a huge diversity of stuff like Track title, album, artist, time elapsed, progress bar, track number, volume level, playback options, battery indicator, and current time and date. The backlight comes on behind the screen, Rio logo, and front buttons and fades away nicely after times ranging from 5 to 30 seconds.  7. USB cable: The USB cable for the Carbon doubles as a transfer medium and a charger. I thought that was very nice since you don't need an additional cord for the AC adapter.   8. Software: The Rio Music Manager software that the Carbon came with is extremely fast and easy to use. I was downloading music within five minutes of opening the software. The transfer rate is very fast to me, as I was able to download albums in seconds.   9. Extra features: The bookmarks are pretty cool and can remember your favorite tracks. The voice recorder is nice but I prefer not to use it because it eats up memory fast. I would have like to have the Carbon feature a radio, but unfortunately, it doesn't.  Overall, the Rio Carbon is a great MP3 player that rides on its simplicity. I felt it was definitely worth the money.

<Title>Still happy after after a year
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the Carbon for about a year now. Works as advertised and described in the other reviews. I use it for Audible.com files and RIPs of books on CD. Easy. Great battery life, too.  As far as durability is concerned, I've had better luck than some of the other reviewers. Like an idiot, I kept this in my back pocket a couple of times and noticed that I squished it together (it's stuck that way now with a slight lip all the way around but still plays fine). I keep it in my side pants or front jacket pocket now and it's been fine.  I use this thing daily, usually for two-eight hours and it has been problem-free except for one thing...  Every once in a while it acts (non-acts?)dead. I have a feeling this might be caused by a few things...  1. The device not being "stopped" before it's taken off my USB connection with my laptop. Not Rio's fault; this is a problem with lots of USB stuff.  2. Moving through sections of audible.com files too quickly.  3. One person metioned a low-power cause for freezes, too. I haven't seen that.  The reset is easy but needs a thin paper clip, The hole is tiny. (Note that the hole in the front is NOT the reset. That's the microphone. The reset is on top near the wheel.)  So,I pop a paperclip in the little reset hole as the instructions advise. The device comes back every time.  The carrying case is useless. I have not yet found one that fits well, and I have been looking pretty hard.  All-in-all, it's still worth your hard-earned dollars, I think, and the price seems to keep dropping.

It is now  one month since I started the return process and still no replacment.   For weeks they coud no  find proof of delivery even though I had the proof in hand and gave them tracking numers.  I called numerous times and was often on hold for 15 minutes,  I was frequently escalated to higher ranking reps each whose compentency decreased as their title increased.  I was promised two day deliverybut at last contact am getting 7 day delivery- maybe.  I still do not have replacement in hand., I enjoyed the Rio Carbon when it worked.  I  actualy got 18 hours for my audible books.  It is a handsome piece with a good screen.  The service stinks.  The quality is marginal.  An IPOD for me next time.  It would make a good fishing lure.

I will never buy from them again.  Update, after finally getting the MP3 I am happy to say that it is great, I had it for over 8 months now and use it almost everyday. In the office I plug it to my computer speakers, it sounds great. I also purchased better earphones (seinheiser or sony for less than $10 here in Amazon) and they make a big difference. I am overall very happy with this MP3 and after getting a free mini Ipod I decided to keep the Rio and sell the Ipod. It is easier to do downloads and have more options. I also purchased 3 more for presents for my nephews, one of them broke the volume wheel which I read happens often on this models, but since I gave him  a set of Sony earphones that have volume control ($10) he still using it and it works fine. They all love them. This is a  great MP3 and an excellent value for the price. It comes with stuff that Ipods sell has options plus it have 5 gb instead of 4 gb like the mini Ipod.

<Title>Clear winner over Zen Micro and Ipod Mini in my opinion
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I looked and used an Ipod Mini, Zen Micro and the Carbon.  I found that the Carbon was the best player of the 3 for my needs.  I owned 1 a week for 3 weeks to get the feel of them.  The Ipod was my least favorite.  The touch wheel was an interesting interface, but the pad felt like it was made of paper.  My finger nail scratched it very easily and I question the durability of the wheel on the mini.  Take a look at one on display at a store and you will see what I mean.  The Ipod has a very user friendly interface.  Most of my music library is in WMA, so converting everything to transfer was a pain.  I don't like Itunes, but it is way better than the Zen's software.  Ipod has games on it, but all I want to do is listen to music :).  I liked the Zen Micro except for the touch interface.  If it was a scroll wheel I would have loved it.  Like the Ipod, you have to install drivers and software to talk to the jukebox.  The Zen had great sound.  The best of the three I am reviewing.  I own 2 other Creative jukeboxes and the sound quality runs in the family :).  Creative's software is not very user friendly for synching.  Consider buying the 3rd party Notmad Explorer if you pick a Zen.  FM tuner is nice, but don't need it    The Carbon had a good feel in my hand.  It felt smaller than the other 2 and was cleary designed for the hand.  The little wheel blows away the other 2's scroll devices in my opinion.  It is right where your thumb is.  The Carbon sounds as good as the Ipod, but not as good as the Zen.  The Carbon's ability to hook up to any computer without having to have drivers or software was a huge factor.  This way I can use it both as a mini hard drive and a jukebox without any hassle.  Here's the summary..  Ipod Mini - Cons: Have to use Itunes, doesn't support WMA format, hated the touch wheel interface, touch wheel feels like paper and scratches really easy, user can't replace battery and proprietary cable.  Pros: Rugged feel, great warranty, lots of stuff available for it  Zen Micro - Cons: Touch pad stinks, proprietary software that is bad and device has a cheap feel.  Pros: User can replace battery, support for WMA, FM tuner, great sound, looks cool when lights up, Outlook sync (but why?)  Rio Carbon - Cons: Pleather case that comes with it (joke), have to use little cable for jacks with metal, user can't replace battery, have to use software to make playlists, metal back get full of fingerprints easily, short warranty.  Pros: Windows sees as a drive (no software or drivers need to be installed), fits well in hand, smaller than other 2, natural feel buttons (no touch stuff), software is simple but effective, looks neat when lights up.

<Title>Worth it.
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Ipod click wheel is clever.  But I don't find it especially intuitive, and it didn't win me over.  And at about 50 bucks more, I don't consider it worth it.  I was shopping for price, acceptability of features, and size.  The Carbon wins on the first and third, and does well enough on the second.    Size:  small enough you won't notice it.    Price:  Small enough ...well, I noticed it, but it doesn't hurt.  Features:  The scroll wheel appealed to me since it reminds me of Sony's electronic dictionaries.  That said, a lot of the criticism of the Rio is over the alleged flimsiness of this wheel.  It's not so flimsy, but it does feel out of place on this otherwise pretty solid unit.  It IS easy to use, though.  Too bad I'm always tempted to use the other buttons instead, despite that being the easiest mode of navigation.    The lack of playlist creation, and the inability to jump around a list of songs with single keystrokes (like one could on the Rio Volt) is a bit of a pain.  That is the low point of the Rio's design for me.    The high point:  the Carbon is very, very pretty (I like the red LEDs, underused since the introduction of blue LEDs), and it is designed in such a way as to be very comfortable in a pocket (tapered shape) without slipping out too easily (rubberized edges).    Sound quality is good.  I wasn't looking for one, but I didn't notice any stand-out difference between it and a 3rd gen Ipod.  The pack-in headphones suck, though.  Decent sound, but who the hell has ear canals that big?  That and I broke them within two days.  My 16 dollar isolating earbuds are awesome with this thing, though.  I'm tempted to go for some of the pricier ones.    Anyhow, if you aren't totally enamored with the Ipod mini, and you have to have something small, and the price/capacity of a flash player doesn't appeal to you, this is a good choice.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 in my eyes is the navigation.  And if you would just play premade playlists or shuffle, that isn't important.

<Title>The budget MP3 player.
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player is a lot cheaper than Ipod or Zen Micro. Sound quality is good and  physical appearance is also nice, very small and handy. However, my battery died just 2 days after using it and I have to send it back to Rio for an exchange to a new one. The customer service people are very nice, it's just that I have to pay for shipping to send it back to them. Overall, it is a good player although if you want to play safe and don't mind spending an additional 80-90 dollars, you can get a Zen Micro or Ipod instead.

<Title>Rio Carbon - Why buy anything else?
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The only other Mp3 player I have had, has been the Rio Cali (128).  Our youngest son (age 12) has one, and our college age son has one.  They are great, but I wanted something that has lots more space in it.  I did lots of research before purchasing the Rio Carbon, and even though some have had some problems with theirs, I decided that I still wanted one.  I will say that this is probably NOT for those who use an MP3 when they workout, or during strenuous physical activity.  I use mine for listening to music when I go for a walk.  I put the headphones on (I use Sony headphones, not the ones it came with), then I slip the Carbon in my jeans pocket, and it sure makes my walk go faster!  I also like to listen at night when I go to bed, so I take it bed with me, and I listen as I fall asleep.  My husband was saying that any type of Mp3 player like this would be more delicate, because it has a hard drive in it, as opposed to removable memory.    As far as I'm concerned, this is an absolutely awesome Mp3 player.  The sound quality is fantastic, and the software is easy to use.  I wouldn't recommend it for the child in your family, but for the average user, it is the best!

<Content>Mine died within 3 hours! No light, no response any more. I've thought it's out of battery, but after pluging in USB cable with the charger for a whole night, still doesn't have any response. Tried press and hold power button for more than 10 second. Will return it. Scared by its quality. Yours could die any time as well. Watch out!

<Title>Carbon is a good player
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to get the carbon after seeing the price here on amazon.com, only $169. The price is what sold me. I was originally going to get the 6gig Ipod mini, but for 100 dollars less and only one less gig, i found this deal unresistable. I got my rio a few days ago in the mail, already filled it up with about 3.5 gigs of music from my cds, and so far so good. However, there are a few things i wish rio could have done to make it better. The case just sucks, you can't access the controls while the rio is in the case, you have to take it out, which can be a pain in the ass cause the case is such a tight fit. Also there is no hold button on the outside, which, if you put the rio in your pocket without the case turns out to be a pain. Additional worries about the Rio are that it just isnt reliable. Although i have had no problems, the stuff i have read in the reviews here is kind of scary,so i am trying to be extra careful with mine. Other that that the rio has turned out to be awesome, good music quality, everything one could want from a digital music player, but who knows if my opinon will change after a few more months of using it.

<Title>Small, long battery life, resets shock
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've used my Rio Carbon every day for three months.  I've used it while walking, working, and snowboarding.  It is very shock resistant -- for a device with a spinning disk -- and has only "skipped" once after a severe shock while snowboarding.  In that case, it just paused for a few seconds and then resumed playing.  I was able to place about 1300 MP3 songs encoded at 128K before filling up the player.  When I tested the battery life, it lasted about 14 hours.  I usually top off the battery every day or so. The supplied USB cable is used to charge, but it is very slow to charge it from your computer.  It charges quickly (about 1-2 hours) with the AC adapter.  The USB cable plugs into the AC charger, so to charge from your car you will need an AC converter (about 2 for $30 at Sams).  The sound quality is so-so and definitely not as good as my old Panasonic portable CD player.  The only problem I've had with it is that it resets itself about once every 3 hours.  After a reset, it comes up in the "stop" mode and you must press the play button to restart the music (not so easy on the ski slope with gloves).  It also looses track of where it was in the playlist after a reset.  I've downloaded the latest firmware update, but the problem persists.  It is not related to the encoded songs, because I can play the same song again without another reset.  The PC software furnished is not as useful as Windows Media Player, so I don't use it.  I purchased an extra USB cable from Rio so that I can charge with one cable and leave the other hooked to my computer.  The user interface doesn't have as many features as Ipod Mini, but the smaller size, larger disk (5 instead of 4 Gig),  and longer battery life compensate for this.

<Title>Notes from a former IPOD 4th Gen
<Date>Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After having a "sour" apple ipod 4th gen experience, I decided to get something cheaper. After using the ipod religiously for 7 months, I LOVE the Rio Carbon much more.   The price is incredible. The size and shape feels much better and fits more easily into your pocket. They offer you a case and headphones, and anyone who has read the issue of static with headphones that have metal around the base, this has been solved with tiny adapter that converts such headphone jacks with one that has a rubber insulation.  I really like the fact that I don't need software and can synch using Media Player 10. In addition, I can take my music and transfer it to my pc at work or my laptop, unlike the ipod. The ipod makes your music invisible, not trusting you like an over protective parent, and assuming you will share music. If you really want to, you'll find a way, so it's just an apple inconvenience.   A feature I really like is the bookmark option. I can listen to multiple audible books and use a bookmark for each book. Or, two people can read the book (if you share a device) and each bookmark their own.   I admit the interface is different and takes time getting used to. I worry the button on top may wear out or break, but I've never heard of this to happen. I like the wheel better than ipod because each movement has a little click feel to it. IPOD makes a noise, but I found it hard to get to the exact song I wanted. I would stop at the song, and when I lifted my finger off of the click wheel, the movement of my hand would often change to another song. Annoying. Rating a song became impossible because of this.   I'm not a big fan or writing reviews, but felt that this would warrant one. I admit it, the ipod had changed my life, making music and books a larger part of my life. However, the Rio will be the one continuing the journey. With a way better value and competitive look and design, I'm hooked.   (Note - after 7 months my ipod's click wheel stopped turning, but occasionally would work and apple has a long list of disclaimers and possible charges - like "Apple may charge you a diagnostic fee including shipping charges, of no more than one hundred ($100) dollars US, (�Diagnostic Fee, plus applicable tax, if Apple inspects your product and determines based on the inspection that the product does not require service. If "and would not pay shipping after 6 months to fix it. They also have disclaimers that scared me because they put clauses in to pretty much let them charge you whatever they want, at their discretion. Not very friendly or, in my opinion, fair. So, I sold my ipod for parts on EBAy.

<Title>Junky toy; makes iPod seem like Rolls Royce of MP3 players..
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After using iTunes, other music playing software tends to come across as run-of-the-mill PC junkware. iTunes does organizing, sharing, ripping and burning so much better than the others, it isn't funny. Nothing like hearing Windows Media Player play MP3s; call me crazy, but I love intermittent volume and tonal shifts throughout a song, takes the listening experience to a whole new level. So, hmmmm tough decision here; Apple's iTunes software, from the masters of GUI or Rio's bloatware?  Hmmmm, another tough decision; get a MP3 player that has auto support from BMW, VW, Alpine and others or get a disposable with no support?  Sure the Rio feels like a toy, but wait, it has a "Plays For Sure" sticker - ah, I love little logos, especially with Windows flags on them, makes me feel safe and secure...  The most interesting testament I can say for the Rio Carbon, and I kid you not, is two different people I know have purchased these things recently and both Carbons are now dust gatherers. One person ended up getting an iPod Shuffle the other got a new iPod photo; and the iPods never leave their side. My experience with the dial thing on the Carbon was a joke, so good luck finding songs; better off setting the Carbon to shuffle and using the next-song button, letting the Carbon surprise you with a random playlist. Also consider, the less you use the Carbon's dial, the less likely it will break (and it WILL break, just a matter of when. Read the reviews).  Advice; get a player you'll love and actually use - in other words, do u want to drive a Porsche or a Hyundai?   iPod; + iTunes support, slick ease of use, growing auto support, LOTS of peripherals, also can use as external drive, Apple hardware quality, it  just works, cool factor - battery life, no microphone  Carbon;  + cheap, disposable - lousy software, plastic dial thing, no iTunes support, cheap, disposable, zero cool factor/no fun to use   ----------------------------------------------------------  There was one "review" filled with typos and grammatical errors, I believe referring to the iPod as an "iflop";   Hmmmmmm, the most respected and ubiquitous MP3 player in history - the gizmo that has completely changed the way people listen to music... A flop?  LOL, yeah right...  P.S.; batteries for iPods are under $50 - its called shopping around.

<Title>Caveat Emptor- No Customer Service from top down...
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Carbon in October, 2004 with my main motivation being that it was capable of playing Audible.com audio books.  Of course, I wanted to play music as well so the large capacity of the unit would allow me to load up most if not all my tracks plus several books.  Well, the music part works OK (the Music Manager needs help) but as far as my main use, listening to books, well, that is another story.  After listening to one part of a book and moving on to another part (or another book for that matter), the unit would freeze up completely.  I mean I could not even turn it off and back on again to reboot it.  I had to reset the system, reformat the hard drive, reload all my music and then reload the books. I contacted Customer Service via e-mail, their preferred method. No response. Again, I tried to contact Customer Service and this time got some canned reply about making sure I was running up-to-date firmware patches and that I should reset the unit. Duh! I replied that I had already tried that. No response.  Tried again. No response.  Called them on the phone.  After an hour on hold at my expense (no 800 number) I finally hung up in disgust.  E-mailed again and again and again.  Even to a Vice-President of the company.  He did reply with another canned response about how concerned they were with providing the customer with a good experience. He also said that he discuss my problem with his Engineering people and then get back to me. Right.  So here I am, more that six months later with a Carbon that does not work properly and even their own executives don't care one way or the other.  If you buy this unit strictly for listening to your music, you MAY be alright, as long as nothing goes wrong.  But if something does go amiss, you are on your own as you will receive no help what so ever from Rio's non-existent customer service. For this kind of money, there are other products on the market that you can buy with some level of confidence that the company will stand behind its product.  Rio is not one of them.  Take your hard-earned cash and spend it elsewhere.

<Title>Great deal - excellent little device!
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Many of the reviews here seem to be written by iPod "cultists" rather than Rio Carbon owners.  I recently purchased a Rio Carbon for its size - it fits easily in a shirt pocket - and large 5gb capacity.  I'm well past high school, so the "coolness" of owning an iPod did not matter to me - quality and price did. (In fact there is a $20 rebate being offered by Rio through June 2005.)  The Rio Carbon exceeded my expectations in every way.  I already have a dozen CD's worth of music on my Rio Carbon and I use it to transfer large files between my home and work PCs.  One of the best selling points over the iPod is that I wansn't locked into using Apple's iTunes service for music.  Although the Rio Carbon is supported by OSX and can use tracks downloaded from iTunes that are in mp3 or wma format, you can use any music download service on the web.  This can be a big money saver.  If you are looking for an excellent mp3 device with great storage capacity at a great price - you should seriously consider the Rio Carbon.

<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this wonderful device for about a month now and I must say I'm pleased.    Pros:     * Battery last about 20 hours.  -- I kept expecting to have to recharge the battery but it lasted one long car trip and several weeks of commuting before needing to be recharged.     * It plays audible.com books.  Some other reviewers have complained about the Rio freezing while playing audible.com books.  I have not had any problems with this.  My one gripe is that the menu to get to 'spoken words' is a little but awkward but once I figured it out no further problems.     * Nice small size.    Cons:     * What is it with the carrying case?  Why did they not put a belt clip or something else useful on it?     * Initial froze when using but after flashing the firmware it has worked just fine.   Over all an excellent mp-3 player.

<Title>RIO knows something
<Date>Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My sons purchased a Rio Nitrus for me in April 2004. It lasted until August 2004. When I contacted customer service to fix the problem, they informed me I needed to purchase another player since the "telling" 90 day warranty had expired. I gave RIO another chance and upgraded to a RIO Carbon for $249.  After about 5 months, the display screen burned up. I contacted RIO again.  They offered the solution of buying another Carbon at $149 since the 90 day warranty expired.  The current sales price with a rebate for a Carbon was $179 at that time.  I declined their offer, since it appears they know the lack of reliability of their product which is why there's only a 90 day warranty.  If you aren't going to use their product on a daily basis, it may be a good product. It's functionality is very good. If you plan on using it daily, let the buyer beware. You may be spending $500 a year for a $200 player

<Title>Customer Support SUCKS! -- Design not practical... 
<Date>Mon May 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>While the RIO Carbon is a nice gadget and seemingly does a lot in its compact design, it really needs to be tested for quality and designed for everyday life!  While in a Holiday Inn, I my Rio Carbon player fell 30" (yes, I measured.) from the table onto CARPET - not hardwood or cement-- CARPET. So when I try to adjust my volume I see that the volume wheel was jammed into the player case, and would not move. How's that for cheap parts?! The free leather case does not protect the wheel either! For $250, one would expect better quality than this!!  Even my FREE cell phone survives falls from higher elevations onto pavement and sidewalks!   The bad thing is that, even though I'm within my "warranty," it's not covered because I dropped it. and it doesn't matter that the product is designed poorly ... I would have to pay $149 to replace it. For this poor excuse for customer service, the company has lost a customer.  In addition, what's up with the RIO holder/protective case?  I can't take it to the gym because I can't clip the darn thing anywhere. I can't even dangle it from my neck. Forget putting in my back pocket - WARRANTY VOIDED if you break it. Their designers must have missed their Practical Application in Design 101 course while they were in school. It's terribly inconvenient to try and use this in any everyday, realworld situation because it was designed poorly and doesn't have the physical accessories needed to make this useful player.  The technology is great, the practical application REALLY BAD. Read your warranty carefully, and if you are the kind of person who occasionally drops things, be forewarned, you should probably buy a steel and padded case for this thing to help keep your warranty intact from any accident you may cause. I'll never buy anything from this company again!

<Title>Very good with WMP 10
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most of my songs are high bitrate WMAs of beethoven, mozart, and mendelssohn (terrific concerti, by the way!) - which makes Ipods a bad option.  This Rio Carbon comes with Rio software, but it's not necessary as it's Mass Storage compliant (you can even use it with Linux if you want!)  On the PC, Windows Media Player 10 (free download) lets me synchronize the library, transcoding everything down to 96 or 128kbps WMA, even modifying the ID3 tags as you go. Sound quality is (very) good.  Okay, I hear people trash about Windows Media format, but reality is it's as good as OGG at sensical (low) bitrates, the encoder is free from microsoft, Pocket PCs all over can play it nicely, and even Linux machines can play it with Xine, so I'm gonna stick with the format.)  (Edit: WMP10 wouldn't allow transcoding to 96kbps, feasible choices are just 64kbps or 128kbps.  Rats.  I guess 128 it is.)  Some niggles: - I agree with Erika Moore's review: the 20-hr battery life is for stupid 128kbps MP3 at soft volume.  With my kind of files, i'd say 10 hours is about right -- which is still pretty good. - During playback there's a gap between songs, but it's only about 1/3 of a second of a gap.  Furthermore, it seems like sometimes (most of the time?) the first 0.2 second of the song is cut off.  This isn't a big deal for Brittany Spears, but it's annoying for continuous tracks like between the third and final movements of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. - Star ratings aren't transferred from WMP10 to the player, and the auto-playlists aren't there either (i.e. you can't play your most favorite songs unless if you create a playlist manually).  I think the Auto-playlists are WMP10's most useful feature, letting you play your favorite songs during the daytime, nighttime, weekend, etc. - I can't figured out how to create playlists for the Carbon through WMP10.  I had to use the Rio software for this (ugh). - The headphones included are garbage.  I have a $9 Philips earbuds I got from Rite-Aid that sounds a lot better.  Do yourself a favor and spend $20-30 on a Sony or a Sennheiser.  Don't waste your money on the premium 'phones; remember diminishing marginal returns (just my suggestion, YMMV).  I also wish it had an AM/FM radio (so I can tune to the Phillies games), but nobody does AM radio anymore so I understand.  Creative Zen Micro has an FM radio, which is halfway there.  If that thing had any battery life and MSC compliant, I probably would've gotten that over the Rio.

<Title>Oh, where to start....
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the Rio Carbon as a Christmas gift from my parents. From the moment after I had spent thirty minutes maneuvering my way through the insane, theft-proof plastic bubble to retrieve my Carbon, I loved it. The Carbon is really a very beautiful gadget. Though, as I would come to learn six months later, you forget beauty very quickly when your mp3 player passes away to the next realm (mp3-player heaven...? DO mp3 players go to heaven...?).  Don't get me wrong, for the six months that my Carbon worked, it really did do me proud. Besides the fact that none of my headphones were compatible with it (apparently, if headphones have a metal ring at the base, they produce this ear-splitting static and make it impossible to listen to music). And the fact that the battery life didn't exceed more than an estimated 10 hours (even when I wasn't blasting it - which leads me to mention that the volume really doesn't go that high, even when you turn up every setting in the custom equalizer). And the fact that all you had to do was LOOK AT IT and it would scratch. And the power adapter/charger? Yeah, it exploded in about four months. Yet even with the previous complaints, I still enjoyed the look, the sound quality, and the overall performance of the Carbon.  Six months later: I placed my Carbon in a cushioned area of my purse, which doesn't contain any sharp, pointy, or otherwise harmless objects. When I went to retrieve it again, the jog wheel was broken! How that happened is beyond me. In any event, my dad decided to call the customer service. They wanted $140 to fix it. Do yourself a favor and go to eBay. You can get a BRAND NEW Carbon on there for $140. But you know what? I wouldn't, because I refuse to spend that kind of money on something that's going to break six months later. In any event, Dad took it apart and glued the wheel back on (WARNING: DON'T TAKE IT APART UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, OR IT WILL BREAK). After not only gluing the wheel back on, but piecing the entire thing back together, I used it for two weeks before the wheel came off again, and my poor Carbon completely died.  I did not, IN ANY WAY, abuse this product the way I have seen other people abuse theirs. Seriously, I dropped it maybe TWICE in the entire time I used it. The only thing I'm guilty of is blasting my music, something characteristic of my age group and something that shouldn't cause the mp3 player to completely meltdown.   So I give this product one star. What's the use of slapping some shiny gold paint on a rock? Underneath the pretty exterior, it's still only a rock, and I don't think I'll give the Carbon even that much credit. Please, PLEEAAASE, DON'T BUY THIS!!! Think of it this way: I went through the pain of it so YOU wouldn't have to go through it. Redirect your search to the Creative Zen Touch, it looks like a much better product.

<Title>UNBELIEVABLY FRUSTRATING. DONT BUY IT! DONT BUY IT!!
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I DONT CARE ABOUT ANY OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT. I DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS ON THEIR SITE. THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE. PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW .  Rio is distributed by a cheap Chinese company, and doesn't mantain a high quality performance at all. After previous experiences with Rio I encountered difficulties as well. The only reason why i bought this product is because the store I bought it from was out of IPods, and this was the only alternative. I am sadly dissapointed. WHY? First of all, the warranty is 30 days. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! I have had the Rio for like 5 months, and the joystick at the top is completely broke. How cheap is this? If they don't repair it, I will be extremely frustrated. It was a huge investment of about 249 dollars, and broke within 5 months.Secondly, this doesn't have near as many functions as the mp3 players coming out. Yes it is small, but has nearly no functions besides that it plays music. The sound quality was average, and the headphones broke in like 3 weeks. At times, i tried to turn it on after putting music on it, and it wouldn't even turn on. IT happened at least 5  - 6 times. This made me extremely mad also. The interface is terrible..The ipod has 2x better interface. You have to continually go back to a screen just go pick your music, instead of simultaneously using your joystick. So what have we learned? It sucks, it sucks, and it sucks? Yeah. here, let me recap. -not worth the money -CRAP durability -close to no features -quality is average Just to not make RIO not feel too bad about their products, i decided to say one positive thing about their crappy mp3 player. The installation package that comes with it is easy to use.   OK, so if you want more reasons to not get this, give me a call.

<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Rio Carbon back in January,2005.  Not wanting to be locked in to Itunes, I felt the Rio interface with my computer, and easy transfer of my wav. files on my hard drive to the Rio Carbon would be no problemo. Was I ever wrong!...here's the scenario: I am now on my fourth player.  Problems from buggy software,firmware,broken scroll wheel (twice)non-functioning menus, etc., hours spent with their tech people.....a friggin' nightmare.  Don't buy this piece of junk and save yourself much grief.

<Title> A Few Flaws
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Rio Carbon as a graduation gift and as soon as I got it I started downloading my whole CD collection on to it. For the first week and a half I loved it but, soon after fiddling around with it I noticed a few problems.        first, I noticed the battery power wasn't the 20 hours Rio claims. I'd say it holds more like 7-15 hours of battery life.       Second, it's shut off on me multiple times while  I was listening to music for no good reason. Of course it goes right back on when I press the on button. About an hour ago it shut off like I mentioned but, it won't turn back on. I'm worried. Luckily, I'm only 20 days into the 90 day warranty.       Third, I can't figure out how to delete songs. Maybe it's because I'm using Windows Media Player for all the songs that I copy to my carbon instead of the Rio Music Manager thing that comes with the carbon. The people at Rio had pre-downloaded 15 songs from bands I've never heard of, like the Phenomenauts. I hate those songs and they just take up memory space. If anyone knows how to delete songs please write in and tell me.       Fourth, the carbon only holds 4.64 GB of music than the 5 GB Rio claims. This is not major or anything but, I thought you'd like to know.        Lastly, sometimes while I'm listening to a song the carbon will just skip a word or two or mess them up like, in one of my songs it turns boulevard into blleevard. It gets annoying sometimes.         Other than that the Carbon is pretty much perfect. I'd reccomend buying it but, keep the receipt you'll need it if you want to use the warranty, which you might end up doing. I think I'm going to have to. I'm looking all over the place for the receipt.

<Title>Poor Quality Control - Don't Buy This Product
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Carbon clearly stands out as one of the best portable music players out there if you just go by specifications and looks.  It's got a sleek design, long battery life, lots of storage, and all in a very small and lightweight package.  It also comes with only a 90-day warranty, and you can probably guess why.  It's just a matter of "when" your unit dies, not "if".  Do a search on Google for "broken Rio Carbon".  Read the reviews here on Amazon.  The stories of failures are pretty consistent.  In my case, my unit worked for almost a year.  I had been traveling a lot and had decided to leave it at home one day.  It sat unused on my desk for about 3 weeks.  When I again turned it on, it displayed the message "Insufficient space for database creation."  That was it.  Nothing I did could bring it back.  All of the suggestions in the FAQ and from tech support failed.  The unit hadn't been abused, dropped or anything.  In fact, quite the opposite.  It had been sitting unused, undisturbed, and untouched for weeks prior to the failure.  When I began to search the Internet more carefully hoping to find a fix, I discovered the common stories of failures.  Bottom line, it's a sleek design, and one of the best units out there on paper, but stay away.  Larry

<Title>Think 2ce b-4 buying
<Date>Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great little MP3 player when it works.  Mine quit charging and I followed the online advice and pushed the reset button, now it doesn't work at all.  I have been going round and round w/ the company because it is out of warranty.  J&R music only has a 30 day wqarranty on mail orders, so I'm screwed both ways. To make it better they need to have a case with a clip or something so that you don't have to hold while your working out or running.  Also headphones do produce a lot of static.  I'm sure some people have had great success w/ this thing and will keep it for a couple of years, but not me, mine has died after 90+ days.  Maybee I can get it replaced, maybee not.  At least I still have my CD players.

<Title>Go with the Ipod
<Date>Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I thought I'd be different and go with this Rio Carbon. I debated between this and a mini Ipod but, it appealed to me because it was smaller and held one more gig. However it stopped working on me, within the 90 days, but because I was out of the country I could not ship it or have acess to my warranty so now I am out of luck and they are saying it costs $99 plus shipping to fix/replace. My advice, don't get it.

<Title>Awful, how do people get off calling this junk/iPod killer?
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Where do I begin? Firstly, the sound quality is inferior to that of the iPod. I used the same exact MP3s ripped from my CD collection for my iPod at 160kbs. The sound was radically inferior. I found part of the problem was the Rio earbuds, the iPod earbuds are far superior. I have a sneaking suspicion that RIO is aware of the inferiority of their product, for while Apple's iTunes defaults MP3's at 160 kbs, Rio's defaults its MP3 ripping and encoding at 200 kbs VBS!  This means that the 1GB more you get over the original iPod Mini is meaningless. The kicker: today my Rio broke after less than a months light use. Rio Support is a horrible. Res Ipsa. Or as my uncle used to say: "buy cheap, pay twice."

<Title>Great product, Great Price.  Buy it now.
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I won't bore you with specs, you can find those elsewhere on this page.  All you really need to know is that the Carbon's sound quality is great, its a full gig bigger than its primary competition, its battery life will get you to/from wherever you're going in the continental US (and perhaps beyond), its about the combined size and thickness of my (short and moderately stubby) ring, middle, and pointer fingers, its easy to synch and even easier to control play, and you won't need to become married to iTunes if you own it.    Oh, and since you're going to have to spend money on this, your decision should be made even easier when you learn that its a bargain compared to MP3 players with SMALLER hard drives (even when a rebate isn't available or its not on sale).  I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this product.   **The only reason for knocking one star off this product is the headphone connection glitch discussed in other reviewer commentaries.  Fortunately, Rio ships new units with an adapter that takes care of the problem.**

<Title>Nice small size, no good case, no folder navigation
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: The size is very very compact, easily fits even in jeans pockets. The sound quality is excellent. The headphones are great. The response time for navigation keys is excellent. No software required to only transfer files. So serves well as storage device.   Cons: 1. The supplied leather case hides the main navigation controls, and you have to pull it out of the leather case if you want to navigate. Currently, there is NO OTHER CASE available in the market !!        2. It is not possible to navigate by folders. You will have to tag all your music collection, and make playlists. Of course, playlists can only be made on the rio software !

<Title>I love this thing!
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I was first looking, I found an IPOD Mini for the same price as the Rio. I figured that the IPOD gets more press so I'd be better off with it. So I bought it, and then returned it a couple days later. The IPOD made a scratchy noise whenever I touched the wheel (which is not an unusual problem with them).   So, when I went back to the store, I got the Rio instead. Since I've had both, I was able to compare them. While they're pretty close, I think the Rio wins. I don't think there is any substantial difference between them in terms of the OS, except that you can't create playlists with the Rio (except on your computer).   I think in looks, the IPOD wins, but you can judge for yourself. The Rio is definitely much smaller, and fits better in your pocket. The extra gig of memory is nice on the Rio. I hated the super-short battery life of the IPOD, and the Rio's is 2-3 times longer. The case on the Rio sucks, but the IPOD doesn't have a case.   The Rio came with a free month of Audible.com, so I thought I'd take advantage of it. I've fallen in love with Audible, and I'm now on my third month.   Again, I'm glad I got the Rio instead of the IPOD. It wins in battery life, extra capacity, and size. I'd highly recommend it!

<Title>Very good even though mine stopped working after 3 months
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was using this as a backup to my 40G IPod, I have owned every generation of IPod and at the 20G+ range still believe the IPod to be the best purchase, especially for Apple users. However, I also use a Rio Cali flash player when I'm skating and am happy with it. So given the specs and price, I bought the Carbon. Sadly it broke after about 4 goes!  Points to note: It's only 5G now this might be enough for most people, but I have 2000+CD's and have transferred 100GB onto hard drive. My next purchase will be the 60G IPod!  It works with ITunes on the Mac, however, on the older Mac's only slow USB 1.1 available.  Interface is nice, but not as good as the IPod's Mini or 'Maxi'  Smaller than a mini IPod, and actually smaller than Rio Cali, though slightly heavier.  Doesn't support AAC, or Apple lossless, but does support WMA.  Radio, Voice Recorder all built in  Fantastic battery life  Cheap!  Looks good! maybe not as 'cool' as the 'mini' but still pretty good.  Headphone!!!! Like the IPod the 'phones are next to useless. So get something worth listening through. I use Etymotic's ER4's and ER6i's as backup (the ER6i's have a little more headroom than the ER6's). These are expensive and though the ER4 are amazing they are $300! (can be found for around $220) and approx $100 for the ER6's However, Sony funtopia's, Grado SR's are not too bad. Competitive with the Etymotics on noise isolation, the Shure's are also supposed to be very good.  So why 4 stars? as mine broke after a few uses. Well I also bought one in Jan for a friend of mine, who uses it every day when traveling and at home, and she's very happy with it! So it would have had 5 stars if mine had lasted, though I must admit I don't treat my players very well!

<Title>Poorly manufactured
<Date>Sun May 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased my Rio in February of 2005.  The general operation, downloading files, etc. was quite easy. The case makes it virtually impossible to operate because it covers all the menu buttons.  When I try to pull the player out of the case, I inevitably push on one of the buttons, disrupting playback. It also doesn't have any type of a clip. I accidentally dropped it on my lawn and broke the power button. I can still turn it on by pushing a pen into the hole where the button used to be and it works fine. I called the company and was told they would fix it for $149.00.  I then escalated my concern to a supervisor, who then told me he was having computer issues and would call me back in an hour. I never received a phone call. I called back the following day, and was kept on hold for 10 minutes, then it rang into someone's voice mail.  I did complete an automated quality survey (the company calls you back as soon as you hang up) and I expressed my disappointment. I was told that I would receive a call within one business day...I still haven't heard, almost a week later.  Buyer beware... the Rio is poor quality and poor customer service.  I would NEVER buy another one!

This lil device has a lot to offer that the ipod doesnt the battery life on the Rio lasts soo much longer than the ipod mini, less expensive and small enough to fit anywhere! i wouldnt want anything else!!

<Date>Thu Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this for approx $60 under retail (signing up for Amazon's Visa).  I've read many reviews stating this is not a durable item.  We are now about 30 days post ownership and I am very happy with my purchase.  I am not a kid, I treat my purchases well, meaning I don't throw the unit down on a desk and it's not apt to fall out of my backpack.  This is my 1st mp3 player, so I don't have alot to compare it to.  I will address some of the issues I've read.  The earpods shipped were high quality.  The static issues were resolved by the manufacturer.  The foam is a little large for my ears, but I had no problem with them exercising or just chilling out.  I did purchase a set of Sennheiser PX100 headphones, and this just made the player even better.   My MP3's are sampled at 128, and i find the player holds about 825 songs.  More than enough.  1st night of ownership I charged the battery, loaded the music (extremely easy with the included software) and let it play until I needed to sleep.  Music was still playing when I woke the next day, and I believe it was going for approx 15 hours.   The carrying case is solid.  I've read many complaints that it obstructs the ability to change the music.  This is very true, however I load the music I want to hear, so I don't have a problem with this.  The rigid construction allows you to put the player in your pants pocket and no activity I've done sends a false command.   I've read good and bad about customer service.  Fortuntely I haven't need to call them.    The last complaint I recall is an issue of fingerprints.  On day 1 I pealed the protective film off the front and back.  The back film is much larger than the front.  I traced a copy of the front cover onto paper, then cut the rear film with the trace.  The film reattaches by static, and now the front of the player is protected. (how many cell phones did I have to go through to learn this?)  All said I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  If you're a kid and have to have an Ipod to fit in with peers, don't bother.  If you're an adult and looking for a quality product, this is one.

<Title>Disappointing Customer Support
<Date>Sun Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>While the unit may play MP3 songs without any major problems, for anyone considering using it to play audiobooks, I would look elsewhere. The unit randomly freezes at the end of an audiobook and must be reset with a paper clip (I keep one in my pocket at all times now)to continue working. Sometimes that doesn't even work and must be reconnected to a computer to delete the audiobook before the unit will begin to operate again. Trying to get customer support to recognize the problem and provide a solution is a waste of time. They are more concerned with selling a product than supporting it. Last email indicated that a supervisor would contact me, and that was over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard anything since. Total lack of customer concern.

<Title>this device filled a void in my life
<Date>Thu Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i think that rio really nailed it this time with a device that is in my opinion, better than the ipod mini in every way.  compared to the apple ipod mini, the rio carbon is smaller, lighter, has more space, more battery life, and is more stylish.  i've had and loved my rio karma for months, but my problem with it was that it wasn't very pocketable and i couldn't always have it with me wherever i go.  when i first read about the rio carbon i knew it was exactly what i needed.  it had plenty of space to hold the albums that i need, way more than enough battery life, plus, it can easily slip into my pocket.  the carbon has the ability to drag and drop files as an external hard drive - a feature absent on the karma.  this can be very useful, especially since i don't need to use software to transfer music and files to the device, even though i can.  i appreciate that the carbon came with a case for it, but it's extremely tight and doesn't allow access to the buttons or screen, so it's more for protection.  there are tons of other great features, but my favorite thing is the external design: it fits in my hand perfectly, all of the controls are well-placed, it slides perfectly into any pocket, and it's extremely sleek looking (the way the backlight lights up and then fades out is beautiful).  ipod mini's are good looking too, but they seem to appeal to kids, teens, and women, while the carbon has a very bold and fashionable style that i think would appeal more to men.  people keep asking my for my karma since i now have the carbon, but i'm still keeping the karma for my home stereo and for long trips.  i couldn't be happier with this little carbon, i suggest that you at least go to a local electronics store to see one and feel one in person because i don't think you'll be able to resist buying it.

<Title>The Carbon Delivers.
<Date>Fri Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a beautifully designed and well thought out high-performance player. It has the feel of a precision instrument, and it delivers. The sound far surpasses any mp3 i've owned in the past; it has rich base, clear highs, and full mids. I was thrilled at the range of the equalizer, you'll be able to customize your sound to a VERY wide degree. It's a breeze to organize your music; actually, this player does it automatically, it's amazing! Just plug it into a USB port and it appears as a hard drive (no software needed!) then drag and drop individual songs, music folders, anything, the player then scans the ID3 tags of the mp3's and presents you with an organized, versatile interface, allowing you to choose album, artist, genre, track, year and more. I won't cover the whole user interface here but trust me, it's fantastic! If your mp3's are all over your hard drive in a disorganized mess, as long as the ID3 tags are intact, just dump them onto this player and they're instantly and perfectly organized! If you don't think anything can beat the ipod mini, think again. This player is more stylish (a matter of taste but I think so), has 1 gig more storage, 20 hours of battery life vs. the ipod mini's 8, is lighter, smaller AND has BETTER SOUND (it's true). If you want status, get the ipod mini, if you want style, status and performance, get the Carbon. I'm not kidding, it's better.

<Date>Fri Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow! I picked this up at my local Best Buy. I didn't think they were in stock. I heard about this player on sites like riovolution.com and Cnet, and the reviews seemed very good. So I ran every red light to get to my bank and get the money and come back to purchase it. It looks big in pictures but so do all other players! This thing is really small and sleek and thin. Its main competitor, the Apple iPod Mini, doesn't come within sniffing distance! What would you choose?  20-25 hour battery life vs. 6-8 Hour battery life Amazing sound vs. Decent sound quality 5 Band Equalizer vs. No equalizer 5GB vs. 4GB $250 vs. $250 Voice Recording Capability vs. No Voice Recording Capability  If you chose the options on the left, you chose the Carbon! There is no comparison. The sound quality is incredible and it looks really nice. The red backlit Buttons and Rio Logo look really cool, and the white backlight fades out and that gives it a nice touch. Plus drag-and-drop file adding is easy and quick. Some iPod users may brag about how the iPod has the seamless integration of iTunes... well so does the Carbon! Not only iTunes, but alos WMP 10 and RMM. I think this mp3 player is the best in its catergory and among the best overall. Forget about the iPod in this case. At $50 cheaper you can't go wrong. $249 vs $199? Extra gigabyte? Bonus voice recorder? 12 extra hours of battery life? Smaller size? Better sound quality(fact, not opinion, since Signal-to-Noise ratio is better with the Carbon plus it has a 5 band custom EQ unlike the mini)? Graphic 5 Band EQ vs. Preset 2 Band Bass/Treble EQ? iPod mini should just plead no contest to its inferiority to the Carbon.

<Content>Just got the product...what can I say?  It looks great. The battery life seems to be less than advertised but it still blows away the iPod Mini.  The sound quality is really good, even with the headphones that came in the package.  The features I really dig are: drag & drop files to/from Windows and the ability to charge the player through the USB cable. Also, it hasn't skipped the two times I took it to the gym. Rio really hit this one out of the park.  My recommendation: if you care about sound quality, don't want to be chained to iTunes, and don't care for those trendy white players, then this is the only choice.

<Title>4 Stars is my new rating. Extended Warr is a must.
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got mine a couple of days ago. Update on new player at the end of my review. And yes it does have a lock feature. Some people posted earlier that it does not have one. If they care to read the provided leaflet, it says in there how to use it.  Appearance = A+ Player looks great, sleek and sturdy construction. Display lights are very cool. The design seems to be more ergonomic than the ipod mini to me. It just fits better in your hands and your pocket. One thing i would like to clarify, if you are someone who examines the player with a fine tooth comb, you will find that on some units the construction may not be as tight around the edges, but it really does not matter. Look closely and you will see the display lights shine though the edges on the top of the player.  Battery = Seems to be great. I will post the exact life once ive had a chance to run it at lenght.  Ease of Use = Couldn't be more idiot proof. Right out of the box i plugged it into my pc without loading the Rio software and my pc read it as a mass storage device and i was able to drag n drop files to it.  The only catch is that if you want to delete tracks, create playlists or organize your music by category, you will need to load the Rio software which comes with it. The software is very easy to use.   Headphones = As expected, bundeled headsets are rarely good. The sound is average and the fit is uncomfortable. You will want to chuck em and get some sound isolating phones.  Storage = You get about 4.6 gigs of free space on the unit to load your tunes. approx 0.4 is used up by the menus and the software apps needed to run it. In the end this still works out to about a gig more than the ipod mini which is right at 3.5 - 3.6 gig free space.  Bit rate = Ive loaded mine at 128 WMA instead of MP3 since WMA has a better compression rate. ie you have more space to use without losing quality. I compared loading a rock track at 192 and then at 128 and you really cannot tell the difference. The difference would probably be clear if you are listening to instrumental music.  On the box = Rio Carbon states 2500 songs. Its an eye catcher, beware that you will probably get close to about 1000 songs before you fill it up. I have half a gig filled up on it and i was able to get about 95 tracks on it. Although the box says 2500 songs in large print, the fine print says @ 64 k/bits which is basically crap quality.  Handy features left out = No FM radio. No armband available yet!!  Sounds great so why the TWO Star rating ?????????????????????? Well !! My player will not boot up after just two days of use. I noticed that the player heated up during charging so my guess is that the internal power supply/battery was the problem. Ive tried everything even the main reset switch but it won't start up. I don't want to deal with Rio just yet so ill be taking it back to the store and try to get a new unit to see if i have better luck with that. I will post updates on the new replacement unit. My strong advice - BUY AN EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN.  UPDATE - Got my replacment player. Had it for a week now. 1 gig of music loaded and no problems at all.

<Title>Carbon battery life
<Date>Thu Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had the Rio Carbon for 3 days.  The battery life doesn't seem to be more than 10 hours at most.  But this could be because I've set the equalizer to something other than the pre-set options.  The sound from the pre-set options seems very weak to me, especially the bass.  I may return it if I end up concluding the battery is defective.  The advertised 20-hour battery life was a big selling point for me.  Otherwise, I like pretty much everything else about it, especially the small size and big storage capacity.  I have had a little trouble creating playlists, but I'll figure it out.

In terms of design, it look cute and fit well on my palm. Minimal buttons ensure ease of use, but an extra "HOLD" or "LOCK" button would be a nice addition. The screen is crisp and bright but could be a tad bigger for people with poor eyesight. The logo lits up in red which is pretty cool. The control bottons are little "clickish" when you trying to push them real fast when scrolling down the menu.  Now the firmware, I am talking about the program the runs the device. The control is a little annonying, it seems like I have to jumping alot from menu to menu just to accomplish something. And everytime I disconnect the device from USB, it automatically switches on and assume I wanna use it right away. It could also use more equalizer set up, and the differences in very subtle between different equalizer selections. Since it is firmware, good news is it can be updated in the future.  In conclusion, it is a very good MP3 player if you like music all the time and on the move a lot. Player size and storage ratio is the best compare to most players out there. It gets 3.5 stars for some of the minor problems and for being a bit pricey.  This is an update : My device won't turn on after 29 days, thanks god I can still return it to the store. I don't know what's wrong it. But I refuse to exchange for another one and I think I am just going to wait and see.

<Title>Even with minor flaws, the BEST of its kind!

<Content>Let me get the negatives out of the way first....  1) You really need to buy a 2-year buyer protection plan as you only get a 90 day warranty from Rio.   2) The pleather case covers up the display screen and player buttons. It's only apparent purpose is to protect the unit while in transit.  3) Lots of talk about static experienced with certain headphones. NOT TO WORRY. This is only happening with cans that have 1/4 inch metal bases on their jacks (not with the more popular earbuds), and is easily remedied with electrical tape or nail polish.  Now the GOOD stuff.....  1. It's BEAUTIFUL and SMALL. You'll be happy and proud to take it anywhere. Just don't get caught using it too much at work!  2. It's EASY TO USE. The menu and navigation system is very intuitive, and the controls are ergonomically located on the device for righthanders.   3. It's FLEXIBLE. The Carbon works without the included software, and interfaces with any of the music players or sites except I-Tunes. It even works with Audible, the popular Audiobooks service, and the package includes a 30-day free trial to Audible. By the way, you'll want to use the included Rio Music Manager software anyway, because it's so easy and synchs well with the player.  4. It has PLENTIFUL STORAGE. I honestly don't know why MP3 player owners want to load 1,000+ complete CDs anyway. All I use it for is to load my favorite tracks among my 150 CD collection, and download selected songs which I like and aren't on one of my CDs. I transfer music at 192 kbps, using WMA. Still, there is room for over 700 tracks! This means well over 1,000 songs if you record at the more common 128 kbps and even more at 64kb WMA. It's also compatible with the MP3 format.  5. It includes a VOICE RECORDER. Nice for recording your thoughts and ideas at any time of the day.  6. It's the NEWEST GADGET out there. There are risks to buying something so new, such as reliability. But for "cool factor", it can't be beat.  Apple is finally getting some serious competition, because I think the Rio Carbon, overall, is BETTER than its Apple counterpart, the I-Pod Mini. Oh, and did I mention the battery life? You won't be disappointed.
