<Title>Best of the breed

<Content>This player is sweet.  When all you want is to listen to your favorite music this is the player.  Plays music that you choose without any frills.  The quality of the sound is superb. Download is a cinch.  The size is unbelievable so you can jog or exercise without feeling any straps or bands. Doubles as a disk-on-key so just as easily you can transfer those other files.

<Title>Weak and outdated

<Content>This is Creative's attempt to capitalize on the success of Apple's Ipod Shuffle by producing a flash mp3 player with no display. This is basically the original Nomad MuVo, and two years ago when I reviewed that same product I gave it a great review.  But that was two years ago, and an mp3 player without a display just doesn't cut it today.  If you want a no thrills mp3 player for exercise, buy the original Nomad Muvo, which you can find brand new for about $15. If you're thinking of getting this, go ahead and spend the nominal extra cost to get the Nomad Muvo TX FM, which includes a display for just a few dollars more.  One advantage of this is that it is easy to use.  No software is required, just plug in the usb key to a computer and copy your music.  You'll have to rename some of your files though to get it to play in the order you want to.  Battery life is around 18 hours on 1 AAA battery, which is pretty good.    The iPod Shuffle is successful because of marketing, not because anyone really wants an mp3 player without a display.

<Content>Este reproductor de mp3 es muy bueno si lo que te interesa es tener memoria disponible y ejercitarte.  El precio es bastante accesible y definitivamente es mas fuerte que el Ipod shuffle.  Milward (Panama, Central America)

<Title>Solid, Simple

<Content>I wanted a no nonsense MP3 player to listen to while working outside.  This unit stores about 4 hours worth of songs.  It is simple, easy to use, and sounds good.  It works great for me.  Don't get this one if you want anything fancy.  This is a bare-bones player.

<Content>Got this one for my grandson then had to buy one for myself, too.  It's great to have lived long enough to see big boom boxes transformed into little bitty things like this.  Easy to load and use.  Mine has the radio function and only half the MB, his has no radio.  Haven't had much luck with the radio.  It seems like the battery runs down real fast but you only have to have one AAA.  The only thing I didn't like was the ear buds, they fall out too easy.  I had to replace them with something on a headband.  Both Muvo's are still going strong after many months of use.  Grandson's has been dropped repeatedly.  Before this he had a Sandisk and it broke right away.
