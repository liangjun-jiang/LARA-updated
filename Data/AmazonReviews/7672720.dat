<Title>Worth Its Penny

<Content>With all the rave over Apple's iPod line and Microsoft's latest Zune (and every other competing big-name joining the music trend), few and far between are the daring consumers who choose to enjoy the lower-priced underdogs as the not-so-popular COBY. After owning mine for about two months now, I can say that I'm pretty darn satisfied with this product. Minus the minor delays (or freezes) every so often, it's a great buy for the price. The sound quality is pretty remarkable (depending also on brand of earphones used, mine are Phillips athletic earbuds, a highly recommended partner to accompany this device). Picture quality isn't bad, either. Another major aspect that shifted my decision to go with COBY rather than Apple (besides the incredible price for, basically, the same product minus the glamour and popularity) was the larger screen size. Apple's iPod proper has a wider screen display, albeit shorter height. Nano's screen is significantly smaller in comparison to COBY's 1.66" LCD color display. Additionally, COBY packs like a Swiss Army Knife. Whether studenting or traveling, the device comes equipped with everything the active buyer needs. The device features an FM radio, voice recorder, e-Book capability, video player, and of course, digital audio player.   My only qualm with COBY is the device's not-so-frequent, but irritating  glitches. I've had to reset my device several times, and reformat it twice. On more than one occasion, (formally well-functioning) files became inexplicably encrypted and were no longer identifiable by my PC. I could neither locate the files on the device, nor add new ones (via computer only; the files were present on the player, and played normally, but would not show themselves when explored through a PC).   If you're willing to accept the small risk for a great player at an incredible price, I strongly recommend purchasing the Coby MP-C7085 MP3 Player. It may not have the celebrity of it's ipop-counterpart, but this inexspensive little gadget is well worth its penny.

<Title>A decent mp3 player, but not worth the price

<Content>Maybe I'm a bit bias because this is my first mp3 player, ipod look alike. But after I received the product, all I can said is that I'm glad I didn't paid full price for it. The instruction is not very intuiative and the touch pad is not friendly. The reason I took a chance was because I couldn't find any reviews for this mp3. Save your money and buy a cheaper, different brand with the same memory.  Pros:  slim, light and small. Looks like a nano ipod. The dashboard light is bright.  Cons:  device charges via usb, not AC cable charger. Works only with windown media player 10 software. Cannot create song playlist in the device. All the songs will play in the order you sync. Touch pad needs to get use to or have the right touch. Too hard or too soft won't work. Radio is useless and don't work. Earplug is very uncomfortable and too big. The directory listing in the device is only for show to take space.  I had the device for almost a month now and so far, it is still working. Though, I haven't used it much. I haven't try the recorder and import ebook yet. Not sure about displaying pictures either. The device claims to be able to contain up to 250 songs, I only have 50 songs in mine and took half of the 1 GB memory already. So there you have it.

<Content>It took me forever to get the product now the product dont even work. So I have to send it back before I can get credit or have to buy another one from another vendor. This vendor could care less, didn't even offer to replace it. This was a xmas present for my daughter!!!!! I am very upset about the service and the no care altitude!!
