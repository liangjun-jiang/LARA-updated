<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

<Title>Simply Brilliant
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

<Title>Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

<Title>Amizing, but soo weak and vulnerable
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loved this ipod soooo0o0o much. it was amazing in every possible way. that was until i went to whipe the fingerprints off with my shirt. MY SHIRT SCRATCHED HTE SURFACE!! The finish on this ipod is so soft that clothing will scratch it. and then i jsut thought, "screw it, it'll jsut be scratched up" but then after jstu a normal day at school ,being very cautious with it, the screen cracked. i have no i dea how. the screen is sooo0o0o weak.  In conclusion, this is an amazing product, so by all means buy it. But pleeasseeeee buy a very strong case for it. and keep the p[lastic film 0o0n the surface when it comes!

<Title>not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

<Title>THE biggest revolution
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

<Content>any other mp3 player beside's apple's ipod line costs less. also the battery life is short, but not a big deal. and to people who can't figure out itunes store and how to disconnect, you don't deserve to own this or a computer if you can't use it!!!! i figured it out in about a minute. to disconnect, go under my computer, select "e" or whatever your usb port's labeled, and eject.

<Content>Now i didn't buy my nano from amazon but i did get the replasment scren off amazon... but anyway the ipod nano black 1st gen is really cool if you dont care about scraches and such. it looks cool becues of its shape and the point that it dosent look like a ipod mini. it also fits in your poket smother than a 2nd gen ipod nano... it also is easyer to fix on yor own. and hase cooler addons than the 2nd gen nano. so ya make shure you think about what you want to do befor buying this.
