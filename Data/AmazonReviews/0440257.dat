<Title>Wouldn't Recommend.
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Mp3 player as something cheap to use while skiing so I wouldn't have to use my expensive one and risk breaking it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody. 256MB is only about 50 songs, which you have to scroll through yourself. There is no menu to find certain songs you want to listen to. After a few weeks, mine started speaking giberish. If I went to the menu, it would look something like SJ#$#@^%(JFS. The battery time is only a few hours, and the USB connection is something I've never seen before. If you lose the cable, as I did, somehow, then there's no way to use it again. I've been trying to look online for something similar to it but I just can't find one.

<Title>At last, a published opinion!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted an inexpensive mp3 player, and this was on sale.  I combed the internet looking for reviews to see if it was worth paying even the sale price.  I found only one review that said, essentially, "eh, it's OK, I guess."  Well, it's not.  Whenever the backlit dsplay shuts off, there is static interference, like bad AM radio reception.  I could turn up the volume to drown it out, but should I have to?  I may have recieved a defective unit, but why chance it when there are so many others to choose from?

<Title>For the younger kids, maybe.
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got one for my 8 year old and my 13 year old.  I notice that my 13 year old is stopping at the end of certain songs, it wont go to the next song, and freezes up.  She can't do anything but take the battery out and restart it.  Also for some unknown reason it was making this loud squeeking noise. I notice when my son turned his on sometimes it only display half of the work COBY. I figure something at the low cost would be good for the kids but it seems to be giving them problems and they haven't dropped it or anything.  They may have only had it for 4 days. Maybe I should had invested in a better quality mp3 player.

<Title>Great Buy!!
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this little MP3 player.  It was all that I was looking for in an MP3 player and it was inexpensive compared to other players like it.  It has nice features and design.  The battery life is great and only needs one AAA.  The only downside is that I'm afriad it might break the first time I drop it.  It just doesn't feel very durable.

<Title>Great little device
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say I do not work for Coby. I purchased this MP3 player a month ago. Im new to the whole MP3 sceen. But as far as I'm concerned its a great little device. Its easy to download to just hook it up and go. Its straight forward as far as navigating thru the system (menu, eq, fm, record, set up). If I was hard pressed to find a complaint it would be the headphones their a little cheap. But other than that Im happy with my purchase.

<Title>Save Your Money
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Thought it was a great deal.  It looked decent and I was able to download music okay.  The only thing is that it is always freezing up and then won't even turn off.  I keep having to remove the battery to restart it.  Don't bother with this piece of junk!!!

<Title>Coby MP3 Player # MP-C641
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was pleased with the appearance of the player and how easy it was to load songs. But AFTER 20 MINUTES OF USE, IT BROKE. After pushing in the menu button to make a different selection, the button stuck in and wouldn't come out. The music stopped and a weird noise came thru the head phones. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT !!!

<Title>Coby MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What do you want an MP3 player for?  To listen to music, right?  Well, this little unit does just that and more.  The earphones were a little uncomfortable, so I bought a set of Skull Candy earphones with an inline volume control for $10 and I'm set.  The nice thing about this unit is that it takes an SD memory card, so you can upgrade from the 256MB it comes with.  And although it's advertised that you can upgrade up to 768MB by adding a 512MB SD card, I found that you can add a 1GB card and get even more songs on it.  It has a voice record function, so you can dictate notes to yourself.  A nice feature, but who buys an MP3 player for that, anyway?  For the price, this little player beats a lot of more expensive ones just because a lot of them don't have the capability to expand memory.

<Title>Big Bang and a surprise
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it to use for mp3 to replace a CD player for the road. Tried it to record my band and after finding the right settings, this thing is a great little recorder. I can record gigs, no gear to mess with and download it to my computer, burn CD's, etc. Tried other brands and they cant even come close as recorders. Cant beat it for the bucks, and sounds better than the CD player it replaced, too. Only complaint is the ear buds were HUGE!

<Content>this mp3 player seems to hold together pretty well. some of the controls are a little strange though. sound quality is good and a little loud so it uses batteries  quicker.
