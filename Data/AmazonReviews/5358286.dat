<Title>Easy to use, inexpensive, and decent features.

<Content>I've been happy with my Lexar Media Jumpdrive. As a USB flash drive that will store any files you drop on it, as well as play about 2 hours of audio in MP3 and WMA format.<p>Transfering music is as easy as plugging it in.  It is automatically picked up by the operating system as a removable drive - no drivers, no CD, works on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, you name it.<p>The case is durable and fits in my hand well, but could be a bit more substancial.  Navigation is fairly intuitive with one joystick that controls all functions.<p>Sound quality is great... I can't complain about the earbud headphones that it comes with.  The backlit screen is easy on the eyes and battery life is pretty decent off of 1 AAA battery (included).<p>Room for improvement: I'd love a belt clip... the lanyard doesn't do much for me when working out.

<Title>Overall great inexpensive MP3 player - USB drive!

<Content>If you're looking for an inexpensive USB drive for storing and transferring files (either music on other types of files), but would also like a portable MP3 player that plays both MP3 and the superior Window Media Audio (WMA) format, this is a great buy!  The menu options of the audio player includes:  Equalizer: (can choose from the following pre-programmed settings: Normal, Rock, Jazz, Classical, Pop, Boom).  Play mode: Normal, Repeat Track, Repeat All, Shuffle, and Shuffle Repeat.  Lockable buttons (have to enter a random set of displayed keys to unlock).  Option to have backlight ON or OFF (power saver).  Contrast: Can change to lighter or darker.  Power saver: Can set the unit to turn off after 1/2/5/10/30 minutes of inactivity, or can be disabled. -------------------- You can use a media player that can recognize a portable media player to transfer the music files, or you can simply copy the files onto the Jumpdrive audio player.  (I use Windows XP with Windows Media player 10).  The battery life is rated at 6 hours for alkaline, and I got at least that.  (I usually use rechargeable batteries that are cheaper to use!)  One of the minor drawbacks of the player: if you are in the middle of a list of songs that you are listening to and the unit is turned off, it will not remember where you left off and will start from the beginning.  I use a nicer set of headphone compared to what comes with the player, and the sound quality rivals a nice CD player.  This depends of course upon the sampling quality of the file being listened to.  For the price, you can't beat it!

<Content>I got my JumpDrive Music a few days ago and really enjoy it.   Within ten minutes of taking it out of the packaging, I had songs downloaded onto it.   I couldn't find another product similar to this.  I wanted a USB jump drive and an mp3 player all-in-one, and all I could find was one without the other. I mainly use the JumpDrive Music while on the treadmill, but I have also found myself needing something quick and easy for transferring large files via sneakernet.  This thing is easy to use and I think the quality is great.  I should have bought one of these a long time ago.  And the price was great, too.  Drawbacks- The body is wider than most of your other jump drives, so if you have a recessed USB port on your computer, you'll have to use the USB extension cord that comes with it in order to reach it.  That's not too bad, but it does take away from the convenience of it.  I give the belt clip issue another vote.  I'm planning on looking for maybe a cell phone belt pouch that it will fit in.  Overall, if anything happened to this one and there was nothing new and comparable on the market, I would buy this one again.
