<Title>Fantastic Music Player
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great Music player.  I have had mine for two months, and I must tell you that this device is small, very thin (candy bar thin) and has a lot of memory space.  I put the micro memory 2gig chip in, and have 6 gig device.   Very roomy.    Lets face it, you can't beat the price.  As far as being rugged, I have dropped it several times, and have had no issues with it.  I think it is worth every penny.  Some techical notes:  In Windows Media Player, this music player will sync automatically.  What is reallly cool, you just drag and drop the songs you want into the sync window in WMP and click SYNC.  Easy.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE CRAPPY SOFTWARE!!  Have fun

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first mp3 player and I love it.  The sound is very clear and the storage space is more than ample for the money.  If you only want this for music it can store nearly 1000 songs!  I'm not even sure I know that many!  I enjoy the fact that it charges from any pc via USB.  I read a review saying that the songs are only played in alphabetical order.  Not true.  All you have to do is push the menu button, cycle to the music library icon and select it, push "right" on the wheel, cycle to the artist name, push "down" on the wheel, cycle to the album you would like to listen to and push play.  That's all you have to do.  I would definitely recommend this product.

<Content>It was awesome to watch videos and stuff, the headphones that came with it sucked, syncing was easy with Windows Media Player, had great battery life, but the screen was too exposed and the scrolling wheel was a pain. I used it until the screen on it cracked and I got a Zune 30 GB

<Title>Groovin' Gizmo
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my insignia 4 gb last year and I am pleased with its overall performance. I like how the controls aren't membrane based and I can feel a positive mechanical reaction when I'm selecting functions and songs on the device. The screen quality is pretty good for the videos loaded on it (faves are The Pink Spiders' "Little Razorblade" and Platinum Weird's "Will You Be Around?") However, I use it for the audio music. The songs transfer over just fine via the Windows Media Player (don't bother with the Rhapsody software if you don't have to). As for protecting the screen, I just use the clear vinyl skin that came with it. Plus, if I want to take it with me on a walk or something, I just use a cell phone holster I got at the mall for $9. I am an avid audiophile and need my tunes on a regular basis. The only thing I can't figure out is how to make the custom playlists. I tried it with the Rhapsody software, but it kept screwing up the order. Other than the gripe about the software, the device itself is a sturdy, well executed player.

<Title>THE most durable little piece of electronica I've ever owned
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok, so I've dropped my Nintendo DS (original) like a hundred times, and the darn thing's like a rock. Same thing with my Olympus Stylus. Even my laptop.  But NONE of them have ever survived a trip through the laundry.  My dh is often rather careless with things, and tends to forget to empty his pockets before washing his clothes. And one day, he forgot to empty my brand-spanking-new Insignia mp3 player out of his khakis. Sure enough that means it went through the full washing experience--hot water, detergent, and extreme heat and fumes from the dryer. That evening as I emptied out the dryer, I found my poor little mp3 player. At first I couldnt find the backing or the battery. But I was SOOO upset. The next morning, out of some inexplicable childish hope, I returned to the drier to search for the battery. I found it and the backing. Thinking that it wouldn't hurt to try, I went ahead and popped in the battery. I held my breath, hit the power button--  And nearly crapped a brick.  IT WORKED! Water, detergent, heat, fumes, and IT STILL WORKED!!! Not even a cracked screen! The ONLY thing that happened was one song got deleted. One.  So. Yeah. I love my little insignia.

<Title>misleading
<Date>Fri May 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to get a cheap flash based MP3 that would work for a Mac. I found the insignia 2gb MP3/Video player and it stated it was compatible with iTunes... GREAT i though. It was no problem at all getting the MP3's on the player as all you need to do is click and drag, also the same with pictures.... so far no problem. Now in order to play a movie on this thing you MUST have a windows computer so you can download the converter, take a hour to get it in the right format and then download it to the player. Now this isnt that bad if you have access to a windows computer but if you do not and playing videos is a big reason you are buying, I would suggest looking at something else. Besides that I would have to say its a great product would recommend it to anyone with a Windows computer  ***UPDATE*** The screens crack easy beware- also if you follow the comments on this review you will see someone much smarter than me found a way to convert the videos from a mac to play on the mp3 player****

<Title>Super audio and video player!
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is one of the best you can get for the money.  Videos look great on its larger than average screen, and the screen has the correct aspect ratio instead of being square.  It will play standard Windows Media Video files (WMV) that can be created by almost any video editing programs.  It includes a very good converter with it that will do the job also.  It plays standard MP3 or WMA files and these sound fabulous.  Windows Media Player works with it well and will download files, playlists, and cover art for you very easily.    The battery lasts a long time on a charge and is replaceable if it should ever go bad.  The FM radio in it works great, and the player has an audio line input so you can record directly from a turntable, tape player, CD player, etc.  It comes in a 2MB and 4MB version.  This is a lot of memory, but if you need more it also accepts the micro SD card so its storage capacity is virtually unlimited.  I've seen a lot of these players, and this is one of the best.  Oh, and I did mention how great that video screen looks, didn't I?

<Title>Does NOT work with Mac!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Mac users - run away now! Although this player is labeled as Mac-compatible, you'll find that you can't actually add content, listen to your MP3s, or add video. So if you call and ask their tech support just HOW the thing is Mac-compatible, they tell you that you can use it as a flash drive. A big, expensive flash drive. RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Buyer beware!!
<Date>Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The audio quality and technical operation of this unit are fairly good; however, the design of this unit is lacking.  The display is large (good) but not well protected (bad).  Apparently the slightest impact or pressure to the screen will cause it to break.  Mine was in working order when I put it in my front jeans pocket and drove to the gym.  When I got there I found the screen cracked and unreadable.  Calls to Insignia customer service resulted in a "case number" and referral to the local "Geek Squad" for further assistance.  At the Geek Squad counter I was told that the broken screen was not covered by the warranty and that there was nothing that could be done to repair the unit.  A follow up call with Insignia revealed that they always refer customers to Geek Squad with a case number, even if they know the issue will not be covered by the warranty.  A beautiful example of pass the buck (i.e. thanks for your money, now please go away.)  Needless to say, BUYER BEWARE!  As for me and my house, we'll never purchase items from this manufacturer again.

<Title>My take on this
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: Easy to use. Has numerous features (ie: photo, video, fm, & etc.) Expandable memory. Has dual headphone port. Can Sync with WinMed without using software CD.  Con: Plays only in alphabetical order (if random is not used). Headphones suck as most of the MP3 players. Only comes with a USB link charger.

<Title>this thing is great for the money - *3.5*
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i bought this for my gf last xmas, and for $150 + $20 for the 2-year warrantee, it's pretty good. i'm not a mac user, so i can't comment on those reviews, but this thing has been with us to costa rica, on the beach, in the sauna, at the gym, jogging, hiking, my pockets, in the dog's mouth, it's been sat on, and the screen is well intact. i do have other problems with it, but i'm ok with them, cuz i have the warrantee. it doesn't allow me to sort & play in the order i like- if i choose to play an album or an artist- it's (mostly) in alphabetical/choronological order- but some mixed cds with track #s get mixed up for some reason. also, for certain tracks, the timeline is incorrect- like, it'll already be @ the end @ 2m 41s, but it's a 5-minute song. also, it shuts off randomly, but i think that started happening after my gf took it to the sauna numerous times. when i first bought this, it was awesome for the price range. i recently saw a decent review on it on WIRED magazine. i think it's off the market now, so i can exchange it for the new & improved SPORT version. for free!!

<Title>Great Quality for the price
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great buy. I love the Aduio and Video Quality, crisp video. IT holds photos. The FM-Tuner I think is an added bonus, also you can record from the Tuner as well as have a line input that allows you to record from other sources such as a CD player, Cassette, MIC, Stereo, or any audio input that you can connect to your line input. I highly recommend this Item. Prior to this Item I have a IPOD Shuffle. This Item offers a whole lot more without giving you a bulky item, it is very light weight and compact, and the screen is not square but rectangular that gives you a great view of your video.

<Title>lots of bang for the buck
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd been looking to get an mp3 player that was cheap (but didn't seem cheap) for quite some time.  I did a lot of research on budget players with ample space and I came across this browsing the best buy site and decided to check it out.  I saw the 4gb model on here for under 50 bucks, so figured why not.  And, I'm highly impressed.  So far, I've uploaded my entire cd collection, downloaded a bunch of other songs, got the free audio book, and have one movie on it, and I've still got more than half of my original space left.  I love this little player.  Some complained about bulk and sound.  I don't find this player bulky at all.  No, it's not as thin as some of the models out there, but it's easily pocketable, and far more sturdy for the extra thickness (I've already dropped it several times).  And the sound quality is great (I'd just upgrade from the included earphones).  Great product overall.  My only complaints; the wheel does go opposite to how you think it would, which takes some getting used to, and you can only hold the player/view the menu horizontally, which isn't always necessary unless viewing a movie.  But I'm nitpicking.  I just love this player.  And of course it does have the sd slot as well for extra memory, so, even better.  Great player, great quality, great price.
