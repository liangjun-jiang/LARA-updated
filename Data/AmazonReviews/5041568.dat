<Content>I bought this little mp3 player from my local department store on sale for $30 and after an extra discount I walked out of the store only paying $25 and some odd change for it.  It is fairly easy to hook up and download music once you get past the vague instructions included with it.  It actually is a pretty nice sounding unit for the price, as it surprised me and surpassed my expectations on a much lower priced mp3 player.  The blue backlit lcd screen is pretty cool and easy to read without too much glare. The preset equalizer is okay and is like the standard preset equalizers that you get on some portable boomboxes. Another nice feature is the dual mini 1/8 headphone jacks so that you can share the music with a friend which makes this the perfect first mp3 player for your kids! This player claims 15 hours battery life on the rechargeable battery.  Well I have to wait and see on that one!   Overall a nice unit for a cheap price but it is no Ipod.  Good for the beginner wanting to get a feel for an mp3 player before dishing out the $200 + on an Ipod Nano or regular Ipod.  PROS:  Nice small compact size, dual headphone jacks, cool blue backlit lcd display, value priced, decent sound.  CONS:  No ac adaptor included (available extra from the GPX website at $15.00 + shipping) so you have to charge the player hooked up to your usb port while the computer is on (about 3 hours to charge), mediocre ear buds (I am not a fan of ear buds as I prefer regular headphones), vague instructions for downloading mp3s to the player, especially for someone unfamilar with the Windows Media Player interface.  
<Overall>4
