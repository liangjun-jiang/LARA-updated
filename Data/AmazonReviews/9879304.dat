<Title>Great Little Player For The Price
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking to get an Ipod or a comparable device for music.  I live in LA and the radio here SUCKS!!!! I needed some music for my workout and in a device that isn't bulky like a CD player. The Sony Network Walkman works great!  I love the sound and it is very lightweight.  I didn't buy an Ipod for another $100 simply because I don't believe I need 5,000 or even 1,000 songs.  170 songs is more than sufficient for me, thank you.  This is a great deal for a great price.

<Title>Worse piece of crap you could buy

<Content>This product will not let you drag and drop mp3 files into the mp3 player like every other mp3 player on the planet. It makes you convert your mp3 using their software to do it. Most of my mp3 library will not transfer over. I bought a Scandisk and every file went in with no problem and plays great. Sony if you were trying to make a product that sucks, well you succeeded.

<Content>I received this as a gift and am very happy with it. As far as not having a drag and drop feature . . . it's not a big deal. The software was very easy to use, even for a novice like me. I would recommend this player.

<Title>pretty Crappy considering the price

<Content>I have it, but thank gosh I didn't buy this little thing. The Sony walkman NW-S23 was my first mp3 player and I truly loved it until I got my ipod nano.   Lets start out with the good,  1.)NW-23 is extremely durable. I have dropped this little mp3 player 600,000 thousands of times, but yet it stills persevere and works fantastically like new.  2.) Great sound. 3.) Extremely easy to use. It is just a matter of creating folders and then dropping it into the file manager.  4.) easy grip for running and small   This thing has major CONS:   1.) TOO Expensive, How can it be $20 cheaper than an 1 gig ipod nano ($149.99), when it has limited features compared to the nano.   2.) Screen is too small and not very attractive  3.) Extremely limited features for the price. It should have more features for the price, possiblly having a recording or radio features.   4.) Ugly has heck.   The description of the sony NW-s23 is correct and it does perform its function fairly well. However considering the price, it's not worth buying.   If you need to listen to music while doing some crazy stunt, this is a good mp3 player for you because it is extremely durable. For the rest of us, It just too expensive. It is really not worth the cost.

<Title>Not real happy with this player
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Unlike a couple of others, I have found this product to be rather undurable. I don't know what the deal is - perhaps a problem with the battery housing - but I now need to hold the thing steady in my hand while working out or else the power shuts off. Also, the shuffle feature is horrible: The same sequence of songs is repeated over and over again rather than a true random sequence being generated. And as others have said, adding and changing songs on the player is slightly cumbersome. I'm now in the market for a new player.

<Title>unbreakable

<Content>I don't know what other people are talking about but I forgot mine on my truck's roof and drove down the road and didn't know till I heard it slide off at 50 MPH. I stopped to look for it expecting it to be in peaces but it worked just fine. The only problem I do have is I had to glue the rubber cap on because the tape that held it on came off.
