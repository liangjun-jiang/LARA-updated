<Title> Machspeed Trio flash music drive-M450-4010R
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have bought recently(2 days back) this mp3 player. The manual did not mention any tech support contact. The enclosed warrenty card did not provide address to where the card to be sent. Very poorly written manual and it is not working as it is sated. I have connected to my PC (2000 OS) and try to copy music files on a 512 Ultra SD card. It says the card is not formatted. I have tried to format and it says"windows can not format the drive" Format is not complete.  When try to use with the new battary (supplied eith the unit) it says"hello" and "01 err" There is no reference of this or nay error in the manual.  I am regretting on this purchase and I am planning to give this as a gift to some one. This way it will be somebody's headache.

<Title>A Dud
<Date>Sat Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had exactly the same experience as the previous reviewer. When connected to a USB port, the player wanted to format the SD card even though the card was formatted in FAT with mp3s on the card.   When not connected to the USB port, the player displayed '01 err' even though the card was formatted in FAT with mp3s on the card.

<Title>Waste of money
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player refused to even play when the card was inserted. It just started shutting off and since not even displayed anything. Designwise this is a neat player but that is of little use if it just does not work. When I first inserted the memory card it refused recognize it... later it did... but refused to come up through the USB connection, so I used my flash reader to put the songs on it... it attempted to play one of the songs and suddenly just powered off, has not worked since other than lightening up its indego light.

<Title>Why sell this piece of Junk?!!
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Why do supposedly reputable companies not check out the items they sell?  This TRIO MP3 player is junk. If the largest-selling O/S doesn't support it, DON'T SELL IT!!!

<Title>Works fine for me!
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sorry others have had bad experiences, mine is going fine. Battery supplied with unit was bad; I had another AAA battery I used instead. Unit powered on fine w/new battery and had no trouble playing a 512 mb SD card with 90 songs or a 128 mb card; sound was v good with good headphones and when played thru my computer speakers connected by the usb cable; sound is mediocre with supplied ear buds but what do you expect?  I copied the songs to the SD card through an SD card reader on my computer w/o issue; I also connected the unit through the included usb cable (about $8 or 9 all by itself at R Shack) for grins and both played back and copied files to the SD card in the Trio via usb. No problems (using WinXP pro as the OS)   This is a bare bones unit for sure -- compare its $30 price to the price of any Ipod or Creative Product. No .wav or .wma format, no display of song names, no random play, no FM, no microphne but it works fine and has good sound and it is cheap.   Very satisfied. Use of SD cards allows de facto unlimited memory (if 90 songs won't do for you, just get another SD card).  You can get more but you WILL spend more. This unit is fine if like me all you want to do is play your mp3's when you want. If you want more the advert should tip you off this widget is not for you  I rate it a 3 because that's all it is -- plain Jane (plain Jack if you are a femme). You won't write home to Momma about her but she does what she does and she does it just fine.

<Title>Functional Starter MP3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Trio MP3 player has worked well out of the box. I was able to use 1Gb drive with this unit and the unit was able to play sound well after copying 100 songs to it. The only concern is that the one AAA battery runs out fairly quickly. Otherwise, this unit also acts as a secondary backup unit with a USB interface.  The compact size is a winner and it is easy to carry with you. The headset speakers were not very good however do a decent job. Overall, it is decent with no frills.

<Title>Functional  if Barebones MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm really surprised to see all of the negative reviews. I purchased one of these a few weeks ago, and considering the price I'm very impressed.  The display is extremely minimal but it gets the job done. The included earbuds are garbage, but that's true of players costing 3 times the price.  Two negatives with this unit would be battery life and the 99 track limit of the display.  Positives are no DRM, a user replaceable battery, and infinite tracks/playlists via SD card media.

<Title>This IS my "sound system" at work
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Plus side: SD cards are cheap, and I have several.  To get a different set of a hundred (or 200 or 300...) songs, just pop in a different SD card.  Sound quality is as good as I need for some background music at the office.  (If you were an audiophile, you wouldn't be checking out a $21 mp3 player anyway, would you?)  I keep the volume of the Trio fairly low, and keep it plugged into a pair of AC-powered Altec Lansing speakers, whose volume I can turn up or down.  Thus I can blast music when no one is around, and Trio battery life isn't shortened.  Always plays reliably.  It doesn't have a USB connector right on the unit, but it does have a USB cable.  My player does triple duty, because I also use it as an SD card reader to get photos off my digital camera SD card - and in a pinch I use it as a thumb drive for plain old data files.  Minus side: No radio.  No voice recorder.  No fancy screen.  No way in heck to know what's playing (LCD just gives you a song number - I have yet to figure out what this number means! - but for my own purposes, this really doesn't matter).  Shuffle mode works pretty well, but I'm not absolutely sure it shuffles ALL the songs.  AAA battery is way too small.  Here's my work-around: I cut a piece of rigid foam same size as AAA battery and bought a cheapo AA battery holder - the leads of the battery holder are attached to the correct ends of the foam "battery" and voila - now I have an mp3 player that runs on AA instead of AAA.  I use a rechargeable 2500 mAh NiMH battery, and it plays for well over 12 hours!  Extra cost: less than a buck.  Summary - I have gotten more and better use out of this product than most other similarly-priced electronic products. I give it 4 stars, because it does what it is supposed to do.

<Title>Great MP3 For Your Technophobic Dad
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one of these from TigerDirect for about 9.99 when they were having a sale on them, and a 1 gig SD card for 20 dollars extra.. At the time, about year or two ago, this was cheap, and still is pretty darn cheap..   The player comes with no memory, BTW, so you will need a SD card to play music with it..   I played with it for a while and upgraded to a Sansa M240 for 60 dollars, I now own a Samsung YP-T9 which also plays video among other things.   My father, however, I purchased a Mach Trio for him and he prefers and understands how to use it, because it is so simple and obvious. I admit I load his SD cards with podcasts from iTunes (note, you can drag and drop podcasts from a smart-playlist in itunes). I use a card reader with USB 2.0 support, it takes about 6 minutes to fill a 1GB card, that's enough podcasts for a days worth of listening..   For Music, it takes standard mp3, pretty much any bitrate.. One minute of mp3 audio compresses (at 128Kbit) into about a meg of space, so a 1GB card gets you about a 1000 minutes of audio or almost 17 (16.6) hours of music.  I think it accepts both VBR and CBR mp3 files, I mean it's played all mp3 files I've thrown at it without fail.   The Mach Trio is rather big, and its very attractive (it's tight and somewhat tough, but it looks like something you'd find at Radio Shack selling as a build-it-yourself science project).. It's big enough it has watch screws holding the case together... But its about 3/4ths the size of a deck of cards, about the size of a cassette tape, but not quite as long.   Operation:  You hold the stop button (down arrow) until the player turns on. It says Hello in a 5 element, 5-digit LCD display. Then it displays two digits indicating how many sound files it found, the display only goes to 99..   (Note, the iPod shuffle minis sell for 80 dollars and quite a bit smaller, and have no display whatsoever, they play songs in a random format.. Probably simpler but I wouldn't buy one.. For 20 dollars more I could get a Samsung YP-T9 from Best Buy)   (When I load it with podcasts, I can only usually get about 50-70 podcasts on a 1GB card, most podcasts are 20-30MB in size..)   Press play button (up arrow).  To go forward one sound file (song, podcast, etc..) press right arrow.  To go backward one sound file, press left arrow twice.  Because To go to beginning of song you press left arrow once.  To rewind/fast-forward through a track hold left or right arrow, respectfully.   To Repeat, repeat a set, repeat/shuffle.. Press the round white button on the top left (its a toggle).   To play a portion of a audio file (called an A/B range selector),press the upper right round white button, one selects the beginning of the audio range, pressing again selects the end of the audio range.. Then it loops over that range until you press the button again.. Dad uses this to practice barbershop songs.. He's been in Barbershop singing with SPEBSQSA for 15 years.   There is a pitch-bender like spring loaded canta-lever button on the side that is used to change the volume.. The volume isn't really very good with these players, it goes to about 25, and that's loud enough to be audible from clip-on headphones across a table on a quiet day.. The squelch of a clip-on headphone, we've found irritates dogs, BTW, but it's safer than a earbud..   Pushing the button in lets you select five equalizer modes, a couple are useful for podcasts with too much bass, and songs with not much high-end frequencies.. But all these EQ modes subtract from the amplitude of the playback, so you'll want the EQ mode to be in the default flat mode.   There is a Lock button just under the volume/EQ control, it locks all functions.. I even found one day that it would not turn on when the lock was engaged. I guess this is to prevent one from running batteries down.. Though its not statistically possible that anything could press the stop button for a couple of seconds, as is required to turn it on.   Sing songs play one after another, engaging the lock will prevent unwanted skipping caused when player is stuffed in a tight pocket, as would be obvious to tech-savvy users.   It has a USB 1.0 connector.. But it's better to use a card reader with USB 2.0 support.. If you want to reduce wear on the player, you can just use the 1.0 USB connector, but its slow.. About 20 minutes or more to changeout audio files.   LCD readout has special indicators for most all the extra modes, it's not just a calculator display.. It's just that the player is so simple it doesn't need a dot-matrix display. Since the display is simply numeric, it's easy to understand and there is a limited number of modes possible.   It doesn't support folders, but it scours folders recursively (that's a computer geeks word for, looking through everything no matter how deep) for mp3 files, so whatever is on the card, in mp3 format, it will find.   Order is dependent, I think, on order in which files are loaded. First loaded file is played first, second --> second, etc..  The only problem I have with it is it takes forever to scour a podcast with it, it was designed for music files not podcasts.. So to get through a 30 minute podcast (like Slashdot Reviews Podcast) it takes alike 6 minutes of holding the fast-forward button, which can exhaust thumb muscles.. It's also not possible to reverse through a previous song, so the cassette tape recorder analogy falls apart on these points..   Otherwise its a good first mp3 player, or if you are a technophobe or a frugal consumer (like me), this is the perfect mp3 player for you. Although if you want something that does everything an iPod does at half the price, consider a Samsung YP-T9.. I've been able to stuff 26 hours of video on a 2GB YP-T9.. And it will play audio books in W M A D R M  format, whereas this Mach Trio will not.. Sorry for spacing out the characters in W M A D R M, put them together.. I just didn't want people searching for W M A D R M players to find this article by mistake.. Microsoft has a proprietary audio file format that most non-iPod's play, and if you play to use a music subscription service or listen to audio books, I would suggest the YP-T9.. If you want just to use music subscription services like Rhapsody online, get a Sansa M240.. But if you only want to rip CD's to mp3 or listen to podcasts (already in mp3 format), then get the Mach Trio..  The Sansa M240 is terrible for audio books, for the same reasons as the Mach Trio, it's tough to scour a audio file.. The Samsung YP-T9's use exponential file search.   If you want more reviews on the Samsung TP-T9 I give a full video review of it on YouTube..

<Title>Bogus Rebate!!!! BUYER BEWARE-UNDERHANDED COMPANY THAT CHEATS THEIR CUSTOMERS! 
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased many items with rebates last Christmas. Digging through my records it looks as though this is the only one that didn't come. I bought it and mailed the items out correctly, and on time. It was for the Machspeed 2GB Trio MPS Player. Today reading the small print and wondering why I didn't get my money, I discovered it says you have to wait 10 weeks to get your rebate, but if you don't receive it, you must contact them no later then 120 days after the promotion ends. So you have to wait 70 days, then somehow remember that you were not sent the rebate, but before 120 days is up, you have to remind them that you still want it. Otherwise you forfeit your rebate. What a scam this is. Shame on you Machspeed Technologies. All for a stupid $10 rebate. Very underhanded company.  Now to just post this review for every item they sell.
