<Content>Outstanding hard drive space for the price, the ear buds that are included are of excellent quality, and I'm completely addicted to it.  The best feature is putting my entire music library on shuffle and listening to things I've ignored for years.  I'm still not always crazy about iTunes but I'm getting used to it.  It's completely changed the way I listen to music.

<Title>beyond expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was virulantly anti ipod. They were for noobs, kids, non tech savvy. I had an iRiver H320, which could be hacked, rockboxed (alt operating system), had line in recording and FM, and a big geek factor.  It played videos before ipods (albeit choppy quality and totally a gimmick). It is drag and drop from windows explorer, no itunes interface needed - well that is a superior feature ipod just doesn't have. I loved that thing. I still have it, but it is only 20 gigs. iRiver doesn't make them any more or support them. it is heavier and fatter than an ipod.  Enter my 80gb ipod video. Form factor - A+. slim, light, portable. Usage factor A. simple, slick interface. click wheel a bit too sensitive, but you get used to it. Video - A++ - biggest surprise for me. Thought it was a gimmick, but video quality is amazing and you can easily output to a TV. Even on 50" HDTV screen, videos are great - VHS quality. With some qeek abilities, you can find excellent free software online (DVDshrink, Videora) to enable you to rip any DVD (or captured youtube video with Videodownloader) to mp4 and have it on your ipod. 6 hours video is plenty.   accessories - A+++. Sets these apart from other brands. Bought a Belkin Tune Talk Stereo, and it is now a digital recorder, capable of 3 hrs of recording live music or ripping old lp's or cassettes to digital. speakers, chargers, cases: huge assortment online for any taste, budget or functional requirement.  80 gigs - what can I say? HUGE storage ability. nothing else comes close.   itunes software took me a while to get into, but it is easy and just fine. I still prefer "UMS" ability to just drag and drop from windows explorer onto player as though it were a hard drive, without any extra step in between. But itunes has some advantages for music management.  all in all, totally satisfied. (But I still use my iRiver now, almost exclusively as a digital recorder) Rockbox is coming for the 80gb ipod, however....!

<Title>Excellent for school

<Content>I'm at college frequently and sometimes I have several hours between classes. This is perfect for those times when nobody is around to talk to and you need some long term, or short term entertainment. The screen is a little small, but its not painful to watch. With an 80gb capacity, I managed to cram 600 hours of video onto this little guy, which will give you about 300 movies, or 800+ tv show episodes. You can cram probably double the amount of music on here if you don't care about top audio quality (as if you can get it through the regular ear buds anyways). The games are excellent, especially tetris, which has kept me addicted for many hours. You can listen to and skip through music while you play your games as well. It is the absolute best investment if you frequently travel or have a lot of downtime on the go, especially if you don't have the space for larger electronics like a laptop. I do not recommend using the itunes store for anything but games, however, as all of their products come with DRM that will only allow you to play it on the ipod and your PC,  which means when you want to buy a new player, you are out of luck.

<Title>Self-avowed iPod hater converted to the dark side :)
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say, I promised that I would never buy an iPod, but after the addition of an 80GB model (and the capability to play Pac-Man!), I was finally wooed. The effortless podcasting integration is also a winner. I had a Creative Zen Vision M, but this model is over twice the size and is thinner. I wish it had more filetype compatibility, but it is so easy to use. This is a winner.

<Title>Fun fun fun
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having this expensive toy is certainly something of a "what one wants, not needs" thing, but what I personally appreciate about it is the portability of it, combined with its ease of use. I can stash my recorded TV shows, all music, pictures, and every single piece of music owned in one spot, and view these here if needed. Play it thru my car's plug in or on speakers, or even jst headphones. It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of the wheel dial and how to use it. One big plus is how it updates so easily when I plug it into my laptop - and charges too!

<Title>Excellant Apple product
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had a different mp3 player but sold it to go with a video iPod. I don't regret making the switch. I've loaded it with books on tape, tv shows, and music and it works well.  I'm not fond of the click wheel but I'm getting used to it. By biggest quibble is iTunes. Since it's a free program I try to cut it some slack but I dislike it's organization scheme - much prefer Music Match. And while this review is supposed to focus on the product how can one ignore the program that makes it work?

<Content>Think of this:  All of your music, TV shows, photos, movies, podcasts, contact lists, dictionary, etc... in the palm of your hand.  And now you can even buy those little addictive games to play on it, like Zuma.  I love it.

<Title>IPOD
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product is excellent, as expected.  Apple always does an excellent job with their products and the IPOD is no exception.  I still haven't figured out how to download videos to it but that is not that important to me anyway.  IT is probably simplier to download videos with a Mac computer but I'm a PC person.  the service from Amazon was also great.

<Content>The Ipod 80 like its cousin the 60 does everything I expected it to do.  This is the third Ipod I've purchased.  Bought the 60 photo and than a 60 video and now the 80. Gave first two to my children. Sound and video quality is excellent with many accessories that one can spent much on.
