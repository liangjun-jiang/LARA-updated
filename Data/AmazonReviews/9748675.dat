<Title>This is perfect
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Granted, I am no novice when it comes to such devices, and knew full well what I was going into when I bought this; but, still, I am shocked at the negative reviews I have read. While each users experience will be different, I must say I am pleased to see those unsatisfied choosing to downgrade;  this is an advanced piece of equipment.  For me, it's perfect.  I have installed the latest firmware, which allows the user to utilize ogg vorbis files, which is why I purchased this model, without affecting any other uses of the player.  If you are not afraid of spending just a little time, you will gain AMAZING (shocked by the what the one reviewer wrote!) sound quality, and an awesome overall experience.  I also work in radio, and the voice recorder is of a near studio quality when set to mp3 128 kbps...compare this to other voice recorders that sound like a cell phone in the middle of the desert...the text reader allows for great reading on the go, and the video works great, so long as one doesn't mind the conversion process.  Granted, I must agree that the included software is sluggish, at best; but when used only for updating the system's libray, and converting video, it is fine.  Use another freeware software (Mediamonkey) for syncing the T9, and you're in for a great experience.

<Title>Good but with 1 annoyance
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great portable media player but is annoying in one aspect: it requires that you reencode all videos in their difficult to use software. The process is very, very slow. Its apparently a Samsung variant of Divx designed to prevent you from encoding the videos yourself with a better program.

<Title>Samsung is great!
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an affordable mp3 that works excellently. I had previously owned the Sansa e250 but returned it because it felt a little too clunky for me. It also seemed to get scratched easily. The Samsung YP-T9 has a harder exterior that is pretty scratchproof and is actually a lot better looking than the photo they have here on Amazon. It's smaller than you might think and has the Samsung logo as well. I think I'd rather have some sort of scroll wheel to navigate but the buttons are fine.

<Title>Much better performance than what I expected
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After spending quite a bit of time looking at the various options for an MP3 player such as the Zen V plus and Sansa e260, I finally chose the the Samsung YP-T9 2GB because of 3 things, 1st. - although all 3 products had pretty good overall ratings, it seemed that the Samsung had fewer firmware problems (such as lockups). 2nd. The physical build of the unit seemed much more solid and classy than either the Zen Plus or e260, and 3rd. Amazon had a really good price on the purple 2GB model ($85.00).  I have not been disappointed and although I was concerned about the 2GB capacity, have found it not to be an issue at all. I have a few hundred mp3 songs, numerous photos, podcasts and even some home video clips of my granchildren on it with about 500mb to spare.   The sound, even with the provided earbuds seemed okay, but after listening to other 3rd. party earbuds, I was blown away by the quality of the audio. I have ordered a set of Sennheiser CX300's which were on sale here on Amazon for less than $40.00 delivered and am really looking forward to replacing the OEM buds. There are numerous EQ settings, or you can create your own custom setting.   The user menu is fairly intuitive and even though the manual comes on the provided CD, it is not really neccesary to get started using the YP-T9. The provided PC S/W is adequate, although lacking many features seen with other products. It would be nice to have the ability to better integrate with podcast feeds.  Video handling and compression is very good and the screen display is suprisingly good, unless outside. The provided FM reciever is pretty weak, but will find the stations I am most interested in listening to and the recorder is nice if you want to capture a talkshow segment. The voice recorder is very basic, but gets the job done.  One thing I would have liked to see was integration with MS Outlook for the contacts, the Zen Plus has this capability and if it were not for the cheap feel and lower quality of the Zen unit, I might have gone for it instead of the T9.   I have had absolutely no lockup problems with my T9 and use it every day, uploading news podcasts in the morning which I listen to on the way into work in the morning via my aux input on my Honda Civic and I listen to it via earbuds during my lunch break. The unit seems very well built and Samsung includes an additional 3 months warranty if you register the unit online, giving it a 15 month parts and labour warranty. Battery life is excellent as well and although I had originally planned to get the car adaptor to recharge during the day if needed, have not found it to be neccessary and can use it all day w/o even getting to 1/2 charge.  Overall I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase decision and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else.

<Title>Amazing mp3!
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this mp3, the same as the black one, for two weeks and it is amazing. It is really simple dragging your music and putting it on the mp3. The sound is really good and the fm radio works perfectly and I sleep in a basement room! I know in one review somone said the buttons are easily pushed but I haven't had a problem.  Just an added thought my brother has an ipod and he said he wished he had gotten this mp3.

<Title>Pretty good stuff actually
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I reviewed this shortly after i got it on the link for the black one. AS far as i know they are the same minus the color difference.  So I'll make this one a bit shorter drag and drop works out of the box.  Sound is good gets pretty loud on the headphones. I have yet to test the battery life under normal conditions but at work with the volume maxed and street mode on i got around 7 hours. Mind you this is maxed volume with the added drain of the street feature so it may very well get close to the specified 30 or so hours advertised under normal conservative use; i.e no constant background etc.  I dd have a chance to encode a small video. I do not recall the orig. format .vi most likely seemed pretty fast on my modest machine (1.8 sempron) quality is good size aroun 224x? On the player it looks really clean albeit small.  All in all very good player for the price.

<Title>A great mp3 player - not just for they money
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research before purchasing an MP3 player, and I wound up purchasing this Samsung.  It holds a ton of music, plays video, has an FM radio, lets you store text files, has a voice recorder and flash games.  You can also play in shuffle mode or by genre, artist, playlist, etc.  For the same money as another brand I won't mention, you get so many more features it's incredible.  The interface is intuitive, it's easy and fast to upload and the sound is unbelievable.  I kind of wish I had gone for the 4gb model, but I'm still in love with this one.

<Title>Great MP3 Player, Crappy Software
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I LOVE this MP3 player.  I love the size of it and I love the look of it and I just love it.  But the software leaves much to be desired.  The software that came with the player didn't even work, it installed, but I couldn't get it to load anything to the player.  So I used Windows Media Player to load my music.  Then I wanted to load some pictures so I tried the software again, no luck.  I searched online and found out that other people had problems with the software and that there was a newer release on their website.  Downloaded that and it works.  It is annoying that in order to load pictures, text files or images you have to use the Samsung software.  I wish there was some other way.  I also do not like the headphones that came with it, they hurt my ears.  But that's easy enough to deal with by just getting a new pair of headphones.

<Title>First MP3.  Does more than I need
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first mp3 used for walking and other exercise.  The buttons are a bit sensitive and the software needs to be more user friendly with respect to song organization and removal of installed items.  The earbuds aren't great, have gone back to my old ones.  Overall it works just fine and deep purple is nice.

<Title>My first MP3 player
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this (with very little previous knowledge on MP3 players)because it had a good write-up in Good Housekeeping - I am thoroughly pleased and am using it much more than I thought.  It came with a 30-day trial for downloading music which was a real bonus - now I just wish I had gone for the larger GB version.  Affordable!

<Title>Powerful in a little package!
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Small, lightweight, smooth little player that packs a punch!! Don't know how it compares to the infamous ipod nanos but if you want something that's very light (total 1.7) and has ALL basic features and more, GET THIS one!! Amazon has just lowered the price even more since last week!! I was especially amazed at how high the volume can get on this one (you can also adjust it so it doesn't get that high..)especially when I work out!! I am waiting to order a case with a belt clip for my new lovely toy right now! There is also two openings on the mid top of the player for a small lanyard or charm if preferred. Extremely happy with it so far!! I have even tried the new Samsung yp-k3...doesn't come close!!

<Title>OK MP3 Playe, will not play any video at all
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item thinking that it was easy to use. In terms of adding music, it is. However, the software has a major problem for video. Based on the specs, it needs MPEG4 but after contacting Samsung USA, they told me it needs MPEG2. Either way, the software did not work or after spending hours and trying other converters, I gave up and am returning it.  Also, the sound quality is not too hot either. My daughter's SanDisk (256 MB) sounds much better.  Battery life, as far as I could tell was good.  Also, do not be fooled. Even though it is a Samsung, it is made in China.   Also, do not be fooled.

<Title>Buyer Beware
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchase the Samsung due to the fact that it got very good reviews.  Unfortunatley, when I installed the installation disk, it had a virus on it.  Thankfully my security software caught it, but it reported it as a severe security risk (MaCSMgr.exe).  The USB cable had a difficult time keeping the connection to charge and to transfer.  I was extremely disappointed there was a virus in the software.  Sorry Samsung, won't be buying anything else from you again.

<Title>Did Not Live Up to Expectations
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Samsung T9 as a birthday gift, and after spending almost 8 hours struggling with trying to get it to run with music services (Rhapsody and Yahoo Music), I gave up.  I was online and on the phone with technical support from Samsung, as well as Rhapsody, but could never get the device to be detected with either of the music services.  I did find in Samsung's knowledgebase that they don't test this device with any music services to see if it works, but that it 'should' - and they market it with free trials of these services!  Maybe they should try testing it, since that what most people would use it for.   It was cool-looking, small and sleek, but if you're looking for using it with Rhapsody or Yahoo Music, I would try something else.  I subsequently purchased the SanDisk Sansa e260R, and I love it.  Also small and sleek, it installed seamlessly and worked right off the bat.
