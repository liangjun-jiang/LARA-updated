<Title>Poor design and construction
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The headphone jack started cutting out after a few months. One channel is now completely dead.  The screen is easily cracked (my fault, but nevertheless....) and the battery cover is loose and feels like it will fall off.  I would not purchase this or the larger capacity (2GB I think) built with the same design.  Junk - worthless now.

<Content>For the price the c240 is great. It does everything I wanted it to do. It is easy to load and erase music.The FM radio gets great reception. I do not like the in ear head phones. I bought a cheap set of over the ear head phones. I also think it would have been better to put the head phone jack on the  end away from the neck cord. The cables keep getting tangled up. But those are very minor things for the quality and the price.

<Title>Not satisfied whatsoever
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did a lot of research beforehand, not only looking at different sansa's, but different mp3 players. I was especially looking for an mp3 player with a built in FM Tuner, so I could listen to a talk show at night and also listen to music when it was done (all while working out). First off, the FM Tuner is a piece of crap. Not only is its extremely inconsistent with its clarity, but majority of the time there is to much static to even bear listening to the radio at all. Second of all, countless mp3's i put on it were read as "bad tracks." (all of these mp3's work on my ipod, and aren't protected or anything either). Playlists on this thing aren't worth the hassle. Plus, the only case I could find for this thing cost $30 which is what I paid for the player itself!  Bottom line, look elsewhere for a mp3 player, especially if you are ever going to use the FM Tuner. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for, this thing WILL play music, but is cheap nonetheless. Be careful. I never thought of myself as an ipod advocate, but i would definitely pay the extra money for one of those (a thousand times more reliable, simpler, and manageable).

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son really wanted an I-Pod Nano, but it is expensive. So,I researched for other MP3 players and found this one to very comparable and 1/2 the price. After receiving it, it was extremely easy to download songs, and my 11 year old son can do it himself. My step-son, on the other hand, did get an I-Pod Nano, and has had problems with it from the beginning, and it took him awhile to figure out how to download. Comparing the two, for my son, there is plenty of room for all the music he wants and then some, there is an FM tuner which the I-Pod does not come with, it has a very nice look to it, and seems very durable. I highly reccomed this product.

<Title>Not as user friendly as anticipated
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because I had read several reviews stating that it was great for a person just beginning to use a mp3 player.  I have an ipod and this is harder to use than the ipod, my daughter is constantly asking me questions if you can believe that. I thought she was supposed to know more about these things than I was.  The screen sticks all the time causing us to have to pop the battery out so we can even get it to shut off.  Downloading music is a snap but if its not a cd you already own the music sights you have to use charge monthly fees on top of the songs.  Its ok but well not ok she doesn't hate it just finds it to be bothersome at times.

<Content>If you're looking for an affordable MP3 player that gets the job done, just buy this one already and end your search.  This thing does everything I want it to. It's easy to use so I don't know what anyone else is talking about. I figured every single feature out within about 10 minutes of owning it and haven't looked at the user manual at all.  The color screen is a little cheap looking, but who really cares. This thing does everything an MP3 player less than $100 should do, and more.

<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Comparing the price of other mp3 players(including ipod)with the same option this is one of the best. It is super easy to put your music on it just by drag and drop or by using Window Media Player(which automatic sync to the player and it is self explanatory from there). ALl of the option work great and I haven't seen any problems with it. It is suprising quick at loading or deleting music. The button take a little of getting use to so remember to read the directions on the CD they gives you. It also have a very smooth and pretty finish so I would recommend a cover for it if you are like me who hate when your stuff get scratch.

<Title>Everything is mising !!!
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered one from ANTonline through Amazon.com . The MP3 player arrived on time. When I open the hard plastic, I saw there's empty storage space. I check the item list from online user guide. I figured Earphones,  USB Cable, Lanyard and 1 lithium ion battery (a replacement battery??). I called SanDisk but they asked me to contact the online retailer. I called the online retailer and the lady asked me to send an E-mail to their tech support department and wait. Then she HANG UP MY CALL! That's very rude.  In general, I believe this is the SanDisk issue because those items were missing in the brand new, sealed hard plastic container. SanDisk is able and capable to prevent this issue. Now they just push the responsibilities to the customer and the online retailer.

I got it was closed twice 4 hours before the stated time it was suppose to close. Then when I did reach someone she didn't have the password to access the email. Then they "determined" that it had physical damage and wouldn't honor the warranty even though there is not so much as a scratch on it. I will never purchase Sandisk again.

<Title>Nice Player, Hard to read display
<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa player is fairly simple to use, compact, and easy on the battery.  So far, I've got 31 1-hour sermons on it, and I could get another 20 or so.  My only real complaint is that the display colors cannot be changed for more contrast.  It is very difficult to see what is being selected, and that's not a good thing when trying figure out what's next while practicing poor driving habits.  It recharges its battery while attached to the computer via USB.  A different charging mechanism would be nice, but that's nitpicking.

<Title>Great entry level MP3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting in the shadows for a long time during the whole MP3 revolution.  First I thought I wanted an Ipod; they seemed cool and my step-brother has one that he likes.  They're really expensive though...  So, hmm...    My sister wanted a Creative Zen player because it could directly upload CDs from a CD player...  But there's not a whole lot of information available on those.    I still hadn't made my mind up until my mom and I went out shopping for Christmas and got one of these Sansa players for my step dad.  I looked at his and it seemed like a pretty good device.  After the new year I started using a certain music program that was compatible with Sansa and found a c240 on Ebay for $30.  I figured, that seemed like a heck of a deal and a good place to start my MP3 journey.  Mine came in the mail a couple weeks ago and I've really enjoyed using it.  It's really compact, like a little candy bar.  I have a laptop where I store my music and transfer to the player, so I have little complaints about charging via USB or difficulty of loading songs onto the c240.  Also, I'm just interested in music, so I don't know much about having photos on there.  The album covers that show up when you select a new artist aren't the clearest images, so I don't imagine photos would look terrific on it.  But like I said, that doesn't phase my judgement of the product.  The sound quality is very good, the storage is excellent for the price and I look forward to adding more SanDisk products to my MP3 player collection in the future!

<Title>Its not perfect
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I brought this recently for the cheap price but i thought it could've been a bit better. First the Pros  1. Amazingly small. Taking this with you working out is no problem 2. Simple enough to use. Music is separated by Genre, Artist  and Album automatically. At least it was for me when i uploaded music from Muiscmatch and Windows Media Player. 3. Microphone very sensitive. Thats a plus depending on the recording situation. Ie: class  Now the Cons: 1. No real playlist editor on the go. There is a Go function, that you can place music in. And that will act as a playlist, but you can't save it and make another list. The only way to make a list is to do it from your computer and download it to your player. Which is good enough, but making a playlist that includes music that is already on the player could cause problems. 2. Photoviewer is basically useless. Only useful if your looking at scenery. (but this isn't anything big) 3. No instructions included, other than whats on the box.   4. For expansion it uses MIRCO SD cards. No option for Compact Flash size or even Mini SD size cards. An option for using normal size SD cards could of work without increasing size much.    Overall it is under a $100. If your using to just keep your self entertain on the subway or during a workout, it will do the job.  If you was going on a long and wanted portable music, i recommend getting a larger size one of at least 4 gigs. If your using this mostly as a recorder for class or whatever 2 gigs with a few MICRO sd cards should work.       Still better than buying an Ipod in my book.

<Title>Poor Design of Charging Plug
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old son and within 3 days it was broken.  The charger and download plug port is poorly designed.  Instead of the plug interfacing with a stiff card with contacts, the plug needs to slip over free-standing pins the thickness of a human hair.  If you are off by a 10th of a millimeter, you will bend a pin.  If you bend a pin you can't download or charge.  Without the ability to charge, the unit is worthless.  The design and screen are nice, but it makes a pretty light paper weight after you bend a pin.  Stay away from this unit, until SanDisk redesigns the faulty plug.

<Content>I reviewed so many MP3 players online, I missed one big detail when I purchased...this is a very small player. This was for my 9 year old for Christmas. I overlooked the specs that tell the size of the player itself. Very small player. Nothing wrong with that, just didn't fit the MP3 case I already had for it. Oh well! Not many choices for cases, but I did find a pink one that she wanted. All is well, the player seems to work well. As usual, no problems with Amazon delivery, etc.!

<Content>I purchased the Sansa c240 from another site on a closeout sale for around $40. I was looking for a replacement for a crappy, 5 year old 512MB Gateway MP3 player I had been using. My main criteria were:  1) Cheap 2) At least 1GB  3) Rechargeable battery  #3 was really huge for me as my old MP3 player ate AAA batteries like crazy.  For my needs this player was perfect. If you're looking for a solid MP3 player and nothing more this device fits the bill. You can use it to display photos but the screen is so low res I would not recommend it. I use it when I mow the lawn and when I work out at the gym. I've read other reviews complaining about short battery life. I don't know if they just got a bad unit or what but mine seems great although I only use it about an hour at a time.

<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>On the negative side, I have three major complaints about this product:  First, the instructions are very poor.  Even if you look up the manual on the internet, all you get is the same information that comes with the product, which is basically a "quick start" guide.  Second, YOU CAN OVERCHARGE THE BATTERY.  Many products stop charging once the battery is fully charged, but not this one!  You have to keep a close eye on the battery icon; and once it's fully charged, you need to disconnect the player or the battery will overcharge and you may cause damage to the unit.  Third, and this is what upsets me the most, the product didn't do what it claims to be able to do.  One of the main reasons I bought this unit was to play protected WMA files (also knows as WMA DRM files) in the form of audio books, which the unit is supposed to be able to play.  IT WASN'T WORKING!  I had to contact customer service, load the latest firmware, and reformat the memory on the unit to get it to play the protected WMA files.  On the positive side, I have three favorable comments:  First, this unit seems to be a great deal for the price!  Given all of the features included in the unit (FM radio, voice recording, music, pictures, and micro SD expansion slot), it seems to be very reasonably priced!  Second, you can replace the rechargeable battery.  It seems like many products these days come with a built in rechargeable battery that you can't remove!  Thus, when the battery wears out, you have to throw away the whole unit!  What a waste!  With this unit, once the battery wears out, you can easily replace it yourself.  Third, customer service is EXCELLENT!  When you register your product, you get a personal account on their website.  If you have a problem, you can leave a message on your account.  Both times that I've written in, I've received a response within 24 hours, and both times they were able to resolve my problem!  All in all, I give the player three stars because the pros and cons pretty much even each other out.  If I had to give it a thumbs up or down, I would say thumbs down, for I think that you could find other MP3 players that don't have the flaws that this one does.

<Title>Check out the Sandisk online helper videos!!!
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was ready to take this player back to the store!  I checked the sandisk web site and stumbled across a link to "how to" videos.  This was the best thing I could have found.  The videos walk through all the settings you need to configure on your PC to get the player to work for drag and drop, showing album art...  I had no idea my PC was set not to show hidden folders!  Who would hide folders anyway?  Nonetheless I now have a player loaded with music and am a happy customer.  Like others have said the photo option is not that great so don't buy it for that.  I mostly want it for working out so pics don't make much of a difference to me.  DH has a 30G ipod so if I wanna see graphics I can just borrow that lol!  I have over 250 mp3 formatted songs on the player (and it's full) and will likely get a micro SD card so I can expand it a little bit.  All in all, I do like this little player!

<Title>Mostly pleased
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price.

<Content>This is a great alternative to an Ipod Shuffle. It is about half price and features the same amount of storage, plus a screen (!) FM radio, voice recorder and picture viewer. The pictures don't look great and the quality of the voice recorder isn't as good as it could be, but overall it's a great bargain. I've had mine for 8 months and i'm about to upgrade to one of the sansa e200's

<Content>Got this for my son's 14th birthday.  Very happy once I got one that worked (had to return the 1st one but very easy policy). The player is easy to use with WMP or just drag and drop. Would have liked to be able to recharge battery without plugging into computer but is working fine and has good battery life. The expansion slot is a plus - can really get alot of music on there.  Price was great and free shipping is fabulous. Overall a wonderful value.

<Title>My Teen LOVES it!
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this last year for my 16 yr. old and she loves it. She had no problem getting it loaded and running in no time flat (little web ferret!). She uses it constantly, with NO complaints. Still hasn't filled it all the way up with music. Plenty of room. Having it able to charge off the computer is GENIUS. No batteries to worry about. Love it so much, My 12 yr. old is getting one this Christmas.  UPDATE (Jan. 17, 2008): 12 yr. old took this thing to her bible study group and used it to record the teaching. I could not believe how good the quality of the recording was! Her group meets in a huge room (school gymnasium) and she was sitting in the back. Not only could you hear the teacher clearly, you could also clearly hear the kids all over the gym as they asked questions during discussion time. I would have NEVER believed you could get that kind of quality out of that tiny built-in microphone!! Very impressed.

<Title>Meets basic expectations
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought two of the Sansa C240 for my wife and son.   Pros: 1)Price (they were on sale), 2)color screen for navigation, 3)Memory expansion slot.  The 1GB of memory is more than enough for my 8 yr old son and as his needs grow (assuming this player continues to work), we'll be able to buy a memory card to hold even more music.  With the price of memory cards always going down, I'll probably be able to get an 8GB card for $15 by the time he needs it : )    Cons: 1)Unlike and IPod, there are not a lot of accessories available for this model player.  I could only find one style of case for the C240 and only one style of radio/docking station. 2)The included software would not load on my computer.  I continued to get a "Fatal Error" and the program would not fully install.  Fortunately, I think the software is only needed if you wanted to load pictures onto the MP3 player, which isn't that important to us. 3) The screen resolution isn't optimal.  Album art from songs is displayed, but with the poor resolution and small screen, there's not much point to it.  Overall, I think it was a good value.  As compared to an Ipod shuffle, I think this is a much better deal. This has the navigation screen and expandable memory.

The sound is great, I think, and the song transfering is very easy if you use Windows media player. The viewing screen is very generic, but for fifty bucks what can you really expect. There are No complaints in my opinion.

<Title>Quality Sound. Poor Construction.
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had this player for about 6 months and was pretty pleased with it. The sound quality is great and it's very easy to use. If you are going to buy this product, I strongly reccomend buying some sort of case for it. I dropped mine on the carpet and the headphone jack flew across the room. Sansa support tried to help me best they could ,however, I did not have a protection plan on my device. I was eventually able to get ahold of a tech that walked me thru the steps of soldering the headphone pice back on.  I never did it, was better just to buy another player. I use this one somewhat still because it works on any speaker dock thats compatible for sansa. Threw some kids tunes on it and set it up in my sons room for bedtime music.   The buttons are a little confusing at first, but once you get used to it its not bad. I would reccomend this player as use for a docking player for music at parties or for using when you mow the yard or pull weeds. I wouldnt reccomend this for an audiophile. If you are going to drop 50 dollars and you want something small and simple. Get the 2gb clip. It doesnt have a full color screen or microsd slot, buts its an overall better value.

<Title>SanDisk Sansa C240 is a great little MP3
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked around a few weeks for the best MP3 for under $75 and found this Sansa C240 on sale for $59.99. The unit is small with a nice clear color LCD screen. The operation buttons are just right for quick one hand operation and the MP3 down loads very fast. The FM radio is a big plus, but like most of these units some of the stations are just a little too weak to pick up clearly, but still a great feature. The only problem I have is for some reason I can adjust the volume all the way down, but when I want to crank up a good tune it seems to only go up half way. The 2 GB that come with the unit is more then enough but I like to have more of everything so I bought an extra 2 GB SD Micro chip for it and there is no way I well be able to keep up with all the songs and pictures this thing well down load now. I do wish they made a larger selection of protection covers for the this unit. I have only found one and it's the one with the arm band. But I'm sure someone well come out with more covers soon. For the money you can't beat this little MP3.

<Title>Nice little MP3 player
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice little MP3 player for $75 or less. The FM tuner is a plus. I listen to the radio at work through my PC speakers. The sound quality obviously depends on the earbuds/headphones/speakers that are used but it will definately crank up a good guitar solo. Although it is a little tough to get a comfortable volume through earbuds/headphones. I've given my eardrums a jolt a few times.  Another plus is the microSD slot. While 1GB is plenty for everyday use, it's nice to have the ability to expand the music selection for long trips.  Synchronizing music has been absolutely effortless. My PC recognized the device immediately. The player is completely compatible with Windows Media Player but I have not tried it with Napster or Musicmatch software.  I don't recommend trying to view photos on this player. The images are so tiny, it's difficult to tell what they are. The device had sample images but only the dog, the cat and a building were easily recognizable. I have not tried the voice recording feature.  The back is supposed to come off to replace the battery. I have not been able to remove the back cover (I'm afraid if I force it that it will break) nor have I been able to find replacement batteries (but the search continues).  If you like to keep your player in a case, good luck. There aren't many out there for this player.  Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product. I would definately recommend it for anyone who wants something a little nicer than the low-end players.

<Title>Nice little unit
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice small device ideal for exercise.  I plan on replacing the neck lanyard with an alligator clip - it is small and light enough to snap onto whatever you are wearing. I expected to have to replace the stock earbuds with better units but will probably stick with these.  I like a nice punchy bass and while these don't have that brain rattling 'whump', they ain't as lame as most other stock buds.  The driver for replacment will probably be keeping them in my skull when working out.    I especially like the ability to plug in 512 Meg micro flash cards ($2 each) for more capacity.  Our family has pretty esoteric tastes and listen to it all; metal, classic rock, country, bluegrass, opera, jazz, swing, disco....everything except (c)rap which we don't consider music.  Micro flash cards let you load up the genres and plug in whatever suits your fancy.  The micros are so tiny tho', they would be easy to lose and I wish someone made a case for this baby with little tiny flash card holders.    Loading is fast and easy with Windows Media Player but be sure you have downloaded version 10 to ensure everything is kosher.  Ditch Dell Jukebox if you have it - Windows loads faster and has all the same features including downloading album info online.  The only downside is the FM tuner which won't work out here in the boonies (none of the MP3s work outside metro areas).  When our gym installs in-house FM transmitters for sounds, I hope this little baby does a good job.  Highly recommended.

<Content>This product although small is very easy to use, and so far I have had no problems with it. When I first got it I went straight to my computer and put some songs on it and some pictures, just to test it out. My only complaint would be the headphones, you might want to buy your own. Besides that this is a excellent subsitute for an Ipod. It is cheaper and can hold just as many songs plus pictures.

<Title>Volume Control button broke after 4 months
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my 11-year old daughter because I wasn't sure if she was responsible for a more expensive player like an ipod.  The system worked great until the volume control button stopped working after 4 months.  It is extremely loose and doesn't connect or push the internal buttons.  You can see that the music is playing; however, there is no sound.  Another reviewer complained of the same problem.     If we had not had this problem with the volume control button, I would think that this was a great deal for the money.

<Content>We purchases this MP3 player after having repeated problems with our iAudio U2 device (stay away from it, seriously!).  So far, no issues or problems with this little guy.  We purchased the extra warrenty on this one so we wouldn't get burned like we did on the last one! It is compact, yet easy to use.  I like the fact that it does not have a joystick and instead just regular buttons.  The display/graphics are not outstanding so if you are looking for that, you might want to upgrade.  BUT, if you want a unit that is small, does what it says it will, and has good sound this is a great buy for the money! ~andrea

<Title>The Best MP3 Player Ever
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved mine from a friend, since he found a better MP3 player. Anyway, he lost the data/charger cable, so I ordered one on Amazon. It took about a day for me to get used to how it worked and how to navigate. So far, the cable shipped today and I've been listening to FM. I am completley suprised by the strength of the FM Channels. I can get a station from 20 miles away! The FM Sound is clear. I like the idea of that. The battery life is another cool thing, I've had this running for about 5 hours now and the battery level when I first got it was about 50% full, it stil looks like theres 40% battery left. I like the rechargable battery, and how photos can be stored on the player. Just another great MP3 player, and I recommend anyone looking for an MP3 player - GET THIS! It's a little high price-wise, but it's well worth it!

<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and it is everything I expected.  I have just two complaints.  One, it's not very easy to use.  While the small size is wonderful, other than the on/off/menu and select button, the "buttons" were made for people with extremely small fingers.  Two, the user's manual is almost worthless.  I pretty much hacked the device to figure out how to use it.  I never could get the Media Converter software that came with the device to work as it was supposed to.  If the CD didn't have the almost-worthless user's manual on it, it would be totally useless.  I half expected the online user's manual to be a little more expansive than what was on the CD.  It wasn't.  One thing I really wanted to know was how long a charge was good for and whether there was another way to charge it than by plugging it into a USB port.  I still don't know.  I bought a 2GB microSD/Transflash to go with it.  It works fine.

<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little mp3 player is fantastic.  First i'd like to answer some of the other reviewers "cons".  The interface couldnt be simpler or easier to use.   Some people complained of lack of good instructions for loading mp3's onto the device but it really is easy.  First, dont use windows media player, use Winamp.   Winamp makes it rediculously simple. you litterally right click the files, or albums you want and go to "Send To: Sansa c240".  and voila!  you're done!  as for the only have 953 megs, I'm not going to go into detail on Window's file system but its called NTFS, previous versions of windows and most mp3 players use FAT32.  In FAT32 format, 1 gig is 1 gig, but under NTFS, that same space translates to a little less.  that's all.  you stil have a gig, it just LOOKS like less on window's file system.

<Title>Great price, decent mp3 player!
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine just a few days ago and have been enjoying it ever since. I bought it to replace a pitiful Coby unit that had the same 1GB of memory but none of the ease of this one.  Good aspects of this player:  1) it's wonderfully small and easy to carry around. The lanyard provided easily goes around my neck and keeps the player secure so that I don't drop it down a drainpipe or something.  2) you can get started using it in seconds. Literally--seconds. I pulled it out of the package and had the radio going immediately, setting up my fave stations with great ease. When it comes to loading music on to it? Easy peasy. I use Windows Media Player 11 and just sync this player, filling it with all the music I need.  3) it's easy to use music services with this one (I am using URGE).  I just download the songs I want onto my pc, then sync them with this player. Takes very little time and gives me absolutely no hassles. The player is immediately recognized by WMP, and syncing is a breeze. (Note: I'm not techno-savvy enough to distinguish between different music file types and the like; all I have is WMA files, I think, and that's just groovy for me; if, however, you are really really into this and have other preferences, don't like DRM scoping out your activities, etc., then this player may not be your best choice).  4) the little screen is pleasant and colorful, and you can even view album covers on it if those are available for the tracks you've sync'd to the player.  5) the microSD slot means I can add even more songs quite easily rather than having to buy another player.  6) the price is fantastic. I didn't get mine on  Amazon because I wanted it RIGHT NOW, and it still cost me very little, compared to iPods and other more expensive brands. I paid way less than I would for a Shuffle, and in my opinion got a better, more flexible unit.  7) when you turn the unit off, then power it back on, you start precisely where you last left off. I love that! The Coby one would always take me back to the beginning of my song list. Talk about frustrating! This one allows me to start where I left off or use menu functions to locate artists, albums, songs, playlists, etc. For example, the other day I wanted only to listen to some meditation tracks I had on it. I just hit the menu button, found "Music" and then scrolled down to playlists. I hit the big button once, got to the playlist and told it to "play all." And there it went. Lovely!  8) Sound quality is very nice. I've got everything from spoken word to hard rock on mine, and it all sounds good. Last night I listened to Van Morrison's "Crazy Love," and I swear I  heard him breathing on that track for the first time. Nice that the player has good equalizer customization so that I can finetune how my stuff sounds.    Now for the not-so-positive aspects:  1) the battery life SUCKS. Sucks badly. Did I mention that it really SUCKS the big one?!?! I have charged it twice already, and never have I gotten more than an hour and 10 minutes of use before it starts to look like it's 1/3 empty. That means, if logic holds, that the battery life for me would be less than 5 hours. I don't know about you, but that just does not have me smiling.  2) charging the battery is done through the use of a USB cable you hook up to your computer, and each time I hook this unit up, the player turns on. Seems to me to defeat the purpose to have it being in use whilst charging it, but okay. Anyway, it's a bummer to have to carry that cable around with me wherever. I will have to invest in a different charger.  3) The contrast on the screen isn't what it could be. Sometimes I can't tell how much juice I still have in it because the contrast is so bad. I've tried all sorts of settings and can't find a way to fix the problem. I'm doomed to eye strain, I guess. Heh.  4) I have less than 150 songs on the unit and am already using 90% of its capacity. Urg. I expected to get more songs on it than that, but then maybe some of the songs I've got on there are really long. Don't think so, but hey. I'll give Sansa the benefit of the doubt.  5) the headphones that come with it are painfully uncomfortable. But then manufacturer-provided headphones seem to always suck, so there you go.

<Title>Sansa c240
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa c240 is a great, cheaper alternative to the Ipod. Its 1GB storage size is diminuative compared to the Ipod videos, or nanos, it is the same price as the Ipod Shuffle and has some considerable advantages. First of all it has a screen, and while not the biggest or best, it organizes everything pretty well and is easy to see. The sansa also comes with an FM tuner and a pretty good quaility voice recorder. As for the actual sound qualtiy, it is very good, but you may want to consider buying some extra headphones, as the included ones are not of great quality. This is a very good alternative to the shuffle, but if your looking for more storage, a better screen, and a video mode, look to the Sansa e200 series. Which sell at $179 for 8GB of storage.

<Title>works well until the earphone connection fails
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this from a local retailer and was very happy with it, until the connection of the earphones to the player went bad (after about 2 months) and I could only hear out of one of the earplugs (it wasn't the earphones- i tested them on something else).  So I exchanged it at the store for the same exact one, and after about 2 months or so happened again!  I could fiddle with the jack and have it a little out of the socket and then I could usually hear out of both buds, but that was a hassle and if it got bumped I couldn't hear anything at all. It might be some strange bad luck i have with them, but I decided to change brands.

<Content>this product is a horrible, cheap, worthless mp3 player. i installed the software, and it crashed my computer, so i had to take in my computer to fix it, and its not even been a week since i received the mp3 player and its already frozen. if you take out the battery when its frozen, it does nothing. i think its completely crashed. horrible, cheap, temporary mp3 player.

<Title>A bit inconsistent.
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My mom got one of these for her birthday, and it worked great.  I uploaded and downloaded songs for her, and it played great.  I liked it so much that I bought one for myself a few weeks later.  However, mine will not allow me to remove songs.  It's the exact same product, on the same computer, but for some reason I can put songs on it but I can't get songs off of it.  Frustrating, but tolerable as long as I'm careful about which songs I put on.   Battery lasts a long time, and this product is very easy to operate.  The earbuds are comfortable as well.  It needs more than one playlist, so that you don't have to search through every artist to find the song you want.  But overall, I'm happy, especially at this price.  And, although I didn't pay any shipping, the product arrived one week before anticipation.

<Title>hilarious
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for its bargain FM radio and for voice recording. Both work well for my purposes. Unlike digital voice recorders, the Sansa saves a simple non-proprietary MP3.  Mac users should know it's easy to sync -- plug it in and it shows up as a separate volume. Just copy files either way like with any volume. No AAC play, though.  But I gotta tell ya. I own two iPods, the 5-gig original (sill going strong) and a 1-gig Shuffle (perfect l'il thing). The Sansa makes me laugh every time I use it. The interface is clunky. Buttons feel chintzy. The software and low-contrast screen make your choices unreadable outdoors, and only at certain angles indoors.  You'd think a Sansa designer would actually use it before releasing it.

<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my C240 about a week ago, and I am loving it so far. It shipped to me in just 2 days. I can't find anything wrong with the screen, and I have used it in a lit room, dark room, and outside. Music transfer is really simple. I put on 45 songs in the first half hour I owned the device. The software installed in a couple of minutes and I already have a few photos on it. It's a great little thing. The design is sleek as well. 5 stars from me.

<Title>Does everything I want and does it well
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My local library uses an audio book format that won't download to an ipod, so I just wanted an inexpensive MP3 player for borrowed audio books and listening to PBS FM stations. I have two ipods and they are loaded with music, but sometimes, I want to listen to audio books while I walk, or sew, or try to block out my husband's country music and commentary while we're travelling. (The man listens to NASCAR on Sirrius radio cross-country, so I can't get away from it.&lt;G>) This little player is working out just fine. I loaded four books on it before we went on a week's vacation and charged up the player before we left. I listened to all four books, including the chapters I fell asleep listening to and had to play more than once. The player still had battery reserve after all that. It also pulled in FM stations up in New England that we couldn't even hear on the RV radio.  It's little, light, easy to use and the only reason it didn't get a five star rating from me is the lack of "rewind" or "fast forward" switches. You can only go forward or back by chapters, not individual pages. As far as comparing it to an ipod, that's not really fair. It doesn't pretend to be an ipod, although the playback quality is fine for what I wanted and the price was definitely right.

<Title>Good little MP3 Player at a Good Price
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player in order to listen to podcasts and music while I exercise.  And I didn't want to "invest" in an iPod.  It is a 1 MB player but I have since added a 1GB micro SD card.  The machine does everything I wanted it to do and I am quite happy with it.  My only criticism is that the screen is hard to see in daylight and it is thus hard to know what part of the menu you want to select.  Also, the instruction booklet could be a little bit easier to read and understand, especially for computer novices.  Still can't find any mention of the operation of the micro SD slot.  However, for what I paid, I am very happy.

<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, so it IS my first MP3 player...but I looked and looked so long I just wasn't sure, so I decided to go with what I thought to be a good entry level product.  Staples ran these onsale for 59.99 (after rebates) so I took the plunge.  I had read reviews of poor FM reception (one thing I wanted) but I was pleasantly surprised.  It did take a couple of hours for us to figure out the software, but that is probably because this whole MP3 thing is so new to us.  But alas, sound quality, speed, even the earbuds were good....now I only wish I could find a cute case/cover!

<Content>Like the person who reviewed before me this is my first MP3 player.  All I was hoping for was a nice, portable player for my music, nothing big.  This player exceeded all my expectations.  You can store photos, listen to FM radio, and it holds up to 500 wma songs.  This mp3 is nothing fancy, but its great for people who don't have a ton of songs.  Its very easy to import songs from windows media player and photos.  Its reliable and does what its supposed to.  BUY NOW!

<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little thing does everything I want much better than anticipated. The battery life is excellent, it is light, good looking, the sound is MUCH better than expected and it is so easy to get music onto it.   The only con I can come up with are that pictures are not its strong point. I bought it strictly for music and podcasts, however, so for me this is not a con.  After reading a prior review I got an armband, neoprene case to protect the display and keep it out of my pocket. I also got a set of low end 'Skull Candy' earbuds so maybe it is this combination which is giving me such fantastic sound.   The bottom line is that I am very pleased with the value and performance of this MP3 player and would recommend it to someone who wants 'just a music player'.

<Title>Must've just gotten a bad one...
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My experience with this player was not very positive.  My first thought was it feels cheap, really cheap.  Installing the "software" resulted in crashing my Dell Inspiron 6000...to the point of it not recognizing the CD/DVD Drive.  I had to surf the net for a special program to help my laptop recognize it's CD drive again.  What a joke.  After finally getting some music onto it through Media Monkey some would only play for 1 minute then skip to the next song, others would play all the way through.  No rhyme or reason.  All songs purchased through Wal-Mart download service so they should all either play or not play.  Not this random problem.  Don't buy this for the color screen or to hold pictures.  Color screen at 64,000 colors?  Not sharp or crisp at all.  Album art very hard to look at.  A Lite-Brite would give you a better picture.  Ultimately I didn't give it 1 star because clearly my review is the exception here.  It is possible I received a defective unit straight from the manufacturer.  I did try another one however, swapped out for the Creative Zen Nano and couldn't be happier.
