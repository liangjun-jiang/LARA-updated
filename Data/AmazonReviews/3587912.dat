<Title>Useless and Creative's Customer Service Department stinks
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If this is your first venture into MP3 players like it was mine DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this device. First of all, there is no legally downloadable music to play on this thing. Nothing is compatible. But, go to their website and click on the "Fill Your Zen" link from the Zen Stone Plus 2GB webpage and it gives you all kinds of links to compatible services. Go to the service, sign up for it, and Guess What? It's not compatible. But wait!!?? They advertised that it was? Now try to get help from customer service. They talk in circles, oh yea, by e-mail only... and then to top it off you have to wait at least 24 hours between e-mails to get answers that get you nowhere. In the last e-mail I got customer service finally told me..  "[We] Apologize for any inconvenience caused from this experience. Please allow me to assist you further in resolving the issue.  Prior sending us an email, our website suggested some solutions for the issues that you are having. Some information that I provide might be repetitive, but I want to get you the solutions that have highest probability of resolving your issue.  I regret to tell you that Zen Stone Plus doesn't support Online Music Subscription Services. Therefore you won't be able to transfer any of the online music that you have subscribe whether it is itunes or Yahoo!Unlimited."  Well now, there's some help. All that stuff that they linked me to on their website, its not compatible. And I'm not comfortable downloading pirated music. So now what? I've got a device that does not do what the website said it would do. I call that false advertising and, Oh Yes...hmmm, its a piece of junk.

<Title>Perfect for sports/running and great price!
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased this player and I already love it.  I enjoy the stylish look and feel of the unit, but there's definitely more than meets the eye.  Sound:  I recently sold my iPod Shuffle (2nd Gen) to buy this.  Creative Labs seem to have figured out how to create better-sounding products.  At any rate, I feel that this sounds richer and more clear.  Size/Storage:  At 2 gb for $70, you can't go wrong.  I have a running mix, and it fits easily on the Zen Stone Plus with plenty of room to spare.  As for the size of the actual player, it's really tiny.  I bought the keychain case for mine and just clip it through a belt loop or pocket.  It's also extremely lightweight.  Durability:  This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The iPod is a sturdier MP3 player.  This is all plastic and feels somewhat cheaper.  It can be easily scratched so spend the extra $12.99 to buy a case and you'll be alright.  Overall:  All I can say is this is the perfect player for sports people.  It gets about 9 hours of battery life, so 3 less than iPod shuffles, but it also has the OLED screen with stopwatch, radio, and voice recording features.  The only one I really care about is the stopwatch, but they all work decently enough.    A great substitute for those looking for a little more for less money.  Don't pay for some fancy name brand when you get just as good of quality at half the price.  Not to mention you can simply use Windows Media Player, or drag-and-drop music into the folder without using any software.  Creative makes it so simple!!!

<Title>Zen In Stone
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Withe the success of the Ipod shuffle that Apple redesigned the past year, many MP3 players are getting smaller, and smaller. While that might be a great thing, that actually doesn't mean it will work in full circle with everything you download. When Creative Labs made their Zen Stone recently, there was just so much likeness, to the Ipod shuffle that just didn't actually deliver. You couldn't tell what songs you were going to play, and you had only 10 hours of playback. There was still so much missing, at a price that really isn't all about MP3. Now, they've made a updated version of the Zen Stone, but is it like its prequel between a rock and a hard place?  The Creative Labs Zen Stone Plus, tries to bring in a new edition of the lackluster previous MP3 player, the original Zen Stone, didn't deliver. This version offers a little bit more storage at 2 GB, rather than the previous version, and also you can actually view what songs you're listening too, from the scroll menu. It also features a FM radio, so you can listen to great stations, in a discreet player. You can also simply charge it up, in about an hour with the recharagable battery, and you can also record files using the Zen Stone Plus microphone. Sadaly though, there are a few problems with this MP3 player that still makes it miss a beat. The first problem is that the battery life is very, very short. You only have about 10 hours of playback, rather than a longer battery life from other rechargeable batteries. The second disadvantage is that you can't play music from certain online stores, and you might have some trouble with subscription services,, rather than music downloads itself. It also will not playback downloads from itunes as well.  All in all, despite a few of the same problems, the Creative Labs Zen Stone Plus makes up for some of the problems that were from the smaller storage Zen Stone, but it just could've added a little more to be desired. Although it might be worth it for some, others may want to choose a better MP3 player like the Sansa series from Sandisk, instead.  Price: C 1/2-  Convience: C+  Easy To Operate: B  Overall: C

<Title>Creative zen stone is a nice alternative to the iPod
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen stone is a mice inexpensive choice to combat the iPod Shuffle. Initial setup of the software is very simple and how creative set this MP3 player to act like a USB flash drive makes adding and removing songs and albums quite simple.  The CD ripping software is quite nice and decently fast as well. I have yet to find a CD that it cannot find the Album info for - even my foreign music collection!

<Content>Yeah, it's pretty cool and all like how it's better than an ipod shuffle and costs way less.  The only problem is that you can't search for a song while you are listening to one and it could have better ear buds.  Overall, it's pretty awsome.

<Title>Creative does it again
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been a fan of Creative for almost a decade now. I've had quite a few of their products and have liked them all - Jukebox, Muvo, ZEN Nano. The Stone plus is great. I bought one for me and one for my wife and we both love them. One great thing about Creative is that you don't have to install any special software on your computer to get MP3s onto to the Stone if you don't want to. And I don't. It acts just like a portable drive - no muss, no fuss. The interface is easy to use, clear - even in bright sun with sunglasses on, and has all the needed functions. It is tiny and durable and with the armband this is a great player for workouts - especially bouldering. The battery life is adequate and carries me through most activities. No complaints. An easy five stars. Thanks again, Creative Labs, for giving us an alternative to those fruit players.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the smaller Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Similarly, the Zen V Plus models have a nicer screen.  Somehow, I never was convinced of their durability. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBROQE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Green)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IBNXX2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6129891-4043002">Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Blue)</a>  This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Excellent value
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little unit is awesome.  This is my third MP3 player and they keep getting smaller, cheaper and yet with more storage!  This thing is so small and light I can slip it into my pocket and forget it's there.  I use it primarily to listen to audio books as I work around the house and the battery charge lasts at least 5 hours (as much as I've listened to in one day.)  Then I simply pause the story, plug it into my computer and it recharges in about an hour while I check email and such.  I highly recommend this player for audio books.  I have not checked the sound quality for music files.  The provided ear buds are suitable for my needs.

<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This has been a big disappointment.  My daughter and I have not been able to get it to work at all.  We have read and reread the directions and have made numerous attempts including reinstalling the software.  I received an I-pod as a gift for myself and had no difficulty setting it up.  I wish I had spent the extra money and bought an I-pod Nano for my son.  Reading the reviews and literature, the Zen Stone sounded great,but has prooved not to be.  I am planning to contact Creative and see what they can do for us. Overall-VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
