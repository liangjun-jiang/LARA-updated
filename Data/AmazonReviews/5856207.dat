<Title>Great MP3 player, especially for price I paid
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my wife for christmas and we've had it for almost a month now and we haven't had a problem out of it.  I installed RockBox firmware, it seems to have more options to it than the original firmware but if you don't know much about computers/mp3 players I'd stick with the original firmware, it worked fine just not as much you can play with.  The battery life isn't quite as long as they advertise but it's good enough.  Overall it was a great purchase!

<Title>Great player, lots of features, some annoyances
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>One of the great things about this player is you do not have to install any special software; just drag a folder of MP3s over to it. The best feature is its future potential; the manufacturer brags 'firmware upgradeable' on the box and an Internet search reveals an active user forum and homebrew software available.  I actually found a use for the text file viewer-- it is a handy way to keep track of a new workout routine. Sound quality is good enough for loud rock music while mowing or working out.  There are some minor annoyances in the software. The equalizer does not have enough frequency ranges and introduces some noise. There is not a clear indication when you disable the EQ and turn on the SRS feature. The picture display is cool, but no zoom and pan - even my cell phone does that. However, these are all minor bugs that could be fixed with new software.  One of the advertised features is line in recording - but you don't get the line input jack unless you buy a cradle. Hmmm, why not just use the line input jack on your computer sound card and save the money. I would rather have had a line input and/or a mic jack on the unit itself than the wired remote control jack - the iriver is about the size of a remote control itself so I am not sure what the logic was here.  Like I mentioned earlier these are minor annoyances and I am generally impressed with the performance and sound on the player.

<Title>Great product. but NO support from IRIVER
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall a great player. The unit workes well with Windows media player 10 and is packed with features. The sound quality is excellent. Overall the player would be 5 stars EXCEPT-  IRIVER. This company has no customer service at all. I had a couple  quirky issues with the unit that I needed some help with. Their manual is useless. To-date, over the course of a week I have spent 2+ hours, per evening on 4 different days, on hold with them not able to get through. Good thing I have a speaker phone. They have yet to answer their support line.Its now become a matter of princepal that I get through. I've also sent off two different emails to them and in 5 days they have yet to return a one. Had I known, I would have seleced a different manufacturer.

<Title>Wonderful mp3 player/ipod 
<Date>Sat Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player. Works wonderful out of the box and requires no firmware updates. The sound is wonderful. Much better than the ipod. If you want to try out both the place to go is bestbuy because they have most of the top mp3 players available to test in their store. the headphones that came with the player are ok, but you probaby should go out and buy new ones. Again for the money it is the best player around. It works with most audio services. Unlike the ipod which only uses itunes. It comes with a multitude of features more than the ipod. including fm radio, radio/in line/voice recording. all and all excellent player, easy to use/ tons of features/ pictures/ excellent battery life

<Title>Excellent Produce
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is much better then an IPOD mainly because .. A. It has much better sound. B. It has an FM tuner. C. You don't have to ship it back to the factory (Apple) for $60.00 to $100.00 to change the battery when it starts going bad. There's way too much hype with IPOD. The only thing it has going for it is that it may be a bit easier to use and has a slightly larger screen, but it's not color. For the price the Iriver is a much better deal.

<Title>Wow, speechless
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>8/9/05 UPDATES:  So far so good. I am still enjoying my iRiver. I think my friend wants one, but it's kind of a waste of money since he doesn't even have a 128 CD case yet, and hasn't filled his 64. Besides, he has Windows 98, and the iRiver is only compatable with XP, Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X. The reason I am resumbitting my review is to point out a couple of things I didn't mention before.  1) Songs cannot play in album order. Though you can do this by using the quick list, it becomes frustratingg after awhile.  2) The battery life seemingly lasts more than 16 hours under normal use, more around 20-22 hours, depending on your usage.  3) The battery is not swappable, HOWEVER, iRiver's site said YET...meaning they are making a swapple battery for the H10-20GB. The battery lasts around 4 years, however shortens slowly after the third year. iRiver's website states at 4 years, the battery life will be dropped around -4 hours. Which means even if you get it now your battery will never die.  4) The player DOES seem to support .wav files. I by accident added a .wav file and my friend accidentally played it. The player played the four minute .wav file just fine without hesistation.  5) You can NOT add a song to an exisiting playlist that has been added to the player, a little frustrating. You have to delete the file in My Computer and then add the song again. This could take an immense amount of time if you want to add a large amount of certain songs.  6) Imo, CNET's review should be redone, as they say the navigation is difficult, when it's easy as pie.  So far, I still LOVE my iRiver. So, it's not 100% perfect, but the firmware hasn't even been upgradeable yet, meaning they are working on some new firmware for the H10-20GB.  And, if you haven't read my earlier review, it is posted below.  7/5/05:  I recently bought and returned the YH925GS. Not only did it not have an FM tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a BIG pain.   The MP3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. Like all 20 GB MP3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 CDs). The controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. There are also arrows for them most easy navigation. You'll notice that it's easier to use than most MP3 players on the market today. The battery life is 16 hours. Some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but I guess 16 is okay.   The player also comes with a 1.8" LCD screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. On this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. This is a really cool feature. You can store lyrics or essays in Notepad, then transfer them into the player. This is a VERY cool feature that I will be using more often.   The sound is really good. It doesn't have WOW features that most MP3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. The sound isn't distored at all, and I'm suprised about this.   The player also comes with recordings and FM tuning. THe microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the FM tuner is quite good too. There are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. And listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. How cool is that? Say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. It's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 GB, Radio, and Recording. (the iAudio X5 is the other player that has this...I didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, WTF?)   It's also PlaysForSure compatible, but to use WMP 10, you have to download the drivers from the iRiver website. Unless you have a lot of music on WMP, I would just stick to the drag-n-drop. It's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. My Computer, iRiver) or WMP 10 that's compatable. RealPlayer is compatable, and Napster is too (but I think Napster sucks). To put photos on your MP3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. As a matter of fact, the My Computer>iRiver method is probably the best. I have no reason why you would want/need WMP 10 or Real to manage music. Though, I guess to have further options, you would need it. But otherwise, it's VERY easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. But remember, if you can't get Windows to understand the H10, you'll need to go to iRiver's website and download the new drivers. I wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.   Overall, if you want the great combination of 20 GB, WMA and MP3, Recording, Drag-N-Drop (no hassle with WMP or Real), and FM radio, you just HAVE to have the H10.

<Title>Good product.... bad faults.
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I'm not 13. Now onto the product. I purchased this in the beginning of July. I grew tired of my CD player and went to Best Buy and debated between this or a Creative Zen. The specs were about the same so it came down to the looks of the player. The iRiver H10 is the best looking one out there. It's small, light and has a vivid color display. The player is also very easy to maneuver. I never really put the text feature to use or even tried it out and the picture feature is nice although i do not know what the significance of it is but I guess some would find it useful. Sound quality is excellent and you can change most of the options to fit your needs (backlighting, scroll speed, etc). Custom EQ, FM Radio, this player has it all. Of course this product has it's cons. It freezes up very often. I noticed this happening more and more as I started filling up the player more. It's not that troubling to take out the battery and putting it back, though. Two weeks after I got it I ended up exchanging it for another because the play/pause and fast forward buttons were becoming hard to push, which irritated me. Now that I have the new one for almost a month the back button occasionally does the same thing. Also, one morning it just kept crashing for no apparent reason. I had to remove the battery during a freeze-up while the system was initializing and it completly erased all my songs. But when I plugged it back to the USB I saw they were still on the player, just not actually appearing when I tried to play them on the iriver. So then I went to the iRiver website and  tried a firmware update which solved the problem and allowed me to start placing songs that would appear on my player. I was still angered about having to go through the trouble of putting all the songs back once again. In conclusion, this is a very good product even though it has major faults but then again..dont all mp3 players do? If you're planning on buying this from a store I strongly suggest purchasing a waranty or else you may regret it later on.

<Title>As good as the Zen Micro with the bonus of the color screen
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Zen Micro and I cant say enough good things about it.  My girlfriend thought it was cute so I gave it to her.  I was going to buy another one when I did some research.  The H10 had some mixed reviews but after using it for a week now it looks like user error...i'll explain later.  First if you have Rhapsody to Go (which I do) you cant complain about the price...its only $100 after the rebate...wow!  Ok now back to the user error section.  Many people complain that the songs are played in alphabetical order.  Yes you can do it that way of you select an album and hit the play button on the side of the H10. If you use the o button instead of the play, you get the album to play as intended.  Pretty simple but I can see how it would get a little confusing.  So just for that I will lower my rating to four stars.  Other than that its the perfect little player.  As good as the Zen Micro with a color screen.  Buy it!

<Title>Absent customer service from Iriver
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player for my son who needed to travel within 2 days. The setup with Rhapsody required several phone calls for tech assistance and they were very helpful. But after one day the MP3 player froze. A call to Iriver said that they would answer the call within 2-3 business days. We found the reset button ourselves and the player has been OK since. Its best to buy this product from a company that can render assistance much sooner.

<Title>The Good, the OK, and the Bad
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iriver H10 20GB (Blue) about three weeks ago after saving and researching for about 6 months.  In summary, I have been very happy with the player and would definitely buy it again.    The Good  The sound quality is very good.  The included ear buds are fine (I'm not a fan of ear buds in general), but the source is clean and accurate and you can spend as much or as little on after-market headphones as you like.  There is a lot of control over the EQ.  Virtually all of my music is in Variable Bit Rate MP3 format.  The H10 supports MP3 and the Microsoft format (WMF).  I don't use iTunes (ACC) or Audible so lack of support for those formats is not an issue for me.  The form factor is nice.  It's about the same size as a deck of cards and fairly light.  It fits in my hand or a pocket easily.  The user interface works well with either one or two hands.  The controls are simple, intuitive and make sense.  (I recommend you read the short manual or it might take you a while to stumble onto some of the more subtle features.)  The thumb slider works well, even with a large list to scroll through-when your thumb hits the end of the slider, the display keeps scrolling.  Using the slider to control volume rather than a physical knob or wheel is a good idea.  One of my main reasons for picking the H10 was the FM tuner.  I like to listen to National Public Radio and other local stations.  The tuner has good reception and it is easy to program stations as presets.  I have used the ability to record an FM transmission a few times already.  The color display is bright and clear.  The screen layouts make sense and have useful information.  I don't have a reason to use the player to display pictures (other than when showing off the player), but it does have this ability.  I had no problems getting Windows XP to recognize the player-it shows up as a USB drive.  Data transfer rates have been good for a USB device.  I've loaded my entire library several times as I've played with different software besides Windows Media Player.  It takes about an hour and a half to transfer 12GB.  Some reviewers have complained that the player locks up when they used Windows to browse the player's hard drive.  It does take a while to display the contents of folders on the player, but I haven't had the player or Windows actually lock up.  The battery life has been good.  I've taken it on a couple of multi-day trips and haven't run it down completely.  The OK  The player is designed to work with Microsoft Windows Media Player 10 (included on CD with the player).  WMP does all of the basic things you want:  rip, organize, update ID3 tags, build playlists, sync with the player.  Of course it takes Microsoft's typical "software for dummies" approach-it doesn't do any of the things as well as some other programs and you can't change the way it behaves, where it stores your music files, etc.  ("Sorry ma'am, but you don't need to know the bit rate we're using to encode your music.  Move along now...")  But, if you are willing to be assimilated (resistance is futile!), it can manage your music collection and player adequately.  Fortunately, because you can copy the music files directly to the player using Windows, you can use any software you wish.  I like to use FreeRIP to create the mp3 files-it works very well, queries freedb so you don't have to type in any information, supports variable bit rate encoding, and is free.  To use the player with a lot of content, having clean ID3 tags is critical.  ID3 tags store the information about the music file (artist, album, title, genre, etc.) in the MP3 file.  I tried Windows Media Player, but again ended up using a different free program (MP3Tag) that worked better, especially when cleaning up hundred of files at a time.  Some reviewers have complained that the player will not play songs in the order that they were on the album.  Remember that the players has only the information in the ID3 tags and the file names to work with.  It doesn't seem to use the "Track" tag, but you can get it to play in album order if you include the track number in the file name and play songs in alphabetic order.  For example, I name my music files "Artist - Album - Track# - SongTitle.mp3."  99% of the time I have the player on random shuffle.  I'm still looking for a program that can make it easier to sync the player and manage playlists.    I don't expect the software to be an issue for the typical owner-I tend to be very particular.  I suppose the support for text files is useful, if you wanted to keep some reference files on the device.  I've read novels on a Palm Pilot, so I'm not opposed to using a small device for reading, but electronic devices have a long way to go to before they can match the performance and convenience of paper for pleasure reading.  Some reviewers have mentioned having to upgrade the firmware and having to remove the battery to reset the player.  The H10 20GB does not have a firmware upgrade release yet, and it resets very easily by pressing a small recessed button with a paper clip.  I have had to reset the player a couple of times, but it reboots quickly and this hasn't been a big deal.  The Bad  Bad is relative.  Nothing I've encountered with the player is truly "bad."   Probably my worst complaint is that there is a brittle-sounding click in the headphones as the player changes songs.  I don't really notice it any more, but at first it was annoying.  I like to listen to longer material, audio books and old radio programs, and fast-forwarding to a mid-point to resume listening can take a while, even with the scan rate set to max (6x).  A progressive scan (longer you hold it down, the faster it goes) would be more effective and intuitive.  The player comes with a white translucent silicone protective cover.  It has a belt clip and is soft and does a good job of protecting the player, even if it is not the most attractive thing I've seen.  I've listed it under the Bad category because it also makes it difficult to feel the Prev Track/Play/Next Track buttons through the silicone.  I haven't had to call iriver for support yet, but have no illusions about the quality of live support that will be available.  Unfortunately, no one provides good customer support.  Best we can hope for is a device that is made well enough that the need for support is rare.  So far, the H10 20GB seems to fall into this category.  Because the player is designed to be a copy of your master library, there's no obvious way to delete files (even ones you've recorded using the player's FM tuner) using the player's interface.  You have to connect it to your computer for this.  There's also no obvious way to figure out how much disk space is left on the player, either from the player or from Windows.  As a work-around, I add up the size of the various media directory trees on my computer to estimate how much space is left.  I'm hoping both of these are addressed by firmware upgrades.   Oh.. and I wish I had gotten red.
