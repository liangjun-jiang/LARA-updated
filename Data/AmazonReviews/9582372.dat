<Title>Great Product but no movie recording capability
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a geat product that I have been waiting for. But, the fact that this device could not record any movie (comparing to: Lyra RD2780, Archos, and more are coming with movie recording capability) really make this product inferior. I have called the customer service and they told me that they don't have any plan to support the movie recording capability. I hope they can oversee this weakness and change their mind to support the movie recording capability on the next firmware release.

<Date>Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my media player for about 3 weeks and it is great once you figure out how to work it, the user manual is a piece of trash!Converting dvd to the formats that are supported takes a bit of time and finding a freeware program to do it is a little hard but can be done.Picture quality is very good audio quality is good battery life is great.I also wish that you could record video directly to the hard drive.Would make loading movies alot easier.

<Title>Ugly device with short battery life
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Even though the manufacturer claims "up to" 5 hours of playback time with video files, in actual usage it's more like less than 3 hours.  Audio playback is comparable to the iPod's battery life.  But the PMP120 is ugly and childish in styling.  I don't understand why, for $400, they force you to carry something people will laugh at you for.  It's also heavier than "pocketable".  As many people have pointed out, you cannot record DVDs directly.  We know that ripping DVDs is illegal in the U.S.  Whether recording directly into an inferior quality format is legal or not, that I don't know, but at least with products like Archos Gmini400 and Archos AV320/340/360, you can simply hook up your DVD player and record to the Archos without hassle.  The PMP120 forces you to rip first (committing a crime in doing so) before you can transfer the video.  Lastly, the screen is no good on the PMP120, as it's barely visible outdoors, even on an overcast day.  It's strictly for indoor use.  All considered, this is a poorly implemented device.  If it were under $200, I'd given it two stars.  But it's an insult to consumers for them to charge so much money for so little usable features.  If you want a portable multimedia gadget, check out the aforementioned Archos products.  (No, I don't work for Archos, or any other electronics company.)  E-mail me if you have questions about portable multimedia.

<Title>Overall i-river quality
<Date>Wed Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a warning about i-riverI do not have this specific i-river product, but I have purchased two of their products in the past, and the quality of both began to deteriorate within months.  Both of them damaged numerous sets of headphones, wearing the connectors to the point that only one earpiece would work.  On one of my players, the backlight on the LCD stopped working, and on the other the connection between the player and the USB chord no longer holds properly, preventing me from changing any of the MP3's on a 64 MB player.  When I contacted the company about these problems they gave me the good ole runaround, basically vouching for the poor qaulity of their products.  I will not being buy any of their products again.

<Title>5 out of 5, Just go out and try it. 
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Actually I was waiting for the portable media player from Microsoft. But I heard unfortunately it won't come out soon. And I found out that iriver is in partnership with Microsoft for the portable media player.   Anyway, I've been using this little surprise for a week. I think it beats any portable media players in the market.   The battery hour is very long. I roughly guess it lasts at least 3 times longer than my wife's Ipod. The lcd display could be bigger, but still quite large as a portable player. Speaking of the quality of sound, you know irivier has superior sound quality to any other players.   I'm a digital camera mania. This device not only save files through the usb fort but also host usb port. So you can read all the image files directly from the digital cameras. This is fantastic.   It also has a FM tuner. One thing I found really great is that you can record the music directly from the radio, and you can control the quality of sound files. It may be some kind of music piracy. Not sure though.   In sum, believe me, this one is a killer toy. I hope the price will be lower so that I can buy one for my brother.

<Title>Finally a PVP that I can tolerate
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had bought Creative PVP sometime back, but had to return it bcoz it uses Microsoft Media Player. Wrong media player choice. It makes the whole process of uploading media very tiresome and slow. So i returned the Creative.  I checked iRiver at the store and found that it did NOT use Windows Media Player. So  I bought it. I have been playing with it over the past couple of weeks. It provides a DIVX codec software and associated media converter software, that makes importing videos easy. Use the Portable Media Center DIVX profile, when coverting videos.I use the AVI format to upload videos onto the player. It is also a full featured mp3 player, voice recorder and a fm tuner. The speakers are little bit low in volume, so have to use headphones in noisy situations. The fit and finish of the hardware is not as nice as Creative. The software has some spelling mistakes such as "FM Tunner" instead of "FM Tuner". But at the end of day, it does what it is supposed to do. And it provides all the software and cables right out of the box.  I am in process of creating a PC based DVR solution, to capture and record live TV. iRiver will then become my portable video system. iRiver can also send video signal's to TVs through a provided port and cables.Provides USB Master port capabilities to interact with other USB port capable devices, without using a PC. It comes with a nice hard case, that U can use to carry it around and to even prop it up while watching it on an airplane. Battery is removable type, so u can buy an extra one, if U are on a really long flight. PVP space is still evolving fast, so expect to see lots more new models coming out in next couple of months. If like me, u want one right away, iRiver is an reasonable choice. You will need some experience in media conversion to successfully import videos in a watchable format. Experiment with video sizing, audio mixing etc till u get it right.  iRiver has also released another PVP that uses Windows Media Player. Do not buy that, unless you have a full featured Windows Media Center PC.  An update to the review. Using Pinnacle Dazzle DVC 80 Video capture device (USB based) and excellent Pinnacle Video Capture Software, I have been able to successfully capture TV output and import into iRiver. I had to reconvert the Dazzle AVI output files to iRiver AVI using the iRiver media converter software. Now I have a complete portable video solution. I am a bit surprised it all actually worked. I was even able to capture HD channel outputs from my DISH TV satellite box using the AV components in the back of the satellite receiver.

<Title>Annoying!  Avoid, avoid, avoid!
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was very excited to get this player as a holiday gift.  I was looking forward to watching the TV shows I recorded using Windows Media Center edition on it.  But this turns out to be impossible - the PMP-120 runs a Linux operating system and does NOT convert recorded TV files (*.dvr-ms) and moreover it won't sync with Windows Media Player 10, which would in fact convert such files.   I spent five hours trying to set it up to watch TV and only learned this sorry fact through extensive Googling.  Certainly I could not learn this from the embarassing manual or from the poor automated help service at iriver itself, nor from the 800 number (I spent 45 minutes on hold then gave up).  Apparently the PMC-120 (PMC not PMP) is in fact Windows Media Player compatible, but at this point I'm not sure I'll trust another Iriver product, because their support is so poor.  Stay far, far away from this!

<Title>"the coolest" way to get junk "on the market"
<Date>Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't make the same mistake I did! I signed up for one of those get-iRiver-free "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Within one day, I received over 200 spam emails and 15 telemarketing calls. What a pain. I guess there really is something to the saying "you can't get something for nothing".  I hope everybody here will learn from my extremely bad experience and avoid these ridiculous pyramid schemes.

<Title>Mediocre
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It does what it says it will do. However, the player has enormous trouble with Xvid, regardless of settings. Plan on only encoding in Divx. With Divx, it can handle 1500kbps, 640x480@30fps and lots of B-frames. It also must have CBR-MP3 to play the video in sync, so if you have VBR with anything, you must encode it over to CBR. The screen isn't particularly detailed because the pixel size is so large. With video, you are limited to 192kbps for audio; anything higher will cause a desync.  It also tends to hang while playing a "non-standard" movie (such as VBR-MP3 or Xvid). You will have to remove the battery to reset the machine and allow for control response again. This problem is alleviated by making absolutely sure you're using Divx and CBR-MP3. On top of that, you lose the ability to fast-forward/rewind through movies above ~650MB. If you have a 1.3GB movie, you'll need to break that up into smaller chunks if you plan on being able to fast-forward through it. It'll play the larger file, and it'll even continue the movie at the stop point, but you will not be able to fast-forward.  Doesn't play Vorbis/FLAC/ACC/AC3 audio, but it will handle VBR-MP3 just fine. The playlists are fairly standard, and the player will let you make your own playlists. The radio uses the headphone cord for it's antenna, and it does a good job with gain. Radio reception is good. There is a built-in microphone for recording audio to MP3, but you cannot record from the radio.  The player comes with iRiver's own little converter, and it's extraordinarly poor. They have pre-selected options, and it is adjusted for encoding speed, not quality. Plus it will crash if you have various codecs on your machine.     You spend more than what you get. There are superior products available for less money. 2 stars because of the price, 3 stars for the machine itself.

<Title>From the moment I took it out the box to the moment I sent it back
<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered it so it came before my holiday, to do something for the long journeys. It arrived a few days before and I opened up the box. First observation, its f***ing massive! But I decided to be optimistic, as it just about fitted into my pocket. I plugged it into the computer and turned it on. I soon realised I had brought a computer rather than an MP3/4 player. However, I figured that I might fall in love with it still, and shoved some songs on. There is no way to effectivley group them by album (the device doesnt do this itself), but only by artist. To do this you must put them in folders of the artist name, and subfolders for the album name. I shoved all my 1,500 songs from itunes on and took a scan round. I couldnt find The Distillers, and realised that I should be looking under T and not D. This is because it arranges them strictly by alphabetical order, as it is a computer, not an mp3 player. But I figured I could live with this. Then I decided to open the folder. I assumed it would be instantaneous, but it took a good 5-10 seconds to open an artist folder! This is no music player, its a crap computer! But I decided to shove some films on to see what it was like. I downloaded an avi film and tried to put it on. There was a file error. I went to the help on the website and it said some AVI files are not equal to others. Bloody hell... better get out the software that came with it. Wait, I can't install it because the serial code doesnt work. I managed to get another off the internet, and eventually shoved on a film that worked. But guess what... the sound was out of time to the picture. I sent it back.

<Content>Most of the people who don't like are the people who don't know how to record the radio or how to put movies on it.It's a good product that is very organized with a big screen compared to ipod video, and is only about $200 used. So if I were you I'd buy it.

<Title>Faulty Faulty Faulty!
<Date>Thu May 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was given this as a gift for Christmas and just over 3 months after I recieved it, I put it on charge for a night, and came back to it and the screen had a dead spot in it. The next time I put it on charge, it completely messed up the whole screen to where now nothing is visible anymore. And the player only has a 90 day warranty, and when I tried to contact Iriver about the problem, I recieved no response. You will probable be better off buying an Ipod that plays both mp3s and videos instead of this product.

<Title>AVI files
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just wanted to point out to the guy that gave the PMP a bad review because he couldn't get an AVI file to play that AVI files CAN IN FACT BE ONE OF MANY DIFFERENT FORMATS.  So unless a video player actually supports all the formats, you'll run into this with any player.  And unless the company pays licensing fees for certain formats, the support will be shoddy.  At least iRiver products don't artificially restrict your freedom to use different formats by only allowing you to play wmas and mp3s.  There are other formats out there that are free that manufacturers avoid due to the pressure to implement DRM as a means to restrict your experience as an end user.  Basically, if you use a Windows-based product you're supporting a group of people who actively work to take away our digital rights.  Which, hey, I've done it too.  I forgive you.
