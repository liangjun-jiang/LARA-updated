<Title>Not as good as the 2nd generation
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The wide body styling is awkward and the smaller click wheel is harder to manuever. I have the 2nd generation and like it much better. I love the tall thin slick styling on it. The only plus with the 3rd gen is more gigs for your money, but bottom line it's styling holds it back. I'll be returning.

<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is actually my first I-pod, so I thought it was perfect to try, especially if you don't want to spend alot of money on something that you might not like...But I have to say that I actually like it, especially with the added feature (Video) and the music advantages. Even though its a small gadget the video is great, at first it's kind of difficult to watch movies/tv shows, but if you stare at the screen for a couple of minutes, you forget how tiny it is. I have to say that I was impressed with the battery life also, I can play like 50 songs, watch 2 tv shows (42 min a piece), and watch movies (over an hour and a half each)...very impressive. With that said I am going to advance to the 80GB I-pod Classic with Video (very soon).

<Title>ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even though I'm a "senior citizen," I have craved an iPod for quite some time.  When the new 4 GB Nano recently became available, I decided to take the plunge.  For Amazon's part, the transaction couldn't have been smoother.  In fact, the iPod arrived much sooner than Amazon predicted.  No problem there.  However, for me -- someone who'd never even handled a music player -- initially I found the Nano confusing to use.  The directions that come with the device are minimal, at best, and you must go online for the complete user's manual (over 75 pages).  Also, it was a bit challenging when it came to learning how to download music, videos and other media into the Nano.  Now, after a few weeks, I'm glad to say that using the iPod has become "old hat" for me.  It's a great little "toy" at an affordable price.

<Title>Love it.
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never owned an ipod before until last year when someone gave me a shuffle for a present. I use it primarily for listening to podcasts and audio books.  When the new ipod nano came out I knew I had to have one.   After using it for a few days, I thought about upgrading to an ipod with a larger screen, but decided against it until some of the inevitable kinks are worked out and prices decline (hopefully). I mean, it's a big jump going from $150 to $250 for the next size screen.  The main complaint I have is that the scrolling goes so fast that you sometimes miss the menu you want. It will just take some getting used to. Also, if you want to play an audio book on slow, it has a funny sound. For the price Apple charges, a little pouch should be included to protect the unit. It would be a lot more useful than an Apple sticker!  As I wait (and I WILL get an ipod in the future with a larger screen), I'm so enjoying this little thing of beauty, to which I've added family pix and video. Sure the screen is small, but the resolution and detail are quite amazing.   I'm very pleased and excited about my purchase. btw, I'd give it a 4.5 star but there isn't the option.

<Title>I love my little nano
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third MP3 player I've owned, and the first iPod.  It took some deciding to figure out which model I would buy.  I knew I wasn't going to be watching movies or TV episodes on a screen measuring a few square centimeters, so I didn't need 80 gigabytes or whatever of storage.  I also knew from past experience that my music player was going to get banged around, so I wanted a flash drive that wouldn't skip or jam.  That ruled out the full-size iPods.  I was torn between the 4 GB and the 8 GB iPod nano.  I went for the 4 GB, and I'm satisfied with my choice, though now I can see that the 8 GB would have been pretty sweet too. Pros & cons:  In favor of the 4 GB nano, I can say that all I want to carry around in my pocket are the highlights of my music collection -- the stuff I'll actually listen to when I'm commuting or working out.  And that's substantially less than 10 GB of music.  In favor of the 8 GB nano, you need half a gig of storage for the iPod software, so the 4 GB is really more like 3.5 GB.  So the 8 GB model would have given me more flexibility.  About the iPod nano generally: It's delightfully small & lightweight, it's easy to use, it has a high-quality screen despite its size, and the sound output seems good. However, the included earbuds are total crap -- they may be useful for strangling an attacking chihuahua, but that's about it.  Music lovers will want to replace them with something more substantial (I went for portable Sennheisers and they're great).  Also on the negative side, I don't find the iTunes interface very congenial.  I used to use MusicMatch and I found it far easier.  With MusicMatch, the user was in control.  With iTunes, it's Apple all the way.  But none of these negatives outweighs the fact that the iPod nano is an excellent little music machine.

<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This iPod is everything I expected a more.  4GB of storage might not be enough for some but is is plenty for storing music.  Perhaps for a lot of video material or many CD albums it would not be.  It is easy to use and is great in cataloging music into easy to find categories.  It "syncs" beautifully with iTunes on my iMac.  Battery life is good.  I can think of no problems with this device.

<Title>I admit it, it's as good as everyone says...
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I resisted getting an ipod for many years - I've owned four or five different brands of PC-oriented mp3 players (creative, sandisk, rio, etc.) over the years and I suspected that the ipod-lovers were exaggerating the hype. I gave in and got the Nano 3g because, well, I'm not sure -- I guess I wondered whether it was really that good. And it turns out, yeah, it is. Not even including the ability to watch videos, which is really fun, even though the screen is small (now I want a Touch!), the ipod interface, especially including the usability of Itunes, is far superior to any other player I've used.  Another reason I was hanging back was because I had a large collection of recordings in the wma format, which the ipod didn't use to be able to play. I'm not sure when they added this codec, but now Itunes can convert wma files to mp3. It works smoothly and quickly, so that objection goes by the wayside too. I also loved the idea of using my Nano as a rudimentary PDA. Apple claims you can access Outlook calendar, address book, and notes on it. This is only partly true. Calendar conversion is iffy (many complaints about this on the Apple forums!), although it has worked -- more than half the time -- for me. Notes doesn't work at all, although there's a menu item for it on the iPod itself. My address book has worked fine. I tried a 3rd-party software (Ipodsync) to improve this functionality, but it didn't work well enough to justify buying. So I'm only halfway sold on that, but I must admit that the ipod is after all primarily a media player, and on that criterion it's been fun to use and totally satisfying. I hear audiophiles complain about the sound quality, but for me it's been totally acceptable.  Summary: Advantages:  Easy and fun to use, especially for downloading podcasts and video using Itunes Disadvantages: Excessively sensitive click wheel compared to other iPod models I've tried Problems with PDA functions

<Content>I'm 63 and thought it would be great to have an iPod.  This item is easy to use.  Downloading the iTunes software (free) helps you organize your iPod with the music you love to hear.  The ear phones were not comfortable for me since I wear a hearing aide.  So I purchased a Voss headphone.  I use my iPod around the house and at the office.  I know iPod have been around for years but suddentely thought it's about time to try one out.  The price was right and the shipping was free.  Can't bear that.

<Title>MAC USERS!!! Read This First!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I hated to rate this product ONE STAR because I'm sure it is a sweet little unit as many of the reviews do say. What you Mac Users need to know is that you CANNOT USE 3RD GENERATION IPODS on Mac OSX 3.9 or below. In fact, you must have OSX 4.8 or later.   This information is not prominent at all on the product description. I even called the technical help for selecting a product or accessories and I was told that all I needed was a computer, itunes and this Ipod to be all set up. After ordering and receiving this beautifully designed mp3 player I discovered that I could not use it as my "ancient" G3 machine cannot (at least easily) be upgraded to system 4.8. So after several phone calls to customer service and the hassle of sending it all back and waiting for refunds, I ordered an older 2nd generation ipod which has yet to arrive at this writing.   Amazon should put this information about system requirements more prominent or top of the list on the product page instead of "buried" in other links on the page.   I must say that Amazon's customer service is top notch! The people I talked to were very helpful, understanding and professional. I give them 5 stars under the circumstances. I expect this matter to be resolved to my complete satisfaction.   It just seems like this whole issue could have been avoided by making the product information on system requirements more prominent. I'm sure that I'm not the first nor the last customer to purchase this Ipod only to have to return it as I did. I just hope this and other reviews will catch their eye and they can avoid what I and others have gone through.

<Title>Nice pod
<Date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first iPod. So I can't compare it to previous versions like some reviewers so successfully have done. But it has a crisp, bright video playback that I find especially kind to my eyes. It also sports a very thin all-metal body.   One thing I really appreciate is the excellent battery life. So many players, and other electronics, don't offer good battery life. This unit also has built-in games and an advanced user interface. I don't use the games much. But it's sort of nice to have them.  I find the body a bit wide for my liking. I also think the scroll wheel is slightly smaller than I'd like. I was also a bit disappointed with the audio. When I played it in the car, I noticed some static and distortion. I didn't have that with my former player.  I use mine mostly for mp3s. I like the fact that it holds a ton of them so I'm not constantly having to reload like I did with my Creative Zen.  I also find that the price is reasonable. All in all, I think it's a good device and, if it fits your needs, you should consider buying it. I personally think it may be better suited to those who use it more for video than audio, however. On the other hand, most people may not even notice that the audio is not quite up to par.   I would have given five stars if the audio was a bit better.

<Content>This was iPod's chance to build in an FM tuner (with perhaps an antenna extension wire to plug into the earphone jack into which headphones could be plugged or not as the listener wished).  But they didn't add this tuner, and therefore all the nice little iPod speakers that recharge the iPod while the "remote" FM tuner is plugged in are useless.  I'll wait for the next generation of iPods and then, hopefully there will be an FM tuner inside!

However, disappoint abounds with the service (or lack there of) of my POST order questions.  With this purchase I was to recieve 5 free mp3 downloads from Amazon.  After many tries, I finally emailed Amazon and questioned if I needed a code or a special site to take advantange of this offer.  I assumed, incorrectly, that a representative would research my order and simply send me the information in question-especially as I am a long time Amazon customer.  Imagine my surprise when my reply instructed me to call Amazon to further research this.   Although disappointed in having to go this route....I called and was unsuccessfull reaching a person.  At this point I gave up and went to itunes.  I think that if you are to make an offer, you need to respond to people who want to take advantage of it.  This is not the customer service I am used to from Amazon.

<Content>The Ipod Nano 4GB is a very good product.  Although 4GB falls a little short for video, it's just perfect for my daughter.  I do think however there's alot to improve on the iTunes interface.  Uploading additional music is always a hassle.   It would be alot easier if it worked like a flash memory, where we could just add and delete songs whenever desired.  It's also a hassle to get certain types of video uploaded and to syncronize from different user accounts, even if on the same PC.

<Title>The nano is great!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 4 GB iPod nano is wonderful.  I looked at online reviews and talked to a lot of people and overwhelmingly the iPods were the favorite.  I have really enjoyed mine and am excited to get even more music loaded.  I have found the nano very easy to use.  The only down side would be how fragile it looks and feels but have not actually found it to be fragile.  The new nano is so small and I have taken it everywhere with no problems.

Now you can listen to your favorite music and view your favorite photos at the same time-And that's only the beginning.  It has so many other features- can watch T.V. programs, movies etc. I'm so glad I got this.  The technology is awesome!

<Title>How to reset if your IPOD Nano 3rg gen lock up
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>How to reset if your IPOD Nano 3rg gen lock up. I had my nano 3rd gen plug in the sync cable and happen to reboot my PC.  My PC surprisingly try to do a boot level checkdisk (before Vista/Window kick in).  I wonder what disk it trying to check since it never try to do that before, so I told it to skip the disk check. It turn out that Vista/Window think my nano is a hard disk.  It did something because for next couple hours I could not get the Nano to show up in itune. I did make a "blunk blunk" sound when I plug and unplug the cable, indicating that at driver level the system does recognize but the Nano gone into a "COMMA" when vista/window try to access/checkdisk it as a hard drive. Vista's Manages drive does show it come in and out as Ipod, but Itune and nano just stay in a non responsive comma.  After trying everything for couple hour, I tried the reboot sequence: Press and hold the Menu and the "Center buttons" for at least 10 seconds, and the Apple logo appear and the nano is back in business.  Therefore do no reboot with Nano 3rg gen plugged in and when it goes in into a "COMMA" reboot it with the "Menu&Center" combo punch.  Buy Apple Stock, no one can make a product this thin and sexy.  It's like buying Windows 3.1 back in 1991.  You'll make 20x your money in 5 years.

<Content>This is my first i Pod, and its great, for the price you just can't go wrong, first up the screen is bigger, nice interface, pretty decent extras, although i don't use them much and 4G of memory. This version is excellent for the person with minimal video needs. However if you're looking for good video functionality i would strongly recommend the 8G or an i Pod classic, since i started downloading podcasts, I'm in need of more space. All in all an excellent product.

<Title>Yes, a music player can be too small
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The nano is thin and pretty, and picture quality is amazing, but the device feels too insubstantial.  It's so thin and lightweight that it frequently falls from my pocket, and there are no sleeves available yet.  Also, the selection wheel is inconsistent - at times, it is so sensitive that it will rocket up the volume or advance to the next song at the slightest touch, and at other times it has to be carefully manipulated to get it to do what you want it to do.  I also prefer the set-up that puts the headphone jack at the top - with the jack at the bottom, the device can only be slipped upside down into a shirt or pants pocket.  I wish Apple had made some of the traditional iPods available at smaller sizes (with corresponding price reduction).  I liked the feel of my old iPod photo in my hand but don't care to shell out that much money again for a device that only lasts a couple of years.

<Title>Superb Upgrade From A Wonderful Gen 2
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I became smitten by the ergonomics and design of the 2nd gen Nano. When the 3rd gen came about, the addition of video capability called to me. I have passed my gen 2 to my wife. The video of the 3 gen is truly impressive. I'd never expect to be comforable watching a full two hour film on such as small screen, yet the sharpness, brightness and clarity of the Nano screen making watching even that long a film a pleasure! I am very impressed with the Nano,as you can see.   I added the V-Moda Bass Freq headphones for under $35 and the resulting sound reproduction is just superb.

<Title>Best for me purchase this year
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this because I ride the bus to work now and needed a distraction from the noise. Now I don't know how I did without it. I love that fact that you can not only download music, but movies,TV shows, and videos as well.  I will say though, if you want to download TV shows or  movies and pics that it would be better if you get the 60GB or 80GB nano as I only have about 300 songs on my 4GB and am running low on space.  If I added my shows on, I would not be able to have much more music. The sound quality is outstanding. Don't know why I waited so long to get one.

<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first iPod, so I'm a total novice. Seems to be fairly easy to use. I bought it to use on my Gold Wing motorcycle. I am able to plug the auxillary jack from the bike into the earphone jack on the iPod and play it through the bikes sound system. I can control the volume with the bike's volumn control, but everything else must be done on the iPod. I just put it on random, play all songs, repeat all, and let it go. The one thing that I do not like is the "click wheel", way to twitchy for me, that is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. I download my own CD's into itunes then download to the iPod. It seems very user friendly, it's one of those if I can do it anyone can kind of things. I'm sure there are other MP3 players that are just as good. I think I would let price and features be my guide.

<Content>I ordered this Apple 4GB iPod for a Christmas gift for a family member.  When it hadn't arrived in ten days, I called Amazon and they said it was probably lost in the Christmas shipping load.  They sent another one out, overnight, at no charge.  On Christmas Eve an ipod was delivered to my home.  It was the original order.  Then, on Christmas Day, another box was left on the doorstep.  It was the replacement.  I was amazed and pleased.  I called Amazon the next week and made arrangements to send the replacement back.  I have never had such courtesy and speed in receiving something from the internet.  I will continue to shop at Amazon because if someone slips up, they will take care of it. Thanks Amazon......the ipod was well received by the recipient.

<Title>No support for military or other Americans abroad
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you support the military and foreign services workers abroad please consider this. I am an American who was assigned for work to Africa last year. I bought my ipod and set it up as if I lived in the States as that's my home. I just got re-assigned to Germany. When I tried to use the Ipod on a new PC I found out that Apple will not let me into my account because they can tell I'm in Germany and it's their policy to only let you use your account in the country you live. I therefore have lost the ability to access my Ipod and copy the tunes from it back into itunes. I contacted a friend in the military in Afghanistan and he reports the same for the soldiers stationed there. Apple will not support them either. From the itunes support desk... "Unfortunately if you are unable to access your iTunes Store accounts I will be unable to assist you, as per the Terms of Service agreement, due to the fact that you are outside of the intended geographical area."

<Title>Another - I Love It
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I resisted for years buying an MP3 player, especially the I-Pod, because it seemed expensive and there were problems with the original versions. Broke down and got one after a co-worker whose opinion I trust gave the new nano-3G a good grade. I love it. It was so easy to set up and get running on my Windows XP AMD PC. I had already installed and used I-Tunes so it was up to date. I just plugged it in and go; the ease of setup is amazing. I am going to download the complete manual and get into it, but the startup guide that came with it was enough to get me going and listening to music in a few minutes. I also downloaded the new 1.1 level of software and let it install that, no problem. The sound quality is not awesome but very good. If there is one rub that I have the controls are a bit erratic, but hopefully that is just a learning curve issue, and so far not enough of a distraction to lessen my opinion (for what it is worth) of a very fine product.

<Title>iPOD Nano vs. iPhone
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have both the iPod Nano and the iphone.   First, here is my review of the iPod Nano.  The pictures don't do justice to this tiny technological marvel. It is very thin (thickness of 2 quarters) and less than a quarter size of my average sized hand. If you are looking for a smallest MP3 player with a screen, I would look no further than than Nano.  It not only plays music well, but it plays videos reasonably well on its high definition screen. You can watch an entire movie on this device. How cool is that?  Couple of pointers: 1)Because ipod showcases the album covers and others bits of information about each song, each AAC track takes little more space on its flash drive. Only about 3.6GB of 4GB are usuable for music/video storage (the rest is used primarily by the OS). This is only sufficient for about 1000-1500 (depending on the bits) songs and a few videos. If you have more than 1000 songs in your iTunes, I suggest purchasing the 8GB version.  2)The Operating System of this device does crash occassionally. You can reboot the device by simultaneously pressing on the middle button and the menu button for about 5 seconds (you will need this info so save this review =) ).  3)Contrary to a popular belief, the sound quality is primarily determined by the quality of the headphones and not the MP3 player. The iPod headphones are of the bare minimum quality (but far superior to those used in Sony Walkmans of the 1980s). If you are an audiophile and have some extra money, I recommend getting a good earphone from Shure (E310, E410, E510).    iPod Nano vs iPhone  1)Sound quality: the sound quality of both devices are identifical. iPhone, however, has an annoying non-standard earphone plug-in which requires an adapter for the third party earphones.   2)User Interface: iPhone has possibly the greatest user interface created by Man. It is not only functional but fun to use. Flipping through the albums in the iPhone's ipod is one of most beautiful GUIs ever developed. The Nano has a typical iPod user interface that use the iPod buttons to navigate through music.   3)Battery Life: Nano has the edge here. iPhone, although posessing a reasonably good battery life, is a natural battery hog. The prime reason is its beautiful touch screen. It is basically a small computer. Listening to music while having the cell phone turned will drain the iphone's battery in about 3.5-4 hours. The Nano will last about 6.5 hours.   4)Functionality: iPhone clearly has the edge, even its the music player is more usable. iPhone has a cell phone, web browser (EDGE and WiFi), IPOD, camera, eMail, and a calendar. The Nano is principally a music player. iPhone's IPOD user interface, however, far trumps Nano's touchwheel.   5)Size: Nano is about 1/8 size of the iPhone (by weight and volume). iPhone isn't bulky, but Nano is a very small device.  6)Price/Benefit ratio: the 8GB Nano costs $200 and 8GB iphone costs $400. iPhone, however, offers more than twice the features.If you already have a phone you love, then Nano might be the better choice. Plus, iPhone is a surprising poor choice of text messaging, especially if you compare it against the phones with QWERTY buttons (not just GUI). So if you are one of those folks who send/receive over 100 messages a day, you might be better off with a QWERTY phone.  7)Coolness factor: iPhone is the coolest device on the planet. Too bad every geek with some cash has one. =)    8)Portability: If you want a MP3 player that you can carry in your pants without having it drag your pants down about 1/4 inch, then I recommend the Nano. But if you already carry a cell phone, it is probably causing your pockets to be bulky anyway.   9)Accessibility: iPhone is only supported on the AT&T/Cingular network. If you are already on an another plan, you may want to stick with your plan until the contract expires and get the Nano in the interim. The next generation iPhone probably will be relased around June of 2008. That version is almost certainly going to be more feature ridden.

<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the new 3rd generation iPod nano after my old iPod mini's battery completely crashed and I thought I was in for an upgrade (instead of replacing the battery for $70). After seeing the 2nd generation iPod nano's small screen, I was pleased that this versions screen size was made much larger. I actually like the more squarish feel and look to this music player. One big plus is the screen, which is absolutely gorgeous. Not pixilated at all. The Cover Flow feature was also a nice added bonus. One of the only problems I have with this iPod is that the back is not aluminum like the front. It is a reflective finish, so you can stare at yourself if you want! But it can get marks on it. I would like a complete aluminum body, but other than that, this mp3 makes for a great player!

<Title>Great Screen, Perfect Pocket Size, Problems in 1 WEEK!
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, I used to own the old iPod shuffle and it had so many problems, I decided to purchase Creative and SanDisk. Well, I saw the new Nano in the store and the screen quality blew me away...beautiful. I was looking for a pocket player that was small, light, thin and could play beautiful videos. Well the new Nano delivers in all those areas and worked lovely. So I dropped the $149 and bought it. Of course, you need iTunes and that took some time and of course it would not detect any of my own items to download, so in 1 hour I blew $50 buying items in my iLibrary. If that wasn't bad enough, a game I bought did not download, Apple still charged me, won't refund the credit, and says it is on my computer, so I'm still searching. Next, I wanted a photo viewer with more options like zooming, etc, which this player does not accommodate. Also I dislike the headphone plug on the bottom which makes the unit difficult to prop up to watch videos. Even with all those features, I loved my little baby until 5 days after I purchased the unit which prompted me to write this article. I was watching a show, after the show I went to play a video and nothing happened. Basically all my downloads would not access, not even the built-in games. Then I synched the unit and it froze solid, I was at a friend's computer, so I couldn't even use my iPod with the computer - not authorized. Luckily the hard reboot did solve the problem and the system is running again, but after a few days of use this already shows me to avoid the Apple and trust my instinct to avoid their products.  For the cost of a major mp3 player, I would expect a system that is more reliable. This month, I will purchase the Microsoft Zune and the new Creative, so I'll let you know in comparison.  COST: *** VIDEO: ***** MUSIC: **** PHOTO: *** SUPPORT: ** PROBLEMS: **  Average: 3 stars  Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving.  John Dae

I own a small plant nursery and often have dirty, wet hands, so I definitely needed a cover.   Now I have a cover that clips onto a belt, and am able to listen to the radio programming I cannot receive here in our rural area.   In other words, it's perfect and just what I wanted.

<Title>Very Pleased with the 3rd Gen Nano
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been wanting to own an ipod for a year and a half, and I finally got a 3rd generation Nano this Christmas.  The reasons that I wanted this product: 1. to consolidate all my music collection on one device, 2. portability, 3. to play my music in cars.  I accomplished all of my expectations on this product.  In order to play my ipod in my car, I also purchased a FM transmitter from Kensington.  It also charges my ipod as it plays, so it's really convenient.  Both products are working very well so far.  I never owned Apple products before.  Ipod Nano I own is very intuitive, and easy to use.  I use Microsoft PC, but had no problem downloading, and using itunes, which you need to have in your computer to import your CD collections and what not.  I'm thinking of getting a docking device for ipods to play it indoors.  My dilemma is that I already have so many music playing devices at home and work.  If I get rid of my 6-CD disc changer player, and replace it with my ipod and its playing device, it would save a lot of space, but I just don't want to donate my CD player to a thrift shop or something.  But I don't think I could sell my used CD player when many people are turning to some sort of MP3 player like myself.  I also have a cassette player, but I don't know what to do with it.(It's in a perfect working condition.)  Another concern is how to carry my ipod and transmitter, when the summer comes.  It's cold now, so I just put my ipod and FM transmitter in my jacket's pocket.  A winter jacket is pretty bulky, so it also serves as a protective case for delicate ipod.  But when it gets warmer, and I start to wear t-shirts and shorts, those two items are too bulky to shove it in my shorts' pockets.(Not to mention my already bulky wallet!)  Is that mean I have to carry a purse like a girl?  Probably I will use one of those pouch that you can wear around your waist.  But that too is kind of annoying.  Anyone with suggestions?

The biggest drawback is that the earphones don't shut out ambient noise, such as would occur when one is in a gym. So far I've simply been turning the volume up, which is not good for the ears. However, I'm in the process of acquiring noise-reduction earphones which many have raved about.

<Title>Very nice, has some quirks
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this as a gift and I love it. It has beautiful screen quality and I've found myself using the video function in so many situations! Riding the bus, waiting in line, at the gym--I'm constantly glad that I have it. The music quality is great and it's also got this sweet little feature where you can put the lyrics of your songs onto the ipod and access them when the song is playing! I think that is just cool. I like having the ability to put my photos on there and play games and all the other little gizmos that come on this.  I would definitely say that it has some quirks, though, that can be annoying at times. Sometimes, the click wheel won't respond to my touch so I just circle around and around and around trying to get it to do something. This usually stops after a few seconds--it sort of feels like there's a delay in the ipod's "thought" process and it needs to catch up when you change screens. I've had to reset it once (pressing the play/pause button and center button at the same time) because it completely stopped responding and all my videos were showing up as scrambled pixels of light. Once I reset it, though, it was fine and I had all my information still on there. The only weird thing I haven't figured out how to fix is that all of my "James Taylor" songs were replaced with my "Journey" songs. It still says it's James Taylor, but it's not. When I go into Itunes, the music is correct, but it's messed up on the ipod.   Overall, I love this little thing! It's so fun and so useful in situations I never even imagined! It's got a couple of quirks, but most technology does (remembering having to blow on the Ninentdo games back in the day to get them to work?). It's still pretty awesome. I'd suggest to get a silicone jacket though--it's easy to get it all smudgy and fingerprinty on the back since it's so shiny.

<Content>Bought it for my son. Awesome little player. Great sound and loud! Screen is drop-dead gorgeous. Although small, images are sharp and clear and video can be enjoyed despite the size. The photo album is well organized and the slide show is pretty cool.  The new menu system is nice as well.  My son loves the cover flow view, even if it isn't the most pratical way to browse music.  My only gripe with the player is the placement of the headphone jack next to the USB jack. It's a little awkward inserting and removing the USB cable with the headphones plugged in.  Other than that, I have no complaints with this player.

<Title>Fun to listen to but not easy to use
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted one of these stupid little players for months and held off on buying one. Little did I know, that due to Apple's insane marketing strategy where they upgrade software and hardware every two weeks it seems, I missed the boat on the 2nd generation Nano by a month or two. I would have much rather had the bigger unit with less space and more color choices. While color choice may seem anal and ridiculous, if it's available, people will want something in a funky color. I don't need outrageous amounts of space for music and think it's dumb that you essentially have to pay extra for more color choices. But alas, I chose the silver Nano, because I don't need that extra space and don't have money to burn.   That said,  I am a devout Mac fan and have used their computers for years. However, my loyalty is waning fast with this product. I was disappointed to learn that I couldn't even use it without extensive software upgrades not only with OS X but with iTunes. Once that was accomplished, I could finally use this machine. I was also disappointed to find that a) there were only very basic instructions included in the slim, ridiculously eco-friendly packaging; and b) another software upgrade would be needed just to read the more lengthy PDF instructions from the website, 78+ pages worth. Apple's products used to be so intuitive that you rarely needed to delve further into instruction manuals; it just basically did what you wanted to and made more sense. Now that I'm trying to add/delete music it continues to include tunes I don't want, and puts music in other places even though I've got folders.   Bottom line: the premise of organized music on the go is nice, if you can get it to work. Better have a hefty dose of patience when using this product.

So far, I have only used it for music, podcasts, and photos (no movies or tv yet), and I have no complaints at all.  Everyone I know is impressed by the design, which was a factor that lured me into buying it.  I keep mine in a protective case (from icase) and have no worries about damaging it in my everyday routine.  The 4G of space doesn't bother me since it's my very first iPod.  I've read complaints about the "small" wheel, but I don't have any problem with it at all.  I love it!

I also bought the silicon protective cover in green and it looks even prettier!  I like this ipod more than any other because its not big and bulky and it fits right into your pocket.  This is a great gift under $150 for that special someone or your kids.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is not concerned with watching movies on their ipod because the screen is small.  The resolution is still great though.

<Title>My first iPod, not to mention first MP3 portable device. 
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well like I said, this is my first iPod, not to mention portable MP3 player, I was still stuck to buying regular CD's or ripping them to MP3 format. Well I got the bug being I am sick of having to switch out CD's in the car or for that fact anywhere else. Plus you get to enjoy the songs you want to listen to.   On to the iPod itself. Have to say I am very surprised at all the cool features this little thing packs in. From the brillant screen to the touch scroll wheel and the fact you can play movies, TV shows, DL photos and all the music you want, well for the space you have, lol! I love it! Just have the 4gb and is plenty for me for now anyway. Plus I don't have a lot of extra money when you have 3 daughters ranging from 5 months to 11 years old.   The iTunes site is great as well. I am no computer geek and I will use the line "If I can do it, anyone can." Purchasing music was a breeze, but be careful at first as I purchased about 20 dollars worth of music and video and only the 99 cent songs have went on my paypal. The albums have not showed up as yet, which I don't understand. So will wait till my statement to purchase more music from there. Still is fun looking and listening to 30 second clips. I have a list for when my purchases go through more smoothly. Also when you put your CD in there to import, it is a breeze! Just be on iTunes and insert disc and asks you if you want to submit it to your iTunes Library and blam it is on and starts to DL right away. Then go to music and take the songs out you don't want and sync it and viola, is that easy.   Battery life: Is absoutley wonderful! Charges fast and holds it for a long time. I haven't had it long, but very surprised with how well this holds a charge.   Things I don't like, which are not that big of a deal. Getting used to the touch sensitive wheel, which I love, is just hard to get used to shuffeling through the cover albums and what not. I am sure it is a timely thing to get used to. Also the back is not metal finished like the front is, basically looks like a mirror made of chrome. So it smudges very easily. Also not big on where the headphone jack is located not to mention I tried 2 other headphones and the cord pratically falls out. I have ordered a pair of Koss XTRPro over the head headphones and hope that those work, if not I am gonna be mad with these earbuds that come with it. They sound OK, but my ears are not ment for the little earbuds to be submerged in it, lol!   Overall one of my better purchases of the last year. Like I said, still waiting on the headphones and my cord for playing it in the car, but I am sure It will suffice. My advice is to get one and enjoy! I still don't know why it took me so long to commit to the MP3 craze.

<Content>I like this new nano , I am glad I didn't buy the older version. So far pretty cool. It almost like having an ipod but with only drawback is less space, to be honest it suits my needs fine. You could fit 2000 songs on it if you wanted to but you would have to lower the sounds quality. I see one thousand songs as being plenty cause after awhile the same songs get lame. I know the ipod holds way more ,but if your like me and you it occasionally it good. I use it mostly for trips. I like the new video feature .So far really happy with it. I like it cause it not big and bulky. Buy it and be happy

<Content>I bought the iPod Nano G3 for a present for my son. He was very excited. That is--until he tried to synch it with iTunes on his computer.  New iPods REQUIRE a version of iTunes that NO LONGER SUPPORTS WINDOWS 2000!  Maybe in Silicon Valley, everyone is wealthy enough that the kids have new computers running Vista or Leopard. In my little corner of the real world, my kids inherited our older computers--running Win 2K.  So we had to return the iPod. . .

<Title>Great iPod my first one!!!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I got this iPod I owned a Sansa Sandisk 1 GB with color screen no video capbittaly now comparing that MP3 player to this iPod its not even close in quaility. One thing they both share in common is that they are both flash based memory meaning unlike with the iPod classic not-so-old iPod videos have a hard drive based memory so they can tend to get frozen more often. The new nanos are all flash based. This plus is so easy all you do plug it in to your windows or mac computer it shows up on your iTunes(note:you need iTunes 7.4 or later for nano to work doesnt come with software CD so you have to download it off apple website easy!) Then all you do is simplly really quickly install it and then your ready to go. All you do is drag your music, photos, videos, and movies/tv shows, and games(note you need to download newer versions of older games) then your ready to go. When you first take it out of the package it includes acttulay 3.63 GB rather than 4 GB because their are 3 games on it that take up that space but still it all adds up. It is very easy to use charge everything(hint with windows you need a windows XP and or a windows vista with updated itunes) You may be saying how can someone watch a movie or a TV episode on how tiny the screen is well the screen is about that same size as one the iPod video plus the picture quaillty is better and more brighter plus on the iPod you can addjust how bright the screen is. And now you can add contacts from your computer on to your iPod so no more forgetting peoples phone numbers because you can simply go to their phone number if its on their and be done with it. Plus since the menu screen half of it is artwork the artwork on this just switches off to the artwork on your iPod(if you have any) People may complain how small the click wheel is but hey on the 1st and 2nd generation iPods the click wheels were like the same size. One thing is the 4 GB model only comes in silver while the 8 GB model comes in the colors, Mint Green, Turqoise, Silver, and black(note on the black 8 GB the click wheel is black as well)Also the new iPods  DO NOT PLAY WAV I REAPEAT DO NOT WHEN YOU GO TO A SONG IN WAV IT DOSENT PLAY but that dosent matter really at all for me. Plus the cover flow on this i think is cool but i think on a later model they should add the visualizer that would be cool. The sound is great its all in all a great iPod/MP3 player for someone starting out on a huge music collection or has music on his or her computer but wants something to put it on their you go your looking at it all in all its a great iPod for a first time buyer and makes a great Christmas present for someone who just owns the shuffle and wants this one perfect for anyone with music,games, or video on their computer.

<Content>I bought the new Nano for my 9 yr old son after he begged and begged for one to listen to music on the hour long bus ride to School and back everyday.  I was very skeptical about making the purchase-a) that is would be too difficult for him to manage and b) that he would lose it.  I was shocked to discover he is a whiz with it.  I actually have no problem navigating and downloading music for him-  I choose what goes on it for him.  He loves it and takes extremely good care of it.  I am very pleased with the ease of use as well.  I will by another one later on for myself or my husband...

<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The nano is a very nice improvement over my first generation iPod (which had a terrible battery; never lasted more than two hours per charge).  I'd rate it a 5 for design and utility, except for my shopping experience.  The 4GB nano comes in any color you'd like, as long as you like silver.  What would it have cost Apple to offer more colors?  Very little, if anything.  But, like many manufacturers, offering color options only at a higher price point is a not very subtle way of pushing you to open your wallet wider.  The 4 GB is entirely adequate for my use in jogging; I never watch video with it.

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Normally, I love Apple products.  I've been a huge fan since I bought one of the original iPods almost five years ago.  I bought this iPod because my other one had seen better days.  Plus, I wanted to try out the Nike+ features available for these latest generations.  Unfortunately, this iPod didn't come with iTunes (and I am unable to access their site to download the latest version).  If a piece of hardware is going to require software the company should package the software.  iTunes wouldn't take a lot of space on the iPod and Apple wouldn't inconvenience their customers.  I hate to give the product 1-star, but Apple has left me with a useless product until I get home next month.  Thanks for nothing.
