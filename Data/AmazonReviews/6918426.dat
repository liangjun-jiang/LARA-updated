<Title>Terrible user experience 
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zune Thursday and affter a day and a half of trying it to work with my new HP laptop I've given up and will be sending it back to Amazon for a refund.  Conversely,  went down to Best Buy purchase a iPod nano and was down loading songs from iTunes in under 2 minutes.  Microsoft's Zune, a failure so great Microsoft is still struggling to sell models from last year at fire sale prices.    (BUY AN IPOD OR SANDISK MP3 PLAYER)

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third MP3 player after a first generation ipod mini (which I subsequently sold) and a creative zen micro photo (which recently died after 2 years of impeccable service).  I liked the Zen, but wanted something a bit more sleek, so after reading some good reviews of the Zune, I bought it.  I was not disappointed.    All of its controls are pretty intuitive.  I think the control pad works as well as the wheel on the ipod mini I had, if not better.  The zune software, while not my first choice for music management, works well for its purpose.  I definitely prefer it to iTunes.  The screen is bright and the wireless sync worked flawlessly.  I don't really have a bad thing to say about this player.  Others have complained about the lack of an equalizer.  I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile and I think the sound is just fine, even through the included headphones.  This may not be the case for those with more discerning ears, but I think it's just fine.

<Title>Not all files play
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for audiobooks that we download from our local libray. They are WMA format, and the Zune says that it plays WMA files, but when I tried to transfer it wouldn't work. After deeper reasearch I discovered that it will indeed play WMA files, but only if you buy them from the Zune store. It seemed like a good player but I returned it right away, so I didn't get a chance to explore it. I bought a Creative Zen and it is sweet and played all my files perfectly, including the audiobooks.

<Title>If I can help just one person it will be worth it.

<Content>After owing the Zune for over a month and dealing with its user UN-friendly music and video formats, I've come to realize that Microsoft's reason for such limited formats may be an attempt to force change upon the music and movie industry to create yet another monopoly.   This is the only reason that one can find when looking at the limitation of the Zune and realizing that Microsoft is a software company. They are not a start up company with limited resources but are on a course for market domination.   Buy the Zune if you want, but realize you are financing intellectual and progress limitations.

<Title>Fragile

<Content>The first time out of the box, the weight from the usb cord pulled it off the table onto the ground and that was the end of my Zune.

<Title>Very Impressed
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Zune for Christmas. I have been an avid iPod user for many years. I wanted to switch to the Zune because I got tired of iTunes. The Zune is very small and lightweight. It is the size of a credit card so it makes it convenient to just throw in my purse or use at the gym. I like the fact that it has an FM radio because I can listen to NPR in the mornings. It's design is very impressive and I like the Zune interface. Overall I am very satisfied and will recommend the Zune to anyone. It is a great alternative to the iPod nano.

<Title>Love mine - no issues at all
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not sure why others are having software issues... I run Vista on my pc and XP on my laptop.  I haven't had any issues with either and was downloading songs to it from my own music library within just a few minutes.  Haven't had to buy anything from the Zune store, and have had no trouble programming radio presets at all.    This is my 2nd mp3 player (last one was a cheepie) so I don't know what I'm missing with this vs. the iPod, but I don't care...  I love my Zune!  :-)

<Title>Great player, couldn't be happier.
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player for my wife this Christmas just to try something different than the Ipod Nano I own. I was expecting to be pleased with the player but after using it I am very impressed. The player works great and is very easy to use. What I am most happy about is the use of the Zune marketplace with the Zune. The marketplace is very graphical and intuitive. This complete package makes me recommend this player to anyone looking to get their first mp3 player or someone who is looking to try a new brand.
