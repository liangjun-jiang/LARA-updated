<Content>Purchased this Zen Microphoto 8GB over a year ago.  Was able to load the first batch of songs and everything went ok.  The second time I went to load songs the player was not recognized by the computer. Since then other than to play the original set of loaded songs this player has been worthless.  I sent an email (twice) to Creative and both times rcvd the same reply, which was to check their Knowledge Base to search for an answer to the problem (and there were many re this problem). I had been trying all of these (and checking their forum for ideas) for 1 year and still nothing worked.  I have put countless hours into this Zen and it still will not work correctly!!  My advice to anyone interested in the Zen Microphoto is to check their forum under the search "player not connected" or "player not recognized". You will be flooded with questions from hundreds of customers with the same problem. Let this convince you to stay clear of this MP3 player.
