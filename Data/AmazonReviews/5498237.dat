<Title>Work of Art Ruined By The Worst Software Ever Written 
<Date>Mon Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>From a hardware perspective, it's a work of art. Beautiful, sleek, lightweight, and solid feeling.  I got it in my hands and fell in love.  And then I tried to use it.  Which required installing SonicStage.  I'd read all the bad reviews of SonicStage, and I'd used (what I thought was) equally bad Sony software in the past -- OpenMG for their NetMD player, for example.  So I was prepared for some annoyances, fine tuning, maybe occassional bugs.  I also assumed the people who complained were exaggerating about how bad it was.   LET ME PROMISE YOU -- THEY WERE NOT.   In almost twenty years of using computer software, tinkering with electronics, owning some version of almost every gadget known to man -- I have never seen such a promising piece of hardware CRIPPLED by such a buggy, ill-conceived, underpowered, unintuitive piece of software.  It's WORSE than what people are telling you.   It's so bad that I ended up returning mine and buying an Ipod -- something I swore I'd never do.  The user interface isn't even consistent between the player and the software.  There's no way to shuffle all the songs on the drive.  User support is non-existent.  SonicStage freezes and crashes for no reason, despite being upgraded to latest version and uninstalled/reinstalled.   Certain songs won't transfer, others are marked as having no digital rights (even though they were tracks recorded from the same albums as other songs that transferred fine -- and that NEVER had digital rights assigned to them in the first place.)   A lot of people have complained about Sony forcing you to use their proprietary ATRAC3 format instead of MP3.  Honestly -- that's the LEAST of this unit's problems.  The bigger problem is that the software engineers are too incompetent to program a stable program that will actually CONVERT and MANAGE those ATRAC3's.   Sony's hardware engineers created this beautiful player, and their software engineers will be the cause of its failure.   Words cannot do justice to how badly Sony bungled this mess.  It kills me to say this, but don't waste your time.   **NEW ADDITION:  To the reviewers who make comments to the effect that anyone who has problems with SonicStage software either has a faulty computer or is a complete idiot:  Have you actually tried to USE the software?   Or do you just sort of sit and stare at the pretty pictures on the screen?  (I mean, come on.  Nobody's arguing that the hardware is extremely impressive, but the software is buggy, unintuitive, and inconsistent.  It's been pretty well documented by several thousand people. I can't imagine that anyone outside of the programming group that put that mess together would actually think it's a competent piece of software, and if they do, they must enjoy spending hours in front of their computer and not have much of a social life.)  Second, some reviewers have disputed my claim that the unit cannot shuffle the entire HD.  My claim is true, it has been substantiated by a senior marketing representative from Sony with whom I have exchanged several letters and phone calls.  Yes, you can shuffle within albums (or "groups"), and you can shuffle within artists and playlists.  But you CANNOT shuffle through the entire HD as a whole.  The only way this would be possible would be to designate the entire library as a single playlist, and playlists are currently limited to 1000 tracks.  So if you have 3,000 tracks on the player, there is absolutely, positively no way to shuffle those 3,000 tracks -- only subsets of those tracks (e.g., album, group, etc.)  I suppose you could spend several extra hours of your life creating complicated playlists and shuffle between those playlists.  But on an Ipod (and, incidentally, almost every other MP3 player on the market), you simply hit a menu entry titled "shuffle."

<Title>A better alternative to the ipod (informative,please read)
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a much better product than the ipod, it costs $350(20GB model)and holds 13,000 songs while the $400(40GB)model of the ipod only holds 10,000 songs and is a full $50 more. Also the Ipod(20 and 40GB models) brag about their small size but this is about the same size as the minis, with 16GB more memory(IPOD mini,$250,4GB,1000 songs)This isn't the cheapest per GB but it compacts your music better than any of the ipods so it can hold so much more music. It comes with a cradle, an accessary that costs you $40 to buy for the ipod,a case to protect it which would cost between $20 and $30(basic cases,not the H20case:$150 or GUCCI cases available)It also comes with a AC Power adapter which you have to buy for ipod. It is a beautiful product. Don't waste $ on ipods, but an IMAC G5 isn't a bad PC to consider. You can then put your music CDs onto your computer and stream them to your Sony music player directly from iTunes, which emphasizes using ipods but ends up being just as easy. DON'T FOLLOW THE TREND OF BUYING WORSE PRODUCTS JUST TO FIT IN, BUY A SUPERIOR PRODUCT, the SONY NETWORK WALKMAN

<Title>One Word - DRM, another word - JUNK
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This product is cool looking.  This product is well designed.  However, the DRM rules are stupid.  It is my music, I should be able to do with it what I want.  I do not need to be managed.  Their software is HORRID and without it, the device is useless.  I have a mini disc player, another cool looking, well designed product which now sits in a drawer because dealing with it is too much of a pain.  This is the new mini disc player, the new cool-looking, well-designed pain.

<Title>Succeeds at making your music portable
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am quite a gadget person, and have needed for a long time a good way of making my music portable. It's very hard to find time to sit down in front of my home stereo and listen. I recently bought a Sony DNF400 portable CD/Atrac3 player and was impressed by the ability to cram 20 CD's into one at 68k encoding, with sound quality at about 90% of the original CD's.  And so I have had the NW-HD1 now for over a week and will share my impressions.  1)  Small form factor. Does indeed fit into your shirt pocket. I wouldn't use the NW-HD1 without a neck strap because if the unit falls to the ground, I doubt it'll survive because a hard drive is very sensitive to damage from shock. Or else, use a belt-loop case (not a belt clip, because someone can easily steal it when you're not alert).  2) I listen mostly to classical music, and so I need to listen to one or more CD's consecutively. If you accidently navigate away from the track you're listening, you could forget exactly where you were before. You could bookmark, but when you return to the bookmark, you only get to play what's bookmarked. Not good.  3)   Equalizer is FANTASTIC, as every 'phone has it's own response and you need to check the response curve so it sounds more neutral.  4)   Battery life isn't anywhere near 30 hours on my unit. More like 20, and that's when you use the player in real life (i.e. switching tracks, using the menu, etc.)  5)   No remote. For a top of the line player, it should come with a remote. You can buy a  remote on the internet from various sources. In some countries, I believe the player comes stock with a Sony RM-MC35ELK.  6)   The case is a joke. It's not even a case, just a cover. It doesn't allow you to attach it to anything.  7)   ATRAC3plus at 68k sounds very fine, as good as MP3. You can cram 600 CD's into this player (30 CD]s per gig).  8)   You can switch the headphone jack between the usual variable headphone output and fixed line out for hooking up to stereos.  In summary, for a first effort, this has been a pretty good entry by Sony into the hard drive arena. A few generations from now, all your concerns will likely be addressed, but for now, it's the best of the lot out there.

<Title>Sigh...
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really hate to say this...but anyone having trouble with the SonicStage software either has a faulty computer or is a complete idiot. I have a Vaio notebook and used the SonicStage software long before I even got this player. I actually decided on buying this player after I ripped most of my CD library into the Atrac3Plus format and learned this was the only hard drive player that plays this format. Fortunate enough this is by the far the best hard drive player on the market. I admit the ipod has a cool scrolling system but the NW-HD1 outperforms the ipod in every other department. The NW-HD1: holds more songs when ripped to the Atrac3Plus format, is smaller, and looks sleeker. Do your research but I'm glad I finally got my hands on one of these.

<Title>A Bit Pricey, But Worth Every Cent!!
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read most of the reviews of the NW-HD1 on this site and on cnet.com before I shopped.  I found the reviews here balanced and found cnet's overwhelming negative (about 70% of folks there disliked the product).  This was my first walkman purchase since the early 90s, and was alarmed by the poor reception of the product on cnet.com. I was doubly concerned since I am not conversant in the technical speak and the reviewers there, I assumed, knew what they were talking about.  So, I gave serious thought to buying the iPod.   I am glad I did not bow to the pressure.  The balanced reviews on this site and my own positive experiences with the Sony brand convinced me to purchase the NW-HD1.  I LOVE it.  Every aspect of this devise oozes ease of use.   I have been copying CDs onto the device for the past 10 hours and I have had no problems.  Admittedly, I have not downloaded songs yet from the Sony site, but based on my experience so far, I would venture to say it will likely be just as easy.  The device is absolutely beautiful, elegant, and classy. And it imparts the feel of luxury and being well made.  This product is what the Mercedes Benzs of old were to the luxury car market: built to last without all the gimmicky gadgets.  My problems with this player are minor: the carrying case that comes standard is impractical, as is the earplugs.   Of course the price is steep, but in this case, it is money well spent.  I have no regrets and would always choose this product over the competitors.  A beautiful and solid product!

<Title>iPod meets its match
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My dad had bought my siblings the 20 gb iPod for Christmas, and my boyfriend bought me this Sony player, so I've had the chance to compare the two first hand.  At first I had some trouble with the software and transferring the songs, but once I had the unit on a more solid surface, the problem was greatly reduced. I still have problems with the software from time to time, but I've learned what to do to overcome them.  I also did not like the default format for the songs that were being transferred, but after increasing the bitrate, I have no more complaints. The songs take up more space and take more time to convert, but it's not a sacrifice I mind making for better audio quality. I still have plenty of room for all of my favorite music, and, being a college student, I have a whole lot of music. I currently have 235 songs and have used only around 2 gigs of space on the player.  It is nice that the iPod accepts mp3 format. I, personally, like the sound quality of the ATRAC3 format that Sony uses just as much.  The two things that I am most impressed with for this unit are the size and the battery life. The unit feels much smaller than the iPod does to me, and the battery life lasts at least twice as long with around the same time of charging. The unit is visually appealing, as well. I also like that it comes with a dock station for charging and connecting to a computer, which the 20 gig iPods do not.  The controls of the unit are not too small to control, as some people think, but I'll admit that I have small fingers. Controlling the unit became like second nature after just a few minutes of playing with it.  Just like that of the iPod, the backlight makes the screen very easy to read. I, personally, do not like either the headphones that come with the iPod or the Walkman. I recommend buying better quality headphones no matter which unit you decide to purchase.  Overall I am very satisfied with the product.

<Content>I just want to say that i have loved this mp3 player from the day i got it and i have had no problems using it.  My friends have ipods so i have had some time to compare the two and i have found that the NW-HD1 is much better.  One of my friends has 1,200 songs on his ipod and it takes up 6GB, i have 2,500 on my NW-HD1 and it takes up 4GB.  My friends get 8 hours playtime with their ipods and i get 25 hours playtime.  This thing is like the size of an ipod mini and the sound quality is good.  I am very happy with my choice to purchase the NW-HD1.

<Title>Pure Magic
<Date>Sat Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had thought about writing out a really long and drawn out review of this product, but so many other reviews (positive ones) have hit the mark on this device whats left to be said. After reading a few (and limited) negative reviews I was a bit nervous but i'm glad to say they were wrong, this product, well, Its pure magic. So I'm only going to touch on my Major Pro/Con  Pros: Don't Blink! Man, talk about loading the music on this device! Yes the conversion from mp3 or even ripping a cd takes a bit longer but when you actually transfer it to the device itself its like pure lightning! WOW!  Con: I don't really have any cons to be honest, the only thing I would ask of sony is that next time the upgrade this model is to add a megga bass function (I like alot of bass in my music).  You can't go wrong with the product, the software is NOT that bad and the new downloadable 2.3 version of this software is quite good.   IPOD is for the kids, the NW-HD1 if for the adult.  IPOD is like driving a Ford Focus, the NW-HD1 is pure Lexus!  Great job Sony.   A final note: I urge anyone struggling between IPOD and this product to buy this product first, try it out for the 14 day return period. You won't be dissapointed and you won't return it!

<Title>Get it now for about $200...
<Date>Thu May 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...or get it later for $400.  The forthcoming model, NW-HD4 is already being declared the iPod killer.  Same features as this except NW-HD4 (and the colorful NW-HD3) can play mp3.  This one can be modified to play mp3 (you'll need to send it to TX to get firmware installed).  But I'm more than happy with SonicStage software.  I've got about 400 CDs on mine and it's half-full.  The sound quality is excellent, long battery life, lightning-fast downloads, sturdy construction and easy to use.  Anyone who thinks it's difficult to operate or use the software probably struggles with any technology.  It's about the size of a deck of cards.  Match it up with JBL On Tour speakers and you've got the ultimate system for the travelling music enthusiast.  It was originally $350.  Get it before it's gone!

<Title>Awesome compact mp3 player
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for about a year. It is very very small, about the size of my palm. The best part is the battery life. It exceeds the 30 hour limit listed in the specs. I did not like it at first when I had to convert my mp3 to ATRAC format. Then I sent it to the Texas service center for a firmware upgrade and now I can upload mp3 directly. They also sent me a new Software which is much better than the one that came with the player. I am really satisfied with the product at this time.

<Title>Good lookin', but fails to shine in more ways that one...
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Upon reading the blurb on the box you think you're getting a really good deal, right? How horribly wrong I was! For starters, the actual quality of the sound that the player gives out is atrocious mainly due to the lack of volume. Full blast volume gives you the same amount of sound coming out of a talking birthday card. This is an incredible let down, especially when you're using speakers with the player.Whilst searching for a this player on E-bay, you're more than likely to come across little scams for about  or  for them to send you instructions on how to open the hidden volume control on your player.     The installation disc supplied contains the actual instruction manual (which I did not discover until a month of installing the player) and a program called Sonic Stage which is the method of transferring files to your player. When you open this program, you think it's all incredibly straight forward: select music to be transferred, press transfer and you're done! This is the case if you're happy listening to the headache fuelling 48kbps which is the default quality for transferring data. You may also think that this can be overcome with the simple click of a mouse by changing the quality to a more regular 130kbps, but it still transfers as 48kbps! I had a headache before even listening to anything!  The actual process you have to partake in to change the sound quality is incredibly long winded and tedious as you have to select individual files, convert them into the sound quality you'd like (roughly 30 seconds per song seems reasonable enough, but then you have to do that for every song you want transferred) and then you're able to transfer them onto your player. Despite the USB cradle developed for high-speed transfers, it doesn't seem any faster. The Sonic Stage program also freezes when you transfer more than 5 albums at a time and crashes your computer on a regular basis. The player is also used as an external storage unit which means you can just copy and paste files into the unit that's shown within 'My Computer' and they can be removed from there.  The players aesthetics may be one of the very few ups of this player. The players petit physique allows you to fit it snugly into your pocket and not notice that it's actually there, although it's surface area is too big to wear around your neck. The design of the players jukebox is very confusing and frustrating too as every song is arranged by 'composer' not by artist. Whilst I'm complaining about the design of this, I found myself stopping to admire the lovely backlight display which is a very minty green colour. The player [as most do] has the hold function, although if you pause the player for 30 seconds, it turns itself off therefore wasting battery life turning it back on again. Now, other than the incredibly unreasonable volume and the hassle to transfer music onto your player.  One of the reasons the world has turned to MP3 players, is for easy sharing or file transferring between work/friends/school, but once again, this player fails to deliver by only allowing the files placed within the external storage folder to be shared and even when you do wish to share them, you have to carry your USB cradle and USB lead (connects the cradle to the computer) which defeats the entire object of easy file sharing and also makes it incredibly obvious that you have a very expensive piece of hardware on you and are begging to be mugged.  When you're paying such an amount for a rather poor piece of equipment, you'd expect Sony to provide you with insurance against theft or external damage and you're just lumbered with the usual Sony warranty which covers a faulty product or damage within the products operating/storage system and leaves you having to pay 0 more to get the player insured against theft through an unreliable company as Sony Centres don't allow you to insure a product unless it was purchased at that particular time within that store.  Overall this product is a poor investment and a complete and utter con! I'm nothing but disappointed with it. Although I may be the coolest cat in town with it, I'll always feel cheated and unhappy with the player.   Ups - The best aesthetics within an MP3 player yet. Downs - Pretty much everything else is a let down.  Want more? www.thetechaven.com

<Title>Do not buy this MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I never write reviews, but I felt that it was necessary for a potential consumer considering forking out almost $400 bucks to be aware that this is not the product to do it on.  Here's why:  Terrible software: Read the review prior to mine. When you first get a hefty mp3 player like this you cannot help being a little happy. At first you live with the small problems but eventually they are just too annoying.   Playlists: If you want to make a playlist be prepared to copy the same song twice to the player. Now since you have so much space mB aren't really the problem. The problem is when you go to play an album or songs from a particular artist. Both songs are entries and thus you get duplicate tracks.  Firmware: The standard model shipped cannot play mp3 formats. Eventually you get an e-mail from Sony telling you you can send your mp3 in for a software upgrade allowing it to play this format for only $20 plus postage and handling. WHAT! Are they out of their minds? Why can't I just download it.  SonicStage: Oh this is the second most irritating aspect of the player. Now this might be a particular bug related to the usage of the integrated browser which I am guessing uses the Firefox rendering engine. It results in Sonic Stage not working. Some of the links are disabled and I cannot purchase tracks or redeem my coupon code. You get 30 free songs from Sony with a mail-in coupon... it takes about 6-8 weeks before it arrives. It could have taken about 100 years cause I still can't get my free tracks. I am not computer illiterate either.... running a dual boot system XP/Fedora Core... using XP only for the musts like Photoshop CS and SonicStage.  Display: If you plan on using your player on a sunny day be prepared to spend fifteeen to thirty seconds to find out what the heck is on the screen. If you are like me and carry yours in a plastic zip lock baggy forget about it cause your chances are slim to none and slim just got on the bus.  Worst of all: When I first purchased it in December it crashed about a week later. I took it in and got it exchanged. Four months later it wouldn't charge. I recently brought it in for repairs (I bought mine at Sears and the Sony Service Center works via them). There is a one-year parts warranty but only three months on service. I was all bummed that I had to pay for this but hey what can you do. I told the clerk what had happened and he said you know what I'll just swap it with a new one. He couldn't cause Sears discontinued carrying it... I wonder why.  Well lucky for me he swapped it for a player of the same caliber. It was the iPod+hp... and I am telling you this mp3 player blew the Sony right out of the water. Wow... it had a color display, incredibly easy user interface, real playlists, slideshow, easy hookup to tv and tuner, and more.  I wasn't going to buy the iPod either but it was all they carried in order to satisfy me as a customer. Boy did I let my prejudices push me into making the wrong decision... DO not buy Sony NW-HD1 player cause you'll really end up pulling your hair out.   I guess I am writing this cause I'd imagine there are people out there who like myself who just don't have $400 bucks to throw around for fun. It's hard earned money... and when something doesn't function properly you feel cheated and aren't sure what to do about it cause forking out another $4000 is not really an option you'd want to pursue.  I hope this helps you make find the player that works for you.

<Title>A Decent Hard Drive Music Player from Sony 
<Date>Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a big fan of Sony electtronics so naturally I wanted to purchase a Sony mp3 player. The NW-HD1 is a good music player but its not excellent. I'll just go ahead and list its good and its bad features.  good: -By far the smallest 20 GB digital music player (credit card sized) when it was released. This makes it very convenient as it easily slides into your pocket.  -Typical Sony excellent fit and finish with brushed metal exterior and handsome styling.  - Great sound quality with proper headphones. ie.Not the ones in the package.     -Easy to use controls.  -Good battery life  -You can use Windows to copy any type of file to the player, using it as a mobile storage device (the device won't recognize or trouble the files)      Bad: -NO NATIVE MP3 PLAYBACK CAPABILITY   -No playlist feature, only a 100 track bookmark list. This was really annoying.  -Although I found the Sonic Stage software easy to use (3.1, the included version is 2.0), it was really frustrating converting and copying my entire music library of just under 1,000 tracks to the player (took approximately 4 hours).    -Because the device only supports ATRAC3 playback, you cannot use Windows MP to sync files to it.  -EXPENSIVE when brand new (typical for a Sony)  Bottom Line:  If you don't mind converting your music libary or any of the other downsides, and if you can get it at a cheap price (under $120) buy it. Otherwise get the NW-HD3 or NW-HD5 which both support mp3 files.

<Title>Great-looking player, but with MAJOR flaws
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, this is probably the greatest-looking 20 GB player out there.  However, it is made useless by the garbage software.  I used to have a Dell 15 GB player, but I sold it and got this one because it was so large and bulky.  If I had known what a living hell it would be to put music on this one, I probably would have either kept the Dell or gotten an iPod.  One feature I liked about the Dell (and I'm pretty sure iPods have this too) is that you could add tracks to the "selected music" and have a temporary playlist for however long you want to keep it.  You could add or remove tracks whenever you wanted, even during playback.  This way you wouldn't have to browse for another track to listen to after one ended.  The Sony does not have this feature.  The only way to make a playlist is to make it in the SonicStage software and transfer it to the player.  But, when you do that, any song you add to a playlist will be removed from its album in the libary in SonicStage, and THEN DUPLICATED in the library on the player.  So, if you plan on making custom playlists, you will find both the SonicStage and player libraries will be completely screwed up with missing and duplicated tracks.  But it doesn't end there!  The Connect music downloading service is the only place you can download tracks in their proprietary ATRAC format.  However, EVERY SINGLE TIME I downloaded music from there, the download failed, and then every time I opened SonicStage, it would try to finish downloading, but fail again.  By the time it actually worked, I would have 5 of each track I downloaded, each one either incomplete or full of static.  Speaking of ATRAC, that is the only format this player supports.  So your options are:  A) Completely duplicate your MP3 library to ATRAC on your computer, taking up lots of hard drive space, but making it possible to transfer tracks to the player quickly.  B) Convert MP3 files to ATRAC on the fly when transferring to the player, making a simple transfer take hours.  It is possible to get this player upgraded to support MP3, but you still have to use the SonicStage software, and it doesn't fix the lack of functional playlist support.  I owned this player for almost a year, putting up with horrible software and no playlists, but I have had enough.  I'm selling this thing on eBay and getting an iPod or maybe iPod nano (those things are awesome!).  Sony has the potential to dominate the MP3 player market, but if they don't stop using proprietary formats and software, it's never going to happen.  In the meantime, I'll be happy with my new iPod. :)

<Content>I use these user reviews for so much stuff, that its about time I wrote one as well. The Sony NW-HD1 is just okay. Sonic Stage is just acceptable. It allows me to transfer files, but there is no song number count and make sure you don't try to get fancy with it.  Updating to a recent version required me to initialize the unit which erased everything on the player. Had to re-transfer from SS. My biggest frustration is running with it. It tends to freeze up on me after about 30 minutes. Some days it will last as long as me (2 hrs) but more often it stops playing. I have to reset the battery (switch on bottom) which is a real pain in the middle of a run. I guess a flash player would be better for jogging but this was advertised as "no-skip" technology.  Oh, and the shuffle function is ridiculous. Choosing to shuffle the entire drive (over two thousand songs loaded) is not intuitive and the player will repeat many songs in this mode. Only by resetting and reshuffling can I get it to change. But it will find a new set of songs to continually play during shuffle. Very frustrating. Lately it has tried to play "No Song" This actually shows up on the menu. It does nothing for a while then moves on to a real song. Perhaps there is a bad file loaded. Sound quality is great, battery life is awesome and it recharges very quickly. But the inability to work on the road or trail and the lack of good shuffle playability will probably drive me to another player soon.

<Title>This may be your ideal mp3 player in disguise
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I would like to make a few things clear. I have owned (or at least used) the following players: iPod (4th, 5th gen, mini, nano), nw-hd5, archos gmini xs200, creative muvo n200, the creative zen sleek, and of course, the nw-hd1. My hd1's firmware was upgraded to play mp3s immediately after I purchased the unit, so you must consider this throughout the review.  	Hardware quality: excellent, no complaints. The unit looks and feels durable. The screen's clarity is lacking though, and is quite hard to read unless the backlight is on or if it is sunny outside. The glass on the front is huge too, which obviously makes it more prone to scratches and more noticeable. Something that strikes me as odd as well is the unbalanced distribution of weight. On the top, you can see that the shape curves up, which is what I think makes the right side a tad bit heavier than the left. Not a big deal, really, especially since the unit is held with the right hand. Just something to think about when you go out for lunch today. (90%)  	Size/weight: at 3.88 oz, STILL the lightest 20gb player out there, which is amazing considering the fact it came out like 2 years ago. This is probably this player's most appealing feature. Here are some direct weight comparisons (in ounces): Hd5 - 4.76, iPod video - 4.8, mini - 3.6, nano - 1.5, zen micro - 3.8, xs200 - 4.2 As you can see, the hd1's got everything beat hands down (in the 20 gb category). It's barely heavier than the zen micro, which holds only 6gb! The only 20+ players that can come anywhere close are sony's other players, the iPod video, and the xs200, which are already in the 4 oz range! Size is a different matter though, since the xs200, hd5 and even the video are technically smaller. Their overall volume is smaller, but in my opinion, the iPod video's face is too big, and the xs200 is too fat. To me, in this case, weight is much more important than volume per-se. There is some confusion with sony's other players that needs to be clarified (even I was confused writing my hd5 review). The hd5 is the smallest but heaviest at 4.76 oz, the hd3 is the biggest but is the middle child in weight at 4.59 oz, and the hd1 is the lightest but the middle child in size. I know it's weird, but I don't know what accounts for this odd trend in size/weight inconsistencies. (100%)  	Sound quality: excellent, better (in some cases, much better) than everything else I have heard (except the hd5 of course). I have done sound comparisons side by side with a mini and a gmini xs200, and I must say the hd1 came first, with the xs200 second and the mini, third. For some, this is the sole reason why they chose sony. (95%)  	Navigation: OK, not that great. To choose between browsing from artist/album/genre/group/others, you press the mode button on top. The menu button is used to change settings like shuffle, backlight, etc. As far as scrolling is concerned, navigation is adequate. Pushing buttons isn't as tedious as you might think. Some might even find it to be more efficient than the click wheel. This is how it works; you can tap the up/down button, or you can hold it down. This will make the player start scrolling at a mediocre speed. After holding down up or down for 6 seconds, then it starts scrolling much faster so it won't take too long to get to  "P." The downside is of course, that you have to wait 6 seconds before you start scrolling fast. (80%)  	Software: sonicstage isn't as horrible now as it was back then, but it's still not all that great. Also, if you own a mac (which I do) you're pretty much screwed unless you use VirtualPC, in which case you'd still be screwed since a slow program within a slow emulation software can only mean the epitome of slowness. However, it is usable, and you don't even necessarily have to use it. Mp3 file manager and Vaio music transfer, two drag-and-drop softwares, should both work. Those that have reviewed the software in the past haven't considered the fact that sonicstage has improved, and it's not even necessary to use. (75%)  	Battery life: excellent, another pro that has served as a determining factor for many. 30 hrs? if listening to mp3s, you won't hit that, but you'll definitely get much further than 14 hrs. (yeah, I'm talking about the iPod) The unit also charges incredibly fast considering it's supposed to hit 30 hrs every time. (95%)  	Button placement: The weird thing about the hd1 is that the design is horizontal instead of vertical. It's not really bad (unless you're left-handed), just different. It takes getting used to along with the buttons on the top, which I think are better placed on the front, like on the hd5. It's true that the buttons are a bit small, but it shouldn't be a problem at all unless you're a big or chubby person. The buttons are pleasant to press. (85%)  	Annoying quirks: Whenever a button is pressed, you can hear the disc spinning along with an annoying high-pitched sound. On one hand, it's annoying, but not a big deal. After a while though, it stops. Plus it's not like you can hear it while listening to music. When you put the unit on hold, it flashes "HOLD" on the screen when a button is pressed. It might not sound bad, but the thing is, if you're using the backlight (which you will be most of the time), it will turn on every time you press a button. This obviously wastes battery. Another thing is that (only sometimes) after the end of a song, you hear some silence, and then literally 1 second of some random song, then it moves on to the next. Don't know what's up with that. This one time, right in the middle of a song, the hd1 started playing a completely different song for a while, then went back. These things are probably uncommon and not a huge deal, but they should be considered. Such a high-priced unit should not suffer from such odd imperfections. Although very rare, the unit has frozen on me before. Last but not least, I don't think that the green backlight matches well with the rest of the player. Looks kind of awkward to me. Wish it were black like on the hd5.  	Things that might piss you off: very few cases (have only seen 1 fabric, 1 leather, and NO silicone). I ended up making my own out of a felt piece of fabric. Also, the cradle is necessary. You gotta carry it around everywhere, but it does looks a lot more neat amongst all that clutter on my desk. Those who travel probably wouldn't like it. If this is you, get the little adapter for the hd3 on ebay. Works on the hd1 as well. Lastly, there are absolutely no accessories (except for wired remotes) for this player, which is a major bummer.   	Why you should buy the hd1: Physically beautiful, appealing, durable, outstanding battery life, very small and light, great sound quality, price (see conclusion).  	Why you shouldn't: Sonicstage, a few annoying habits, you have to pay to get the firmware upgrade (although I heard if you buy a new one now, you don't). No accessories, no fancy features.  	Side note: Sony has THE WORST customer support IMAGINABLE!  	CONCLUSION: This is a great piece of hardware, but it may not be for you. In my case, the things I listed above (small/lightweight, sound quality, battery life), they are most important to me. Not to mention, for a used one, I only spent $80! Come on, $80 won't buy you anything nowadays except an iPod shuffle that holds 5 songs. It's nice to know that even if I break this thing, I can always get a new one without spending my life savings. Just because it's old does not mean it's obsolete (yet). However there are plenty of reasons why you should NOT buy this. The video iPod is absolutely beautiful. The screen is gorgeous. iTunes is a great, simple program that's dead simple to use, and quick. There are a million accessories for the iPod. You can install Linux on your iPod. Enough said. The hd5 has a longer battery life that's replaceable, and it doesn't need a cradle. The creative zen vision:m has great video battery life and doesn't have all these stupid legal restrictions. Archos players are probably the easiest to use. In short, you should only buy the hd1 if your preferences look like mine. (or you're broke! Haha) Know what you want, how much you want to spend, and know what to expect. Just to let you know though, for now, I'm satisfied with mine.

<Title>Well... Sony Strikes out again
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a completely Beautiful device, it looks awesome, has long battery life, and since its made by sony... it seems like a no-brainer  If you agree with this, you are mistaken, myself i thought this was a far supirior product to the ipod until i bought one.  the program you haveto live with to get music on this thing is probably the most annoying program i have ever used, always buggy, wont encode half my music collection, and is SLOW the ATRAC 3 format you haveto use cant be opened in anything other then Sonic stage, so if you want to be able to use your computer Other than just litening to music (using a music player that takes up less system memory) you haveto keep both your old mp3s and theese useless atrac 3 files  the device itself is nice... looking, but once you start to use it  it is barely possible to navigate though your music collection if you have anywhere near its 20 gig compacity  Just dont buy it, youll save yourself ALOT of time and money
