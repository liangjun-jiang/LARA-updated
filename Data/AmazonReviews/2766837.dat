<Title>Electronic Moron Finds Love...
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I have seen two pretty bad reviews here and let me tell you, those people are doing something wrong!  I have had my Sony Network Walkman for 2 days now and I LOVE IT!!   This is my first Mp3 player and being the technology idiot that I am, I was afraid that I would get this thing and it would take me days to figure out how to use it.  Well, within 15 minutes I was beginning the process of transfering the better part of my music collection onto this itsy bitsy tiny little thing.  It was so easy to use the software.  It even came with 5 free music downloads from SonicStage.  The thing I am most impressed with is the sound quality.  The only songs that suffered any quality (only a little bit) are songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs.  Understandable.  But the rest of them are crystal clear.  You can adjust the eq only a little bit, but for me, its enough.  I like the bass a little heavy and this player satisfies that.   All in all, I believe that I got really got my money's worth.  This absolutely a great purchase, I love it, I love it, I love it!

<Title>Hard to go wrong with Sony, LOVE this one!
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this little tiny MP3 player. I really have no complaints about it. The software is easy to install and user friendly. The MP3 player itself is so small and lightweight yet easy to operate, even while running. It never skips either. I loaded music on it right away when I got it and was amazed at how easy it was to convert my music files to their sony software and then the transfer was a snap. The sound is great and I am using basic headphones from a previous Sony product. Possibly could be better with better headsets, but who knows, the sound is plenty for your ears. I highly recommend this one. For the price you can't beat it!

<Title>Make a smart informed choice instead of going with the flow
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can go with the flow and buy an iPod or you can be smart and buy this awesome device with superior technology.  Here's a side by side comparison with the 1gb iPod shuffle:  - Number of songs:  iPod (240), Sony (680) - Battery life:  iPod (12 hours), Sony (70 hours)  It's not even a contest!  You don't even need a brain to figure this one out.  You'll waste 6 batteries on a Shuffle for every one on Sony.  I've never listed to a Shuffle but I can say the quality of the music on here is awesome.  However, I must admit I do own stock in Apple because I know all those dumb people out there will continue buying them!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player overall
<Date>Sat Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite all the reviews out there warning about file transferring and sony mp3 players i decided to get this b/c it was the most banf for the buck.  The mp3 player and software are actually both pretty easy to use.  You just basically load the songs onto the software and transfer the songs onto the player.  Simple as that.  The software can convert the songs from mp3 format into atrac3-plus format when you are transferring songs, so that way the player can hold more songs.  I've uploaded a little over 500 songs onto my player at 64-kbps and the quality isnt noticeably different from my other mp3s.  Another good thing is that navigation is pretty easy on the mp3 player.  You basically organize your songs into "groups" and you name your groups, e.g. rock, sum 41, r&b, etc., and you can just browse to the group you want.  And you can shuffle/repeat the group you want or all the songs in the mp3 player.  You can also browse song-by-song, which doesnt take too long, the navigation goes pretty quickly when you hold down the buttons.  The battery life is also very good.  You can use the thing on one AAA for more than 40 hours.  The mp3 player also resumes the music you were playing immediately when turned on. So overall a great mp3 player, but for the following:  it takes a long time to organize and transfer songs onto the player, took me an entire day to do that.  Plus, although the group navigation kind of is adequate, i wish this player supported regular playlists.  I guess thats the drawback with flash mp3 players.  If you dont travel alot and can put up with charging, I would definitely suggest shelling out a few extra bucks for a mini harddrive player.  But this is a extremely good player for those taking trips where charging isnt covenient.  Another negative aspect as that the player is kind of flimsy.  Looks ok, but it doesnt seem to be extremely sturdy.  The player is extremely light, even with the battery installed, so goes good in your pocket or whereever.  I also own a larger 20GB harddrive mp3 player and I like this so much better.  It's lighter, and battery life is awesome, and just seems to be more hassle free.  Further, with the larger, i felt i was carrying around a ton of songs i never listened to, while with this, its always playing my favorite songs (sum 41 rules, btw).  Well, over all a terrific player.  Well worth its price.

<Title>Yes, it plays MP3 directly and yes, it supports drag-and-drop
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Some of the reviews here contain materially false information.   This player plays MP3 songs directly, without the need to convert them to ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus format. This is covered at great length in the manual.  This player supports drag-and-drop for MP3 files. The SonicStage software is only necessary if you want to work with ATRAC. Look online for the appropriate version of Sony's "MP3 File Manager" (version 2.0 as of this writing).  For those who want to work with ATRAC, SonicStage is a stable and reliable application, when used in a stable and reliable environment. It is best to use Windows XP, install the lastest updates, use virus-checking software, and avoid running software from untrusted sources.

<Title>Easy to use, great sound, lots of songs, what's not to like?
<Date>Tue Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really don't understand the hyperbolic criticism of Sony's SonicStage software.  It took me all of five minutes to figure it out, without even looking at the manual.  Clearly, some of the reviewers here have failed to read THEIR manual.  There's no requirement to use SonicStage;  your PC will see the NW-E107 as just another USB-connected storage device.  Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your MP3's, if that's the format you like... this unit plays them just perfectly.  I suppose if you have a humongous library of MP3's, and for some reason you really really really wanted to be able to manipulate them through SonicStage, you would become frustrated that you had to first "transfer" them into the SonicStage library and put them in a playlist.  But this really isn't the best use for the included software.  The advantage with SonicStage is realized for someone just starting with assembling a collection of portable music files.  The ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus compression algorithms designed by Sony allow you to cram an incredible amount of music onto this tiny podlet.  It's really remarkable... I'm currently walking around with 27 full-length cd's on mine.  This is plenty for me to choose from when I go running, or have to get on an airplane, or have an extended stint at the old computer keyboard at work.  The unit weighs practically NOTHING; the packaging it comes in weighs more than it does.  Even with the AAA battery in, it simply disappears in a shirt pocket, you don't even feel it there.  It's great when working out; when I'm out running I just pop it in the pocket of my shorts.    The controls are simple and intuitive.  Is it "feature rich?"  Gee, I dunno... it plays the songs, lets me access them easily, lets me shape the treble and bass (you get three preset levels, one the flat factory setting, the other two user configurable... I have one setting for general use and one for inside the motorcycle helmet).  You can preset a volume level that will be your default whenever you fire it up.  There's some other stuff it does, but that's all I ever need, so I haven't spent too much time monkeying around with the other features (lots of byzantine repeat modes that I would never use in a million years).  I program computers all day, the last thing I want to do is have to program my personal stereo.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because the little plastic plug that covers the USB port is kind of tricky to pry open, and because there's no way to clip this thing onto your clothes if you happen to be without a convenient pocket.  Also, I'm not totally sold on the earpod headphones... but I have a pair of Sony PSYC headphones that I love, so no biggie.  Otherwise I am totally pleased with this purchase.  Under $150, and I have triple the song capacity and triple the battery life of a $300+ iPod.  For me, that's worth sacrificing all of the file-sharing-with-friends features that probably appeal more to kids in high school and college.  I just want to listen to music.  This little guy does the job for me.

<Title>The Truth According To Zowie
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Flawed Fatally" and "SonicStage Suicide" are pretty much right on in their appraisals.    The hardware is awesome.  I don't regret getting this gem.  I just squeezed 20 albums on this puppy with roughly 250+ songs.   And the battery life is spectacular - Sony must employ some of the best power management experts on the planet.    However, and this is the big frustrator, the Sonic software IS the worst piece of crap I've ever used, going back to the DOS days of the '80s.  It's horrendously slow (almost like watching the grass grow), weirdly inaccurate (in it's gauges showing transfers), unintuitive, and basically a scam (my opinion) to get you out to their website to sell you more music.   BTW, since the instruction manual says you can't drag-and-drop MP3s and have them play, and since I tried this and it in fact doesn't work just as the folks at Sony truthfully say, don't believe that you can despite what other reviewers here say.  What you can do is drag-and-drop files, so you could use this as a portable memory stick, but they really don't play... at least I haven't been able to get them to play.    In summary, however bad the software is, the hardware is still amazing and I hope that I won't have to interact with the software too often.  I even went out and downloaded the latest software from the 'net, so don't think this is just an outdated review and new software might be available.  I suggest to Sony that they skip from version 3.2 straight to 5.0, fire all the developers of the present software and go get a team who can whip off something worthwhile.  And, develop drag-and-drop for MP3s.

<Title>DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE CRY ON HERE THIS IS THE BEST EVER
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>IM NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND WRITE A REVIEW THATS VERY DETAILED, SOME PEOPLE ALREADY DONE THAT SO WHAT IM GOING TO SAY IS SIMPLE AND EASY. THIS MP3 PLAYER SIMPLY RULES, THE HEAD PHONES IS SO SO. THE SONIC STAGE  SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE MP3 PLAYER IS SO EASY TO WORK, U SPEND 3 MINUTES READING THE CARD TO SHOW U HOW TO ATTACH THE MP3 PLAYER AND HOW TO COPY MUSIC FROM YOUR PC ETC. ITS SO EASY FOR ME I BOUGHT THIS CD PRETTY MUCH TO RIP MY CURRENT CDS ONTO THE PLAYER... IT WORKS GREAT ALL U GOTTA DO IS INSERT THE CD  AND IT READS IT STORES AND ALL VERY FAST.  IF U RIP A CD U BURNED U CLICK A SEPARATE BUTTON CLICK  IMPORT SONGS AND THATS IT U ARE DONE, LABEL THE FOLDER AND ITS FINISH. DONT SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CRYING CAUSE THEY CANT FIGURE THIS OUT. I DID TONS OF RESEARCH ON THE NET BEFORE I GOT THIS MP3 PLAYER AND IT SIMPLY ROCKS. ONLY THING THAT SUCKS IS IT DOES NOT COME WITH A NECK STRAP BUT I HAD A OLD DIGITAL CAMERA THAT HAD A NECK STRAP THAT I FIT ONTO THE MP3 PLAYER SO PROBLEM SOLVED. 5 STARS FOR THIS PLAYER

<Title>Buy the Right Thing!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection.    Many of the complaints seem to arise from assumptions made about the player and capabilities it was not intended to feature, rather than product which doesn't live up to its claims.  I've just bought a new SOMY Walkman A3000 20 GB because I want more storage, but I will keep this little beauty because it's the only one I know that runs on a battery. I'll also replace it if I can, should it's life run out before a newer version is available.

<Title>Player is great... but don't count on finding armband
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have loved the unit itself.  I had a minor issue in which I had to send it off for warranty work a few months after the purchase.  It has worked great & I have enjoyed the quality of the MP3 player itself.  The problem is that after less than 2 years of it being out, it is no longer possible to find the armband to carry it in.  I have looked all over the Sony website & called their Sales department.  It is not available anywhere.  I have used the Google search engine looking for any place that might sell it.  Amazon has a listing for it, but does not have any to sell anymore.

<Title>Awesome little player but something goes wrong 6 mos later
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little MP3 player from Sony!I have two of them. They are perfect for working out...BUT something majorly malfunctions after about 6 mos of use! When the player gets ready to go haywire, the battery will go dead- which seems to be an easy fix;I've replaced them successfully numerous times before, but this time when the battery is replaced, the player seems to lose its mind! The display reads "Data Access" and will not stay on for more than ten seconds, and flashes Data access every  subsequent time it blacks out.Within an hour or 2 of this happening, it ceases to work at all.When this problem felled the second player of mine yesterday,it popped loudly. I happened to be listening to it at the time. Sony charges a flat rate of $77.00 on any repair plus whatever costs might arise if they fix it,so there's little point in trying to repair one of these since you can go buy a new one for about the same price.There is apparently some design flaw,but these little players are AWESOME while they last. Just wish Sony could get them perfected...

<Title>Great player...CAN transfer mp3s without using SonicStage
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player works great. I have owned it for a little over a year now and it has been going strong. I wanted to clear up a few misconceptions that older reviews seem to focus on...this player DOES NOT have to be used with Sonic Stage software...at some point, Sony included a download in their updates section that allows you to download an mp3 transfer program. Although it's not as nice as the drag/drop format of a newer player, it sure beats importing to ATRAC and then converting to MP3. You can find this download on Sony's support site at:  http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=NWE107&upd_id=1936&os_id=99  For some, since this player doesn't have any functions like voice recording, fm player/recorder or sleep timer that some of the newer players now have it may not be worth it to buy this model. For people like me who just want a simple mp3 player, nothing else I've seen comes close to touching the 60 hours of playback time that I can get from one single AAA battery. (I also own a Sansa m240 mp3 player and only get 16 hours from the same size battery and can take the dead battery out of the Sansa and it will play another 5-6 hours in this Sony!)

<Title>Fake mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got mine (512MB, blue version of this) from Sonystyle.com just yesterday. After playing with it for a few hrs here are my impressions.  First and foremost the mp3 playback quality is atrocious. 128kbps files sound like 64kbps or lower. Even my no-brand-name cheap mp3/cd player has better mp3 quality.   I suspect the codec/DSP in the Sony are still designed for their propreitary ATRAC3 plus format with a secondary mp3 support. In fact converting a mp3 file to Atrac3plus (with included software) sounded better than just mp3 file. Inspite of this hassle, it was still below mp3 quality from other players.   The battery life seems to be in line with the specs listed by Sony. No complaints on that front. The backlight LCD display is a nice bonus too. However size/volume is significantly more than the iPod Shuffle.  The user interface is more loaded than such a small palyer can withstand. As a result it more cumbersome and confusing than Apple/iRiver players.  In short this awkwardly named "mp3" music player is a step in right direction for Sony but is still below average. Price is right but not the quality.

<Title>Very good sound quality, less than an oz, long battery
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins, esp. in the waist!) MP3/ATRACT players from Sony are the latest models of their Psyc line of digital music players.  The new-age styling of these MP3 players does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.   The new silver Psyc MP3 player features 1GB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick -- esp. in the middle area where the single AAA battery resides. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)   What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase "up to" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)   Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.   The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version).  It has a nice, sharp backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit "muffled" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).   Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.   In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little with transfering music. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions.  Recommended.

<Content>There's a few things too look for in a flash player. Long Battery Life. Check. LCD Screen with International Language Support. Check Good Navigation. Ah, good enough. Price. Check  Easy to put songs in. This is the major one.  Here comes the doozy. YOU can only use SonicStage Software to put files into this 'chine. No drag and drop. No drag and drop. What happens if you want to port stuff over to say a school computer? Nope. Say you want to port stuff over to friends place. Nope. Say you want to port stuff from your friend to your place. Nope.  That really sucks. Flash is more expensive than Hard Drive MP3s. If you cant use it as storage as well as listening to music then it's not worth that extra cash wedge, battery life or no battery life.

<Title>Blows away anything else in it's category
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is amazing for the category it's in.  People complaining about it are comparing it to hard drive players but this is a flash memory player so it'll never skip.  The sound quality is excellent.  Of course you need to use Sony's Sonic Stage program to put music into it but that's what makes this one so much better than the others in it's category.  Sony's program compresses the music file so you get almost 700 songs in the 1 GB memory.  Compare this to the Apple iPod shuffle which is also 1 GB and only holds 240 songs.  Plus the iPod plays at random and doesn't have a display to show you what's playing or choose what you want to hear.  This blows the iPod out of the water for the same price.  I'm very happy with this player and will eventually be moving up to the 20 GB Sony hard drive MP3 player which holds 13,000 songs compared the Apple 20 GB player that only holds 5,000.

<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I got to say that I has a iPod Shuffle 1G, and the change to the new Sony Sony NW-E107 Network Walkman 1 GB was awesome. This unit has a great sound quality, you can control the bass and treble levels. The earbuds are pretty good, sounds great.  The buttons and display are fine. The LCD display it's no that clear and the buttons are quite complicated to command, you need to take the hole unit in your hand to control the player.  The battery, the best. You can have up to 70 hours of continuous playing with only one AAA battery. And if you go for a long trip or something, you would get there with batteries, and if not, you can replace it. Great.  The software. The bad part of the movie. I thought that iTunes was lame, but the Sony's SonicStage it's even worst. Quite complited, not friendly, not good.  The other ugly part of the unit it's the transfer speed from the computer. With USB 2.0 you can transfer below 1Mb/s.  I think that the bad parts can't compare with the great ones. Sounds great, superior battery life, good earbuds and good looking.

<Title>So many whiners...
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this and have been playing with it for a few hours. I don't have any idea why all these people are whining. Their major complaint is that the software is hard to use. That just blows me away. If you have the technical skill to navigate to amazon.com, then you will be able to use this software with no problem.   The player itself is completely amazing, though. I love this to death. It is much smaller than the pictures lead you to believe and it is feather light. It blows my mind how this thing weighs less than the AAA battery that is used to run it! Everyone says the battery lasts up to 70 hours, too. I havn't had it long enough to check that, but from what I've seen with it on for the last few hours, it has't run down any. Control is pretty easy, too. The sound quality is great, and this little thing is LOUD. It can go high enough to be too loud, and that's something I like in an Mp3 player. It also has a feature to automatically adjust the volume between songs. That's a nice feature since some of the songs I own are quiet and hard to hear and it makes them all equally audible.   I havn't owned this thing for a full day yet, but I love it to death! This is a spectacular Mp3 player, even if the other reviews make it seem like an inferior product. 5 Stars!!

<Title>iThink therefore iSony
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My iRiver IFP-195 finally packed up the other day so I began looking around for a suitable replacement. iPods have never appealed to me due to battery issues and sound quality and iRiver's latest products do not support Windows 98 so I decided to check out Sony's latest offerings. That's when I came across this wonderful little player.  I don't download music, I just convert my own CDs so I wasn't concerned about any alleged MP3 issues (although it obviously does play them). I had previously converted my CDs to WMA for the iRiver and so once I got this home I converted some of my favourite albums to ATRAC3 (132kbps) to see if they sounded as good.  Not only did they sound better, especially the bass, but unlike MP3 and WMA on the iRiver there were no added gaps between tracks. This meant that I could finally listen to albums like Oxygene and Equinoxe without the annoying split-second gaps between the tracks on the CD. It was worth it for that alone.  As for SonicStage, I don't understand why people have a problem with it. You put a CD in, convert the tracks to ATRAC3 (or ATRAC3Plus), plug the player in and copy the tracks across. Once on the player you can move the albums around. It's not rocket science and I actually found it to be better than iRiver's Music Manager.  In summary, I think this is a wonderful player which far exceeded my expectations.

<Title>Small slice of audio heaven
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for a few weeks now and I must say this is the BEST investment I have made! It really is an adorable little device that packs a HUGE audio punch. The sound is superior to any portable music player I have tried, and you can fully adjust the treble and bass to how ever your preference prefers. For such a small device, it has many features that make this device very interesting and enjoyable to work with and listen to. It's also a handy, portable, plug-n-play storage device that allows you to drag and drop files.  I read all the reviews I could before I purchased this device, and many people complained about the lack of drag-n-drop of music files. Sony has made such software capabilities available for past players, so perhaps they will for this player in the future as well. For me, it doesn't matter because Sony's SonicStage software just is NOT that big of a deal for me to use. Over the years I have amassed a HUGE MP3 collection of my own CD's and CD's I check out from the public library (a better option than downloading if you live in a larger Metro area with a HUGE music collection in their library). It is quite simple to get the music on the player. I imported the MP3 versions into SonicStage, converted them all to ATRAC3plus 48 kbs and dumped them on to the player.  I'm fairly picky about the quality of music I listen to, but I can NOT state firmly enough how absolutely GREAT the sound quality of even 48 kbs of the ATRAC3plus versions sound on this player. By converting my MP3 collection to the ATRAC3plus 48 kbs files system, I still have my MP3 collection AND a MUCH reduced in file size set that I can burn on to CD's for a backup. Blank CD's are inexpensive, and it's good to have another backup of my music collection. By converting my MP3's to the ATRAC3plus system, I now have around 750 songs on my Network Walkman player. Sony indicates 695, but there certainly IS room for more than that. It's just AMAZING that I can listen to my music on this player at work for two weeks and not hear the same song twice AND all of this from one AAA battery. INCREDIBLE!  Yes, it will be nice when Sony finally gets the armband released for this player, but I have a brain and can figure out a way to make my own until then. That's called ingenuity.  ;-)  If you want an FM tuner, Sony has a 1 GB player with that feature either out or soon to be released. I purchased this player because I do NOT want to have to listen to the radio. I just can not say enough good about this player. The onboard features are excellent, the operation of the player and yes, even the SonicStage software are quite intuitive if you take a few seconds to actually make the effort to look (and heaven forbid - read!) through the menus. I have an older and slower computer and when I imported and converted my MP3's, it did take a while to convert them to the MUCH better sounding and efficient ATRAC3plus 48 kbs, but I simply began the process right before I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning they were done and transferring the ATRAC3plus 48 kbs files on to the player was very quick, even with my slower USB 1 transfer capabilities. It was literally only a matter of minutes to fill up my player with over two weeks worth of high quality sounding music pleasure.  If you don't care about listening to the radio, you don't need your player to be a mini-recorder, you don't mind having about two week's worth of music to listen to all from one AAA battery, then I HIGHLY recommend you purchasing this player. I have absolutely NO regrets and am 100% satisfied with my purchase and the performance of this player. Thank you Sony!

<Title>good player but, customer service issues w/ Sony
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player in April 2005. It stopped playing for no reason. Replaced battery and still no function. I emailed and phoned Sony Customer Support and they said they would either repair or send me a refurbished one.I opted to send the player in for repair. A tech called and said he would give me a discount on the repair(almost the cost of a new one) Long story short, they have had my player from July to September with no call, no email what so ever.In fact, I still do not have my player as I write this. I feel like I've thrown $150. away. As for the player itself, the software for me is great, easy to use, and the player up until it stopped working after 45 days, was great aw well. I agree the head phones aren't so good so I purchased new ones. So I thought this was a great player until it stopped.

<Content>This mp3 player is great! It's small, has a long battery life, and it can hold a ton of songs. Also, it has two modes so you can skip easily from playlist to playlist or just look through the songs from one playlist. I recommend getting the armband that goes with it. It makes working out very enjoyable and it doesn't get in the way. Overall, a great product.

<Content>I'll make this quick:  It's tiny. It's solid. IT SOUNDS AWESOME!   PS  ...I'm not sure why there's so much griping about the software.  It does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it well.  It's obvious some of these reviewers have not used any other music related software  ...because they are all cumbersome and a little bulky.  Sony's is no better NOR worse than any of the others I've used, and I've used quite a few.

<Title>Bad support and Software
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What's wrong with this device? Well, Sony has done a great job of isolating people from the openess of music. This MP3 Player is small, and holds a lot. Unfortunatly, it requires you to use Sony's software, SonicStage. Because of this, Sony has made sure that you can't get any online songs from anyone else.   "At this time, online music services such as the Roxio Napster, Listen.com Rhapsody, or Apple iTunes Music Store are not directly compatible with the Net MD Walkman recorder or Network Walkman player."  This means your using Sony's CONNECT music store to get music online. Not only is this music store hard to navigate, it doesn't seem to have a lot in it.  If that doesn't seem bad enough, you'd better keep your installation disc in a safe place. Sony will charge you $20.00 to get another copy from them.  Although the MP3 player might work fine, the software and services required to use with it are terrible.

<Title>Sony Did A Great Job With The Network Walkman!
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This was my first digital music player purchase.  I did a great deal of research on numerous players before finally deciding to buy this product.  I could not be more impressed with the player, and consider it a great investment.  Contrary to reviewer complaints about the SonicStage software, I found the software to be fairly user friendly after reading the instructions and working with it for only a short time.  It accomplishes everything it is intended to do.  I compressed several CD's and transferred them directly into the player via the software. I also transferred numerous MP3's into the player.  The player came with a coupon for five free downloads from the Sony Connect Music Store.  I took advantage of the coupon, and downloaded the free songs.  The music store can be accessed directly via the Internet or through the SonicStage software suite.        I have no complaints with the sound of the player.  The sound is crystal clear, and tone preferences can be adjusted manually.  I also found the player to have plenty of volume when used with the included headphones.  It does have a fragile feel to it, so I recommmend purchasing the sleeve armband that is advertised as an accessory.  There is no clip on the player, so the armband serves a dual purpose as a protective and carrying device that works well during during physical activity such as running and cycling.    There are numerous players available out there.  For the money, I think this is a smart bet.

<Title>Simple, sounds great, no moving parts, nice.
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using mine for a couple of months now. It's simple to operate, it sounds great(!), it has no harddrive to fail, and it runs a long time on one AAA battery. It weighs so little, I can let it dangle from my neck when I'm at my desk. I like it a lot.  There is a three position switch on the side that allows you to step by track or by folder. The third position is "hold" which locks out the other buttons so you can carry it in your pocket with no worries about accidentally changing settings.  The E107 will play music ripped to 256 bits, which is CD quality to my ears. The player is advertised to accept up to 320 bit MP3s but anything above 256 gets re-compressed. I find the sonic quality of Sony's re-compression unacceptable, so I've re-ripped my music at 256 bits (variable bit rate). Most people probably rip at 160 to 192 so this wouldn't be an issue for many.  The SonicStage software isn't exactly dazzling, but it's Ok. I have the generic file management software loaded onto my device, but I usually don't bother with it. SonicStage is adequate for my use.  My wife has expressed an interest in an MP3 player after seeing mine, so we'll probably end up with a second one.

<Title>Between this and the iPod Shuffle, go with this
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I traditionally buy Sony for whatever portable listening device I'm currently using (all the way back from the original Walkman). They have a great shelf life, and I suspect this player will too.   I actually like the idea of using replacable batteries over a rechargable internal battery because the life is so much longer. Other rechargables don't even make a transcontinental flight, and then you're stuck! Besides, ONE AAA battery lasts a very long time in this little beauty.  The buttons are simple and excellent. There are too many players with tiny buttons that these big thumbs can't press easily while jogging; this player does it right.   Also, the Shuffle does not have a display. This does, and it lets you choose between individual songs or whole albums (groups)...yes!!  About the software, yes it is a little annoying, but it's a quick extra step and is handy for compiling mixed playlists. Otherwise, I do miss the drag and drop of my old player and havent taken the time to see how that can be done with this (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). I haven't fooled around with the ATRAC format either- I keep the music files in mp3 format so that I can do other things with them.   About the sound quality- and there's really only a few other reviewers dissatisfied- try adjusting the sound equalizer and using headphones other than the ones supplied (they aren't any good). I can get M.I.A. severely thumping  at 190kbps. Besides, the ability to store so many albums on this inexpensive device makes it a little easier to compromise on sound quality. The thing is to tinker with the controls and the file sizes until you're happy. So far I am.

<Title>We have 2 of these and still going great after a year!
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just had to write this review because I recently decided to buy an alkaline battery-powered MP3 player which can record off a built-in microphone and has a radio tuner. I ordered the Creative Zen Nano & the Sandisk Sansa and they were so much more inferior in quality to the Sony Network Walkman. I've read the reviews and it seems that most of the problems people have with Sony is the software. There do not seem to be very many people who encounter hardware problems with Sony. The drag and drop features of the other players were very attractive, but it doesn't do you any good if the player breaks down all the time. I've had my Sony MP3 player for a little over a year now and it has been very reliable. My husband has one too and he loves it. I usually load our CDs using ATRAC3 format but I have a couple of MP3 songs which I imported into Sonic Stage (using "Import..Music File") . We create playlists on Sonic Stage and just load the playlists into our players (note..it is very slow in transfering and deleting files ..grrr).  It's a pain, since I have two different music libraries (one in MP3 and one in ATRAC3), but I never worry about my player locking up or crashing.  In short, you just have to decide what is more important to you...if your music library is fairly stable (i.e. you don't recycle or change your songs often) and you want a player that's well made and reliable, then this one is for you.    Oh yeah..I also hate the fact that you have to register your player and your computer with the Sonic Stage Website in order to use your player... and you can only register a limited number of computers (5) to use with your player at one time.  I only really use one computer to load songs into my player but I just don't like the idea of having a limit. And since it takes so long to erase all the songs off the player at one time, I just format the player (which erases all the songs in a couple of seconds), but I have to re-register the player with the website to reload songs into it....grrrr!

<Content>The biggest and most serious drawback I ever faced (because of which I have not been able to use the player even once) was the format incompatibility with mp3.  This player does not play mp3 files !!! It only recognizes a proprietary format called ATTRAC3 and these songs can only be downloaded using Sonic Stage, provided along with the product. Note that there is NO WAY you can  play a song w/o installing sonic and runnning Sonic Stage first on your PC.  Due to numerous issues and its incompatibilty with OS versions etc. most people are not even able to run the software therby renderingt he product useless.

<Title>Sony  Network Walkman
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sony Walkman, Sony over the past 2 decades have been about the best product to purchase, from the first tape player walkman I purchased to the CD players, now to the MP3 players. As a long standing tradition, you almost always have to purchase additional headphones as the pair supplied usually do not last very longv (or sound terrible). The same goes for today's MP3 players. Back in 1986 you could purchase a pair of Sony ear buds, and they would last six months, today your lucky if they last two weeks. But Of course the Tape Player walkman would last a long time, until the cover finally separated from the body, and I became tired of taping it back together. Today the Sony NW-E107 model seems to have survived the usual abuse I give these products, How many times can you drop one, I have had mine for nine months now, it is scratched and beat, I have gone through many sets of head phones, But the pair that have lasted are the Sony MDR-EX51 ear buds (around $50), they are coming apart in the usual Sony fashion (a common problem since the 80s), but they have lasted. The Sony NW-E107 itself is still operational. The buttons have become sticky which I resolved with a can of air and silicone spray, the battery life is good (I wish it had a rechragable battery), the sound is good enough. I use this walkman every day, it does take a lot abuse, I am not looking for high fidelity perfection, I am looking for a simple to use, small package that can carry a lot of music, with a reasonably decent sound. This has all that. The only problems I have really encountered are    First: the software, this is a terribly written piece of software, slow, sluggish and crashes to much. I don't have two hours to load music; I just do not have the patience. There is a program that was available an MP3 drag and drop which I can not find a link to. If you happen to install the provided Sonic Stage, run the task manager sometime, look for SAAD, that would be sonic stage using unescarry resources even thou your player is not connected. I have disabled it in my win xp start up.    Two: The buttons, becoming sticky, I fully expected this to occur, given the use and expose. The problem is turning it off. You have to hold the play button for 5 seconds (so says the manual) I have spent ten minutes trying to get this thing to turn off. It usually starts again after I hold it for the 5 seconds. I have managed to turn it off, a few hours later finding it still playing? I have wasted many batteries with this. Now when I want to turn it of I remove the battery entirely. (This causes the player to start at the beginning of the first folder of music) A simple on / off switch would be a nice feature.   This has been a fairly good product despite the drawbacks. I am considering purchasing the SanDisk SDMX4-2048 Sansa e250 2 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot as my next MP3 Player.  I believe the Good ole' golden days of reliability for Sony are over (I have other failing sony products). But I must say once upon a time they were the best, economical product around.

<Title>Great if you put some work into it

<Content>All the other reviews on here are very negative.  I understand where they're all coming from.  It is NOT easy to put songs on this player and if you're a fan of any other music jukebox besides Sony's SonicStage (I am...) then you're going to have a hard time.  If you put some work into this player, it can be better than an iPod (in storage).  According to the description on a 2 GB iPod Nano, it can store 1,000 songs on 2 gigs.  This 1 GB Sony Network Walkman could probably store a TON more than that (possibly 2000 but you'd have to be very lucky).  Here's a little guide to using it that will make it worth it.  1. Make a folder for each artist and put their songs in alphabetical order in each folder (yes this must be done manually).  By doing this you can quickly get to the artist you want ultimately making it easier to get to the song you want faster.  2. Mess around with the settings on SonicStage.  Personally I think the best transfer setting is to have it set to 64 kbps.  You still have high quality audio without losing the space.  (Just a note:  songs from a retail CD or an online music store will sound better than songs from a burned CD.  This may be true with other players as well but I'm not sure.)  3. Anything downloaded from a different music store with a license on it must be burned to a CD and imported into SonicStage straight from the CD so it doesn't interfere with any licenses.  By burning it and ripping it from the CD, it doesn't take the license with it when it's burned to a CD.  Those are some main points.  By following all three of those steps, you can get the most out of your MP3 player.  I will admit there are better MP3 players out there than this one but this one can be good.  Hard work with this one can pay off.

<Title>It is not a MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is not a MP3 player because it just plays Sony's audio format (ATRAC), so you always have to convert your MP3 files into ATRAC format using a software provided by the manufacturer (that is not so easy to use).
