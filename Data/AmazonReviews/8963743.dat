<Title>Excellent Player/Recorder
<Date>Tue May 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this player for a little while now and just wanted to share my thoughts.  A few reasons I purchased this player is for the less restrictive offerings it provides.  For example, the ability to play many formats, including lossless encoded FLAC.  I like to use my players in the home and car more than thru earphones, so good audio reproduction is a must and this can do it.  Also, I want full quality audio recordings which I can then compress into my favored mp3/FlAC/OGG codec.  This player offers full quality WAV format recording instead of the usual limited 128k mp3 encoded recordings most other players restrict you with.  The form factor and design of this player is great.  Fits really well and comfortably in the palm of my hand and is intuitive and simple to use.  The only gripe is the scroll wheel could use a little more grip on it's surface as my thumb tends to slide over the surface rather than moving the wheel.  And if you press too hard for additional grip it will activate the scroll wheel buttons.  Sound quality and features are awesome also, including a parametric EQ to provide total control over your equalizition preferences.    One thing to note is when trying to transfer FLAC files, I could not use the MTP protocol for hard drive players.  I had to reset the driver to the standard usb mass storage device.

<Title>Excellent SQ, small, and logical player
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't want to say much, this player is simple, what I expect one to be like, and it works great.  It has amazing sound quality (I heard pretty much every single other player on the market).  Putting music onto it is as easy as drag&drop, the player basically works like a flash drive that plays back music.  The interface is comfortable, although the controller takes a bit of time getting used to.  I am not worried much about the control as long as I can do it quickly and the player works well (which it does, I had it for about 4 months now).  You can use it while jogging, it will not skip.  It supports gapless playback for those of you that matters, and gapless it is, I used a continuous album that was just broken up into tracks for comfort, and had my friend listen to (he had no idea what he was listening to).  He could not even tell that he listen to 3 tracks, evidently, when he asked me 'how long is this song?'   The player has an excellent EQ, bass/treble or 5-band parametric.  I use it to boost the bass on my headphones a little bit, and it does not bloat, just makes it punchier and more audible.  When you get this player, make sure you do not select that you live in France (when starting it up), or the volume will be very quiet.  If you think it is quiet, reset it, go through the start up process again and select that you do not live in France =]  You will be surprised as to what the 7 mw output can do.  Highly recommended, although it is best if you grab some better phones to go with it.  If you need isolation, I highly recommend something from Etymotic, Westone, or Shure to go with this player in order to fully be able to enjoy what it brings to the table.    I do not work for Vibez, I am just an audio enthusiast.  If you have any questions with regard to this review, or anything in audio, feel free to contact me at [..]

<Title>Overall, fairly good
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sounds great and interacts well with external speakers requiring their own power source.  Song searching is very quick since you can sort song title, album name, or artist name alphabetically before scrolling through individual songs.   Only two complaints: Using windows media player to synch songs (manually, in my case) is fairly simple, but changing song information is a bitch, especially if you've connected to a second computer and have songs not present on your primary.  Song information has to be edited on the version in your computer, synch that file to the vibez, now you have two versions of the file, find the old version and delete from vibez.  It really is a pain compared to using itunes.   Secondly, creating an on-the-go type of playlist using the vibez interface is extremely slow requiring you to go through the entire menu top down for every single song.    Otherwise, I highly recommend the vibez.  It just requires a little more thought to operate than the ipod.

<Title>the amazing TREKSTOR Vibez
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the trekstor vibez, from the start i want to say that the design is delightful, it fits wonderfully in the hand as you scroll around the big scrolling wheel when browsing your music, you can modify some controls to go to certain shortcuts to your liking, and the player doesnt need any software to put the music in it, this could be one of the best AND the worst qualities  of the vibez, because if the properties of your tracks is not in order, it will show that way on the player, so you have to be careful with the names and titles of the artists and albums..etc, in conclusion the player has many strong points and the size of it is very good, its for peopel that like listening to their music alot with great quality and volume, but not for joggers, people who watch videos or audiophiles ...

<Title>Mixed Review Like the Vibez Hit a Blender
<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We purchased two of these about a month ago. We were mixed about returning them for our money back, however.  To be fair, first the pro's: -nice DAP, handles the audio much better than the iAudio players -drag & drop function -limited shortcuts to certain functions (may also be considered a "Con",  since the functions that I would've like to shortcut to isn't a   possibility -looks great (a "Con" too since the fingerprints immediately show up) -replaceable batteries--important on trips to be able to have some charged  ones ready to go -love the fact it is flash-based, as flash will last much longer than any  harddrive-based player -all kinds of bells and whistles on the interface, which can be a plus or  a minus (as it takes a few hikes on the system's tree to simply delete a  file). -love the wallpaper options (or screensavers)--love Rush's "Fly By Night"  owl as wallpaper! -love the Gapless and the ability to play FLAC!  Yeah! -thing will do Linux ( a definite plus!) to Vista to Win98!  Cons: -no decent cases to purchase (can't access the scroll wheel if used) -playlist can't be modified, once saved -saved Sessions sometimes corrupt other saved Sessions (a bug they  obviously won't be fixing) -customer "care" just repeats the same advice (update the firmware--  problem: the item ships with the latest firmware, which they have never   updated in a year to address the obvious bugs; also their "care" doesn't  even have a unit available to work with when speaking to you!) -unit rolls a bit on its curved back, which is a problem when you want to  work with the controls with one hand, while it is on its back -scroll wheel drives me batty! it is way too sensitive, and the firmware  offers no way to adjust how fast the unit fast-forwards or reverses. If  one isn't careful, you just either restarted your song or bounced to the  next. When it is a 2 hour concert in length, egad! Getting back to the  place I was takes a while, and it won't FF in smaller increments, as it  will do on a smaller file. It seems to adjust what the FF increment is by  the size of the track---goody... -I use a Logitech Wireless Music System connected to the item here.  Because the Vibez is curved on its back and because the headphone input  is on the bottom, my Music System doesn't quite fit on right. Also,  the USB input is right next to the audio output, so I have to take off  the Wireless System to hook up the USB (a small pain, but pain none-the-  less.) If you're interested in going almost wireless, your can find the  Logitech Wireless Music System here at Amazon:  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXQFJC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0370473-1281250">Logitech Wireless Music System</a>" (a great system) -if I hit a track to play, the player boots me to the main screen, and I  don't always wanna go there! -one has to go through the complete tree just to get to some commonly-  used areas and to play a song -Pro & Con is the fact that you can use Sessions like you'd use the  iAudio playlist function to add/remove songs. I have never owned any  other than these two players, so if other players' interfaces are like   the Vibez, egad! iAudio's=add track to playlist, remove track from list,   delete song. Simple and Voila! This one is a pain, especially when the  player kindly corrupts the session. -I am not sure that the volume is on French (it goes as high as 30- so   can someone clue me in?) I have reset it twice now. On some tracks, I  need to get the volume raised a tad more (some audible books) and can't. -I've moved my books and talk radio shows to my iAudio (which makes me  mad that I had to) and use the Vibez solely for my music. I am shocked   that I have already run out of room though... -we've had a few episodes where the units have just shut themselves off  for no apparent reason. Then a reformat, upon rebooting them--wonderful -if Trekstor hasn't come out with bug fixes after more than a year of   this model being out, they will not be doing so. As most electronic   companies, they just don't care to do so.  Here's a bug the their "care" doesn't seem to be aware of, and possibly has someone wondering what in the world...? I have also figured out its work-a-round.  When saving a playlist, if you have set your player to "repeat", the player never finishes saving the list. Sadly, you'll have to pull your battery! After you do, set the player to NOT repeat! When it is saving your list, it is trying to loop it in a repeating pattern (duh). After you have saved your list, you can stick it back to repeat, if you like. The default is to NOT repeat. Sadly, though not surprisingly, "care" didn't figure this out, when I called (nope, "update the firmware, Ma'am").  J&R on this site had this item for $189 (great price), but no one anywhere has them in stock. I am sure that we grabbed J&R's last two (sorry).  Can't comment on the FM (except that it comes separate). I didn't purchase it, as FM barely will come in my home.

<Title>I don' like Vibez players at all.
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own the 8GB player, not the 12GB, but I hate it so much I thought I'd let anyone considering this version know as well.  Normally, I really try and shy away from 1 star ratings, but this product I'm afraid warranted it. I have not had good luck with its reliability. A month into owning it, it stopped completing its start-up cycle. TrekStor was was fairly nice about having me return it for a replacement (tho they didn't send me pre-payed shipping labels like HP has). Now giving them the benefit of the doubt, it could have been a fluke and a bad unit. But immediately upon receiving the second one, it gives faulty "back cover removed" errors and shuts off. Since it's more than 90 days since I bought it from JR Electronics thru Amazon, they will not let me return it to them.  So I payed for this one to be returned as well, and it hasn't completely died on me yet.  That said, here's how I rate the non-reliability issues:  Pros -really elegant, snazzy look -great drag-and-drop way of adding/removing songs; it appears as a USB disk. -allegedly wide variety of supported formats  Cons -rotating wheel control is sometimes cumbersome and redundant with other buttons that do the same thing -player has trouble with .OGGs unless they are perfectly encoded; it's not that it won't play them--it plays them, then freezes up at the end of the song, and won't respond to anything until the battery has been removed *and then* the unit has been plugged into your USB port. -other random freezeups too.

<Title>Great product, horrible costumer service
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Vibez has plenty of space for music, excellent sound quality, is compatible with every operating system and every music-file format except for AAC, comes with great ear buds, includes a microphone and supports WMA DRM.  Sexy, too.  But mine randomly stopped working (perhaps a hard-drive failure from the noises?) after 3 months, and despite my full description of the problem and the fact that the device had (up until a week or two ago) worked flawlessly since last August, Trekstor Support insists that they cannot rule out my device being defective.  They have offered neither to repair nor replace my Vibez, and have pompously suggested that I contact the retailer I obtained it from, ie: Amazon.  Perhaps Amazon treats their customers better, but if not I see no reason to replace my Vibez with another Vibez instead of a device that comes with decent customer service.

<Title>I really like this, but...
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is awesome. Great sound quality, fair size for price (when I purchased it a year ago) and a lot of great features. Definitely a solid buy, and one I don't regret at all.  I've owned this for a year at this point although I'm jones-ing for something with more storage (Zune 1 now that they're half price). I had one or two crashes/freezes over a year, but they're easy to solve by using the reset feature (very handy). The ability to add an FM card internally and easily replace the unit's battery are attractive and uncommon features.  However...  You must realize that this is not an iPod or a Zune. Meaning: you won't find a hailstorm of accessories for it. It does not support Audible audiobooks yet (if you're into that sort of thing, Audible claims they're working with TrekStor to provide support "soon"), and firmware and other functionality updates are few and far between. If you can live with that, this is an easy-to-use, high-quality device.   A note about the FM card: reception is OK when you're in an area where the signal is strong. If you must have FM, then go for it. Otherwise, I don't think it's work the price, being smaller than a dime and not very powerful.

<Title>Really great player
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned a Rio Karma, and liked it a lot, but this is a definite improvement. The sound quality is stellar, not just because it lets you use better sounding formats than mp3, but because the internal preamp is great. More so than any other mp3 player - especially the ipod - this unit is designed around making music sound good as opposed to making something small that would store data. No brickwall limiter, no frequency response goosing, just good, detailed sound.   There were 2 features that I didn't know I wanted but now love: * Drag-and-drop file transfer. Not having to deal with software makes everything so much easier! It's such a little thing, but it makes the whole operation smoother. * The assortment of DJ functions. I didn't think I'd use this, but it's great. You can let it play for a set period of time based on random selection, on most- or least-listened to songs, or on year that songs were recorded. Plus a few others. I usually listen to whole albums, but this is a fun way to switch it up, especially the least-listened to feature.  I've had mine for a little over 2 months now, and it gets used 5 - 6 days a week. No problems, no bumps - just plug it in and go.  The wheel does take a bit of getting used to, and the radio receiver isn't so hot. Otherwise, I'm completely satisfied.

<Title>Solid music player
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The reason i bought the vibez is mainly due to the firmware they brought over from the Rio Karma, I like the easy to use interface and the 5 second crossfade (built in, unlike iPods which need iTunes to acheive the same effect). its compact, very sharp looking, and has other features like a voice recorder and picture viewing. No video or internet like an ipod touch, but for music its great.

<Content>I adore this little player.  I have been downloading audio books from my local library on the Cleveland library website. Can't do that with an iPod. At the Riovolution.org website one of the developers from Trekstor has been taking our input and releasing new firmware for it. They released 3 updates in the space of a month and have taken input from actual owners to improve the player.  Now has a feature on the device where you can choose MSC, MTP or RECHARGE ONLY mode. Current owners and anyone thinking of buying this should drop by this thread for info and the new firmware. [...]I can't think of one CON about this player. It realy is one of the best. I am tempted to buy another in case I lose or destroy mine, lol

<Title>VibeZ successor to mythical Rio Karma  
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For those familiar with Rio Karma which was last made a few years ago, we have long waited for a successor.  One that was worthy of the now mythical status of the best sounding DAP on the market.  The VibeZ might just be that DAP. The Rio Karma was way ahead of it's time with reguard to Sound Quality, ability to handle Multiple file formats, Gapless Playback, Crossfade playback and an incredible 6 band equalizer.  Many DAP audiophiles still consider it second to none when it comes to sound quality.  The chip set used in the Karma was made by Sigmatel.  Trekstor has created the VibeZ using the same chip set and Rio Karma like firmware.  The result is fantastic!  The Pros: Sound Quality - It's incredible  Deep, Full, Rich and very detailed.  Very quiet compared to Rio Karma.  Power - Second only to the Karma, will easily drive all but the most demanding cans. Any IEM's (In Ear Monitors) and portable cans will sing when connected to the VibeZ.  By demanding I'm talking the likes of the Sennhieser HD-600's which really open up when connected VibeZ + portable amp.  I use a Pimeta with AD8620's that I built.  Equalizer - 6 band parametric equalizer allows tweaking sound to fit each set of cans or genre of music.  Each setup can be saved off as a preset and selected from the menu the next time you want that sound.  Playback options - You name it it's here. DJ Random mix, works like shuffle of all tracks on the player to shuffle up tracks in 15 minute incriments up to 8 hr's or unlimited.  You can choose to playback songs that haven't been played for x amount of days, playback by Genre, Era, most played tracks etc.   Cons: Navigation Wheel - The navigation wheel takes a little time to get used to. It is a unique as the player.  No problem after a little use.  12gb Size limit - This is a little small for people wanting to take advantage of the Gapless playback in some of the lossless file formats. While it's not an been issue for me others might feel a need for more storage space.   No Line out - for those that need line out sorry.  It does perform well through the headphone out and I don't think you'll miss the line out feature.  I run my Headphone amp from the Headphone out on the VibeZ without any issues.  I think, the upcoming dock will have a line out on it like the Karma dock did.  WARNING DO NOT SELECT "YES" I LIVE IN FRANCE in the initial setup.  For some reason mine was defaulted into the French Mode which limits the output.  I had to Reset it, reformat the drive and Reload to correct it. It still sounds good in that mode but at full volume you'll still be looking for more.  Of course if you're buying for a young person you might want to select "YES" you live in France to help conserve their hearing.    So if your looking for a DAP to play music and not concerned about video and all that crap then look no further or a least put this one on your short list.  I can assure you that you will be hard pressed to find one with better sound quality and audio playback features.

<Title>Terrible product - do not buy!
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave a very positive review to this player last year.  Unfortunately, there's a follow up on January 30th, 2008: I need to modify my original rating. The player suddenly stopped working last week - I last used it about a month back - now it appears to be dead. I've tried to charge it using the usb port on my computer : the player starts to charge, with the backlight alternately but irregularly coming on and off, and will start to boot, but then shuts down, starts to charge, with the backlight turning on and off, then starts to boot again but shuts down(before it gets past the Vibez screen) etc etc. Contacted customer support - they were of no use. I now possess a beautiful paperweight! Buy this player at your own risk.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent quite a bit of time deciding which mp3 player to purchase, and I had narrowed down my decision to either an iPod or a Zune, but the TrekStor Vibez came along at the last minute, and after reading many online reviews, I decided to purchase a Vibez, and I couldn't be happier.  First of all, my desires in an mp3 player were:  1. Great sound quality 2. Gapless playback 3. multiple file format support 4. usable in Linux 5. user replaceable batteries  From my experience, the Zune has better sound quality than iPod, but the iPod has gapless playback, which the Zune currently does not have. These two items were most important to me, so either choice would have meant I was compromising what I wanted.  The Vibez player has everything I was looking for and more. It has superb sound quality, has true gapless playback, allows playback of mp3, ogg, flac, and wav files, and it does not require any software installation. This is great because I don't have to tie my device to one PC or one software installation. And since I use both Linux and Windows, I can plug the Vibez into either and just drag and drop music files with no hassle, and then the player creates every playlist I could ever want based on ID3 tags.  As far as batteries go, the battery is easily replaced, and new batteries run about $20.  If you're concerned about having a larger screen, the Vibez won't be up to par, but if you just want a great sounding player, with great features and true gapless playback, the Vibez is a great choice. I have absolutely no buyers remorse, and would definitely make the same decision again.

<Title>Exceeded Expectations
<Date>Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about a week and am really impressed with it. I had never heard of Trekstor before I started researching my Ipod replacement. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try and am happy I did.    Pros: Intuitive interface - this takes a little bit of time to get used to if are used to an Ipod because it is different, but after a while it is easy to use.   No propriety software - no need to have Itunes or any other software, just drag and drop songs into the player.  Supports FLAC - for those who want lossless playback this is important.   Organization and playback - Organizes sings automatically and allows many types of playbacks based on years, genres, most listened to etc.   Sound - fantastic sound for a digital audio player  Cons:  Interface - I know I listed this under Pros as well, but coming from an Ipod, it does take a some getting used to.   Storage Space - wish it had a bit more space, but a 15gb version will soon be available  Click wheel - can be a little loose and takes some getting used to  Accessories - very hard to find and very few exist

<Title>A different drummer
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Vibez is a great altenative for those who don't want to partiicpate in the I-Pod universe.  I tried out several other other devices from Cowon and Samsung before choosing the Trekstor.  The Vibez has more storage than the Samsung and comparably priced I-Pods and it is much faster than the Cowon hard drive device.  Its size and weight make it much more convenient to carry than most other devices.  The best feature is its menuing.  It is quick and easy to get to the music and I can do so with far fewer clicks than I can with my wife's I-Pod.  The dial control does take a couple hours to learn to manipulate well.  The Vibez is good looking and well built with a metal back and buttons that feel substantial and durable.  Battery life has been very good.  The only negatives I can think of are the periferal items that come with the Vibez.  There is no wall charger so charging takes place through a standard usb cable when you connect to a computer.  Also, Vibez accessories are limited and have not yet reached stores in the USA.  All in all, I am very happy with the Trekstor: good musical reproduction and compatibility with OGG and flac formats, style, ease of use, durability.  It does sync with XP Media Player so...if you want a less expensive alternative to the I-Pod  and enjoy the beat of a different drummer this is the one for you.

<Title>Errors detecting device
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is not really a review it's advice on how to fix a problem.  My Windows XP computer was unable to detect this device. I got the message   There was a problem installing this hardware: MTP Device An error occurred during the installation of the device The specified service does not exist as an installed service.  There is very little troubleshooting info online. I emailed tech support and got this answer which fixed the problem for me. I just thought I'd save people the hassle by sharing it.  Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is a new protocol and set of drivers developed by Microsoft to connect portable devices to a Windows PC and synchronize digital media content between those devices and the PC. MTP is geared toward portable devices with hard drives; flash-based devices will continue to use Mass Storage Class (MSC), a broadly supported protocol whose drivers are already included with Windows Vista, XP, 2000, and Me.   If your TrekStor-device is not recognized correctly by Windows or there is something wrong with the MTP-drivers installation, please try to reinstall the drivers. Therefore, please identify your device in the device manager and then:  - Right click on it and choose to UPDATE DRIVER. - In the new window, select NO, NOT THIS TIME. - Then, do not use the automatic search but INSTALL FROM A LIST OR SPECIFIC LOCATION (ADVANCED). - In the following window, choose DON'T SEARCH. YOU WILL CHOOSE THE DRIVER TO INSTALL. - When SHOW COMPATIBLE HARDWARE is check, you can now choose between a USB Mass Storage device and a MTP-device.

<Product Name>TrekStor vibez 12 GB MP3 Player (Black/Silver)
<Title>Vibez is great

<Content>Owned a Ipod Nano 8gig for a while, but wanted more storage while keeping a small player. The Vibez 12gig fit the bill perfectly. And it is a better player to boot. Excellent sound quality and features. I really like not being tied to Itunes to import music too. Now I just use the windows file manager to transfer music over.  Only quibble is it is a little too easy to jostle the jog wheel, interrupting  a currently playing track. But overall the best dap I have owned, by far.
