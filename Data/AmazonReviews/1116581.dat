<Title>Zune is cool!
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an awesome device! My local store only had two left when I went in this afternoon and I'm really happy I got it. It's interface is really pretty and I love how you can really make it you by personalizing it. It makes my 'other mp3 player' seem boring!

<Title>could be perfect but,........
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to give a big review, just a few thoughts: 1. Make it a little thicker to give more battery life (this will piss off lots of people for me saying this). 2.Give me a stinking EQ! Give me a choice of having it on or off to use wi-fi or not. I don't use this feature myself so omitting the eq makes me seem unimportant. Also, a few people are saying that after they updated their zunes (1st gen) they still had an eq - BUMMER!!! 3.Allow me to use other programs to sync music and video to the Zune (I own 4 Ipods and you can use 3rd party software even w/them - though it never seems to work well w/it - ZUNE would be PERFECT!!!) Not the best personal review but just a few issues I have .

<Title>Better than I thought it would be
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been an ipod owner for many years. I always had a good experience with them, but when it was time to get a new player none of their offerings really matched what I was looking for. Yes, the itouch is beautiful, but 16gb for that price ... not gonna do it.  When I saw the second generation Zune was coming out, I checked out the specifications and decided it was time to "switch".  What I like: 1. Solid engineering; it is heavier than an ipod and a little bit bigger, but I kind of like the weight of it. I even feel cool having it because it isn't the same mp3 player I see everyone else has -- that is pretty superficial though.  2. The touch wheel is actually a nice interface. This works great even though you do have to adjust to it a little. Navigating through menus is easy and they pretty much nailed it.  3. The menu system looks and works great ... makes some other devices appear "dumb". I hate to say it is hip, but yeah it is.  4. FM Radio ... granted I am a sirius user, but I was surprised how great this feature works. I am sure I will get a little use out of that. My gym has TVs that run sound on radio frequencies, and I was never able to listen to them with my ipod.  5. It has a nice sized screen. This was a good middle ground between the itouch and the ipod classic for me. When I thought about the features of the itouch that I would actually get the most out of it was the screen. This screen seems to have a good quality and you will see my negative comments of it below.  6. Good price for the features.  7. Good sound quality and a decent pair of included ear buds. I have owned a lot of ear buds including some higher end models like shure e2s. I think they supplied a pretty good pair. Beyond just the ear buds I think I can tell the difference compared to my ipod, but that might just be a new user euphoria experience.  8. Can customize the background -- adds that personal touch.  9. Wireless syncing.  What I don't like: 1. Video quality is not bad, but it could be better. If the resolution was higher I think this would be a 5 out of 5, but it really shouldn't be a deal breaker; it still looks pretty good.  2. The zune desktop software isn't shabby at all, but it does take a little getting used to. I have noticed a few things that are lacking or not working great. This is one of those areas where, hopefully, we won't suffer for long if releases are distrubuted periodically.  3. I wish the wireless syncing was faster and there were more options of when to do it. My network is setup in a way that causes a couple of trips between systems, so I probably am adding some latency. It is a cool feature to add one song, podcast or even an album, but I would like some more automation added.     I have only had it for 2 days now, but I am really glad I decided to get this compared to the ipod classic and the itouch. Both of those players have their good points, but the Zune seems to really fit with what I want and need.  Great player - it is a good buy - I am very happy with this purchase. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars if it only had a couple of slight improvements. As another reviewer said - 4.5 stars if it was possible.

<Title>Good player but disappointing desktop software
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune 80 may be an excellent player, but you are forced to use it with the Zune desktop software. Unfortunately, this software, while user friendly, is a huge disappointment.   In this review, I will be comparing the Zune desktop software to the Ipod desktop software (Itunes) which, as far as I'm concerned, is still far superior :   Downsides :  * First of all, on Zune contrary to Itunes, there's no real song rating system (i.e. 1 to 5 stars). Instead, there's a "like it or not" system. That's not very useful when you want to create smart playlists.  * Speaking of smart playlists, there's no way to create one on the Zune software. You have to manually put the songs you want in your playlist, which is a pain compare to what I'm used to with Itunes. On Itunes, you can create smart playlists based on music genre, years, song rating, duration of the songs, etc. You are out of luck if you want to do the same with the Zune.  * Also, with the Zune software, editing a song information - particularly  adding an album cover - is an awkward process and editing multiple songs at the same time is simply impossible. The easiest way I've found to edit songs is to get into windows explorer and work from there.   * There's very few ways to filter your songs, albums and artists in Zune compare to Itunes. There's like 3 or 4 different filters in Zune, including alphabetically, compare to something like 30 on Itunes. (Edit : Ok, I just found like 15 hidden filters in Zune, so its not nearly as bad as I first thought)  * Finally, when you are playing a song on the "now playing" interface, you can't easily access the song information, let alone edit it.   Upsides :  * Nice layout, beautifully designed.  * User friendly  * Excellent sound quality.  * Can Sync with Windows Media Player  * Wireless Synching with the Zune player  * Wireless Synching with Xbox 360  For me, one word describes very well the whole Zune software experience: inconvenient. It's unfortunate because I really wanted to like it. The good news is that, contrary to the hardware, the software can be improved with upcoming patches.  Despite the flawed zune desktop software, I think the Zune player is still a very good choice. With good sound quality, premium earbuds, large display, nice interface and plenty of features you won't find on other players - like fm tuner and wireless abilities - the zune 80 is a great value and is hard to ignore.

<Title>Enjoying it more than I was expecting
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been quietly waiting for Zune to support WMA lossless playback. Just when I had given up hope, out comes the Zune 2. I am using it with Vista, and haven't had any trouble yet adding the software or getting the Zune to run. Even the wireless sync worked without complaint. I am impressed that after playing it for about a day I haven't heard a skip  even when it's churning through WMA lossless files that sustain 700-800 kBps. I suspect that with constant playback I will end up getting about 5-6 hours doing that, which is not bad.

<Title>Zune 80 GB possible iPod killer? Almost.
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Zune 80 is either hated or loved. I've read reviews mentioning it to be the iPod killer. While I think it comes close to contending with the audio player currently holding the largest market share, it misses out on a few points.  The headphones that are packaged, are great if you're used to those garbage headphones packaged with other players. However if you have quality buds/cans or what not, I would suggest sticking with those.  Let's look at the dimensions. The Zune, by dimension is rather small by comparison to it's now older (and lower capacity) brother the Zune 30. It's 2.4" wide, 4.25" high and 0.5" thick. Around 25% smaller than the original, it also sports a much larger 3.2 inch screen made of glass. That's something I found interesting. As far as I know, most players have plastic screens. The added durability and clarity of the glass screen is very nice.  Enough of the dimensions though, I'm certain that software questions are prevalent somewhere. The Zune software, which is NOT packaged with the snazzy box that the Zune 80 comes in, is downloaded from the Zune's website. It looks pretty, but I can't honestly say I enjoy using it. Yes, you can sort audio by Artist, Date and Genre, it also requires association with mp3s. As in, you MUST use it for mp3 audio playback to use the software. That gripe aside, the software is fairly simple to use, syncs well and while I had some problems on my laptop, I had no issues on my desktop, or several of my friends. (I was fortunate in that they allowed me to test my Zune and software with several different brands. My laptop is the only one that experienced any issues). While the software left me wishing it worked on my laptop, the Zune's GUI is very nice.   A bit simple, with large text, but still very nice. Scrolling using the touch pad was complemented on the GUI with a large version of the letter appearing as you scroll fast. Tapping the pad stops it, while pushing down on the pad select the song/album/playlist, etc. (More on the touch pad in a moment)While the screen shows a giant version of the current track's album art, and you can select a background image of your own there is one gripe. Where did the EQ go? Microsoft, please rectify this. I am not a hardcore audiphile, and my headphones work great (Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 3 Live) with the Zune, I do like the option of selecting my own EQ settings.  The wireless, which is used to sync with your computer if you wanted to, works great and the setup (going back to the software for just a moment) was simple. Unfortunately, if you leave it on and forget to turn it off, it will eat up your battery life like a hungry elephant. Just remember to turn it off, and the battery life is great.  Back to the touch pad. I feel this is the most innovative part of the player. It is not simply a touch pad, but tactile controls as well. Called a squircle, I had my reservations but it works amazingly well. The scrolling is great with the touch pad, and the faster you move your finger on it the fast it scrolls through the songs. Alternatively you could hold down the touch pad, which would also allow scrolling. The touch controls can even be turned off for those who prefer tactile controls, a definite plus for people like me who only used audio players without touch controls, although as I stated the touch pad is very nice, responsive but not TOO sensitive.  Of course, the audio is the most important part, and the audio quality is good on the Zune. Podcast playback works great in both audio and video capacities. The video, with that very large screen looks great, and after going through several different videos of varied genres look amazing. The Zune natively supports H.264 and mp4 video playback, just in case anyone's wondering.  As you can tell, the Zune has a great feature set, making it a great player. While the Zune can compete with the iPod and even possibly give it a run for its money, I think it would put it far beyond by making some additions with firmware updates, such as EQ. Other than that, it's a solid player that I think many people will enjoy owning. Keep it up Microsoft, and you may even get some of that market share back.

<Content>Having had the original Nano(4gb) all filled up, it was time to upgrade.  I went to Walmart and BestBuy to get it, and neither had it, so I ended up going to Circut City.  The interface is gorgeous, and it was easy to switch  my songs from iTunes to zune..just click select all and drag them!  Definitely better than the iPod Classic.

<Title>LOVE IT!
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It was crazy hard to get my hands on one of these, but luckily Circuit City still had one available for a local pick up. I've been using it for almost 3 days now and I can say that it is far, far better than my 60gb video ipod.   It has everything I ever wanted and then some- great big display (although the video could be a bit brighter), great interface, light & sleek, no annoying DRM, customized background with a backlight dimmer (so you won't go blind in the middle of the night when trying to change an album), and a nice radio (lots of kudos here!).     One of the most interesting features is the wireless sync which is extremely useful if you have news podcasts since it will automatically download it in the morning without hooking it up into the computer. It's also extremely easy to set it up.  I have a Netgear router and it took me literally 3 mins to make it work.   I've waited a long time for an mp3 player like this and it was worth it! Beware though- this is a very different device than the new ipod touch. It targets a different kind of consumer so make sure that you know exactly what you want/don't want before making a decision.   _____________________________________ **UPDATE** Jan 30 2008   I wanted to write an update on my 2 month Zune experience.  I still think it's an excellent product, BUT the software that comes with it takes a lot from my 5 star review. If I could, I would give it 3 stars right now since I'm going nuts over it.  Microsoft should really be ashamed of putting such piece of garbage software out! Yes, they rolled out an update recently, but it still sucks. And yes, it looks pretty, but after you're past the point of 'look, a transparent pic of Michael Buble,' you end up biting your nails and cursing the world since ID tags are so screwed up AND there is no easy way to make them right.   Customer service is in India and they are just beyond useless. Msoft should fire 70% of them and use that money to actually SOLVE the problems  that the software has. Right now the only help you can get is from a couple of Zune forums where users help each other. Horrible, just horrible!  Also, what I find annoying is that I really have to be careful to press the button right in the middle. It is so sensitive that a lot of times instead confirming the selection it will go either right/left/down/up. I also get tired of having to click so many 'play' selections before actually playing a song from an album. It would be really nice if there would be an option to see all the songs from one artist at once instead of going from album to album.  You should also know that you can't make your own playlists from the Zune. The only playlist you can make is the one 'quick list' which kind is the generic Zune playlist. You also can't delete individual songs from it- it's all or nothing. I'm REALLY hoping that the next firmware update will solve this because it really really sucks.      External hard drive capability would be nice too, but I don't really care that much about it.

<Content>I love this player. You can connect directly from the player to your TV or through your Xbox 360. It is so easy to use. The software is creating some problems for the power users but I don't think most people will notice a problem. I also believe they will come out with some updates within the next couple of weeks to solve these problems. Everything else works very well. I really think that this is going to be the player to beat.

<Content>I bought the zune awhile ago (80GB) and i was shocked, before i buy the zune i heard some good reviews and some OK reviews, it's amazing how a touch of your own hand makes all the difference.  this device IMO is almost all pro's, it's screen is as beautiful as it could ever be (big screen) i love this device so much although there is one down side as i see it, you can not use the device as an external hard drive, so you cannot put any type of files on the device to move them to another PC, otherwise i have no negative stuff to say about the device.

<Title>Durable, High Quality, and Great Sound!
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 80gb aka the Zune 2. I could gab for days about the features and specs, but the majority of die hard junkies have already doen their facts prior to its November release.  I got the Zune in November. The sound quality is top notch, so good that an Equalizer isn't even included! The headphones make for a dynamic listening experience as they are modified directly in our ear headphones, as appose to the the standard junk ear bud headphones. If you don't hear a sound difference you obviously don't have them in right. The Zune supports high bit rates but no FLAC (Free Audio Loseless Codec). Which really isn't a concern who'd want that much memory to be tossed away?  The Zune features not so much a revolutionary panel as the iPods click wheel, but a safe alternative. The squircle, this little addition enables touch sensitive option on the button below the screen or standard press.  The software is very subjective some adore the looks, and others mutilated by the mp3 file naming issues. Keep in mind many sources online and programs can fix this. The problem is Zune brings files back to their original state, meaning if you have a song that was originally not tagged properly, welcome it back.    I lost my Zune yesterday, being extremely paranoid over my loss I hunted it down, I've truly grown partial to it. I located it outside in the snow this after noon. It was covered in thick layers of ice and even after thawing processes finished it worked fully functional! The screen is an amazing screen at that, large holds great potential for videos and pictures and is nearly indestructible. Little feats like wi-fi aren't so great but are welcomed. I Highly reccamend the Zune 80gb for the price, quality, options, art and music enthusiast, consistent stability in high use, and storage size.    Being a Apple iPod fan for numerous years, I decided not to convert I'm not biased i just want my music (don't we all?), but to enable an broader  opening. My iPod was dubbed unrepairable, so after losing 7,500 songs and going onto my third iPod i simply wanted something more durable. iPods are still great try out the Zune or iPod if you'd like a great MP3 player, just remember the choice is yours not just our reviews.

<Title>Get over it!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First let me say, I have no problem with my Zune, I had an 30 Gb version and upgraded to 80 Gb I have song that wern't bought from the marketplace and they all play.  I have absolutely no problems with the software, the first version did suck because you had to resync completely if you wanted to add like one song.  Also if you wanted to remove one song you had to go through a song and dance.  With the upgrade you can access your Zune like a HDD, just click on device and search thru the songs until you find the one you want to cull, them BAM! its gone.  As far as using it for storage of documents... WHO CARES!  You bought an MP3 player not a portable HDD!  If you want a back up of important docs spend 10 bucks and get a 256 stick and keep it around the house.  I read a review that said the screen was small and blurry, this thing has one of the largest screen on the market!  I admit that some of the other players have some cool features but the Zune is not as bad as people make it seem.  As far as playback onto your PC, why would you get a portable MP3 player, sync it with your pc, then delete the songs off and just play it thru the player?  You can just unplug the speakers and plug them into the headphone jack and there your go problem solved.

<Content>This is a great player and in some ways it's better than the iPod. In fact, since iTunes sucks and Apple doesn't care, I'll probably never buy any player but the Zune in the future.   However, what I really don't get is why Amazon only has the 80 gb Zune from some company charging $150 over the prevailing price for this item. These Marketplace companies are getting worse all the time. I think I'll just start looking elsewhere for the best deals. Amazon's getting real lame, real fast.

<Title>Best I've seen so far!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was always an I pod person.  I had a first generation I pod and a the 5th generation video one so naturally when my mom bought the 80GB Zune I laughed at her.  Well it ended up not working well for her audio books that she likes to listen to so she gave it to me.  In truth I never really used my I pods.  Over the few years I had them all of my music got deleted off of I tunes 3 times so I got sick of trying to rebuild my collection so I just started listening to the radio and cd's.  With my Zune even if the music gets deleted off of my computer it wont get deleted off of my device.  That is such a help!  Really the only thing I don't like about it is that there are so few accessories created for it, everything out there is for I pods.  Overall the sound quality is great, it holds a ton of music, I love the radio feature, and best of all my music wont get deleted!  It's a great alternative to I pods.

<Title>Ipod killer
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The best bang for your buck.  Yeah the Ipod touch is cool but this bad boy is 80gb for only $250.  My favorite thing about it is watching movies.  I downloaded a program to convert my DVD's so they will play on the Zune.  This is awesome for when I am traveling on long bus rides.  I have about 500 songs on there right now and have 6 full length movies on there as well and I still have 70gb left.  If you are looking for a good program for converting DVD's to play on the Zune, use Cucusoft Ultimate DVD Converter it works great.  So if you are looking for a great MP3 player that you will hold a lot of songs and video's get the Zune 80gb.  I would also recommend getting a protective shield on it so it doesn't get scratched.  I ordered one from Invisible Shield.com and it was $25 for a full body shield.  The shield is guaranteed and if your Zune gets scrated with it on they will pay for a new Zune, pretty sweet deal.  Go out and by a Zune 80gb you won't be disapointed.

Customer support is what we've come to expect from Microsoft--which is to say--none at all.  After messing around with it for 2 hours trying to get some music on it, I give up.  I'm not a systems engineer and I shouldn't have to be to get a stupid MP3 player to sync up with my music library.  Microsoft should just stick to the other things they do badly.

<Title>Little box, huge sound
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have been amazed by the Zune since receiving it.  Integration with the online software was simple, even for a computer monkey like me.  Ease of use is a hallmark of the device - the touchpad scroll and select is wonderful and remarkably similar in feel, if notphysics, to a mouse wheel.  Size of the device was also a surprise - while a bit taller and wider than some MP3 players, it is ultrathin.    As to capacity, I've loaded well over 500 songs, 100 photos and 3 videos and have barely begun to dent the monstrous 80 GB available.  As someone who travels up to 2 weeks a month, it has become a lifeline - not only in terms of music to whittle away the flight hours, but I've also loaded a great number of family photos onto it and can meander through a slideshow of my wife and kids at will.  The large (relatively speaking) screen is clear and easy to view with great picture.  Sound quality is superb.  If there were one feature I did not like, it would be the cord of the earbuds.  While the sound they deliver is crisp, if the cord moves or brushes against something, a great deal of background "fuzz" is generated.  But this is far from a show-stopper with such a great product.

<Title>Excellent Product!!
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my husband after I got myself a 30GB unit on Black Friday & he loves it.  I've had no problems with the software (I've installed it on 3 different computers) & it's extremely easy to convert videos/DVDs for your viewing pleasure.  The sound & picture quality are excellent and I would definitely recommend this unit.

<Title>Hardware issues and bad support
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought two Zune 80 from Zune Original around Dec. 14 2007 for me and my son for Xmas gift. My son's unit got batary problem. It can never survive over night. Mine works fine.  After call them many times and shipped back the unit, I finally got refund. It appeared to me that they often could not find my records. They had to put me on hold many times and for very long time. Some times I simply gave up because of prolong holding time. Few representitives are good. But over all I am disappointed with the support.  My son still wants it. But I am fed up with them.  Regarding the unit, it works fine with some anoying issues. For example, it keeps adding same podcast to the device causing multiple same podcast stuck in device. I am sure they will be fixed by later updates. I am not sure how long it will take.  The Wifi is almost a wast. Wireless sync drains power big time. I basically avoid using it. If sync and transmiting songs or podcasts is the main reason of Wifi in Zune, then it really does not make much sense considering the cost and space it adds up.  I like the screen, the space. The navigation is pretty good. I hope Zune 80 can browse internet later. But I really doubt they are able to do it.  Also, Zune really lacks of accesories. It seems that not many companies are willing to make accessories for Zune v2.

<Title>Amazing product
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Keeping this short and simple for those of you with little time:  Good stuff: Perfect size, amazing capacity, gratuitous amounts of screen space, easy UI, STURDY, wireless, radio, fun to use, sound quality, great battery life for the screen size (same as iPod classic).  Not so hot stuff: Wish it had a radio and voice recorder, Software blows (disclaimer)  I'm going to adress the cons for now, since all the other reviews probably praise this thing to the sky. The biggest con is the software. It syncs when you don't want it, sucks CPU power, and refuses to let you sync it with Windows Media Player. There is, however, a way to get around it. In the settings, it has a selection option that allows you to select whether or not you want it to automatically sync certain things. If you just select that you don't want it to automatically sync things, then i must admit the software doesn't blow that much. The only other complaint with the Zune 80 is that it dosn't have radio and voice recorder...i have gotten over that and it was really easy.  If you want to see Pros, look at all the other reviews.  Bottom Line: The Zune 80 is sturdy, sleek, and basically blows the iPod classic out of the water. If you're careful with this thing, it won't break on you. I've shocked it, dropped it, and every day it gets thrown around inside my backpack. No problem. No brainier.

<Title>Easy to use and intuitive
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like this product a lot.  My biggest problem is that when you download a CD, if you don't assign it to the genre you think it belongs, you can't go back later and fix it.  At least not without reinserting the CD.  That's annoying.  You also just can't use the device itself to make your own playlists; you have to plug it into your computer and use the Zune software to do that.  That's also a bit annoying.  Otherwise, I'm loving it so far.  BTW this is my first MP3 player, so take everything I've writtin with that in mind.

<Title>nice product, very disappointing and frustraiting software
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The player itself is very nice, rather large. Well constructed. Buttons are easy to use, and navigate through menu's.  CONS; extremely poor and difficult to use software. Unlike other players I've owned this unit does not have drag and drop, a major draw back. Not allowing easy loading of files and play list. The software that you must download, (not included) will do things you don't want it to do, and if you try to use hacks or work around's there always seems to be another unwanted effect that crops up. The unit does not with instructions, except to hook-up the unit to your PC and download the software.  With such a huge storage capacity it would be nice to be able to directly record from FM but you cannot do that either.  All and all a very disappointing experience for the $268 spent.

<Title>great player, only minor complaints
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When you take the Zune out of the box, you feel the steel and see the shine of a glass screen, and you know its going to be good. The video looks outstanding and is very crisp and clear. The screen gets dirty easy but is also easy to wipe off. The menu system is very easy to navigate and there is no leaning curve at all. The center button has a nice gliding feature, which is great if you have a lot of files to scroll through. The software is easy to use  and files sync rather fast. I cannot comment on the social or sharing features as I have not used them. I was very close to giving this player five stars and would recommend it to anyone but I have to knock off a star for the following complaints. There is no equalizer or no way to tweak your sound. The software removed a file from my player that I removed from my PC. I selected the option where I sync file manually but it appears that made no difference. The player and the software do not have advanced options like being able to just copy files over on the PC and not have to deal with this "syncing" stuff. The specs boast of "Up to 5 hours" battery life for video. I charged my battery until the battery indicator was green, then turned it off and locked the buttons. I got on a plane and watched roughly 2.75 hours of video and listened to roughly 20 minutes of music and the battery was dead. I had similar results flying out, although closer to 3.5 hours of video. Granted, not too shabby for such a small device but I have to point out that my battery life so far does not equal the specs. In summary, this is a great player, especially for video.

<Title>Hardware improved, software lagged behind
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this new Zune 80GB.  The player looks and feels very nice. The material looks very quality and futuristic.  The sound quality of the player is neither better nor worse than the first generation. It was generally good with the first player.  But actually, they have removed the EQ option altogether in the second generation. So, you are left with the standard sound that comes with it. But, I found the sound quality very good, way better than other very popular mp3 players, which was the primary reason for me to go with Zune.  Its screen is large and very clear.  Picture and video quality are very good.  In terms of the software: This is where things get quite disappointing. The first generation software was so bad that I thought this new "bottom-up" update (as they claimed) would be quite an improvement over the first. However, after using the software I came to the conclusion that the software actually has not improved much at all.  The change over the first one was much more esthetic than functionality.    Keep in mind that I am not an Ipod owner.  The review is not a comparison of Zune with an Ipod, except in the scroll wheel part below. Here are the facts that you need to be aware of before purchasing Zune:  1. If you were waiting for a drag-and-drop feature where you would just drag the songs from a particular location on your computer straight to your device, you will be disappointed again. Apparently, Zune team does not want to give you that convenience. What I, personally, would have liked to see is this: I drag a group of songs to a playlist in the Zune device which updates it immediately, then the playlist on the library automatically updates (or not, depending on the choice) and my library playlist updates (or not) accordingly without a whole process of syncing of my entire library to Zune just because I want to add a picture or a song to a playlist. I am sure a lot of users have told Microsoft that they would have liked to have this feature.  But, you won't get it this time either.  Instead, Zune team makes you go through first adding the songs to the library, pulling those songs to the playlists, which is itself a pain because of the separated views of playlists and the music library. And finally arranging those songs in the playlist (maybe according to albums) one by one (see #2 below), and then waiting the software to sync your library to the device, because the manual sync function is not working and the software will sync again. This procedure is unnecessarily difficult and dissuasive.   2. The categories on the main interface, such as music, playlists are separated from each other and adding songs to your playlists is unnecessarily very difficult.  You don't see your playlists from your song collection interface, unless you switch to other views in order to see one or the other.  Very unwise way of organizing and programming since the music and the playlists are quite related to each other.  3. There are inconsistencies between the playlists in the software and the device.  For example, let's say you created a playlist in the software and decided to sync it to the device (manual or automatic, it does not matter). However, if you disconnect your device after syncing and browse through that playlist (if it's there), you will see that song list for that playlist is not correct; you are missing a number of songs even though you synced the whole thing. This is very annoying if you counted on this sync and now you are out of home.  The real frustration is there is no way to correct this problem even if you synced over and over again! Also, the alphabetical order of the playlists is also different in the software than the one in the device. Zune device ignores "The" in front of playlists (or artists, words, etc.), but software does not, resulting in the incorrect placement of the playlists.  4. Zune software has very important syncing problems. In other words, it incorrectly communicates with your device to put songs, videos, pictures, and update the information there, etc.  For example, I noticed one very important thing. The software syncs a particular group of songs over and over again each time you plug the device in, even though these songs are already in there. Interestingly, the software lists these songs only once when you search for them, but if you plugin the Zune device 10 times, the same group is synced 10 times!  However, the device shows these multiples.  For example, you would have 10 copies of the same song visible to you under the artist that one of those songs that keep being copied.  These syncs eat up storage on the player and after a couple of syncs you will run out of space on your Zune for this reason! The software is quite a closed box in which you have minimal, if any, control over what it does and how it does.  I noticed on the Zune forums that this might have to do with a bug in the software which writes ZuneID to songs.  And, the example I have given you is just one problem of synchronization the software has, among many. The real frustration is that there is no single response from the Zune team about this problem on the forums. There is no statement about an update that would fix this very important problem, among many, affecting almost all the customers and basically rendering the player just unusable (what would you do with the player if it gets full even though you do not add more songs?).  5. Let's say you have 10 albums for a particular artist. And you want to add this artist's songs in a playlist you created by album names. The newest album first, the older one second, and so on. When you select all the albums and then carry it over to the playlist section, it will NOT add the songs according to album year, name, etc.  It will add them all in a disorganized way and you cannot sort them unless you do them yourself by dragging each song. Considering the number of songs in all these albums, this would take forever. And, most importantly, you will NOT be able to sort them by albums in the playlist that contains all these songs.  All the sorting options from the playlists are absent.  It would have been nice if we could sort in the playlists.   6. The option to sync automatically or manually is simply not working. So, every time you connect your device and want to sync a single picture, it will start syncing everything in your collection automatically even if you choose to sync by selecting "let me choose". This is quite frustrating because it creates a so-called "sync group" for your entire song collection and deadly-slows down the operation on the zune device. The software sometimes crashes or stops responding.  7. Many useful features, such as the EQ, have been removed from the software, even though their functionality have been somewhat questioned.  In addition, editing tags is no longer available.  The software has been crippled by eliminated useful features. In the software, you cannot see how many songs you have in a playlist.  It's just very inconvenient.   8. Album names, song lists, artists classifications, album arts are all wrong in the Zune software.  There are many albums that show under wrong artists or vice versa. I had Bjork showed under Arcangelo Corelli, despite these two share not a single album name at all.  There are many other examples like this. The bad news is that there is no way to fix this annoying problem by editing in the software; it simply does not work.  9. When you have many songs, like around 8000 or more, the screen animations and the responsiveness of the device software declines. The transition animations between menus on the Zune device responds slowly as you add more songs.  10. If you are using manual sync, trouble awaits you. Let's say that you decided to sync a particular song by manual sync.  You happily did that by right clicking the song and selecting "sync".  Now, you want to listen to it.  If you search for that song by the artist under artists or album under albums menu on the device, you will not be able to see that artist or the album that song belongs to. You will only be able to find the song you just added by using the song names menu because you decided to sync via song.  Interestingly, and of course incompetently, when the software adds the song to the device, it does not update the artist or album fields. Similarly, if you choose to sync through album, you might not be able to see those songs by going through artists or song names.  The common sense is when you add a song via the individual song, album, or artists, all fields should be updated, right? But, no. Zune is quite different. You find the song only through the method you chose to sync it. Sensational job.  11. This point is very important. The Zune support team is pretty much useless. The help section of the software is like a bad joke. Download and you'll see.  If you buy the device and you cannot figure out something (which will definitely be the case) or you do not understand why it does a particular thing even though you did not ask for it, you will be on your own. They are uncoordinated with each other, every time you ask for help for the same problem, each agent will try to give you a different work-around.  I had to teach one of the guys there about an update with particular KB (stands for "knowledge base") article at Microsoft because just couple hours ago, it was suggested by his colleague for my problem and which did not help.  The only consistency the support team has is to ask you if you have upgraded your firmware and software. If you answer positively, they will ask you to erase everything in the Zune device and resync, not a good option if you have already done it after talking to one of them, it failed to solve the problem, and you have many songs in your library. If they luckily understand your problem and the steps you have already taken, they will put you on hold and "look in" to your issue. After minutes, they will say that they've got nothing in the knowledge base for you.  In fact, they will even go as far as to say that it is the first time they hear such a complaint as yours.  12. With regard to battery, the music performance is good, though not excellent.  Cnet reported the music performance to be 22 hours.  Microsoft claimed it was 30 hours. The judgement is yours.  Certainly it is better than the first generations of course, though there are considerable number of people who have problems with batteries (search for this problem on the forums of Zune). And, for video I was able to watch videos for little over two and a half hours.  The earbuds are also a lot better than the ones that come with other popular mp3 players.  They are much more quality, we need to give credit to Microsoft for this.  13. You still cannot use it as an external hard drive. It would have been really convenient to have this feature.  There are hacks for using it as a hard drive though. But, officially, you still cannot do that.  14. The wireless sync option is really handy if you have a home wireless network.  This is a very nice idea.  But, it would have been a lot better if one could actually connect to Marketplace and buy songs.  15. The scrollwheel is still not similar to iPods. I am not saying this is better or worse, since this depends on what a particular person finds more comfortable.  Its functionality has improved though. Personally, I found the Zune device control more functional. But, it depends on the person using it.  16.  The Zune software has a serious number of playlist problems. For example, if you accidentally delete a playlist, you will not be able to recreate the same playlist because the software will say that it does exist even though you just deleted it and it does not show up on your screen.   Also, if you select marketplace to browse songs, the page does not load for a considerable number of people. It shows every image on the page black.  For the playlist, marketplace, and the problem # 4 above, I have talked to the Zune support team and the expected happened. The first person I talked to asked me to restart and reconnect which, needless to say, did not help (see # 11 above). Then she transferred me to a more experienced technical support member. This is what they call "escalation".  The experienced technical person told me that Zune software has a lot of issues, it is still in "Beta", and they were getting a lot of calls. The result is I was not able to find a solution from the support team to the problems I experienced. I hear you ask: "It has been a year since the first software was developed.  Why is the software still rough and has a lot of issues?  Why does Microsoft want us to beta-test it?" Very good question. If you are anxious about Zune, I strongly suggest you do not buy it because you'll try to find work-around to the problems that the programming team should have solved long ago. The product is still not good. The problems are not that advanced (does the playlist problem look that advanced to you?).  They are the type of problems that an ordinary computer user would notice easily.  You might be wondering.  How can such a big and experienced software company be this bad in creating a media player software? I think the problem is the mentality of the programmers and what they think the users should do with this product. It is designed so that you'll have minimal control over what to do with the device. We need to admit: Microsoft is very sluggish in this and apparently still thinks that we'll use whatever they release. Their strategy is to wait until the very last minute of holiday season, release whichever unpolished and bug-full version of the software and hope to catch up by "updates" which do not help at all.  Do you have suggestions and complaints to Zune team? Well, keep them to yourself because apparently Zune team does not want to hear from you. Note carefully that they have removed the "Feedback" link on the Zune website. Did you give up on support team on the phone? Do you want to look for additional help on the website? They now refer you to what is called "community assistance". Zune refers you to many others who have problems with the software and/or hardware who, if you are lucky, might help you. Microsoft does not want to deal with you after they sell this device. They transfer the support responsibility to hundreds of others who have the same problems. If you check you the Zune website's "community assistance" section under support, you will see that there are almost as many bug reports, disappointed and angry people as there are people who currently own a Zune. There is not a single response from the Zune team at all. Some independent computer scientists/experts are trying and suggesting workarounds to those who list their problems, many of them do not solve the problem entirely. Zune team just sits back and watches (or not).  There are people who post replies to my review that the problems and/or inconveniences I have experienced are specific to me because my computer was not "up-to-date" or because of some other reason.  This is not true, I have an up-to-date computer. Even so, if I am one of those many people who experience this, you could be one of them as well.  It is the proportion of those who are unsatisfied compared to those who are. I observed, in the case of Zune (I have no idea about Ipods), that the proportion of those who are unsatisfied is too much.  Also, some problems I have indicated here are completely objective.  For example, how can the problem of very weak help documentation of the software be specific to me? You can download and see it yourself.  Or the absence of drag-and-drop, playlist sorting, wrong album art (tag problems that results in multiple song syncing)?  Similarly, the problem with syncing multiples of the same song over and over again (see #4 above) is acknowledged by the Zune team, case number is 1051854663; so this problem is not specific to me either, which renders the player just useless.  You pay $240 for an mp3 player, and you do not want surprises (I would not).  Also, many readers disregard my original disclaimer that I am not an Ipod owner, and think this review serves the purpose of boasting Ipod.  This is not true either.  I have never used an Ipod and will not buy one because of their poor sound quality (this is my personal opinion about Ipods).  I do not know whether or not their performance is satisfactory.  This is not the scope of this review.  This review tells you that the Zune software and the device are not yet ready to meet the expectations according to the criteria above.    Overall, the software has many inconveniences, difficulties, and bugs, and they will be upsetting you very much.  The player as a hardware is nice but the fact is you won't be able to do what you want without a solid, user-friendly, bug-free, and convenient software.

<Title>pretty damn good.....
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the same 20g ipod for almost 3 years (gen 3 maybe? I don't know, first generation with the click wheel), finally died on me the other day, so I went out and bought this the next day. I was very very happy with my old ipod though, especially since it lasted me 3 years of constant use...I just felt like...I guess, not going with another ipod.   But onto this. I am extremely happy with this, I'm sure I would've been happy with the new ipod as well, since I am coming from primitive. The scroll pad is amazing...it really is. I like it better than the ipod click wheel by a lot. Yes, the faster you move your finger, the faster it scrolls, but you can also flick your finger across a few times, and it will practically scroll through your entire collection at a decent speed (where you can still tell alphabetically where you are at all times). You can then just rest your finger on the pad for the scolling to stop that instant. It's very hard to overshoot what you're looking for. I don't think I could think of a better way to get through long lists.   The sound is fantastic in my opinion. I don't know if ipods made theirs better since my old one, but I could never find one of their EQ settings to make everything I listened to sound the way I wanted. I have already listened to this for hours and hours, and everything sounds great. All highs are there, bass comes in perfectly with the included headphones (and there are no adjustable or preset EQ settings). The headphones are very similar to the Sony Fontopia (~$40) I've been using and are just about on par with them. The magnet to help prevent tangling, and the braided wire is a nice little touch too!   Software I'm still getting used to. It really isn't bad, but it's not the greatest. I don't like how you can't easily change song properties as you could with itunes (highlight all songs by one artist, right click, change the artist names to be the same, and you're done). I haven't found a way to do that with this yet. If anyone knows how, please inform me. Other than that, I'm fine with it. I'm a windows media player 11 user (solely used itunes before that came out, and then only used it for ipod synching), so getting rid of itunes is not a problem for me at all.   REALLY REALLY REALLY wish you could synch this with WMP...that is a superbly dumb move considering you NEED windows to use a Zune.   Overall, the thing is beautiful. I'm not overly critical of anything. If it works without frustrating me, I'm happy...and this makes me happy. Maybe the ipod would've too, but I'll be glad to help a viable competitor out so apple stops controlling this market.

<Title>best mp3 player of the year
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned and used a 5g ipod since it first came out and was happy with its performance and its ease of use. However, after 2 years, 30gbs was no long enough for my growing collection of music and videos. So i decided to upgrade to a new player. I first looked at the ipod classic which was 80gbs and was $50 cheaper than what i paid originally. While new improvements have been made to the simple interface of the ipod, sad to say that many of these improvements came at the cost of device performance and lags on the interface. in fact, the performance of the sample model in the apple store was so horrible, that i deduced that if you add my extensive collection of now 6500+ songs and 200+videos and alot of photos, the device would just be lagging all the time. i took a gamble at buying the zune at a circuit city on nov 13 and i'm thrilled to say that this is by far the best MP3 player, there was no regret in my decision. The interface was quick and snappy even with my extensive library, the zune pad is a wonder, giving me the ability to swipe and click depending on the situation. the navigation and arrangement of the menus make it easier to browse and play what i want to play since i dont have to go back one level every time i need to do get out of the menu i am in. the wireless sync is very useful since i usually forget to plug my zune into my computer and just charge it when i dont use it, so its a good thing that it syncs automatically so when new podcast episodes get into my computer, i simply take my zune from my house and there inside are my podcasts without worrying about syncing them. The screen is gorgeous and a step forward the ipod classic's screen. it's glass screen is scratch resistant which allows me to be less gentle to my zune and maintain its beauty. the premium earphones are extremely nice and comfortable too. the desktop software is stunning, in fact, it makes itunes look like some boring accounting program. overall, i am ecstatic about my experiences with the zune and it is definitly the best mp3 player i've ever used.

<Content>I really like the new Zune 80.  Just purchased it, abosolutely no major complaints.  Extremely sleek, great to feel in my hand (feels sturdy), screen is perfect, love the new Zune pad, loads of space, UI is terrific, radio works great, surprisingly well balanced earphones.  My initial startup synch worked great (had preloaded the Zune software before purchasing, so everything was quite fast).  What I found stunning was the speed of synch.  WOW.    Only complaints are the folowing: NO EQ, not even presets (why Microsoft???); some microphonics with the premium earphones due to the chord rubbing against my shirt; screen is a fingerpring magnet (good thing it's not a touch screen ;-)

<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There was a quote "The bitterness of poor quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price has faded from memory".  It is very appropriate in the case of Zune. I've got the 80G Zune as a present. It worked for less then a week and now the device won't power up. I have tried just about everything, but nothing works. I have called support - no help there either. It seems to be that the screen gets scratched extremely easily and I have only carried it in my small pocket and nothing is in there to scratch it.  It looks like I can't even send it back Microsoft to get it fixed (since I didn't buy Zune - it was a present). From a quick look on the online forums there seems to be quite a few people with these problems.

<Title>Total Garbage
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've decided never to buy another Zune. First, my 30GB 1st gen. Zune would freeze up constantly and the software was a pain to install. Now, with this 80GB Zune, I've had to suffer the pain of having my entire music library erased because of a crash bug when the Zune was connected to my PC. Not only that, but the touch pad lost all vertical scrolling capability.  I sent it in to Microsoft for repair, got it back, and it's having the SAME touchpad problem, and the software still stinks. I'm done with Zune. It's all iPod, all the time for me. I mean, you've gotta figure they're number one for a reason, and they've been number one for a long long time.

<Title>Beware of The Microsoft Zune Software
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a former Zune owner and thought I'd share a little background about a major problem that many of us 1st-Generation Zune owners have had.  For many of us, this problem had became a fatal flaw with the Zune player.  I have sold my Zune and am now looking to replace it with an iPod, an Archos, a Creative Zen or some other product out there.  New customers should at least become familiar with this problem and to Microsoft's response (or non-response) to it...  The original Zune player and software were nice.  I owned the 30GB Chocolate version. Nice.  The software was not going to make history, but it got the job done in a nice, neat, effective interface.  Not the most powerful, creative or thoughtful music manager out there -- but good enough.  Then they decided to unleash the second generation software on its unsuspecting first generation customer base.  For 1st-Generation (1G) users, it was like the plague descending.  this was no update -- this was a virus that Microsoft unleashed.  First of all, in what I believe will prove to be a stupid and misguided effort on Microsoft's part, they decided to cripple much of the functionality that already existed in the 1G software.  I suppose that this was so that they could claim to have a "simple" interface to compete with iPod's "simple" interface -- so simple, in fact, that it did almost nothing that its users needed and everything to try to steer them to Microsoft's music store.  Unfortunately, Microsoft has also made sure that only THEIR crippled software would work for your Zune.  This outrage would be enough to turn off most 1G customers, but the news was much worse than just crippled software and functionality.  Much, much, much worse.  In all their wisdom, Microsoft unleashed a software update -- a virus -- that once it infected your computer, would cripple your song tags.  All of a sudden, 1G loyalists found that their albums were associated to the wrong album art -- AND -- that many albums had the wrong content listed.  sometimes albums had additional content listed. Sometimes less.  Sometimes both.  The albums now listed the wrong songs (some by other artists even) AND had the wrong album art.  Microsoft the released a patch.  It was a joke and did not work.  In fact, I am not sure that the patch worked for anybody out there if we let this and other blogs be the guide.  And now, 1G customers had an infected computer with no way to revert to the original 1G software -- which worked -- and no way to fix the jumbled up albums.  I and thousands of others wasted countless hours "fixing" the song/album tags, only to have Zune stubbornly revert the back to the wrong information.  We tried the patches.  We tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  We looked at the knowledge base.  We called customer service. Nothing worked.  the albums were now completely and permanently ruined.  Probably tens of thousands of man-hours at a cost of who knows how much ruined by Microsoft's ineptitude.  And what have they said since the release of their useless patch? Nothing. Not a word.  So beware Zune buyers and potential owners.  Make sure you want to give your business to a company who would do this to their early adopters.  If you are a 1G owner and have not yet upgraded -- for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT UPGRADE.  It will ruin your song tags permanently -- guaranteed.  As for owners of the new 80GB Zune and the flash Zunes, I do not know how this software has or will effect their song/album tags and libraries.  But if a problem does develop down the road, don't be surprised if what you hear from Microsoft is... nothing... and an implicit "Go F___ Yourself, dumbass customers."  By the way, I am not an iPod owner.  I don't have a history of being anti-Microsoft.  I have no previous axe to grind.  This is an honest account of what has happened to Zune First Gen Owners and what can happen to you.

<Title>80 GB ZUNE wins against 80 GB iPod
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this Zune last weekend and I am currently very happy about it. I returned the iPod that I purchased a week ago and I was a lucky one to find the Zune for exchange.   First, Why did I return the iPod? I had problems with the iPod while watching video Podcasts. It was freezing,resetting, etc. After a massive research in Apple's discussion boards, I realized that the 2nd generation iPod has many more freezing problems. It deletes people's libraries, keeps on freezing till the battery runs out etc. Everybody was complaining that Apple released the product without enough testing. So, after spending 4 hours with their customer care, they pretended like there was no problems with my device even disconnected me twice on purpose. That was it. My first Apple product was gone back fairly quickly.  I am verry happy with exchanging the iPod for a Zune. I was lucky to find one on 17th of November because it was out of stock almost everywhere.  SCREEN: It's screen is almost TWICE AS BIG as iPod's, the image is BRIGHT and CLEAR for both pictures and videos. It is great! Microsoft took the advantage and used the screen very well. THE ALBUM ART LOOKS GREAT while you are listening to music. The fonts in song /album/artist lists are perfect size you may see a lot on the screen.  NEW TOUCHPAD: iPod 6th generation's click wheel was awful. People with 5th generation even says that it was more responsive before. MICROSOFT WIN AGAINST THE CLICK WHEEL WITH THEIR NEW TOUCHPAD. It is like the touchpad's of laptops, works like a scroll bar while you are searching for music or moving in your library. The faster you scroll, the faster it goes in the menu and with a touch it stops, if you release it slows down and stops eventually anyway. So I liked the touchpad a lot, much more then the irresponsive click wheel of iPod. It was a nightmare to go to the next song in the list with the click wheel. Zune's touchpad also works as a direction pad so you may just click if you need to go just to the next song, or album in the list. The back and pause/play buttons on the sides of the touchpad helps a lot as well. You may press the back button and go back to the main menu. While you are listening to a song you click the center of the touchpad and then you may move to another song in the album by up/down or even move to another album of the artist by left-right. It was not this easy in iPod.  BATTERY: I watch video podcasts a lot so I cannot give a good review for battery life. But they say it runs 12-14 HOURS only for listening to music.  SOFTWARE: Zune has its own software. iTunes has been out for a long while and Zune software cannot compete with it yet...However, I found it enough for my needs. I transferred 50 GB of my music at once with NO ERRORS OR INTERRUPTIONS. I hope it keeps on running without problems in the future.  EXTRAS: iPod had a lot of extras, clock, calendar, alarm, games, etc. Zune has NONE of them. One bad thing is that there is NO EQUALIZER you gotta live with what you get.  RADIO: Zune has a radio INSTALLED in it, I have been reading to the radio only at the car but if you cannot watch a game and want to listen to it, there you go!  WIRELESS: I have not tried the wireless sync. I bet I'll have problems because my wireless is not that reliable. But we tried to transfer files from my Zune to another friends 30 GB Zune and it worked pretty well. If you have friends around with Zune's, you may SHARE YOUR MUSIC, and listen to the shared files for a limited time.  FILE TYPES: Zune is DRM-free, you may transfer divx and wmv files as well.   EXTERNAL STORAGE: You MAY NOT USE Zune as an external hard drive like you can do in iPod. I could not do it so far. However, you may transfer the music on it to another computer.  OVERALL: I definitely recommend the 2nd generation ZUNE over the 6th generation iPod.   I think Apple has just started to move to other directions with iPhone and iTouch and they are OK if they loose the competition to Zune in massive mp3/video players. If they keep on disappointing their customers like this, they will eventually loose it.

<Title>Further proprietary bull
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First gripe:  doesn't use Windows Media Player - you have to download special Zune software to do anything.  Isn't this backwards?  I was thrilled when I learned that my Gigabeat used the ubiquitous aforementioned software - how does a product MADE BY WINDOWS not do the same?!?!?  Gripe the Second:  the touted social feature - sharing songs wirelessly between units - is a major tease.  Basically whatever is sent from one unit is recieved by the other as a special format that lets you listen three times before you have to actually buy it.  Meh, what was i expecting from the biggest software whore in the world?  Now I'm wishing I'd gone with a lesser-known, more consumer friendly brand.

<Content>I love this Zune!  So much better than ipod.  I had a Creative Zen Vision M.  (I was robbed!) This is much easier to use!  The screen is so clear.  Sound quality is wonderful.  The earbuds are cool, too.  They're wrapped with cloth.  The only problem so far has been finding a case.  Zune has one but it's not great because you can't charge the Zune with it in the case.  I did find one from incipio, here, at Amazon.  I love it, too because I can be charging and listening while it's protected!

<Title>Great sound is everything
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Many are the times when I have opted for the slightly cheaper item, only to realise that I should have spent a little extra and bought "the real thing". This was lurking somewhere in the back og my head when I ordered the 80GB Zune rather than an iPod....Was this going to be another example of a poor alternative? Was it really possible to buy a multimedia player with 5 times the capacity, save 110$, and get an FM radio and a better podcast management on top (compared to the iPod Touch 16GB)? As anyone that has listened to the iPod Touch knows, this has an equalizer with just about a zillion different adjustments, ALL sounding like a plastic megaphone inside a zillion different cardboard boxes. The Zune has no equalizer, not even bass and treble adjustments, it just sounds great "by nature". The "in ear" design of the headphones excludes almost all surrounding noise, and gives a great sound all the way from deep bass, through a beautiful middle range, and up to the highest tones audible to my 43-year old ears. GREAT sound dynamics!!! If you can live without the signal effect of having white wires hanging out your ears showing everyone around you that you are a part of the  "Apple community", but finds it more important to have great sound in your ears, the Zune 80GB is for you. The Zune headphones have black wires, but trust me, you will "Zune" get over it!! This is a multimedia player for adults! I can hardly wait for the Zune Markedplace to get fully functional in my region (Europe). My warmest recommendations of this product! ...and NO I don't work for Microsoft.

I still asking myself why Micrsoft don't allow a simple interfase to use the gadget, why I need to be connected to the Zune Market store, is all they care about? If you want to buy it download the software and try to install it, if you can't don't buy it

<Title>Excellent Choice
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I spent a great deal of time researching digital media players by many manufacturers.  I finally made my choice for the Zune (2nd generation).  I was a bit uneasy about this choice due to the bad reviews the 1st generation Zunes received.  Microsoft has made up for these shortcomings and then some.  I love the 80 GB Zune and would recommend it to anyone.  I purchased the AV pack at the same time and can now listen to 30 years of my favorite music right on my television.

<Title>Good product but flaky customer service
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought it for myself for christmas and I have not been disappointed. The sound quality with the included earbuds is superb. The display is excellent. I want to point out a few minor issues which, if fixed, would make this a truly outstanding product:  - battery life The battery life is adequate for my usage pattern; after a typical day of listening the the battery is still half full. On the other hand, when I browse a lot and skip songs etc the battery drains rather quickly. I have yet to see how it stands up to a 11 hour plane trip.  - Zune software The Zune software did not integrate as well with my WMP library as expected. Since my kids have a number of PlaysForSure devices, my music library requires both Zune and WMP. Moreover, tag editing is rather cumbersome with the Zune software so there WMP comes in handy.   - Customer service Here comes my main source of grief: From the beginning I did not get the wireless sync feature to work. After spending hours reading various FAQ's and KB's I was still not getting a connection. Called Zune CS and they poked around for like 30 minutes and then insisted that my netgear router was not compatible with the Zune, and this is pretty much the end of it and is there anything else we can do for you today. Luckily enough the next week one of my coworkers got a Zune and we tried the wireless 'social' feature and not result. So I borrowed  his Zune for a day and I plug it into my computer at home and the wireless sync is up and running about 45 seconds later. So turns out the wireless was defective from the beginning and the clueless customer service keeps blaming the 'incompatible' router.   Too bad that by now I was past the 30 day return period and now I have to send the unit in for repair. It will be truly missed until its back.  So in summary I can wholehartedly recommend this product. If Microsoft would improve the battery life and spruce up the software and customer service, they would give apple really a run for their money.

<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I woke up at 7 in the morning to see that a Walmart 40 minutes away had three in stock I ran out of the house!  The Zune pad takes some getting used to but everything else is dead on.  The OS is as sexy as the device itself and wireless syncing has to be seen 1st hand to see how cool it is.  I can't say that it is better than an ipod since I have never owned an ipod but when my friend who is an ipod owner says "Here take it back before I go buy one myself" makes you think.  The biggest draw back for me is the fact I cannot find any accessories for it!  Everything is only for the 1st gen Zunes.  Not even ebay has a descent case / skin for it.  Guess I just have to wait.  I strongly recommend the new zune.  Also buy a velvet cloth for the glass screen to keep it clean.

<Title>My first mp3 player.
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first mp3 player.  I've had very nice PCs the last decade or so, most recently picking up a $4,500 Gateway but never bought a portable mp3 player.  I'm not a fan of the Mac universe and stayed far away from the Ipod hype.  The first Zune was ok but 30GB was just small so I waited knowing something bigger would eventually come out.  I was lucky enough to find one of the new Zune 80GB at Target as the clerk was putting the ONE they got out on the shelf.  A few days later and all I can say is that this is my new best friend.  The design is really amazing and just has a better feel to is then an Ipod.  I love the interface as well and the controls are better then imagined, the new pad is brilliant and everything works exactly how I want it to.  If I had to think of ONE negative thing it would be the software that you download for your computer.  The reason I say this is that renaming files becomes hit and miss on videos.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  The layout is OK but right now is a 3 out of 5.  It does what I need it to do but doesn't give me as much control as I want.

<Title>Great
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally got mine today. I have not had time to do a lot with it, but so far i'm pleased.  I never had an ipod but i have had several other small mp3 players.   First off, i really do not see what the big deal is about the softwear. Its pretty easy to use. The screen is nice, but the entire thing gets a lot of smuges because its flat black.  The screen size is great, i propped it up on my keyboard at work and watched it for quite a while.  the battery life does not seem to bad, but could be better. I charged it for about an hour, it was already half way charged when i got it and when i took it off the charger it was almost full. I played with if off and on for about 7 hours at work (proably had it on about 3-4 hours total and i kept turning it on and off) with both video and audio and the battery was almost drained.  It seems sturdy but i'm getting a case ASAP. The video tilt is really nice. it comes loaded with music, but you can not play anything untill you hook it of the first time. I really wish they did'nt preload anything on it but the backgrouds.  the touch scroll is nice but a bit to sensitive, I turned it off on mine.  i played with my friends ipod a little and i liked the scroll on it much better.  I really like the size. Not to big, not to small. Its thin and fits comfortable in a pocket.  overall i really like it so far, and it is a great price for 80gs.

<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really love this MP3 player. I've been out of the loop in terms of the latest MP3 technology for a while. I had an original Dell DJ (old I know) which I adored, but it broke recently after having it for years. As badly as I needed a new one, I really didn't like any of the Ipod models or the original Zune. However, when I tried the 8 gb version 2 at the Zune I knew I had to get the 80 because I loved it instantly.  Pros: Wonderful piece of hardware, simple to use, but really cool. Love the scroll button...amazing, so much better than the Ipod classic. Extremely easy to add music, playlists, etc. Screen is big and super clear. Software really easy to use, prefer to Itunes (besides the marketplace)  Cons: No AC adapter. It won't add some mpegs I have on my computer, but I'll have to look into that later.  The cons are minor compared to the pros. This is like the perfect Christmas gift (which is why I bought it for myself ;-)  BTW, this was really easy to find at my local Target, I believe they recently received tons of shipments.

<Title>Way to go Microsoft!
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll leave it to others to point out the many advantages of the Zune, and simply say that the fact that this product costs $350 on eBay says something about customer demand for it. I've been trying to get this player ever since it came out, and only succeeded today. (Our local Wal-Mart had two left.)  The bottom line is that there are only three or four significant disadvantages for the Zune compared to the iPod Classic: 1. Battery life - the battery life is the same for video (5 hrs.), but the iPod Classic has 30 hrs. of audio life compared to the Zune's 20. 2. Using it as an external hard drive - This is a reason why many people buy a hard disk player instead of a flash player. I can't understand why Microsoft couldn't allow this. 3. Notes - Notes on the iPod can be very useful. I'll miss this feature the most. Besides fixing the above problems, my number one recommendation is that the photo sharing feature be expanded to include other devices, especially WiFi-equipped cameras. That way, you could wirelessly unload your camera pictures to your Zune when your camera is full - not to mention being able to start sharing the pictures with other Zune owners immediately.  But the number of ways the Zune bests the Classic should make Apple hang its head. Windows Media Center TV show syncing, wireless syncing, a screen twice as large, beautiful graphical interface, customization (the norm for Microsoft products), magnetic earbuds, updated software...  Finally, would everyone stop comparing the iPod touch to the 80GB Zune? A product that costs $50 more while giving you only one-tenth the storage space is not a comparable product.

<Title>Best Player I've Owned to Date - IPod Can't Hold a Candle To This
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well to start off I preordered the Zune from Amazon a month before it came out, yet I did not receive mine. I looked locally(Chicago) for it everywhere, but it was sold out. Finally I caught a break and ran a search online for Zune's availability at all Target locations and found one store that had 2 left. Ran over there and snatched it up, and I must say I'm glad I did. Didn't really want to wait another month for Microsoft to get their act together with the release of this. Now onto the actual player.  First, its great that it has a bigger hard drive than its 1st generation in comparison to its #1 rival, the Ipod. I had an older 40 GB Iriver 340 which was nice, but to have double the space to hold plenty of videos is great. The size is wonderful, definitely not too heavy or bulky, and easily fits in my inside coat pocket or even my front jean pocket. Previous hard drive players I had were just too darn big. The screen size is out of this world for a player of its size. It blows away just about any other player on the market, aside from the PVPs which are much larger anyways. The Zune pad is very easy to use and is quick to get used to. I had a Zen Creative M Vision that seemed like it just never could get its act together with the scroll bar thing it had. The glass screen is a huge improvement to cut down on scratches, and the back is pretty scratch resistant too, although I'll still get a skin or case when a good one comes out to protect my investment.   The player itself is very good. My Iriver when full would take 30 seconds  to "boot up" just to play from shut off mode. This starts immediately. The large and simple screen layout menu is perfect, and I'm only 25, not 75. Who wants cluttered menus which makes it hard to get to where you want to go? This player certainly doesn't have that problem. The music part is great for searching by genre, artist, song, or album. I also like that it is easy to get to the shuffle on/off button because I use this feature a lot with 5000+ songs. I wish you could make playlists on the actual player, but no worries as the Zune software takes care of that. The video is very clean and clear, and with the increased size it definitely beats an Ipod Video or Creative Zen M Vision. I love the podcast feature. It will sync up the podcasts you want to listen to that are the latest to come out and immediately downloads them. The picture feature is very good as well because you can put your pictures on a slideshow without having to hit the button every time to go to the next.    The software is actually very good and is very easy to use. It automatically adds the new music/videos that you get once you've told the player which folders you want to be active for the sync. It updates by doing a media search as soon as its turned on. Personally, I consider myself a power user, so the more options I can tweek the better, but its not the end of the world.  I picked up the AV pack with this and it works quite nice, charges through A/C and the cradle has a built in remote sensor so you can perform all the functions from elsewhere in the room. I've tried out the AV Out with just the RCA plugs and so far it seems pretty darn good even on a large TV.   Needs Improvement - First - run as a hard drive or external drive. This is just so much easier to move files/media to other peoples computers without having to have the software on their machine. 2nd...have an EQ! Not that its a huge deal because it sounds great with its default settings, but come on how hard is it to include this feature? 3rd...the video. I love the video on the screen, it sound and looks great. The only problem is it has to be in WMV or MP4 format, and most of my stuff is in Avi or Mpeg 1-2. Thus none of my movies are recognized by the sync and can't be put on there as is. So now I have to go get another software to convert all my files to Mpeg4 if I want to put them on the Zune, which is more money and time. Also Zune's Marketplace doesn't even have movies on there, so you're pretty limited to what you can put on there now. The one cavat the Zen Vision M had was that it played many different types of movie files, and I could pretty much put almost any type of mine on there. The Zune either needs a firmware update for this or to make a software fix available that will help convert the files automatically. Some music files are not identified correctly and not all album art is downloaded automatically, although most is. Some small improvements here would be good too so I don't have to physically go through every file to make sure its up to date with the right information.   The unknown - So far the battery life has been very good, but its still early. This is the one thing that gets me every time, I really wish all Mp3 players had removable/rechargeable battieries like cell phones. I don't want to keep replacing my player every 2 years because of a dead battery, its just lame. Hopefully this isn't a huge issue down the line, but so far all my of players have been. I was tempted to get an AV700 from Archos or another of that lineage because of the removeable battery option, but paying upwards of 600-1000 for those players is just too much.   Overall for the price, this is an excellent MP3 player. Could there be some improvements? Yes, but its about as close as you can get to a having an MP3 player with all the bells and whistles without Apple's tyranny and control. Think of the Zune like America, and Apple like the USSR in the 1950s. :)

<Title>Excellent music and video player!
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been holding off for a really long time buying a portable music player (PMP), mostly because few have had the capacity to hold my music collection, currently at roughly 70GB.  Apple has offered iPods with enough capacity for a while, but they have disabled WMA-format playback (the format my music is stored in), so no iPod has been suitable for my use.  The original Zune wasn't an option for me because of the capacity, I didn't like the software that it came with, and I just plain didn't like the way it looks.  But when I heard that Microsoft was coming out with an 80GB model, I thought I'd take a look.  I picked one up the first day they were available, and I am very impressed.  The screen is gorgeous (and huge for a player this size), and the 80GB capacity lets me keep all of my music plus several TV shows (self-ripped) and cartoons with me at any given time.  Having a standard video/audio out is also a plus.  But one of the neatest features is the wireless syncing.  When I'm at home at night I can use the wireless sync feature to update podcasts and any collection changes without having to wander downstairs to dock it at my computer.    I know most of you looking at this are wondering how it compares to the iPods, so here's a quick summary:    Advantages over iPod Classic: Larger screen, better navigation through library, wireless syncing, built-in FM radio, no special certified cable required for connection to a TV, overall probably easier to use for those not familiar with these types of devices, prettier user interface, feels more robust, wider file format support, more flexible navigation through music library, wireless syncing is killer, and on a personal note I like the Zune software much better than iTunes.  Regular home dock includes Component Video output.  Disadvantages compared to iPod: No TV shows/movies are available in the Zune Marketplace, some may prefer the click wheel over the Zune's touch pad (though many may not), fewer accessories available (though the basics are there and are very good), purchased content from iTunes probably won't work, no equalizer.  Sound quality on the Zune may be a tad better, but it is close.  Personally I don't miss the EQ because the sound quality is quite good.  Other little things that I like: Changes made to my music folders on my computer are instantly reflected in the Zune software, even if they are made by another piece of software.  Starting a synchronization operation, even over WiFi, starts the Zune software automatically.  You can change which album/artist you are viewing without having to back out to a higher level menu by clicking left/right on the touchpad, making for very fast navigation when trying to find a specific song.  Things I don't like: Creating playlists in the Zune software is kind of strange, so I use Windows Media Player to create them, then import the resulting M3U file.  The Zune software doesn't have any ways to re-tag files, so another utility will be required.  Zune software can't be minimized to the system tray.  The touch pad, while a great idea which does improve using the device, does take some getting used to to avoid accidental navigation away from the music you are trying to select.  On my super-sensitive high-end earphones I can hear the hard drive motor spin up before song playback begins (though it disappears immediately, and therefore isn't at all annoying).  Overall this is a highly recommended product, and unless you have a significant library of protected purchased iTunes content or a lot of iPod accessories, this makes an excellent replacement for (and is a more-than-worthy competitor to) the iPod Classic.  Now we just need Microsoft to come out with a 160GB version.

<Title>A G8 alternative to Ipod is here....
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was devastated when my Creative M broke for the final time. However, it turned out to be an advantageous thing in hindsight. I chose to replace it with the  Zune 80GB.  The features on the 80GB are outstanding (wireless), ease of navigation, large- clear screen, FM-radio, not to mention a very impressive headset. Other reviewers have complained about the setup process, nevertheless, if you follow the steps carefully, (do not connect device before loading software.)  It is a flawless synchronization. What's more I could not overlook price point for 80GB, far less expensive than comparable MP3's and Ipods.  Lastly, the 2nd generation Zunes lost more than a couple ounces to become a sleek pocket friendly portable device.  Try-it - Love it!

<Title>Microsoft Strikes Again!
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I absolutely hate Microsoft because of this product.  In the product description, it says you can load protected WMAs to your Zune.  THIS IS A LIE!!!  If you previously bought music from an online store other than Zune Marketplace, you can't add the music to your Zune unless of course you bought and downloaded the entire CD, burned it, then RIP it to your Zune.  If you bought a song here, a couple there, and burned several different artists to a single CD, you can't only RIP them as one album name to your Zune.  Now let's talk about Zune Marketplace.  Sure the songs are cheaper (79 cents per), but you have to buy Microsoft Points to allow you to spend 79 cents per song.  Oh sure you can add them to your Zune and wirelessly share them, but listen to this:  you can't burn them to a CD!  Its a nice device physically, but I'm sending it back because I want my freedom back!  Don't buy a Zune if you value your musical freedom!!!

<Title>4 STAR PRODUCT, BUT LETS TALK ABOUT THE CONS
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm going to keep this simple. There are a lot of people out there deciding "iPod or Zune?"  Well, this short review should help you along the way.  The problem with the Zune is first possibly a problem with your computer. Check the message board for the Zune. A lot of people there are complaining about syncing it with Vista. I had the same problem. My suggestion is making sure Vista is COMPLETELY updated before installing the zune. If there are any OS problems, and I mean any, try to fix them before installation. It can save your hours of frustration.  Also, people buy this for the huge beautiful screen. Well, here's the major drawback - the zune of course only supports .wmv files. Yes, there are two other formats it supports, but it's two formats the average consumer won't use - it's not .avi. The zune will not convert the files for you. This means you will have to hit up google and possibly pay for a file converter. My suggestion: use Windows Media Encoder - it's free.  Finally - the zune software is not going to be like iTunes - so if you're unorganized....don't uninstall iTunes. Keep it handy, you will be needing it for editing songs or the tags to them.  Overall though, I would buy 5 zunes before 1 iPod. The iPod is for simple folks who mainly focus on music, the zune is for the people who want complete media entertainment.

It is better than the iPod Classic, way better. My friend who owns and iPod classic 80gb looks at me jealous when I take out my Zune 80gb. The picture quality is amazing, and the sound is pretty good with the premium earphones. The software is so easy to use, a 5-year old can use it. Buy the Zune, you will not regret it!

<Title>Throw away the factory headphones. Don't even show them to anyone.
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 80 gig zune is awesome. Everybody that uses it automatically tries to manipulate the wheel like it's an ipod. It doesn't do circles, it does straight lines, vertical and horizontal. The touch function works very well after a minute of playing with it. If you're in a rush to get to a song and you keep swiping it will fly past your selection so to stop it you place your finger on the button as if it where a spinning wheel and it comes to a dead halt. Nice touch.   The sound quality is awesome but the first thing you have to do is throw away the horrible head phones it comes with. I thought the thing was a dud until I put in a different set of headphones. There is no equalizer but sound is very rich and full, even for crap mp3's I've had since I was a teen.   The software can be annoying. It tries to be a combination of windows media player and itunes at the same time so it has decreased functionality in some respects in order to be easier to use by stupider people. My favorite function, open song in folder is still there but harder to get to.   The best thing about the new software is it doesn't make it hard for you to copy your music onto your other pc's. You can add music onto your zune simply and you can take it to another computer, download the zune software, and put the songs from your zune onto any other computer (as long as it also has the zune software which you can pull down for free from the internet as long as you have the zune on you). I haven't tried to max out the number of computers I can copy songs too but so far I haven't had a problem.   I've downloaded from the store, it's easy, the songs copy to other computers, no bs, no problems. The only problem I've had is wireless syncing to other zunes. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but there is no explanation as to why.   The extra wide screen is nice for watching podcasts it's just to bad there are so many bad podcasts out there. I try to stick with the ones that are professionally done. The store doesn't have much to offer in the way of movies or television yet but I'm waiting.   Ah, this is my big complaint, if you're putting videos on your zune, make duplicates of the videos as it re-renders them into 320 by whatever to fit the zune's small screen so when you watch the videos have shrunk. Watching a video so small on a 32inch monitor sucks. Test it with expendable video first.

<Title>Incredible Product, Terrible Software
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my Zune, but the software and some of the features seem like they were just thrown together.  I would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn't for the software.  Basically, you can't use Explorer to load music and videos.  You have to use the buggy Zune software.  Good:  1 - the interface is smooth and intuitive.  Much better than the iPod.  2 - the sound quality is great.  3 - great storage for the price.  I've loaded stacks of CD's and I've barely made a dent in the memory.  4 - Wi-Fi (nice, but you'll probably never use it)  Bad:  1 - The pictures are all viewed in landscape mode which means that portraits look tiny because they are not auto-rotated.  2 - The video quality isn't as good as the iPhone.  When I view the same files on both, the videos on the Zune get vertical lines through the screen as the camera pans.  The iPhone is smooth.  3 - I don't like the sync feature.  I turned off the auto sync feature for the audio so that I could delete music out of the "My Music" folder to make space for more music.  When I started the Zune software, I watched in horror as all of the songs I spent hours loading onto the Zune delete from the Zune right before my eyes!!  There was no way to undelete, so I had to reload all of them.  There is also no warning before it deletes songs.  4 - no EQ (they dropped the EQ feature in favor of the wi-fi)  5 - You can't use the Zune as a portable hard drive.  Come on, Microsoft, 80 gigs of unaccessible memory?  Overall:  I love my Zune and I'm glad I bought it.  I use it all the time (now that I've gotten used to how the software operates), and if they can work out some of the kinks in the software, it will be awesome!   If they drop the sync feature and allow you to load songs using windows explorer and fix the photo viewer, I'll give it a solid 5 stars.

<Title>Perfect for iPod haters!
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Our family just doesn't do Apple.  So that knocked a huge market share out of the running when we started looking for DAPs a few years ago.  I muddled through with 2 different Creative models, but when the second one broke within a year (of course after the warranty expired) and Creative wanted $200 plus shipping to repair it, I threw in the towel on Creative.  That was in March 2007.  I've been wanting to try the Zune ever since, and when I heard an 80Gb was coming out I decided to wait for that one since my music collection is getting pretty sizeable.  I see other reviewers are raving about the touch pad button (whatever it's called).  I like this too, but it's really no different from the Creative models of a few years ago.  Slide finger to scroll or change volume, press to select something.  The other two buttons, back and pause/play, are nice and discreet.  The included earphones are dubbed "Premium" by Microsoft but they're really not.  The sound is fairly good if you're sitting perfectly still (and I mean perfectly; you'll have to be careful breathing if you want to avoid the excessive microphonics from the cord).  I still recommend upgrading to the Sony MDREX90-LP or the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro if you have the dosh.  But the Zune itself - ah, beautiful!  Slim, with a nice heft to it, just a nice all-around design.  The software on the actual device is simple and intuitive.  The Zune software for your host PC is also much better than some of the other ones.  I made a mistake and put 550 songs on the wrong playlist - it was a matter of select, drag and drop to the correct playlist to fix that.  On WMP or the Creative software I'd have to delete them all, then go back and manually add them to the new playlist.  I highly recommend this model which we got at Wal-Mart since everyone else was out of stock.

<Title>Much better than original Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I found this 80gig model at Target in San Diego the day after Thanksgiving so feel lucky to have found one. I really like this mp3/video/radio player. I bought the first generation at launch but returned it a few days later because the battery didn't last long, had syncing problems and the computer software just sucked. This new Zune syncs wonderfully and the computer software is very good, comparable to itunes. I have not been able to sync via wireless for some reason. Maybe its the router but will call support and see what they can do. I've had this for a week now. The screen is very bright at 3.2 inches with the same resolution as the ipod classic and nano. Since the screen is larger with same amount of pixels, the picture is larger but more pixelated than the ipod. The feature I really like is the radio which works great. It will even display station name with song playing. The device is solid with glass screen and aluminum back so should be more durable than Zune 1. The battery is also better than Zune one. Microsoft really got it together this time around, I just wish it came in the other colors as the smaller Zunes. UPDATE: Battery life isn't as good as ipod classic, still can't sync wirelessly but other than that I really like this.

<Title>Great product, Crappy Software
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new hardware is fantastic. They've made many significant updates, sized it down; it feels better, it looks nicer, lots of storage, etc, etc. They removed the DRM restriction on the marketplace, which killed the first-gen Ipod-killers. They have Podcasts now, which triggered a party for me and my NPR poetry programmes. The touchpad is surprisingly nice; although I prefer to stick to the analog function (which is still an option), it's sensitive, and doesn't feel like an Ipod imitation. in fact, I prefer it to the Ipod's touch pad, which I see as harder to control.   But the new software is absolutely abominable. It's slow, it's buggy, it seems like the Zune guys scarcely tested it before they unleashed it on the market. It's difficult or impossible to use many very basic functions - update album info, organise your music, pick what goes on the player - that the old software had; so although it looks better, it's scarcely useful.   I went easy on the rating in spite of this - God knows, Microsoft is damned determined to start beating out the Ipod, and they're going to be listening through those complementary deluxe headphones to everything every insignificant forum-poster, amazon-reviewer, or blogger has to say. Like the original Zune software, I can see, in the very near future, some significant changes to the programming, some basic features unlocked again, some bugs being fixed (like the weird group of songs that the software seems to pick to un-sync and re-sync to your player every time you hook it up - to no particular annoyance, just very strange). After that, it'll definitely be a five-star product.

<Title>Nothing too great
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, great congrats at Microsoft for improving the Zune's old model. The Zune 2 truly looks sexy compared to the old, fat zune. The memory also got upgraded and the user interface as well.  Now I hear many people saying that the Zune 2 is better than the iPod. (Note that everybody means the Classic, NOT the Touch, which is far better anyways and only comparable with the Archos series). Well, this is what you get when Microsoft does everything it can to make the player better than the iPod video. And yes, it won. The Zune 2 is much better than the iPod video.  But wait a minute. The iPod video is old and outdated. The iPod classic is out now! Looks like Microsoft has been sleeping....and can the Zune 2 outclass the new iPod classic? NO.  Apart from having a bigger screen and being scratch-resistant, there isn't any REAL features the Zune 2 has vs. the iPod Classic.  -You can share songs wirelessly - but limited only to other zunes.  -There is radio, but the iPod also has that.  -You can customize backgrounds. The iPod Classic also displays backgrounds.  Four main things make the iPod Classic a Zune 2 killer: - Fantastic UI Coverflow (seriously - would you expect this on a hard-drive based mp3 player?) - High Quality Games! - Applications (I'll get to that in a minute) - Also usable as an external hard-drive  While the Zune 2:  - CANNOT be used as an external hard-drive. -Goes only upto max. 80GB, not upto 160, as opposed to the iPod Classic.  So why would people, who do not have at least 50 gigs worth of music and videos and photos buy this player if they cannot use the rest of the hard-disk? Thankfully, you can use the iPod Classic both as a PMP (portable media player) AND as a hard drive (especially at 160 Gigabytes)- So you get what you pay for, and can use every GB on the Pod. On the Zune 2, this space gets wasted.  What really makes the Zune look bad is that it doesn't have any applications.  No Games.  No calendar.  No clock.  No stopwatch. No alarm (to wake up to your favourite song playing) No real equalizer.  No song ratings (heart or broken heart? oh please...)  And guess what? While the Zune's screen is larger, the resolution is 320 x 240 pixels - SAME as on the iPod Classic screen!!!! This means that a sharp video on an ipod Classic will get all blurry on a zune screen! A total rip-off!  And the battery life is shorter than on the iPod (just a bit over 20 hours music playback vs. the classic's 30 hours).  I'm not saying that the zune 2 is a failure. All I'm saying is that it's not the "god-product" fanboys and apple-haters claim it to be.

<Title>Yes - it is worthy of 5 stars; Excellent Device
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an outstanding device, Microsoft really nailed it this time around.  The form factor of the Zune 80 is great, it is much smaller and easier to pocket than the Zune 30, the touch pad is EXCELLENT and the user interface is a notch above the ipod.  The device is very attactive, and the polished chrome back adds to the overall look.  The sound quality is outstanding.  I understand they removed the EQ, but an EQ isn't needed, they have the tone/sound dialed in on this device.  The new Zune client software that runs on the PC is also vastly improved and much better than itunes (I am a previous iPod user).  The Zune Pass, all you can eat subscription + the Zune 80 is a match made in music heaven.  Microsoft is making big time progress here.  One other thing to add, I dig the headphones that are included in the box.  They are the most comfortable ear bud headphones I've ever used - I could wear them for hours and not feel uncomfortable.  They sound excellent too.  Big five stars from me.  I look forward to future firmware updates and the ability to do even more with the built in WiFi.  This is THE music device to own.

<Title>Best in it's class!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing device. I'm an "audiophile" of sorts and I've played and/or owned most of the major devices out there (iPod Classic 80, iPod Nano 2g 2gb, Archos 504, Archos 605wifi 160gb, iRiver H140). For me, the Zune 2 wins! In comparison to iPod, there really can't be a fair assessment. People who bash the Zune 2 are looking at it too narrow mindedly. If Microsoft wanted to created an iPod clone they would have! Plain and simple. It wouldn't be the first time they took a good idea and made it their own. I've been using Microsoft products now for well over 15 years. I'm no Microsoft Fanboy myself but I am thrilled with this unit. Microsoft took a common thing and made it their own. That could be why Zune 30GB was such a flop, because it was trying TOO hard to be an iPod and was failing miserably at that. But the new none....totally different.  Consider some Pros and Cons:  Pros- (Hardware) Design: The housing is beautiful. Scratch resistant and simple. Real glass screen and a touch pad "Zune Pad" that makes browsing your thousands of MP3s fun and relatively simple. Hold switch and thinner housing is a plus! Headphones that are included have very nice sound...however...see the cons.  Accessories: Microsoft took a lesson from Apple and made a proprietary port on the bottom for accessories and syncing (which is also a con) but opened it up to 3rd parties to develop accessories for it. Very nice!  Screen: Crisp, clear, and BIG! Compared to the iPods (minus the iPhone and Touch) the screen takes the cake. I love seeing a HUGE album art...I feel like my digital collection is actually tactile!   (Device Software) Design: Beautiful! Simple! and Easy! Microsoft exceeds here compared to other DAPs or PVPs. Its fluid and and well designed without sacraficing performance. Also, PERSONALIZED BACKGROUNDS! Nice! Audio playback is truly eloquent. Not too happy about not having an equalizer but oh well. With a decent pair of headphones ($40 - $100) you can listen to your favorite music and not worry about no equalizer because you have the raw (in a good way) sound unadulterated.   Use: Easy. Rediscovering your collection is simple and the shuffle feature is nice. You can shuffle any form or your collection and then during playback you can rate it: Love it, Don't Love it, and no setting. Also, if you want to hear more of that artist or album just click and navigate to "Go to Artist".   (PC Software) Design: BEAUTIFUL! I use a TON of media players and this one is very nice. Admittingly I do like iTunes coverflow for iTunes (not the iPod however...too choppy and buggy), but the Zune's PC Software does a nice job of really bringing your collection to life.   Use: Easy. Pretty simple and syncing is very easy. Drag and Drop or automatic. Also the Podcasting is a very nice addition too. Plenty of subscriptions to choose from.  CONS- (Hardware) Design: Small window on top of the Zune for the wireless function can be loose. Also where the front soft-plastic and aluminum housing meet has a  small raise of separation. No gaps or anything, just doesn't fell 100% smooth is all. Also, although the included headphones are wonderful as far as quality goes (especially compared to ANY other bundled headphones) they buds suffer from some noise amplification through the cord. If you don't want the noise then you'll have to sit perfectly still. Right!   Accessories: Proprietary port. Nice and crucial for powered accessories...but a plain 'ol USB port is also a beautiful thing.   Screen: Can easily see fingerprint smudges. Nothing too surprising. Also the resolution can yield some fuzzy pictures (if resolution is lower than the screen). Nothing to cry over though.  (Device Software) Design: NO EQUALIZER! NO EQUALIZER! NO EQUALIZER! Man that bums me out! Some songs just need some adjusting. Minus that detail however, the sound is very very nice! See Pros. Also, limited support of Codecs. Ogg and AVI support would make this unit the BEST and a true iPod killer. Still, the codec support it has now is still decent.  Use: NO NOW PLAYING selection of feature. Suppose you go into pictures and your messing around and you want to go back to music. Have to end your slideshow (picture browsing expereince) and then hold back to get to the main menu. Not a big deal but still. Minor detail. Also, NO SMART PLAYLISTS!!! Again, nothing to give up the device for or not buy it for but something that eeks me a little.  (PC Software) Design: can be a little resource intensive on your PC. I have 2GBs RAM on my Laptop and I noticed it a little. NO LINUX support! Proof I'm not a Microsoft fanboy. I run dual boots in my house and find myself in Ubuntu a lot. No support for Ubuntu or any Linux for that matter. Something too is you can't use the Zune as a flash or portable hard drive unless you do a RegHack...and most people don't want to do that. I would really like to see more support for more codecs. That's where the Zune would KILL the iPod and iTunes.   Use: Nothing too much to complain about.  OVERALL:  This is a winner in my book. I feel I'm unbiased in this decision too. I've had and loved my iPods and I loved and still love my iRiver H140. But this Zune is amazing. I would recommend it too anyone anywhere anytime! Simple as that. I don't care if you prefer iTunes or iPods or whatever...this Zune 80 is worth every single penny!

<Title>Impressive
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just bought today from a local Target store in CT. For what I need this unit is pin point dead on. I'm not a fan of apple products, but my wife has the 30gig 4th gen, and the iphone so.... You can see I have had my exp. with hers and itunes and etc... Now I have all my music ripped via media player 11 and this was one of the coolest and easist syncs I have ever seen. I have 29.7gb/7,570 files of music, and it took alittle time, but hey I rule for having the widest music selection on the block. In the car fm transmitter is right on. Need I saw more.... I could, but let the product do the talking. Want more info contact me on this device via www.myspace.com/zune

<Title>Zune Rocks and is available is some of the TARGETS stores...
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing player.. just love it.  I was very skeptical about getting a Zune, but now... "I feel GREAT!!"  This is the best HD player in the market... iPod is a nice looking player, but for the price point ZUNE is a better bargain.. Wi Fi, Radio, Cool interface...  The other day I took it to the Gym to "SHOW OFF" to some of my iPod friends.. they were impressed a couple of them RED FACED ;). The sound quility between the two.. ZUNE ROCKS!!. The videos were looking great. I had my son's snap in the back ground... you can pick up your ZUNE from a bunch by looking at the back ground... feels personal :)  I like it big time and would recomend it as a gift to your loved ones. Also checkout the www.zuneoriginals.net for some cool customization (text and graphics on the back of your ZUNE)  Checkout at the Target.com site for avaiability at nearby stores... it is going fast so hurry up.  Happy holidays!!

<Title>Sold the Zen for the Zune...was it worth it??
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the Zen Vision: M for quite some time and was very happy with it.  It did everything I needed it to do so I had never really thought about upgrading.  Then I started putting movies on it and quickly found out that more storage capacity would be a good thing (my Zen was the 30gb).  I tried everywhere to get one of these things, even signed up for notifications when they became available online via email alerts; I could never login fast enough to snag one.  Then one day on a whim, I walked into my local WalMart and snagged the last one!  Let the fun begin...  The unit is neither light or heavy, to me it feels just right and solid.  Mine came charged to the degree that I could hook it up and sync my stuff right away had I chose to.  However, I waited and plugged it in for the full charge.  My Zen arrived with a depleted charge and I had to charge it overnight just to begin with it.    The software was a breeze to install (I disabled all firewalls and anti virus) and when I hooked up the Zune, it was installed no problem.  I told the software where my files were that I wanted transferred from an external drive and it began immediately.    The Zune marketplace is OK.  I can't find any video downloads (TV shows, movies etc) so hopefully that is coming soon.  The podcasts are fantastic.  The display is fantastic on the unit with movies and video podcasts looking crisp and clear.  Compared to the Zen, the screen is a wonderful upgrade.  Battery life on the music is crazy long.  My Zen would struggle on 9 hours or so, but the Zune is still more than half charged after a 10 hour day at work.  I haven't watched a full length video yet, so I can't comment on that. The wireless sync though, will also kill your battery life.  Here's what I don't like.  The sync connector to the Zune is flimsy.  For whatever reason, it's hard to get a perfect fit into the Zune on many occasions, however, it will still sync, but the connector is at an angle.  I'm afraid the connector will break, or the piece in the Zune is at risk of snapping.  Wireless sync is way too slow to be really useful at all.  A video podcast that was only synced 6% of the way wireless, drained my Zunes battery more than halfway after 30 minutes.  Hook it up to the PC and it's transferred in under a minute.  My hope here is that the Zune will get an update on the wireless function to be able and get on the web...We can only hope.  The inability to delete anything from the Zune only by using the software is completely stupid.  Any time I want to delete a picture, video, podcast etc, I have to sync up and delete it through the software.  Dumb with a capital D.  The Zen would let me delete anything, anytime and it does come in handy.  I don't think the Zune displays as many of the mp3 tags as the Zen.  I could get the year of the album, track number, producer, and play count.  On the Zune, you get album and track. That's it (unless I'm missing a button combo while the track is playing).  So for the overall upgrade, I'm pleased.  But there still is room for improvement on the next update or Zune altogether.

<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have been using it for almost two months and it has been a very good experience. It software is very friendly and much superior to the ITunes. I have to say that I was surprise with the video section and it capacity to READ all the available Windows videos that I had in my Documents. I think that it is superior that the IPod in many ways but the most important thing is that it is under WINDOWS environment due to that IT recognized almost everything from it. Also I have a 64bit HP laptop I had had some problems with ITunes in order to recognize it. There is a compatibility problem between ITunes and some Vista versions (Ultimate at least).

<Title>Hands down, much better than the iPod classic
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third mp3 player - the first two were Creative Lab nomad hard-drive based products.  Both of those died after 2 years of use, and I was frustrated with the lack of robustness.  I assumed an iPod hard-disk based solution would solve my problems, so I bought one.  It was returned 12 hours later.  3 PCs couldn't consistently detect the iPod, and when it did music would inexplicably fail to import.   Some video podcasts wouldn't sync, and others would. The iTunes software was incredibly slow, and it wouldn't allow the iPod to connect to more than one PC.  The album artwork sometimes created issues with the iPod itself.  Enough of that nonsense, back to the store with the iPod.  Fortunately I located a Zune 80 gb.  It can be linked to more than one computer, and the software is much easier to use and occupies much less processor overhead. The screen is bigger, and the artwork doesn't create issues with the software.  And, this baby has wireless, and if your PC is on and the software is active, you can sync anywhere in range of your router.  Very nice, and very useful.

<Content>Way to go, Microsoft. I guess they did a lot of R&D becfore coming out with Gen2. It was worth the wait. I love it so much I want to sleep with it under my pillow. I sold my iPods on e-bay for pennies on the dollar because they were eating my wallet with paid downloads that don't play anywhere else.  As a bonus, but I don't like to show off, I saw some iPod users looking green with envy at a Starbucks.

No drm hassles from using it on different machines, unlike ipod. Yes, I did buy this to replace an 80gb 5.5 gen ipod video. I am so happy. This thing works right, and above all, does not seem to be a 'make and abandon' tech as Microsoft updates enhance functionality, not cripple. Do get this. I guarantee you will not regret it.

<Title>Major junk
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is junk. It's too small and blurry screen and the thing doesn't work as a normal storage area. That means that you can't use it on any computer unless you install the drivers and if you own a Mac or a Linux machine you can't use it at all. You can't use it for anything but music either (so no backup for my important documents although the disk (should) be large enough).  Next to that, the music on there is not compatible with any media player unless it's Windows Media Player (which is an archaic program). The music you buy is also only playable on the Zune and you can't even transfer it to another computer or home theater system nor burn it to a cd.  The headphones and audio output in general is awful, bass is too weak and when plugged into the stereo system gives an awful tone.  Stay away from it, it's underpriced because it can't sell, get an iPod or a Sansa MP3 player that allows it to be recognized as an external disk.

<Title>Zune A Mediocre Player: Updates Could Help
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1) No manual anywhere that I can find. After purchasing the Zune, I took it out of the box and began charging it up. I then took the Product Guide and the Start Guide to the couch, thinking I would read up on all the features of the Zune while it charged up. Wrong! The Product Guide is just filled with safety and warranty gibberish in ten different languages, and the Start Guide, which does deal with actually operating the player, is all of four pages! It appears that the entire user guide is online:  http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/usersguide/yourzune/default.htm, and it's not even in PDF format so I can print it off. So, in order to find any information about operating the player you need to go surfing around the Zune web site. This may be fine for some people, but I think it's a pain. You'd think for $250 they could include a manual. Does anyone know where I can find one? I'm still looking....  2) A new Zune comes disabled. When you first take the Zune out of the box, you can't use it. Whatever button you press, it says "To start, visit www.zune.net/setup." Okay, so I do that. It took me four tries to finally make a connection to Microsoft's server. Each installation attempt took a while (about 20 minutes, times will vary), so you're talking almost 90 minutes just to get the Zune to turn on. I'm not sure if this is because the Zune servers are being over whelmed with new Zune purchasers, but if you're buying this as a Christmas gift, be warned. You may want to open it up and install the Zune software a few days before Christmas. I'm not sure why (profit margins I guess) that Microsoft didn't include a CD-ROM or flash drive in the box with the software, or better yet, have the operating system already installed on the device so that it is usable when new.  3) No direct digital camera file transfers. It's hard to understand this. The technology has been around for a few years, and they're touting this device as a music listening, picture viewing, video watching marvel. So, let me get this straight. You're away on your vacation. You are cruising around, enjoying the sights, taking a bunch of photos. You have your Zune, your digital camera, and your .... laptop! Or better yet, maybe you have your entire PC in your backpack with a massive battery pack or a portable generator. Come on Microsoft, get your head out of the sand.  4) You can't turn the thing off! The way the booklet tells you to turn it off is by holding down the "play/pause" button. This only puts the player in standby mode. What that means is the battery will drain much faster when you're not using it. After trolling the Internet I found that this problem is widespread. I also found a solution: hold the "back + down button (center pad)" simultaneously for several seconds. The device will eventually "completely" shut down.  5) Reviewers keep mentioning how great it is that you can output video from the Zune to a TV, unfortunately there is no video out cable included. You'd think for $250 they could give you this $8 cable in the box.  6) Stupid Item 1: You can't delete songs, pictures, videos directly from the Zune. You need to delete items in the software and then re-sync to remove the items from the Zune.I have a $50, 1 GB Creative Labs player that I use for the gym that allows you to directly delete songs. Why not the $250 Zune?  7) Stupid Item 2: Rating System. From Microsoft's web site, "A heart means you like... a song. A broken heart means ... the song just isn't for you." Why on earth would you put music on your MP3 player that you don't like!? Somebody at Microsoft needs to get a clue. Don't they ever market test this stuff. This is dumb beyond words....  8) Stupid Item 3: You can't access the player as an external hard drive. The technology has been around for awhile. I believe there are some hacks available to make it possible.If that's the case, I can't imagine why they didn't include this feature.  9) No support for audio books from Audible.com. Another oddity. I guess I'll use my Creative player for those.  10) An improved battery meter: one that tells you exactly what percentage (or better yet hours and minutes) of battery power you have left.  11) Proprietary USB cable. Why? Why? Why? Would you do that? You couldn't make it the same as my digital camera, external hard drives, other MP3 player GPS, etc...?  12) Wireless syncing.... yawn... ho hum. Who cares? All it does is eat up the battery life, and it's slow. If you could browse the internet with it maybe it would be of some use. Give me back the equalizer.  13) FM radio. Wow, that's cutting edge. Do I really need another portable FM radio? Now if it was an HD radio that would be worth buzzing about.  You may not believe this, but I'm not a Zune basher. I think it's currently the best jukebox-type player on the market for anyone that wants to rip their music in high fidelity with the lossless codec. I think Creative Labs used to be the best, but now they appear to be focusing on smaller capacity flash-based devices or portable video players. If you're someone who is more concerned with video than audio, check out the Zen Vision W. For music the Zen Vision M was an excellent player, but it has been discontinued with apparently nothing to replace it. As far as Apple goes, their players have been plagued by poor sound quality (and are for people that don't know the difference) and mechanical failures.  I get the impression that Microsoft rushed this to market for the holidays. How else do you explain the lack of a unified user's manual either in the box or online? I'm hoping that they address some of these issues in future firmware updates. Support for open source lossless codecs would be nice as well, and the DJ feature that the Creative players have is excellent. Maybe Microsoft could buy that from them (or copy it : )  ).  I hope this review helps some prospective buyers. I've only had the Zune for a day, so I'll try to post a follow up later on.

<Title>Good Player Bad Service
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided on the Zune over the iPod because most commentators said that the player is better than the iPod and that the Zune Marketplace was superior to iTunes.   The player is pretty good but I do have a complaint about the Marketplace. It is harder to navigate than iTunes. I also have a problem with the points systems that it has. Instead of paying directly for each song you want to download you have to buy points making it more expensive to use than iTunes.

<Title>Worth buying if you luv music
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this at hunting it down, mind you I do not own a Ipod i did not want to get one, too many out there decided to purchase this one. This is an upgrade from a person who has the Dell digitaljukebox which is still in pristine condition [lack of usage] and I wanted to upgrade myself.   1st comes in small brown box and I was like where is the charger, but the player charges through USB, nice. Its slim and sturdy looking screen size is nice and the colour on the screen comes in good. The wheel senses your finger tips and you can scroll.  You call also just press the button[wheel] and it works that way as well.  Though you can not used with gloves on.   2. The software downloads onto your comp, which advise do that 1st than sync you player because it will say found new hardware. Download time I say about 15min mind you this is on LAN so if you dont have that or somight be a little longer.  MY OS is XP and it was quite good no problems like Ive read on others 3. ONce i syncd in player in you instruct the zune program which is broker down to music,video,paylist etc..where to pull your music,photos etc from. you save on the setting and everytime you put something in those files without even have to manually go through the file copy motions it finds it and put new info on player 4. I was downloading songs from various...and I have to say I was impress usually on my other player I know ancient I would have to say sync player or manually do in order to get the new songs/etc..as soon as the file is download Zune picks it up and puts on your player..nice 5. though I will say there were some quirky stuff just once the album covers were not matching the artist when first downloaded and if it does not have a cover seems to copy other cover and puts on. ex..I have some Sting songs and the album cover was dup 3x for the Cure songs that did not have..it shows that way on your comp but when I went to play on the Zune does not have it like that so very minor. I have not used the earphones that come with it looks nice for I have a nice pair of V-MOda I like to rock.  All in im am pleased with the outcome thus far. Ive upgrade myself and did not have any of the problems that others were commenting on.  I think this is a great player and worth the price..+ a hard to find commodity

<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading the reviews of the 80GB Zune being better the the iPod Classic i was skeptical.  I own my ipod for more then 2 years, and I love it.  But i wanted to try something new, so i purchased the much praised 80 GB Zune.  All i have to say is.....WOW  Everything in this Zune is....well..."Sexy."  The interface of the software and hardware is amazing.  The sound of the zune is very good, despite not having an Equalizer. The screen looks huge, after looking at the ipod screen for so many years.  Another cool feature is the Radio on the Zune.  It not only picks up the station on the zune, but i can pick up the current song that is playing, and its artist and title scrowls on the bottom of the frequency number.  Lastly, the headphones are really nice.  Most headphones that come with the mp3 players suck, but the zune headphones are high quality.

<Title>Great player and Bad software
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player itself is really good.But to bad its linked to the worse music software i've ever used. I returned mine after 1 day. It can't even get the album artist and tags right. And they dumbed it down so badly that now its annoying and intrusive. Its constantly syching even when you don't want it to. And podcast..If you like podcast be prepared for an hour or more of syching the device. And that means you can't do anything. What i found really annoying is, I use other programs like winamp just to listen to podcast on my pc. This software listed them in my music collection and they were just blank url's with the podcast logo. I didn't want it to sych winamp at all. You really can't do anything with it until Microsoft patches it and who knows when that will be. I would say skip the Zune for now. For me it was a mistake to buy this. And its really to bad. The player is great,but the software kills it. I will never buy any mp3 player that is linked to its own software again(ipod and zune). I bought an Archos 404 and could now be happier.

The ZunePad took a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, browsing through your library is quick and efficient.  The large screen on the device is impressively beautiful.  Video playback blew me away right out of the gate.  The seperate Podcast feature, combined with the ease of podcast subscription service through Zune Marketplace is wonderful.  It allows you to subscribe to dozens of free audio or video podcasts, which will automatically download the latest episodes which replace the older episodes on the device during sync.  Audio playback is great as well.  The lack of custom or pre-configured EQ settings is a bit of a drawback, considering not everyone hears things the same way.  I myself am a drummer, and I have a hard time hearing low bass.  A custom EQ allowing me to crank up the bass on some music would be a great addition.  I don't know why MS ever removed this feature in the first place.  Considering this, though, the music playback is great.  The number one drawback to Zune, as I am sure most of you have figured out by now, is the Zune software.  That proprietary stripped down wonder that has been making Zune lovers scream in terror.  Microsoft, in an attempt to simplify this software for the masses, has in turn ruined what was once at least a tolerable and somewhat feature packed music management software.  No tag editing capabilities, no automatic album art retrieval, no smart playlists, and a rinky dink heart/broken heart rating system.  While I think this software could be useful for those with little to no PC literacy, it is a slap in the face to customers wanting full control of their music library.  The lack of functionality in this software, even when compared to the 1st generation software, is a very sore spot on what has the potential to be a much loved and highly regarded personal media player.  It does a fine job of loading your media library according to folders you select.  It also does a fine job of syncing, whether plugged in or wirelessly.  I have had no problems in either of these areas.  Beyond that, though, the software is terrible.  Microsoft either needs to add these features along with same features it used to have in the 1st gen. software (like tag editing, smart playlists etc.) to the current software, or launch a completely seperate Zune software for advanced users.  The fact that this is the ONLY software compatible with the Zune really limits MS' potential customer base.  The Marketplace is decent, if you like the idea of paying per song like Apple makes you do with iTunes.  It does have the Zune Pass service, which is a monthly subscription, but not all songs are available for download using this service.  If they are going to have a monthly subscription service for a set fee, they should not place limitations on it.  The podcast area is great, because so much of the content is free and it automatically downloads and syncs it for you.  Apple just improved iTunes tremendously by announcing video rentals.  I fear Zune may never be able to work out a deal like this, and the download content available for Zune right now is pretty much limited to music videos purchased in the Marketplace (people really watch these things?), and the video podcasts.  I have managed to find a way to download and convert youtube and other flash site videos, but it wasn't without some research before I figured out how to do this.  All in all I am very happy with my Zune.  It does everything I need it to do, and does it well.  The software will be the major downfall of this player if MS doesn't start acting fast to get several issues resolved.  I have been one of the lucky ones in my Zune experience.  I would hate to see such a well designed and functionally sound device fall victim due to unneccessary software issues.  I would suggest this product only to people who have either never owned a PMP before and are just getting into the market and folks without an extensive music library that would require a lot of management before loading it on to a device.

<Content>First, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I have been anti-Apple for a number of years.  However, all of my friends have iPod Classics or iPod Touches and even they have been impressed with my new Zune toy.  The screen is beautiful and the fact that giant pictures of the album art appear whenever a song plays makes you just want to stare at the screen for hours.  I find the software easy to use and I had very little trouble syncing approx. 20GB of music from an external hard drive all at once.  The radio is a perk and the podcasts are phenomenal.  Of course, the one little thing that would make this absolutely perfect is downloadable video (movies and TV shows) from the Marketplace.  I have no doubt that good ol' Bill Gates is working on this as we speak, though.  Despite my prejudices, I have to say that this Zune blows your typical iPod completely out of the water and gets some very admiring stares on the subway :-)  I highly recommend!!!

<Content>I have four kids and they all have I-pods.  I bought the Zune for the radio feature.  While at the gym the TV's are turned down but their sound is broadcast over an FM signal.  Now I can watch and listen to the news while on the treadmil.  Or with such a huge capacity, I can watch the first two seasons of Hero's while working out.  And the screen is big enough that I can watch a show even while running on the treadmil.  I prefer the black color over the white and the my kids, who were all i-pod devote's are all jealous of me!

<Title>Zune 80 Gig, better than before
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the Zune 80 for Xmas this year (07).  I love the interface & display, looks even better than the ipod.  I heard some nightmare stories about the software that came with the 30 Gig version, this seems to be better than those.  BUT, the software still needs some work.  If you have an old or weird CD that you try to add to your libary, things can go wrong.  As with most mp3 software, Zune goes out to the web and looks for the album info.  In some cases (ie, old "bought it on TV" CD's) The Zune will not find the info out there.  When it can't find it, the manual input is buggy.  I've had it lock up on me several times now trying to  input the info.  I've downloaded the recommended "reset" patch, but that wipes out a lot of manual info I've already put in.  This is especially true if you had to find the album art yourself.  If you use this reset program, all those album covers will be lost.  I'm sure this is part of some "anti-piracy" thing MS put in there.  Hopefully they will continue to work on it.  Also, it would be nice to have EQ abilities either on the device or on the PC, but none is there, only volume.  Other than those items, I like it!

<Content>I own the first generation also, I like the 80GB size of the 2nd generation. It took me a while to get used to the buttons on this one and I still at times have trouble. The lock switch on the top has been an issue, sometimes it just does not unlock and I have to move the switch back and forth. Overall I am pleased with this product, I like the Zune software and the capabilities. I have found that you cannot use Zune software with two zunes plugged in, it is one or the other. I wish the company had put some more thought into the lock switch and also put out some better cases for this product. Based on the switch, I am giving this product 4 stars.

<Title>Love the Hardware, Hate the Software
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really can't understand why I can't sync this machine directly from WMP11.  The Zune Desktop is just plain hideous.  Had I known how truly awful it was going to be I wouldn't have bought the player.  It's slow.  It's buggy: if you edit MP3 tags, the program actually reverts them to the wrong characteristics if it doesn't agree with what it thinks the tag  should be!    The Zune desktop is clearly aimed at morons who want to just plug the thing in without actually maintaining their collections.  It might be OK for a 4GB flash-toy, but I got 60 GB of WMA's on this player and editing, deleting, moving, renaming or doing anything sensible is out of the question with this software.  In a word, it's ****.  Hardware: sounds great, the interface is clean, battery life is excellent. I'd give the hardware 5 stars.  Now let's get a sync feature that works with WMP or some third party app so I can actually use it.

<Title>Simply the best MP3 player yet
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I bet anyone reading this is considering an iPod. Well I have owned 4 iPods. I can tell you none of them were as wonderful as my Zune 80 GB. The only iPod that is even remotely close to this is the iPod classic 80 and 160, and in both cases the Zune has a far better screen. The iPod touch has a rather nice screen but it's more expensive and has a limited 16 GBs of storage, just a mere 20% of the capacity of the Zune80.   And there is one more thing... With Zune you have a choice to subscribe to all the music you want for a small monthly fee, which means you can download ANYTHING from the Zune Marketplace and actually use this storage to explore and discover new music without going broke. But if you are one of those people who must own every song, then you can choose to buy them one by one or album by albun same as you do with iTunes. So with Zune, you have a choice. With iPod you don't have a choice.   So bigger screen, more storage, and choices. It's a winner!  Alex Alexzander

I actually use it with Mac OS X 10.5 through parallels and it works like a charm, even with 8,000 songs + videos to sync up.  The interface is trully and ipod killer and much better than the ipod touch coverflow method.  I am actually learning to rediscover music i haven't listened to in ages thanks to the very intuitive way of navigating music.   Highly recommended product.

<Title>No sacrifice in performance & great value
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Zune 80 for about a week now and am extremely happy with my choice.  This is my 4th MP3 player (ipod's, creative labs, and now Zune) and by far the best choice.  I think there will be a lot of iPod users that switch to this device.  The only thing comparable seems to be the Creative Zen, but for the same price it's less than 50% the storage capacity.  Pro's Great quality sound.  Factory ear buds are very good quality.  I have bought my own for normal use, but keep these around and they sound much better than competitors headphones.  Display.  Very large, vibrant display with glass window.  I watched a movie on this and the bigger size (in contrast to the iPod) is very nice.  80 GB is enormous.  A ripped DVD is about 700-800 MB, so you could have dozens of full-length movies and thousands of songs.  Perfect for long trips.  Value.  The comparable sized iPod is hundreds more, and doesn't have the resolution.  $250 for 80 GB is unbelievable.  Compatibility.  The device supports MP3, WMV, AAC (iPod format, unprotected), MPEG 4 and other formats.  It has podcast support, which is a must.  Good battery life.  I've run mine at the office over several days (4-5 hours a day) before recharging.  Took it on a 3 day trip with flights and no recharging.  I suspect I'd have to charge if I was gone a week, but I'm happy with the battery.  Con's No built in equalizer.  Sound is good, but I like to adjust levels of bass and mid.  Does not offer support for other DRM subscription music services (like Yahoo Music).  Why Microsoft chose not to support their own DRM format escapes me.  They do offer the all-you-can-eat [...].  I do not consider lack of support for the protected AAC format a negative, as iPod's equally don't support WMV.  I choose to have my music in MP3 format whenever possible so I'm not tethered to a specific technology.  Plus Amazon now offers MP3's for $0.89 each!  Accessories.  It would be nice to see Microsoft bundle in a car charger or a case with the package.  I've been recommending the Zune 80 to my friends.  Very good device.

<Title>Perfect for my Windows Lossless files, no support for Windows Media Player
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Firstly the iPod vs Zune debate. Once the Ipod Touch gets a greater storage capacity then that's going to be the player of choice for most people. But that won't help me for my latest music project - ripping my large cd collection into Windows lossless (perfect sound quality) files.  I have both the Ipod Classic (160gb) for my vast collection of mp3s and now the Zune 80gb for my growing collection of lossless Windows Media music files - mainly jazz and classical.  Why both? I love the iPod Classic storage capacity but on the other hand I also love the usability, look, and feel of the Windows Media player. Compared to iTunes it's just much better all round. I wanted to rip all my remaining cds to lossless and use a decent player to listen to them on my computer so I chose the WMP. I also wanted to play them on an portable music player (not possible on iPod unless you convert/duplicate files to Apple format) so when Zune 80gb was announced with its support for Windows Lossless files it made perfect sense to purchase that for my lossless music collection.  The large glass front and the screen graphics are easier to see and read than the iPod. I have other hobbies such as photography and the ability to view the day's shoot on the Zune is something I'm looking forward to.  The sound quality is very good but a little sharp. I shouldn't be saying this (as someone wanting perfect sound quality) but I wouldn't mind an equalizer. The sharp perfect sound quality of lossless is missing the unnatural warmth of the mp3 and it would be nice to warm up the sound a smidgen, but hey, that's the bed I made.   I was hoping that when my Zune arrived I would be able to sinc it to WMP but there's no ability to do that and you have to use the provided software which is even worse than iTunes.  That's really my only complaint. The benefits for the moment - playing Windows Media files at lossless sound quality on a portable player - outweigh the software issue.  I'm very happy with the player. Hopefully you will be too.

<Title>Worth the wait - Absolutely amazing
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I almost settled for an alternative since these were so scarce, but am glad I waited.  This is a must-have if you've got a child and you want their cartoons/movies available at home, in the car, and on a plane.  We previously used a portable DVD player, but dealing with discs was a pain (scratches, changing, etc).  Now that we have all the kiddie movies and music on the Zune, all we need is this one device.  The HomeAV pack works great at the house when we want to display it on the large TV, and the only drawback is the resolution when displaying on a large screen.  It's fine for standard definition or any movies viewed on the Zune screen, but it's not HD quality when sending it to a 50" plasma.  We have 83 movies and a ton of songs on the Zune, and still have 32GB available.  I was concerned the wireless features wouldn't be secure enough since our home network is locked down pretty well; however, the Zune supports multiple encryption options (including WPA) & showed the MAC address so I was able to setup MAC filtering too.  After the intial setup, we don't even have to connect the Zune to the computer anymore; I can leave it in the car and sync from the garage!  This Zune is also very durable.  We've used it quite a bit and it still doesn't have any scratches.

<Title>Great way to store your music and photos
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to own a 20GB Dell DJ and was very happy with it due to the fact that it was a simple, easy to use, easy to understand piece of hardware that I could back my files and music onto.  After that experience I've come to expect the same kind of performance from any mp3 player that I buy.  After the DJ croaked I started looking around for a new one and it being the case that I really don't like Steve Jobs and his MacIntrash plans of world domination I looked around for something OTHER than an iPood.  After looking around this Zune seemed to be a good bet over the competition (iRiver, Toshiba, etc).  When it finally arrived it was very easy to go online and download the necessary software to run it.  Once I sync'd all of my music and pictures onto it I started to play around and was very impressed with the easy user interface, huge storage capacity and screen.  The "premium" headphones give out great sound quality and are decent isolation headphones.  Most of the preloaded content is lame but it was really easy to delete it offa the player.  I'm still trying to figure out how I can rip my DVD's onto it and get it to recognize some .mpeg videos on my hard drive but overall this is a great player that deserves a serious lookover if you're in the market.

<Title>The Zune is a great choice
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a great choice for an Mp3 player, I own the 8GB and have owned a 30GB. If you want a quality player with great support (like new firmware updates, great 1st party accessories, etc.), great features (like an FM radio, wi-fi for syncing and sending songs, video on a very large screen, podcasts, etc.) and great software with a great way to get music (subscription service or buying music in DRM or non-DRM forms), then you should get a Zune. I've had it since the 13th of last month, and it's been nearly a month with it, and I really like it. The wireless sync seems like a gimmick to some people, but I use it all of the time, because I have it next to my bed at night, docked and plugged into my speakers at night, and when I pause the music, after one minute , it automatically syncs with my PC, so I get any newly downloaded content, podcasts (which automatically download), videos, pictures and more while I'm sleeping. It will even convert and sync my TV episodes for me, so I can wake up and watch my favorite TV shows while I'm on my way out to school. It performs well, It's much more durable than an Ipod (doesn't scratch as easily) because it has a glass screen, a matte finish on the front and a brushed-aluminum back, so it doesn't scratch. The controls are very easy to use, and they are quicker to do than other players (such as the ipod). The quircle is both a touch-sensitive D-pad, but also is a normal D-pad, so the touch can be disabled, something no player can really do right now. The two main buttons are easy to push, this time being a little raised, an improvement to the 30gb model, where the buttons are not raised. The only annoyance with the 80GB Zune is the hold switch is a little deeper than normal, so it's not the easiest thing to disable, but then again, isn't that better for your battery life, seeing as it will never unlock itself?  The headphones it comes with are great, they get very good Bass, and they are made of a very cool material, similar to a rope for climbing. They are easy to store, too, because the left 'bud magnetically connects to the right 'bud.  The Zune gives you all of this, and for the same price as many competitors (such as the Ipod). There are not any major problems with the product, and it's a good value, so what's not to love? If you want to see my un-boxing video, go to this URL-http://youtube.com/watch?v=7jzzx_4StC4

<Title>Better than my iPod
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Prior to my Zune 80 I had a 30GB iPod Video for a year and a half.  It was a decent MP3 player but had lots of problems.  I spent hours on the phone with Apple tech support and never got anything resolved.  After a year of owning it I was still having problems and Apple would no longer speak to me.  It finally got to the point where the battery wouldn't charge anymore and I could only listen to it if it was attached to a dock.  I needed something new and the Zune looked like a fresh start.  It really was.  I installed the Zune software prior to purchasing and found it to be usable.  It wasn't the greatest thing ever made but it worked and was actually quicker at responding than iTunes.  Once the device came and I started playing with it I decided that I would never try an iPod again.  The new controls are so much easier to use and the interface on the device is genius.  Unlike the iPod, the Zune actually feels like it was built with quality products.  It's rugged, sleek and easy to use.  I have been very impressed and would highly recommend this device to anyone in the market of getting an MP3 player.

<Title>Looks great on paper, however Poor Quality 
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very excited to hear the Zune 80 was to be released.  Waited until the release date and was disappointed that Amazon could not fill my order.  I got lucky and found one locally.  Everything went great for the first few days.  Then all of a sudden it would not turn on.  Even with a full charge, I tried resetting, connecting it to the USB on the computer and still nothing.  Finally, decided to return it.  After all I'd never get 2 defective Zunes, Right?  Wrong.  The replacement Zune started shutting itself off almost right away. I'd sitting listening to music and it would just shut off even with a full battery charge. It shut off 10 times in about 12 hours of use. Again,  I tried resetting the player (several times) and also charged it for over 8 hours. It would just shut off with no notice.  Now I'm really disappointed as I REALLY liked the Zune 80.  I figure I have had 2 defective units and was able to return them both.  What happens if the next one works for 91 days then dies? I'm stuck and must get it repaired.  Not worth the risk to me.  I hope I am the exception and not the rule.  Good luck to everyone who purchases a new Zune 80.

<Title>Don't waste your money, poor software, poor hardware, complete junk.
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off let me say I despise ipods and will never own one.  I have had creative products in the past and loved them.  When I saw the new zune 80 I thought it would be even better then my zen vision m, so i bought it.  At first I was irritated with the software it has a tendacy to sync multiple songs, lose album art and is very limited in the ability to control your music collection, but I struggled through it and found it to be usable, not ideal but usable.  Sound quality is pretty good, however the build quality is pathetic.  I got mine 11/19, as I was sitting in the parking lot listening to some tunes the player fell off my lap and landed face up.... it shattered the paper thin glass screen, ruined the screen completely.  I then called Microsoft to be told there is no way to fix the screen... it's junk.  Next let's talk battery life.  Unless you plan on keeping this thing plugged in 24/7 don't plan on using it.  When you pull it off the charger and turn it "off" using the method the limited instructions recommends it will still continue to drain the battery.  If you turn it off using the other method, it won't drain the battery however it will have to boot back up which takes a few seconds and hitting play will not pick up where you left off.  I found average battery life to be about 10 hours.  Honestly do not waste your money, it is no where near what a $250 media player should be.  The software is sub-par, the build quality is terrible and the battery life is worse.

Cons: Horrendous software, Click Wheel is still a better interface  After using my 5th Generation iPod's screen stopped working just a little above 1 year (conveniently out of warranty) I decided that I didn't want to buy another apple product for my next mp3 player. The Zune 2 had just come out and the 80GB of space was quite appealing (upgrade from 30GB) and the player seemed rather improved from the first Bricky Zune. After testing the interface in the store and checking the size I was quite convinced this would be my next mp3 player. What really sealed the deal was the Zune Originals offer from MS that allowed you to laser etch a custom picture from a set # of artists onto the back of the player.  So I waited anxiously for my Zune (shipped direct from the factory in China). When it arrived the player was solid as expected and the interface was smooth..... And then everything went downhill from there. I started by simply installing the Zune software and when that was done I selected my music folders. First thing I noticed was that the ways to manipulate the sorting were incredibly limited compared to ITunes. You couldn't sort by priorities (like Album> Artist). So I either had to choose between browsing artists (where the albums would be scatted around) or by album (where the artists were scattered throughout the whole list). To top things off in browse mode, things are jumbled in the album view where it splinters off albums if you have various artists or feat. artists in a single album... Not great. Of course this could be overcome by a simple search right? Nope... the search function is horrible and non-interactive. It's not even close to as smooth as the itunes search and from the search page you cannot sync songs directly from there. Either way it makes organizing any collection a complete pain. Second off the Zune doesn't double as a portable HD if you need it while the Ipod does. And third, I often bring my mp3 player to work to play music on my PC (since my work PC has limited HD Space). For some obscure reason the Zune software does not play songs directly off your Zune unless you copy them to your HD collection first (defeating the purpose of doing it in the first place).  It really upsets me that Microsoft had a great chance to take a customer away from Apple's Ipod reign and completely screwed it up with horrible software. I wanted to enjoy the zune but it's just been a miserable experience so far that I can't recommend to anyone (esp since it's about the same price as the ipod classic). Sure, things might improve in the future and the software might be updated, but I wouldn't buy this player and bank on that. I'm even tempted now to sell my Zune at a loss on ebay and go buy another iPod so I can use Itunes again (which I don't particularly like all that much to begin with). I could go on about the positive aspects like the wireless sync and the social aspect, but really it's all just overshadowed by pure un-useability..... It's sad how they didn't even get the fundamentals correct with the software. Here's to hoping for an improvement (and I'll update my review if one comes). Oh yeah, in case you're wondering "why so low". Because these crippling problems basically make the player practically useless to me.

<Title>Great Player and Great experience
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune 80 a month back. Till now I can tell you that my experience has been great. A lot has been written  about its hardware and software so let me tell you a few other aspects.  1. Premium HeadPhone: The premium headphone makes a lot of difference. The sound quality is great and for most of the people this head phone will be step up from the usual head.  2. Following the baby: Zune is a baby. Well now Zune 2 it about to be a teenager!! The point is that its really amazing to follow and see the product grow. It fun when new features are added and anticipation is great too.  3. Different take on market: Zune has a slightly different take on the music market. Thay have to compete with the dominant players. The whole social approach along with the ZuneSocial site is just great. It adds new dynamic to the whole PMP device. 4. Less is More: The competition is big. Has a lot of content. In fact so much content that sometime its tough to find what you want. Podcast is one example. Way too much of it is out there with the competition and its cluttered all over. Zune has lesser number but they are well organized and easy to find.  I have been happy with my Zune. If you give it a try I am sure you will too. Generally you can return the item in 30 days. Get one and try it for a couple of days.   Rohit

<Title>Hardware great, software horrible
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The scrolling feature of the hardware is very good.  It's fast and responsive.  The screen is a nice size and bright.  However, the software is a nightmare.  It synchs everything and anything multiple times and the tags for artist and album are frequently labeled "unknown".  So you have to manually go through each song, (no way to do this as a group) and list the correct info or else you will have a bunch of unknown songs on your player.  If you have a lot of songs, it's too time consuming and unworkable. If you want this player I'd wait for a software fix before buying.

With the new update of the software and firmware, I just loved it. The found the software easy to use. Even I sorted out the mess around my media files. It was quite easy. The use device is very easy to use and straightforward. Just 3 buttons..

<Title>About as good as it gets
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to spend alot of time here singing my praises of the Zune. I could spend an hour listing all the reasons why this is such a great product, but the bottom line is that the 80 gig is excellent. I'm extremely picky about my electronic toys and I always research the crap out of a major purchase item. I spent a long time comparing this to the ipod and they were neck and neck as far as pros and cons go. In the end, I received a good deal on the Zune so that was the tie breaker. I've had my Zune for a couple of weeks and I am completely satisfied with it. I've had no problems of any kind with it. I was a little apprehensive about the version 2 software because of some other "horror-story" reviews, but so far everything is working perfectly. I am glad that I opted for the Zune instead of the Ipod. Of course, nothing is perfect and there are some cons with that come with Zune. For instance, I wish the Zune marketplace was as developed as Itunes, but I'm betting they will be catching up in the near future. The only other problem I've had is trying to find a decent case for this player. There aren't alot of options to choose from for the 80 gig yet. Hopefully, that will also change in the near future.   **UPDATE** I've had my Zune 80 for the past couple of weeks and, while my initial review was positive, I've had time to experience some of the less than satisfactory tendencies of the unit. Most of them seem to be software specific, but more about that in a minute. I haven't ever owned an IPOD, but I decided last summer to get either the 80 gig or 160 gig classic for christmas as a present to myself. I downloaded ITUNES and began ripping my collection of audio books. I have to say that I was less than impressed with Itunes. It was just not user friendly and I didn't like the layout. It also slowed my computer down. Also, I did a little research by visiting a few Apple message boards to see what IPOD owners were praising and/or complaining about regarding their IPODs. I didn't come away with as rosy a picture of Apple products after that, but I was still planning on getting a classic. A few months went by and I heard about the 80 Gig Zune. Long story short...I read the reviews and specs on the zune and decided to go with it. There really isn't any other way to say this...the zune software has been a pain. I started with version 2.2 and then updated this past week with 2.3. So far, I've re-formated my zune twice. I don't know if this was strictly necessary, but it really did seem to help the new versions of the software run more smoothly. My main problem goes back to my audio book collection. Since Zune doesn't support Audible, the only way to get a audio book onto the zune is to rip it. Just ripping one book takes a while, so you have to invest signifigant time. So far, every version (including 2.3) has had a tendency to re-name tracks, move tracks, butcher playlists, and delete tracks. The software seems to do this at random and I have no idea what prompts it to commit these changes. It does get really frustrating. Its gotten to the point that I'm afraid of sycning my zune because I have no idea what the software may randomly decide to do. For instance, this morning I was going to sync a video, so I plugged in the zune and (suprise,suprise) it decided to automatically "remove" 70 tracks from one of my books from my zune. This was a random assortment of tracks scattered over several discs that I had ripped. I have no idea why it chose that particular book because I haven't worked on it for over a week. It was installed perfectly with no flaws. The playlist still looked fine, so I tried to re-sync it to the zune and missing tracks remained missing. I tried to play one of the missing tracks from my pc and I got an error message saying that the track had either been deleted or re-named. Ok fine, so I popped the discs in and tried to rip. The software did a couple of things here. On some of the missing tracks, it showed itself completing the new rip (only it didn't) and on others, it wouldn't even detect the missing tracks in order to start a rip. So, I completely deleted the affected albums and restarted my pc. Then, I began the ripping process over and I was able to restore everything as it originally was before this all started this morning. I went through each track and they all play perfectly again. This is an example of the kind of "housekeeping" you will need to do in order to maintain your collections on your Zune. Its obviously a software problem, but the fact that I've had to re-format with each update is also discouraging. Its just a lot of work. This wasn't an isolated incident either, because the software has done the same thing previously on other books.  I went into Settings on my desktop and I thought I had made it so that nothing would be added or taken from my zune with me doing it manually, but that isn't the case. Its either ignoring the settings I made, or I'm misunderstanding my options. Either way, once the software starts to make a syncing change, you can't really stop it. You can hit cancel and it stops, but if you want sync anything else, you have to complete the sync the software last started. It seems to wait in a que. In my example, I hit cancel and then tried to sync the video, but it started the removal up again before the video could start to sync. Other short coming include the following: inaccurate info is regularly displayed on tracks (i.e. their names, whether or not they are really there), inaccurate info is displayed on your zune storage amounts, and extremely slow video syncing. The slow video syncing is strictly limited to the Zune 80. My wife has a 30, and it takes her about 45 seconds to sync a 2 hr video. It takes me 45 minutes to an hour to sync the same video to my 80. I called Zune support a couple of times. Both reps sounded foreign, so it was difficult to communicate with them. The first time, the lady put me on hold to check with a "consultant vendor" about this problem. She came back on the line after about 5 minutes and informed me that microsoft is aware of this slow video syncing problem in the 80 and that it had something to do with a new component that they developed for the 80. She told me they are working on a fix, but that it was a hardware problem. I asked if they would be able to fix it with a software update and she couldn't answer me. There is no time estimate on a fix, and microsoft hasn't even posted this issue on Zune's site.  I asked her why they hadn't, and she couldn't that either. I wanted to talk to someone different, so I called back about an hour later and spoke to a guy. He said that they had received a memo about the video problem, that they had been aware of it for some time, and that they were working on a fix. I again asked why nothing was posted on Zune.net about this, and he WOULDN'T answer me. He just gave some general canned response that let away from that question. But, at the end of the call, he did encourage me to always check the website for solutions before calling support. Nice, huh?  :-) I've also been disappointed with battery life. I've always had my wireless turned off and that is supposed to help with battery life, but my Zune doesn't seem to get anywhere near the official battery life listings released by microsoft. It does help if you completely turn the unit off vesus putting it into hibernation. There was some problem with the version 2.2 software that prevented reduced power useage when the unit was put into hibernation and I thought that was supposed to be fixed with the 2.3 release last week, but I haven't noticed a difference. In addition, my sister-in-law just got one of the latest generation Ipod Classics for her birthday last month and I was able to look at it today to compare screen resolution with my zune. I have to say that I thought the resolution on the IPOD looked better to me. I was a little crestfallen at this. On the Zune, you can pretty much always see at least a little pixelation, but I couldn't detect any on the IPOD. At this point, I don't know whether to keep the zune and try to ride out the problems or bite the bullet and return it for an ipod. I've put so much work into it so far that I don't really want to go to Apple, but I will if things don't rapidly improve. My window for returning is going to run out soon, so I will wait and see how it behaves in the next week.

<Title>Value for money, large display at the same price/capacity
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software issue looks over-emphasized to me. There are something that I would like to be improved - how the stored songs are displayed and PC storage usage - but the large dispaly makes video great and the 80GB capacity allows me to keep larger files. Plus, I do not feel great for iPod due to its slow and irregular response of new iPod wheel and the sequence of recent added songs, although I like the image of iPod. Net-net, both are not so different to the extent that their software is not perfect.  All albums/songs imported from CD can be automatically exported to zune software. It was quick and easy. Amazon now sells good and more inexpensive MP3 files. It is sure that there are more chioces than before ,which is simply a good news for consumers like us, although I do not feel any of all these choices are superior. They are just different.

<Content>I upgraded from the 30GB unit so I though this unit would be the same but with a bigger hard drive. I was pleasantly surprised though. The new unit is much thinner than the 30GB, the screen is larger, the touchpad is a nice added feature, and overall the unit looks and feels much more polished than my preivous unit. I have a friend who got the ipod 80GB the same time I got my Zune and she is jealous. This is a great unit and with the new and improved Zune Marketplace the PC experience is dramatically improved over the 1st generation software.

<Title>Zune 80Gb
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought the Zune to supercede 2 20Gb Sony Walkman HDD Players. The Sony's killer features were the sound quality and the use of the superior ATRAC compression standard. Sadly the latest Sony's only have 16Gb and no longer use ATRAC so I looked for something with a big capacity to allow the use of lossless compression (WMA for the Zune) and for something with an excellent output stage. Have to say I am delighted with the Zune's audio quality - much better than an iPod, comparable with a Walkman - a bit less natural sounding but with more detail.  All other features are, for me, just a bonus - video playback excellent as is the radio, don't really use picture display or podcast capability and the Wi-Fi is a bit of a gimmick (although it does work well). Only glaring omission is that you can't 'see' the device from Windows and hence use it as a portable hard drive.  Only really bad point, and the thing that stops it getting a 5 star rating, is the Zune software. Potentially this is the best software to come with any player - easier to use than iTunes, Sonicstage or WMP and with lots of features. Only problem is that, in true Microsoft fashion, it's full of bugs. I have had ripped CD tracks assigned to the wrong album, misnamed or just missing - purchases from the online store fail to download (I got my Zune points back after a long call with support) - album art downloaded from the online database which then disappears again - tracks on the Zune which won't delete and many other problems.   So - great hardware, bug ridden software - at least there is the potential to fix the software and complete an otherwise excellent product.

<Title>Yes I do believe the new 80gb zune is better than the comparable ipod
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My previous mp3 player was a 30gb ipod video that i bought new. i owned it for a year or two and sold it because i saw how you could customize the backgrounds on the 1st gen zune plus it had the built in fm tuner which i gave major cool points for. i hear a lot of ipod defenders downplay the fm tuner feature but i am only loyal to the product that provides the features i want at the price i am willing to pay and the zune fit the bill. i was ready to buy a 30gb zune but i heard whispers of the 2nd gen coming out so i waited. i chose the 80gb because it had huge storage, an fm tuner, customizable backgrounds, very nice headphones as standard and a large screen. i've used it for about a month now and i am very happy with my purchase. it is slimmer than the 30gb zune (although i am glad to see MicroSoft still supports and sells the 30gb, my friends 30gb stills works great and i would recommend it also) and i like the new touch D pad interface much better than the old zune button, the ipod's touch wheel or even the new ipod touch screen (it is hard enough keeping fingerprints off a small screen w/out having to touch it to use it). the sound quality is excellent and the headphones superb. the software automatically brought up all my cd's in my itunes library and downloaded all of the available album covers effortlessly, something that was frustratingly absent from itunes. it's pretty bad for the competition when MS is considered less restrictive. the compression format also seems to be an improvement as my tunes now take up less space and i have since added new music and video and noticed the same. the podcast subscription system through the zune site has worked well but not spotless. the only reason i did not give this 5 stars is because i am picky and have had some random syncing errors while downloading podcasts. when researching to see if there is an actual problem, myself or the zune site does not come up with anything so i can't help but feel like i am doing a bit of beta testing for ghosts in the machine until MS's next software patch. no biggie, i just click on the episode again and it downloads fine. Now all that is left is expanding my collection to fill all that space and convert some of my dvd's.

<Title>Excellent product. Better features than the iPod.

<Content>My previous MP3 player was an iRiver which, at the time I bought it, was also far superior to the iPod. Now I need a bigger font and screen to read my selections. The Zune 80G fits the bill. The 3.5" screen also makes viewing videos a pleasurable experience unlike the 2.5" screens which are like looking through a peephole. As for the sound, the supplied earphones make all the difference. Unfortunately it doesn't have a built-in equalizer (like the iRiver). Love the touch-sensitive pad - great idea. Infant mortality: After two weeks my first Zune bit the dust and I couldn't revive it. The quickie return policy of Amazon saved the situation and I had a replacement in three days.

<Content>I like the Zune 80.  I wanted to let some of you know (I've read a lot of complaints about it not completely shutting down) that if you hold the center touch pad toward the down position while holding down the "back" button, it will shut off the Zune so it doesn't drain your battery.    It's useful if you have a video that freezes the processor for some reason.   I know someone will think that was useful information.

<Title>Happy happy happy.
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was incredibly happy when I bought my Zune the day after it was released. The front is dominated by a huge 3.2" screen which gives you plenty of viewing real estate, much better than having it dominated by a huge scroll wheel which isn't very functional anyways (I'm not 90 years old and blind and I don't have huge sausage fingers). The touch pad is extremely functional and easy to use and the buttons are nice to have separated from the scroll pad. The only complaint I'd have about the touch pad is that the center button is very vague and sometimes can lead to a click up/down or left/right but it's not a big deal in the end.  Navigating the thing is easy and the sideways thing is a huge help rather than going forward and back, I have no complaints on the navigation but the rating system is somewhat lacking but not enough to make or break it.  Software is very simplified and may lack some functionality but I've found it provides everything necessary to fully enjoy the player without a ton of clutter and extra stuff that's completely unneeded and confusing like other unnamed software programs.  I had a Toshiba Gigabeat F40 before this one and couldn't stand the plus navigation thing, my fingers don't follow a straight verticle line, I had a hard time with that. It only did pictures too, this thing does videos and I've loaded all my favorite DVDs onto it. I can also record TV shows onto my computer and flawlessly put them onto my Zune, this is one of my favorite features.  What else can I say? This thing is the best player on the market and with the massive storage it comes with I haven't even reached half my storage with 152 videos, 2140 pictures and 1580 songs. The movies are excellent quality also, I don't mind watching them on a 3.2" screen at all!

<Title>Pleasant Surprise - goodbye iPod
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There is no such thing as a perfect digital player - they ALL have some shortcomings.  That being written, I am pleasantly surprised by the Zune 80 gb player.  I have owned hard-drive based MP3 players since 2003 when I bought my first one.  I was recently using the 5G 60gb iPod and it needed replacing so I start researching players again.  After a great deal of research, I bought the Zune but didn't open it right away.  I waited a few days.  That was a mistake.  For a few days, I just used the free Zune software.  I have read some reviews that the software is terrible. I initally agreed but after learning it, I realized I reacted in haste.  Sometimes it is a bigger challenge to 'unlearn' other product's software.  That was my case.  Now I like its simplicity.  I would recommend some improvements to it though but it is fine in a general sense.  The player is quite good.  The sound of the music, to me, is better than my iPod.  I did a direct comparision listening to the exact same songs with the same headphones on each device and that is how I drew my conclusion. I have read a review that reported a great deal of problems with synching and so forth.  I have experienced none of those issues.  No doubling of songs.  I do see it run back through the list of everything but it isn't resynching everything.  To me, it is checking the index of the Zune software's list of files to the index on the Zune looking for differences to know what to synch or ignore.  Here is my list of Pros and Cons for the Zune 80.  Pros: *Better sounding music (even without equalizer - go figure) *Choice to use click method and/or touch.  If you aren't a huge fan of the iPod click-wheel, you will really appreciate the Zune.  I love that change.  The touch function is more natural.  To scroll up, run your finger up on the touch pad.  To scroll down, run your finger down.  Or just click on the top/bottom/left/right of the touch pad to navigate.  Again, it really is very natural to use. *Extremely easy on the eyes.  This is a pleasure to view.  Easy to read. *Friendly navigation.  Again, unlearning other players is the biggest hurdle but worth getting to know the device.  Once you do, you will really like this device. *Larger viewing screen.   *Radio - with RDBS.  Very nice feature. *Supports Podcasts.  I subscribed to X-Play's video game review podcast with no problems. *Nicer headphones included.  They come with headphones that have inserts to help find a better fit.   *The quick add playlist is very friendly to use.  I didn't really like the iPod one mostly because I wasn't a huge fan of the clickwheel. *Substantial feel.  It handles like a quality effort was put into it.  Cons: *Battery life.  Not long enough for me. *Some software design improvements needed on the Zune device and the Zune software on the pc.  I could list a set of improvements but I won't.  They are more tweaks that I believe the development team could easily add.  My field is software so I know I view things from a different perspective.  Overall:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I am glad I did not buy another iPod.  I am excited about music again thanks to this player.  I am actually looking forward to buying CD's and DRM-free music.  And remember, there is no such thing as a perfect digital player.  Keep an open mind when you are browsing for players.  There are many good choices out there, not just one.  Oh, and please don't give away music.  Pay for it so the artist that you love can devote their creative talents to making even more music.  (No - I don't work in the music industry in any way.  I just want to at least support the artists that make the music I want to hear.)

Conversely,  went down to Best Buy purchase a iPod nano and was down loading songs from iTunes in under 2 minutes.  Microsoft's Zune, a failure so great Microsoft is still struggling to sell models from last year at fire sale prices.    (BUY AN IPOD OR SANDISK MP3 PLAYER)

<Title>The Ideal Player for The Real Music Lover
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a apple guy, work hours in front of the fanciest G5's everyday,  I also happen to be in the music business and of course a music fanatic 24/7 specially good music... which of course is not what you'll find at the I tunes store or any mainstream site, Anyway the reason why I went for the zune was not only the hard drive capabilities but the great deal that zune marketplace offers, let me be specific: while on I tunes you pay from $0.99 to $1.99 per song you will get unlimited absolutely legal downloads for something less that $15.00 a month now that is a great deal for someone like me that will spend half salary hitting the record stores, now; every-time I see a record I like, I write down the title and just go to the marketplace and get it. I got the 30 GB full now I'm getting an 80, I cannot stop loving my zune, if you really into music don't just go for the easier option.

<Title>Best Bang for you dollar player
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my zune yesterday and had enough time to play around on it and I conclude that this is the best player on the market today. The only player that comes close is the i-pod touch but the larger capacity,the screen and radio was the deal breaker for me. Set up was easy (I was installed the software 3 weeks before, so I had more time to arrange play lists etc). Sound quality was outstanding and the sharpness of the screen surprised me.  Setting up wireless was simple and fast. My only recommendation is that there is future support for avi files and possibly a volume control on the earphone string, instead of having to reach inside my pocket and take out the zune to adjust volume.  Other than that excellent product from M$. (If only they put this same effort and care into their 360 console).

<Title>Bad idea
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is not a bad music player, but for what you're paying, you're better off getting an iPod. I don't want to get into the depth other reviewers have, so I'll keep it short: Zune Marketplace is awkward and annoying to use, there's a huge lack of third-party support (accessories, etc.), wifi is too draining on the battery to be practical, navigation pad is far inferior to the click wheel, radio is far inferior to portable radio quality. Plus, games, TV, etc. are not supported by Zune marketplace. The iPod isn't perfect, but if you're looking to part with this much money, you'd best choose the iPod. It outclasses the Zune in every category.

<Title>Zune is NOT an Audible or Public Library friendly device.
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Fortunately my local public library system has tons of audiobooks and audiomusic in CD format, so I just place hold, and then burn them in the lossless format for audiomusic and 192 bits non-protected WMA for audiobooks. It would be nice if I can download instantly from OverDrive or Recorded Books my public library provides free of charge for 21 days as DRM WMA.   But, alas, unlike Googles', Micro$ofts' corporate moto is not "Do No Evil", but rather "Do Profit at any Cost".  Apple Ipod wasn't library friendly either, by not supporting DRM WMA, but Creatuve Zen Vision M was. Unfortunately Zune 80GB is slimer and better build than Zen Vision M 60GB. And I am not into flash players yet due to their 32 GB max size.  So while I am keeping using Zune, I am not spending a single penny on Microsoft marketplace due to their unethical behavior in the following:  1) Not supporting non-Microsoft DRM WMA format (And Yes they could've removed the option of wireless transmission of the non-Microsoft DRM WMA to other devises if copyright restriction, rather than bottom line, was the problem)  2) Not supporting audible format  ( Audible wants it, Microsoft not even if it doesn't sell audiobooks of its own)  I also do not appreciate that Microsoft not integrated the player with WMP 11, removed equalizer, has painfully slow speeds of transmission through WiFi of a song to another device, doesn't allow listening of a song in the same time while it synchs through WiFi or transmits through WiFi, and lacks bookmark feature. While that can be a technical problem for the first zune, it could've been solved for the second generation.  And yes I have to give kudos to Microsoft for allowing free upgrade of 1st generation players. But that (as "Hello from Seattle" cuteness) is not enought to clear their name as an unscrupulous, money-hungry company.    As some bloggers remarked "they wish they can love their Zune" but they can only "like them", as creators of these devices appear to not have hearts or feelings, just a zombie-like drive to make more money. As hard as I try (I live in Seattle and I have many friends working for Microsoft), both Zune and Microsoft, due to their overtly shrewd production & marketing, are utterly unlovable.

<Title>Getting There
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all this device is not perfect but none of the high capacity players are... but I think this one is the best so far.  Software sucks. Player and interface is better than the iPod. Screen for video and navigating... better than the iPod. They removed the equalizer feature on the 80Gb player compared to the original Zune... dumb move but the sound quality is still great.  FYI if you get one of these put on some high quality headphones and navigate through the menus. Do you hear buzzing? If you do take it back/return it and get new ones until you find one that does not buzz (my second one does not buzz). It was really annoying and NOT something you'd expect from an expensive media player.  Like I said not perfect but probably the best high capacity player on the market right now. P.S. Xmas 07 Staples has them for $199 and so does Target. Happy listening.

<Title>MP3 Player is great
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for about two weeks and I am very happy with it.  The player is a good size and weight, the screen is beautiful, headphones are great and sound quality is excellent.  The zunepad is also really cool and once you get the hang of it really makes browsing a breeze.  My only complaint would be Zune's marketplace is a sort of buggy but I am sure that will normalize with time.  Microsoft has to be losing money on this player because the features are vast and the quality is superb.  Take advantage of their war tactics and get a really nice MP3 player below cost.

<Title>1 star is too good for microsoft zune
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very unhappy with my well thought out decision to purchase a zune. When I buy a product, I want a product that does what it says with no strings attatched.  For example: Buy a media player...take it out of the box...hmm looks good...load and play mp3's. I am a happy customer. Not so with microsoft zune.  To even use the zune after you open it up, you MUST connect to the internet and download software! This immediately annoyed me because when you pay $250 for a mp3 player it should work out of the box/or have software included. Does anybody disagree with this? So, while feeling violated as a consumer, I begin downloading the appropriate software from the zune site. 38mb on dial-up. Hours later, still without 1 song on my new mp3 player I finish my download. Click setup....now I must first update windows to install the software for my $250 mp3 player.  Apparently ms is not happy until they complete a full cavity search. No thanks. Sending it back. This consumer will look elsewhere. If there is no acceptable alternative then I will do without. At least I used amazon who I have never had a problem with.

<Title>ATROCIOUS!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>WOW!!! - I've just followed every therapist's advice and took my 5 minutes of "WALKING AWAY".  I'm trying to write this as calmly as I can... Let's just say that Microsoft & Zune have destroyed my Christmas Day!!! - THIS PRODUCT IS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE IN EVERY ASPECT POSSIBLE.  ISSUES:  1) YOU CANNOT PLAY YOUR FILES FROM THE ZUNE ON YOUR COMPUTER!!! WHAT?!? - HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? - The Zune I got is an 80GB device & my hard disk space on my computer is also 80GB.  If I'm at home & want to listen to music from the Zune... I CAN'T DO IT!  I'd have to import the songs from the Zune back to my computer's hard disk!!! - Is it just me? Am I the ONLY person who would like to playback from the mp3 player on the computer?  With an iPOD you connect it, iTUNES opens up, you see the device, and you can play what's IN YOUR DEVICE.  Not with Zune.  This device is meant to be loaded with whatever media and to be used on-the-go.  2) CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A SCARRING NIGHTMARE.  You'd think that Microsoft makes enough income to not have to outsource something as important as their customer service support; but no!!! - I called the Zune support line at 9:00 A.M. on Christmas Day and got off the phone at 10:22 A.M., Along the way, I spoke with three people and we went through every possible way of dealing with this issue.  The problem is that the customer service personnel don't understand fluent English very well and one has to slow things down, use simple words, and explain each issue in a child's way.  Trust me folks, I work with people from India and I am a trilingual person (Born in Italy, raised in Puerto Rico, and married to a Peruvian lady); I am also a special education teacher and my job description requires extreme degrees of patience.  I called, spoke simple terminology, spoke slowly, and was highly polite. THEY STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLE ISSUE OF WANTING TO PLAY WHAT'S IN THE ZUNE ON MY CPU.  We edited the software, renamed files, entered the software as a "guest"... and every step of the way, the associate kept being surprised by the outcome.  I was put on hold in 8 INSTANCES and finally when I asked for the supervisor, a "LEVEL 2" person got on he phone and told me that the only way to play back from the Zune on my computer is to import the files from the Zune back to the computer!?!  After a few minutes of getting off the phone, I called back to ask if maybe Windows Media Player could play back what's on the Zune.  After another 25 minutes and being put on hold 2 more times, the answer was "NO".   IN CONCLUSION:  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR MUSIC ON YOUR PC OR IF YOU DON'T MIND PERFORMING 15 STEPS TO GET YOUR MUSIC BACK ONTO YOUR HARD DISK, GET THIS DEVICE.  IF THIS IS NOT YOU, THEN GET AN iPod AND STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DEVICE.  ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS FOLKS!!!

<Title>Can't stop playing with it!
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have scoured the reviews on Amazon for months trying to decide between an iPod and a Zune. The closest I've come to an mp3 player was a WALKMAN cell phone...so this was a big deal for me. After spending the last few weeks trying to load my cd collection into my computer....today was the day! I can honestly say, I have not stopped playing with my Zune all day (and I'm 44!). It's one of those things that you don't know how you lived without it once you get it in your hands. I work in a job where I wear headphones all day, so this is wonderful.  I can listen to years of music I've collected and forgotten about. The main reason I chose the Zune is for the radio and the screen size. Remember the days when you took pictures and actually had photos to share (I put everything on the computer and burn to cd to watch on the dvd player)? I can now share my photos with others on a screen large enough to see.  As far as the sound quality, I haven't much to compare it with but feel it sounds just fine. For anyone who is still undecided, take the time to read the reviews on Amazon. I do it for any major purchase I make now.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have an Ipod (2nd Gen) and a Sansa also, and the Zune is my favorite of the three (I do love my Sansa though).  The new 80GB Zune is not as bulky as the 30GB, but it is still not tiny by any means.  The screen is crisp and clear, and the touch pad works very nicely.  So far this is the easiest to use MP3 player I have ever owned.  The Zune Marketplace is also very nice and easy to use.  My only real complaint is that the wireless will not work on my computer without first having to close the Zune program, end the Zune tasks (in Task manager), and restart the services.  Simply rebooting doesn't work for me for some reason.  Looking online, it seems to be a common issue.  I was also worried about it not having an equalizer, but it turns out that the sound quality is excellent without it.  The earphones that come with it are decent, but like others have said, if the wires rub on something they will resonate in your ears.  I ended up buying me some Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 pros (which are AWESOME!).  I have had a little trouble finding a case that I like since the 80GB is a little newer.  I've had my Zune for a couple of weeks now and I still cannot put it down.  I love this thing!  Pros:  large display, easy to use scroll pad, huge hard drive, great sound quality, Zune Marketplace is very nice  Cons:  Wireless a little difficult to use (for me), no equalizer

<Title>The best present I ever gave!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My husband absolutely loves his Zune.  He has yet to fill it, but probably will over time.  We were a bit disappointed and surprised that our media player didn't recognize it like it does our other players.  But then when we opened the zune program, all of the music in our library was already there!  It was easy to drag and drop to sync and fast.  The scroll to see the music is easy and fast.  The playlists are easy and he can select to randomly play everything or just one artist or one album or create his own list very easily all from the zune.  It sounds great.  Pictures look great and were large enough for us to share them with family when we visited.  Maybe someone who has a lot of i-tunes music wouldn't want to make the switch I don't know how that works, but we have had no problems with the cds already in our computer.  We have downloaded a few songs from Amazon and they worked just fine.  I didn't want to get trapped in the i-tunes and a lot of users had complained that it was slow to scroll through their large i-pods.  The zune is fast and durable and my dh expects to enjoy it for a very long time.

<Title>This is The Funnest Mp3 that i have used even better than ipod!
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>READ MY REVIEW IT COMPARES THE ZUNE 80 AND IPOD CLASSIC I HAVE BOTH! I love my Zune 80gb because of all the features it has.  The big beautiful screen is a big plus. i have the ipod classic aswell and the video quality is about 10x better on the zune and clarity is much nicer as well. The user interface is very nice and slick. Even my mom had an easy time figuring out house to use this because of the simpleness. The Sound quality byfar surpasses the ipod classic i don't know if it has to do with the premium earphones or with the devices themselves. Even without an equalizer i Love the quality of music in the zune. Whats really Fun was sharing music with my friends in school. I found i liked new music and it's so cool because it's a way to discover new music. I also love the storage i mean 80gb is alot i have about 30movies so far in both my zune and ipod but i much rather watch movies on the zune and use the zune. Pictures look great. Zune 80gb Pros -Big Beautiful Glass Screen(Has No scratches to date)  -User Interface with Big Letters is Beautiful  -Thin Sleek design compared to Zune 30gb  -I feel that the Zune beats the Ipod in Outer Design because The Zune is very sleek in Design and Has No Scratches Whatsoever and I've had it for a month. And The Ipod is Nice But Scratches so Easily you always have to keep in case which, makes the ipod thicker and less sleek.  -Zune Pad- you can scroll or click whatever you want it's really fun to use.  -Podcast Support  -Headphones are very Excellent quality and never get tangled!  -You can play movies through the headphone jack unlike the ipod where you have to buy a dock and special connections which are very pricey.  -Wirelessly Send Pictures, Podcasts, and Music(even though for songs you can only play them 3x i really find this a cool feature because you get to discover new music first and then download the song or songs if you really like them.)  Neutral things about the Zune The Software- for me i Had no Problem puting all my music a collection of 4,000 songs and 30 movies onto my zune-because all of my music was already organized on my ipod so all i did was used the music on my ipod and transfered everything from my ipod to the zune software. Even Though the Music From the Ipod was all coded from Apple-the Zune software had every single song organized and for me it was so easy. Only about the 20 songs i Purchased from itunes did not go in the Zune but thats okay.  The reason i give the software a neutral review is because adding new music and organizing the songs in the Zune Software can be pretty tough say if you got your music from somewhere besides the Zune Marketplace. It's doable but alittle frustrating. Even though the Software is not perfect i still love my zune 80. -Battery life is Great, but Ipod Battery last a little longer.   Zune Cons -Does not have extras like Watch timer and Games, i miss these from the ipod. and that's about all i miss.

<Title>The ipod Killer
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune first caught my eye upon its inception a few years back. I saw a display in an electronics store, and the smooth video really caught my eye. The subsequent reviews made me hold off, but when the 80GB generation 2 version was released, I wanted one instantly. The interface is super intuitive, the sound and video are superb, and the asthetics are superb. The headphones are excellent as buds go, but it would behove you to rip your own music with settings to match them (a bit fat) for optimum sound quality rather than relying on downloaded MP3s and WMAs, unless you tweak them. This is a tiny complaint, and would be an issue with any ear buds, as compares to actual headphones. I have a pair of backphones I use occasionally on the Zune, and they sound fabulous.  I bought my sister one, and we use the wireless file sharing all the time. It's an awesome feature, as is the wireless sync (I have my work computer downloading podcasts in the evenings, and when I walk in the door, it automatically syncs them to my Zune while I'm working - too cool...). I'll be getting my girlfriend one soon (happy birthday honey...).  HIGHLY recommended... :)

<Content>I ordered this Zune for a gift for my husband for christmas, I have purchased other Media players in the past for him that he did not like because they were not user friendly and were hard to upload the music to. He loves the Zune, it's easy to use, easy to upload music to, easy to share music with other people that have a Zune. It also has the capability to listen to the radio which works great at the gym when you have to tune into certain radio stations to be able to watch the TV's there. This is a great product, I almost hate to say it but I have a video Ipod and I'm thinking about switching to a Zune.

<Content>i purchased the zune 80gb ver2.0 in Dec08,the pricing from Amazon was jus great, but i am not to pleased with the claims made by MICROSOFT abt the product, due to following reasons-a.battery life both standby and playing is far too less than actual- it is jus abt 8-9hrs of audio playing time and 3-4hrs for video, b.navigation is not smooth, the software is too one dimesion,it is too rigid following one set of forward and backward movements,c.Since i am using it in a hot and humid weather conditions the player may be not performing upto mark.Anyway i will be using it and keep posting

<Title>What I expect
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are looking for a digital media device that functions like it should then this is the one.  The Zune was easy to set up and the function has met or exceeded my expectations. I bought 3 IPOD nanos for my kids last year and found the design to be less than satisfactory. I decided to try the new 80 gig Zune this year. I bought 2 and I must say the Zune is ten times better than the IPODS. The software works like it should. The Zune navigation works like it should, I hated the Ipod wheel this is twice as easy. The graphics and the 3 inch screen are great. The kids love the radio function. Now Zune just needs to get manufactures to make more accessories for it.   The only thing that stumped me for just a couple seconds was changing the settings to find my sons music folder but that was solved with the help feature.

<Title>Zoom for the Zune!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the 80gb Zune for Christmas and love it! I have been doing all the necessary downloads so I can begin transferring music.  After reading some reviews, I don't know what the big deal is about downloading the Zune software.  Laziness or lack of research on the product may be the answer.  I have read both booklets that come with the product and followed everything to a "t"....and guess what!?! Everything seems fine if you follow directions.  It's sleek new look makes it very attractive, the glass screen is also nice (i'm gonna buy a plastic cover though).  It's easy to use and I love the large screen.  It's still new to me, so I'm learning a lot about the Zune, but so far, I can't put it down!

<Title>Just one GRIPE... Doesn't support DivX/XviD playback!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everything about this thing is GREAT! But it really lags behind in MEDIA SUPPORT!  I mean COME ON! It can play almost every video format, including iPod MP4's, MPEG-4's and M4A's... BUT NOT DivX/XviD?! CREATIVE's ZEN's play DivX/XviD videos! But other than that, this think is PERFECT! I got it for Christmas, so that was awesome... DIDN'T have to pay for it. But yeah!  Besides the fact that is not the way of the future because of the lack of DivX/XviD playback, it will still continue to thrive in the social era!  So, about a 3.5 out of 5 for me... Yes, because of the lack of DivX/XviD playback... YES! That is the reason... Otherwise it'd be a full 5 Stars!

<Title>Zune 80 a great mp3 player but needs some finesse
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own 6 iPods, an iRiver Clix 2 and now a Zune 80 and here is what I think of the Zune after one week.  Pros  	Navigation with twist interface much better than the interface on the new iPod nano's and iPod classic. I can't stand the split screen. 	Brushed aluminum back: This is one of the best features, I own 6 iPods and I scratched every single one of them within 15 minutes of taking them out of the box and I baby my electronics! 	Glass screen: another plus, all my iPods(save my iPod touch) I have scratched the screen within a week or so of owning them. 	Zune pad: I love tactile feedback, my iPod touch is frustrating sometimes because it attracts smudges and fingerprints with all the "touching". I also love being able to swipe to change a song or menu on the Zune. 	Stock ear buds that are actually worth keeping/using 	Wireless syncing was easy to setup and use but I seriously doubt I will ever use it.  	 Cons 	Build quality is nowhere near the iPod. The Zune 80 feels toy like. 	My Zune has frozen during use 3 times in the 5 days I have owned it which required a reboot( ala holding the back button down while pressing up on the Zune pad) 	Zune software installation process. On Vista Home premium it took me over an hour to get the software installed(I work in the IT Field so this should have been a no brainer). Another hour to figure out how to get all my album art to show up on Zune 80(Erase all content and resync device after rebooting computer).  	Zune marketplace software has been dumbed down way too much. Microsoft could have just cloned iTunes and it would look better and be a lot better laid out/organized.  	Wifi sharing: I think it will be many years if ever that I find another person with a Zune that I can/want to "squirt" a song to. 	Only works with Windows. Thankfully I now have a Intel Mac and am able to run Vista in Bootcamp. Before when I only had a Powerpc Mac I had to admire from afar.  If they made the Zune cross platform I have a feeling more people would try them out.   In closing I enjoy the Zune 80GB and its interface over the new iPod Nano and iPod Classic, however it could use more advanced settings options, an equalizer, and the video playback needs some tweaking(When a video ends on the Zune it doesn't do anything. On the iPod it kicks you back to the video menu.)

<Content>Shipping was very fast for the product. Music quality is very good and the big 3.2 in screen looks amazing. Glass certainly beats plastic. The included earphones work pretty well and the FM radio feature is really nice. The big letters of the main menu look great and its handy how you can set your own wallpaper unlike the ipod. Zune defeats the ipod classic hands down

<Title>Simply the best.

<Content>The 80GB Zune is very easy to install, software, sync and navigate. I've owned various Ipods & Creative Labs MP3 players and the Zune is by far the best. Most importantly the sound quality blows the Ipod touch away. Another reason to buy this over the Ipod is that it easily syncs with Mp3's and doesn't change the file type using up tons of hard drive space like Itunes does. I'm blown away by this player.

<Content>Before purchasing the new Microsoft Zune 80 gig, I was very skeptical. For me, I had to decide between: Apple's Ipod, Creative Zen, or Microsoft's Zune. I've lived with Apple my whole life. All of my computers have been Apple as well as my mp3 players. I decided on a Zune after seeing my friend have one. Best decision I have made. Superb player against the Ipod. Watch out Apple.

<Title>The best Portable Media Player available today
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I refuse to buy an iPod. Thusly, I have owned a Sony ATRAC player that was built like a brick outhouse. Excellent machine. Problem was, B&W screen, no album art, no photo storage and no video. The unit cost me $249, but the sound was absolutely incredible.  But I wanted more. I saw the iPods as cheap, over priced and becoming a status symbol. I am not a lamb being led to slaughter. I am a non-comformist and just had to wait for the right machine to come along.  Well, the right, nay, the (almost)perfect machine finally did arrive.  The Zune 80GB finally sent my Sony player into oblivion and freed me from the iPod flock of vagabond zombies.  The Zune 80 is "ALMOST" perfect. The touch pad is a marvel of engineering. The fact that you can press and click or glide your finger over it is amazing. The navigation on the unit is smoooth and the color excellent. The GLASS screen and metal casing clearly place this unit in the upper crust of media players. Very, very elegant. The earphones are better than most I have purchased separatley (I paid $39 for a set of Sony earphones. Sound quality was excellent but the sheathing on the cords disintigrated within a few days of use. I will never by Sony earphones again). The Zune earphones are also "classy". Black in color with CLOTH sheathing. The unit comes with FOUR sizes of ear buds. And the earpieces attach to each other via built in magnets. Excellent!  The unit is rather large compared to many other players, but damn, that gorgeous screen is worth it! I made a promotional slide show using ProShow Producer, which just happens to also support video directly to the Zune. The slide show, placed in the video section of the unit works flawlesly. As a photographer, I am in love with the unit as I can now show people video slide shows of my work (portable portfolio). Yay!!!  CD's are a breeze to transfer. Not only that, you can have a guest on your machine as well. I was so impressed with this machine that I got one for my wife as well for Xmas. Her Zune 80 is on the desktop computer, mine is on my laptop. I can go to the desktop and her account will log me in as a "guest" and allow me to download anything from her account into my Zune. She can do the same with her Zune on my laptop. That is soooo cool!  I also noticed that the machine will go into automatic pause if the earphones are withdrawn while the unit is playing. The unit actually senses when you remove the earphones. Hmmmm.... I wonder why?   And if that is not enough, it also has a built in FM radio which you can also preset. RAD!  To say I am impressed with this unit is an understatement, However, I did say the unit was "ALMOST" perfect. Here are the drawbacks.  1- The unit has no controls to adjust the sound. Maybe I want a deeper bass or higher trebles. No such luck! Microsoft really needs to add an equalizer to this thing. Maybe in a future software update.  2-Third party accessories are practically non-existant. Try getting a case made exclusively for the Zune 80. I bought two cases and they were too big. I found out that the Zune 30 will fit them but the Zune 80 is just a smidgen too small. And the cases, when you look at the descriptions, only say "Case for Zune". I found one arm band  provied by iArmbands (sold on Amazon) that fit the Zune 80 perfect. It's inexpensive and it is surprisingly nice. The other case is provided by MIcrosoft. I got that one for my wife and although it is of excellent build and quality, it works like a wallet in that it covers the screen and has absolutely no belt clip nor strap. All you can do is stick it in your pocket or purse.  3- The next item is the absence of a clock. I would really love to see a clock at the bottom of the screen next to the battery meter.  4- Lastly, no consumer replaceable battery. I'm kind of leary on this one. I wonder how much it will cost to get the battery replaced once it goes udders up.  Other than these items, the machine is to die for. Get it, get it, GET IT ALREADY!!! You will not be dissapointed. This is about the best investment you will ever make in a Portable Media Player, hands down beats the iPods. Which brings up another point.  How can any sane person buy an iPod touch over the Zune? The iPod touch, lets see. You smudge the screen when you touch it versus the Zune with the touch pad. The iPod touch is 16 GB while the Zune 80 is well, 80 GB. The iPod touch is currently selling for $150.00 MORE than the Zune. To those that bought the iPod touch... are you insane? It's just a stripped down iPhone!  Either way, the Zune 80 is the way to go. You will not regret getting it. Review by: Koa www.myspace.com/borikenwarrior

Some user gave detail description about the problem, i dont want to repeat their report.  I only want to conclude that the software is very poorly made.  The developer only need to try sync few Albums & audiobooks, not difficult to find how non user friendly it is.   Please.... Microsoft, you can do better than this.  I hate to see ipod is the only choice in market.  MSFT has flocks of smart guy there.  Do something.  Give us a good software and user will stick with you

<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was a bit skeptical about buying the new Zune, after hearing "The software sucks" "get an iPod", but I decided to go ahead and buy it. I must say that the user interface on Zune is great, the Zune pad is easy to use and the organization is great. I'm glad that the size has been shrunken some, that was my biggest turn off for the original Zune.  I love the bigger screen compared to my old iPods, the glass is very sleek, and the picture quality is beautiful. I'm not good at making reviews but this product is not crap, it's pretty damn good. The software is ok, it's better than using iTunes. One thing I wish they would put in the software is the option to edit your files in it. I cannot change edit file properties when in the Zune software, I have to edit them from my music, video, and pictures folder, which is a pain when it's being displayed right in front of you.  So far it's been an excellent iPod replacement. The premium zune headsets are great, the bass in these things are sweet, and comfortable. Hopefully this player will last longer than my old 5th Generation 30GB iPod.

<Content>I've had ipods since it's 2nd generation, and just bought a zune. It's a great mp3 player, the only one i've ever used that is even comparable to the ipod. The touchpad is fantastic and can scroll much quicker than the ipod's circle, the ui is prettier, and the screen is twice the size.  The ipod classic 80 gb competitor is a fantastic mp3 player, but the zune is the only one that gives it a run for its money.  Also, Zune media runs much better on a pc than itunes does.

<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm not going to repeat what has already been said about the hardware and software. The new Zune is simply a well-designed device. There have been a few hiccups, but that is to be expected with such a complicated device. I'm sure future firmware updates will resolve those minor issues.  The greatest thing about the Zune is the features that I just stumble across. First, I ordered a dock just so that my Zune would automatically sync wirelessly with my computer, and discovered that I could control my Zune with my Logitech Harmony remote when it was docked. Awesome. Second, I connected the Zune to my Xbox 360 via the sync cable, and it connected seamlessly with the 360 interface. Now I wish I had a new Ford so that I could test it out with the new Sync system.

<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, Ive owned a 30gb ipod video, and my dad owns a 80 gb classic. But now that i own this zune, i will never go back. Im 18 and have about 60gb of music, so i was looking to upgrade me 30, but i didnt really like the 80classic my dad had, so i looked elsewhere.  Apperence/feel: I was very surprised on how solid this thing felt, the glass screen, the sturdy back. Everything looks sleek and well built. The only gripe i have about it is that the top wireless piece feels a little loose, but that could just be mine.  Interface: The whole user interface is great. its easy to learn, and works very well.   Battery life: The battery life is relitivly low in comparison to the ipod classic, averaging at about 20 hours for music and about 4 for videos.   Comparison: Well, with just about everything, the zune does out-do the ipod, the look, feel, and overall performance truely is a unique experience. The one thing i will give apple, is that the marketplace of itunes does still kick the crap out of the zune marketplace, though i will admitt, the zune market is quickly adding more podcasts and such, so that is a good thing to see and hopefully it will soon be as versatile as itunes.  I think this media player is superior to apple ipod, though it still has room to improve. honestly i give this product a 4.5/5 but ill give it the benefit. highly recomend

It works great.  It is an excellant alternative to an Ipod.  I would recommend to anyone (in fact, already have). I love the zune software. Very easy to use; just drag and drop.  It's also easy to subscribe to your audio and video podcasts, and with the wireless sync you know it will be ready for you at a moment's notice. The biggest disappointment is the somewhat limited accessories for it, but given its newness, I'm sure that will soon change. Try it out, you won't be disappointed.

<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I loved my new Zune.  Great interface.  Not an Ipod.     I ripped and dumped about 40 GB of music onto it.     Then I went and deleted some of the stuff I ripped from my computer Hard Drive. And I realized that my Zune did the same thing.   Turns out that the Zune will only hold anything that you also keep on your computer.   There are some stupid workarounds, but they defeat the purpose of the device.    So, if you have enough harddrive space to devote to 80GB of Zune material and anything else you wish to also have on your computer, then buy one.   Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere or realize that you'll have to invest in a new hard drive.  Me, I'm going to see if I can take mine back.  It's a shame because I loved everything else about it.

<Title>Goodbye Apple
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 80 is fabulous.  I formerly had a Creative Zen Touch until I bought one of these under recommendation from a friend.  STOCK EARBUDS: Immediately right out of the box, you notice that the headphones are much more attractive than the iPods.  They sound like crap until you find the right tips with them (once you can get a seal they sound 500x better).  It all depends on the size of your ear canal.  A few things I liked about them over the iPod stock earbuds was that the wire was covered by a nice woven thread-like sleeve thing that made them easier and more durable when they are wrapped around your Zune.  Also, the ends of the earbuds are magnetic so you can stick them to your Zune when they are not in use, or you can wrap them up in a ball and stick the two earbuds together with the magnet to hold them together and take up less clutter and get tangled less.  COMPATIBILITY WITH VISTA: Immediately after I plugged the Zune into my usb port, it detected the Zune and installed the driver for it.  Very nice and easy to get up and running.  Definitely 100% compatible with Vista.  ZUNE SOFTWARE: Somewhat clunky and difficult to use at first.  I have no complaints with the software because I turned off certain options. Here are my tips for new users:  1. Tag your MP3's (ID3) before you add them to your Zune's library.  MP3tag (google it) is very useful for doing batch tagging.  Doing this before you sync the first time is my recommendation, it alleviates a lot of frustrations in the future.  2. Don't use the Zune software to rip cd's to your library.  Use Windows Media Player, and make sure it is set to encode it at 192kbps.  If you use different software (I use ExactAudioCopy to rip to V0/320 depending on the genre/cd), set it up accordingly.  3. Update Windows before you install the Zune software.  Believe me, it helps.  4. Turn off the "automatically update album art" option in the Zune software's settings.  This usually will put the wrong album art on the wrong albums.  Google missing album art and look for album art with high-resolution.  High-resolution album art looks amazing on the Zune's screen, and also it will look less ugly because of JPG artifacts.  Find the missing album art before you sync it to your Zune.  If you don't and you update the album art, you will have to delete it from your Zune in the device menu and resync it to update the album art.  This also holds true for tags and stuff as well.  5. Configure the Zune software's syncing options so it will let you choose for all of your media types.   6. Tagging audiobooks as podcasts will let you resume it in the middle, which is pretty much equivalent to having a bookmark where you left off :)  7. The Zune's video format is MPEG-4.  Use a video converter (I use Cucusoft Ultimate Video Converter Suite) to convert your dvd's to MP4 files to use on your Zune :D Also, I hear complaints about no drag&drop support.  This is a load of crap because you can just drag an album onto the device icon in the Zune software, and it will add it on the end of your Now Syncing list.  No longer do you have to wait for the software/Windows to finish syncing one album before manually syncing the next one...you can do it all at once.   ZUNE USER INTERFACE: It is sexy.  It is simple.  It is effective.  You can change the background.  The album art is very big and sexy.  The touch pad is very precise and fun (you will master it after a few hours of use).  I don't really like how playlists work, but it is easy enough to go from album to album that I don't really bother with it.  You can wirelessly sync to your PC, and it is very nice.  One thing I dont like is being unable to edit tags and being able to delete albums on your player (you have to use the software for that).  Other than that, it is easy to use and nice.  AUDIO & SOUND QUALITY: With my current headphones (a pair of UE Super-fi's), I can hear the difference between 192kbps bitrates, V0 (VBR), and 320kbps bitrates.  It is superb and far better than the sound drivers of the iPod.  The only problem is they removed the EQ feature, so it is a little bit more difficult adjusting high priced headphones to your liking depending on the genres of music you listen to.  On my super-fi's though, it sounds FANTASTIC.  Love it.  I only wish it had FLAC support though :(  As for methods of downloading music, you can do a subscription based music purchasing plan for 15$, and download all the music you want, or you can purchase albums individually.  One step ahead of iTunes store already.  THE TOUCH PAD: It's basically a 360 degree version of the Zen's touch pad (minus the huge sensitivity of it), and a D-pad from a Nintendo controller combined.  It has something for everyone, its precise, and its fun going to your album list and swiping it down to see what you are going to land on (think like a slot machine :D).  God this beats the iPod's steering wheel any day.  THE ZUNE ITSELF: The back is literally unscratchable, I've had mine since Christmas and I don't have a single scratch on the screen or the back.  The soft rubber-like material used around the touch pad and the buttons has a few scuffs on it though.  There aren't really any good cases for the Zune 80 yet, so be careful with it (there is no ToughSkin case for the 80...ARGH!!).  I have read about many people who have deliberately attempted to break their Zune by throwing it at walls and failed.  That is how strong this thing is.  The only vulnerable part I see is the screen and perhaps the face buttons (they are sort of flimsy on mine).  EXTRA FEATURES: The wireless sync is pretty nice and is handy when you dont feel like untangling cords/seeking out your cord.  Unfortunately it is a lot slower when doing transfers though.  The social feature is interesting but I haven't really tried to use it much recently.  As for people complaining about the Zune not doubling as an external hard drive, there is a registry hack you can find on the forums at zunescene.com that can fix that.  Just make sure you use the hack after you install the Zune software though.  A note about the hack though: media files you add via the external hard drive method and not the software will not show up on your player in the Zune software.  Just a forewarning :)  Honestly I love my Zune, it is far better than the iPod and it is GREAT for just about everything you could ever want from a portable media hard-drive based mp3 player.  You can't get a better mp3 player at this price.  The iPod's reign as the best & most affordable mp3 player on the market is going to be over soon.  Do yourself a favor and check this thing out before you go and buy the newest iPod on the market.  You won't ever go back.

<Content>I have only had one other player before and it was a cheap MP3 player/flash drive.  So, naturally I was nervous about putting this much money into something.  After I received the player I was glad that I had chose to buy it.  I found the software as well as the player itself extremely easy to use.  I hope everyone else who buys this player finds it as great as I have.

<Title>Hardware 5 software 4
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this as a gift for Christmas and I have loved having it.  I've been able to listen to more music in the last three weeks than I have in the last year.  I carry it with me almost everywhere.  I cant imagine having so much music or so many pictures that 80 gb would be necessary but you never know.  At first I thought the screen size was overkill but you can see pictures and videos so well on it.  (Its great to be able to say, "Hey have you seen the latest pictures of my family?" and whip it out and show great pictures to someone thats big enough to be easily seen!)   The software isn't the greatest, but having said that it's not something that would turn me away from owning this player.  It would be nice to be able to manually enter the artist/genre if the player gets it wrong after downloading something, but again its just an annoyance, nothing more.

<Title>Device good - software questionable
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Looked long and hard at the Ipod and decided to go this route. Would be nice if more accessories were out for it. The device itself is great, and the included earbuds seem to be pretty nice as well (I'm no earphone expert though!). Software is OK, I have some problems getting album and artist info to stick, it seems like when it syncs it loses the changes I just spent 30 minutes typing in!! They should add a setting to allow the computer to override the device when there is differing information on one or the other. The only way I have found to do this is by erasing everything off the device and reloading it once I've made the changes. But this is a rare occurrence since it seems to track down album info on almost every CD I've ripped. No comment on the Zune Marketplace, haven't even tried it yet. Highly recommend this device, and the best part of it is you don't need to saddle your machine with Itunes!

<Content>I recently purchased a 30gig iPod which my wife confiscated. So, I decided to get an 80gig Zune for myself. I am so pleased that she took the iPod. While they are both great, the Zune has more features and is easier to navigate. Great Product!

<Title>Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Review
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a quality piece of gear.  The screen is gorgeous!  I have had a few minor issues with the software, but overall, it gets the job done.  It would be nice if the software had a "stop" button once you begin playing a song, but it only has a "pause" button.  The player itself has worked flawlessly and I especially enjoy having an FM radio which displays the RDDS data with call letters, song and artist and sometimes the station genre.  The player was roomy enough to rip my entire collection of cd's (approx. 300), many of my digital photographs and I haven't used half of the available space yet.  I also like that the software gives me the choice of a number of formats to rip cd's to.  The variable bit rate Windows Media format, at the highest bit rate, does a very nice job of preserving the full dynamic and frequency range of my jazz and classical cd's.  I don't care for the new Windows online store to purchase downloads as one has to go through the silly routine of buying credits and then using these credits for purchases instead of directly using one's credit card to pay for the downloads.  I haven't used the wireless feature yet, but it is nice to have just the same.  Not sure about the movie capabilities yet, but it doesn't appear to be compatible with the movie sites I have checked so far, but I haven't really pursued that aspect yet.  I bought it mainly as a music player and that it does very very well.  It even comes with a better-than-average pair of noise isolating ear phones.  Good job, Microsoft!!

<Content>I bounced between Zune and ipod when making my decision for which way to go.  I am so glad that I went with Zune.  It is sleek, lightweight and exceeded my expectations.  My new hobby is shopping Amazon for accessories!  There are lots of great cases, speakers, plugs, etc. that I have been buying.    I subscribed to a talk radio program that downloads automatically to my Zune every morning.  I ALWAYS have something interesting to listen to, on demand when I am available to hear it.  Zune is the greatest electronic gadget that I've purchased.

<Title>Problems with the Zune 80 gb
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've bought two of these--the first one I returned to Amazon because it was defective--the button didn't work at all, downloading took hours, and all in all, it was a nightmare.  So then I bought a second one, and it's defective too!!  The button works sporadically, but at least it downloaded the installation set-up from the website and installed my music and videos--so I thought it was a good one! But after only two weeks, the problems started. I have a friend who swears by the 30 gb Zune--so I know the problems aren't operator error since she has fits with my Zune too.  The good folks at Microsoft need to work on quality control....If I could give it less than one star, I'd do it.

Not only did they beat the retailer's price, they shipped directly and discretely to our house BEFORE Christmas. The product was in perfect condition and made the perfect Christmas present.

<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>PRO: Fantastic screen, nice interface, controls, good included earbuds.  CONS: MUST go through Zune software to put files on device, no drag-drop from Windows Explorer :(. Why they would not allow this device to be used as an external drive is beyond me, I bought assuming this was a standard feature. If I cannot find an easy hack I will be returning the device. There is just something wrong with having an 80gb HDD in my pocket that is only a quarter full. 60gb wasted? How aggravating, especially when I'm trying to figure out how to move project files between home and the office. C'mon Microsoft.

<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player is everything and more I'd hoped it would be. The screen is crystal clear and the sound is great. The user interface on the Zune itself is very creative, but at the same time very useful.  Microsoft did a great job with the touch pad also. Battery life for this player is good, but not the greatest (figuring the screen on this thing is huge, I can understand and deal with it).   Now to the computer software. I don't understand why everyone is hating it. I find it easy to use. So what if you have to use the "Zune" software to use the "Zune"... How people get hung up on this issue is beyond me.  I give this player all 5 stars because I have yet to find anything wrong with it that would make me wish I hadn't bought it.

<Title>Great improvements!
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm very impressed with the easy to use software.  It transfered 60 gigs from WMP to the Zune software and then synced without a hitch.  People complain that it will only accept DRM-free music, but I think that's a selling point!  When I pay for a song, I want to own it.  With the Zune, I can transfer my media to my PSP, PS3, Wii and my Sansa without any problems.   i-pods & i-tunes would NEVER provide this type of flexibility.    Oh, to the reviewer complaining that they're left with 60gigs of unused space, and feel it should be used as an external HDD????  I say buy some more music, otherwise buy an external HDD.  This device is targeted towards music, movies and other entertainment.

<Title>A Wonderful Machine
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As many people state at the start of their reviews, I will too. I had an iPod for several years and was never dissatisfied with its performance. Thus, the Zune had a lot to live up to in my eyes.  I believe that the program used on the computer in order to load music is perhaps the most important part of an mp3 player. After using iTunes for years, I knew what I wanted in the Zune program. I ALMOST got it. For the average user, I believe that the Zune program is flawless. It has a beautiful layout, has podcast subscriptions, mp3, m4a AND wma file compatibility, and functions well with the mp3 player. However I have a few complaints. I am an organization freak. I like to have all of my music in the genre that I believe it is, not that of the internet. So when I rip a CD I will change the information accordingly. With the Zune program it takes more time because (at least that I find) it is not possible to edit the information for multiple items at once. You can just type in each one by one, or go find the files and do it through properties on windows explorer. That is my biggest problem; there is a lack of ability when it comes to editing the information that songs have. As for syncing with the Zune, there is one weird thing that happens where it keeps "adding" the same group of songs every time I connect my Zune. I read another review in which the person had the same issue. It doesn't add the songs again, it simply says it does. Kind of strange.  Onto the player itself. First of all the controls are wonderful. At first I was curious if I would be annoyed at having to flick my thumb a bunch to find the artist I was looking for. This never has happened. It is force sensitive, meaning the faster I flick it the further it goes. Or, if I don't want to flick my thumb, I can simply hold down the pad in the direction I want to go, great idea. The interface in the Zune is great as well. There are functions that let you go to the artist of the song you are currently listening to and other little things that make navigating through it a little easier than the iPod. The screen is great for viewing pictures as well as watching video mainly because it is big. At least compared to the iPod's screen. Also when viewing pictures, there is a zoom option, which I do not believe the iPod has. The FM radio is a great little bonus. Just in case one ever wants to listen to their favorite talk show on the walk home, or anything such as that, it's there. I haven't used it much, but its reception and quality seem great to me.  Sound quality is something I have had no problem with, even without the EQ that was apparently on the original Zune. I rather dislike the quality of the in ear headphones that came with it, but I have my over ear phones, and it sounds wonderful through those. I have nothing to say about the "social" feature because no one I know owns a Zune. Hopefully they will gain popularity so I can try out the feature, however I don't think I would put it to much use, because the song only stays for 3 plays, which isn't saying much.  The Zune met and exceeded my expectation for it in many ways. Hopefully program bugs will get sorted out soon and maybe a little bit more functionality. Other than that I love the Zune player and will not stray from it any time soon.

<Title>Beats the stew out of the iPod Classic
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After going through at least seven iPods through generations 4-5.5 (out of hard drive failures) I was ready for a change when my last one broke.  I was also sick of the iTunes software; it's bloated, slow, and its usability is crippled under Vista x64 versions.  I was reticent in buying a Zune because of the poor reputation that the first gen Zunes received.  But, when I read about the second gen Zunes and finally saw them, I was sold.  The Zune 80GB is a beautiful device.  It's sturdy, sleek, and intuitive.  The screen real estate compared to the iPod Classic is phenomenal.  It has a nice glass screen instead of that cheap plastic that Apple has that with which you can push your finger down on and touch the display inside.  The UI of the device is what really shines.  The large geriatric text is simple, stylish, and equally a breeze to use. I love that you can change the background of the menu, I've already done it several times. The "squircle" Zune pad is also really nice, and works much more fluidly than the iPod scroll wheel, which is really lousy on the iPod Classic generation.   PROS: - good battery life - beautiful sturdy player built with quality materials - large glass screen - excellent UI and OS - Zune pad - included earbuds are MUCH better than the cheap ones included with the iPod; the sound quality is better and the physical quality also surpasses the iPod earbuds (plus you don't stick out in a crowd wearing them like the ubiquitous 'hip' white iPod ones) - software: intuitive, clean and beautiful.  I like the fact that when you add a folder to your music directory the Zune software immediately recognizes it and adds it to the library. I also admire that you can change the background of the software like you can on the actual Zune.  It sports as a decent media player on your desktop as well.  I've completely gotten rid of iTunes and have made it my default player.  CONS: - software: I also put the software here as a downside.  Microsoft made the software too simple.  They left out a lot of beneficial things such a meta data tag editing, and favorites.  I just use a free program called Media Monkey to edit my music, but it's a little gripe that I have with the Zune software that hopefully Microsoft will change. - lack of accessories: As other reviewers have said, hopefully this will change as the Zune gains a larger user base and other third party companies -- as well as Microsoft -- start releasing new materials.  I'd really like to find a decent FM transmitter for it. - hard drive space: I have a lot of music and with the release of the 160GB iPod Classic it was very tempting to opt out and purchase that, but as mentioned my Apple experience made me choose otherwise.  80GB just isn't enough for me.  I hope that Microsoft will release a larger sized Zune so that I can fit all of my music _and_ videos on there. - social: This isn't really a complaint against the zune or its software.  The whole "welcome to the social" thing is really cheesy and kind of impractical.  It's neat that you can send a nearby Zune a track, but being able to play it only 3 times is sort of lame.  Overall, I highly recommend the second generation Zunes over the iPod.  If you are betwixt the iPod Classic and the new Zune, I'd say make the Microsoft "switch" (see the irony in that) over to the Zune.  I don't think you'll regret it.

<Content>I have to say this second generation Zune is amazing, and with the new firmware update it fixes any small bugs there were that knocked some of the lower review scores you see in here.    The new Zune is great, it's 80gb, and is has a much better screen in Size, and quality "Glass", over the 80gb Ipizzy classic.  The screen, wireless connection/sharing, premium headphones included, etc. trump the 80gb Ipod easily.  Until apple makes an 80gb touch, this Zune in my opinion the best buy anyone can make in looking for a high quality performer, with a ton of space to work with!

<Title>The Zune Delivers
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So I obsessed over which player to purchase and evaluated the Ipod Classic and others of similar capacity and price. My desires were:  -$250 or less -big capacity to hold movies, podcasts, lots of songs, and pictures;  -no need to be small enough to clip on a shirt or shorts for jogging -big screen to watch stuff while on long flights or drives -FM radio -Wireless sync to my computer -high quality, comfortable headphones  I made the jump to the Zune because I had not owned an Ipod and was therefore not wedded to i-tunes or their interface...this was to be my first player.   Once I got this thing, all my research really paid off. I love every aspect of it and have not had one regret. The headphones are extremely comfortable and sound great compared to the ipods I've borrowed. I LOVE the massive screen...the images are clear and crisp and have very little blurring on action scenes. I have put EVERY picture and song I own on this thing and have more than 40 gigs available for movies. I automatically download and sync about 10 podcasts of news and reviews everyday. And when I'm bored with the content I have on the Zune, I turn on the FM tuner and listen to the radio. As you can tell, all in all I am very happy.  Other features I love: screen brightness can be dimmed to save battery; touch pad is way cool, though if cool is your primary objective, I guess you need to get the Iphone; photos are automatically organized by folder with the original folder names from my computer...makes it easy to show my family and friends pictures of my daughter last year, last month, Christmas '05...; music and podcasts display cool album art when you play the songs or scroll through; the Quicklist feature where you can add songs to a playlist (but there is only one quicklist, not a fully customizable feature).  Some things other people might NOT like: battery is good, but I don't think it lasts as long as they say; size: it is a bit bulky, but that's what you get for 80gigs...it's not any more bulky than other 80gig devices; wireless is NOT wireless internet...just syncing to your computer; doesn't load or play WAV format, although mine synced and played all my WMA songs automatically (some reviews I read indicated that it would not play this format, and I can't figure out why they said that...); no random playback feature; no clock.  Anyway, I hope this helps you. The Zune satisfied all my wants and desires. Anecdote: a friend just got his IPhone and was flaunting it in front of my face. While I think it's cool, I just wanted way more storage and for a lot less cash (I got my zune for 240 no tax no shipping from Amazon). I promptly told him that I could put 10 of his IPhones into my Zune. He chuckled and rolled his eyes. -bp

<Title>Great Value for the money
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the first portable media player I have I owned.  I cannot compare it to other models since I've never owned one before now. I did use a site that compared different models and their features. If you can find a non-bias site, I would recommend doing that instead of relying solely on user reviews.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_portable_media_players#Video_Formats  The Zune is very competitive with features.  I mainly chose the Zune due to the storage capacity and battery life.  If playing songs, the battery is suppose to last up to 26 hrs. The battery life for playing movies was more than the Creative Zen W.  (Zen and Archos were the 2 others I considered) I've owned mine now for about 2 weeks. I've been putting it to the test during those 2 weeks.  To be honest, I started to return it but now I'm glad I didn't.  I really like this device.  I like the look of it and the 'feel' of it.  The sound is great. Picture quality is great.  Even Ipod lovers have stated they're surprised at the quality of the pictures/videos/movies.  Be careful in believing everything you read or hear.  Even the Zune forums told me I should return the device if I wanted to delete media off of my hard drive.  This is not true. You can delete the media from your hard drive and still keep it on the Zune.  It is also not true that you cannot contact the Zune team via the telephone. There is a number listed on Zune.net under support.  I called Zune and they were very polite & helpful.  They instructed me on how to set the settings in the Zune software so I can now have media on my Zune but I don't have to keep it on my hard drive.  I will also be honest in stating I don't like the Zune software. I don't know what the first version was like but if it was worse than the new version, I'm glad I never experienced using it. I was disappointed to find out windows media player doesn't even recognize the Zune.  I still use the windows media player to rip music to my hard drive and play my music.  I just use the Zune software to sync up my Zune device. I didn't want to have 2 software programs but it's not that big of a deal.  It may be if you're running low on hard disk space. I would recommend calling the support number on zune.net for any questions you have before purchasing.  I didn't do this but from now on, I'm going direct to the source when I'm having trouble deciding on what to purchase.  One complaint I've seen a lot is that it seems you're forced to use the Zune Marketplace but this isn't true either.  I've purchased my music from Amazon, Walmart and even Itunes and it still works on the Zune.  I have yet to buy anything from the marketplace.  I have downloaded some podcasts from the Zune marketplace and they're free.  My niece has the 30gig Zune for over a year and has never even been to the site.  She didn't even know what the site had until I got mine and I emailed her from there.  She uses Limewire for her media content.  One of my friends keeps saying Ipod has more accessories but I'm not sure what they mean.  I've found all the accessories I need for my Zune.  You can get cases, home & car kits, speakers, etc for a Zune just like you can an Ipod.  Just search the net or even Ebay.    I believe choosing a media player comes down to personal preference in the end.  If you started out with an Ipod then more than likely you will always be an Ipod user. (even though I have seen reviews where Ipod lovers have switched to the Zune) I started with a Zune so if I tried to use an Ipod now, I probably wouldn't like it. If you've never owned a media player, then I highly recommend the Zune.  It's a great one to start out with in my opinion.  I got the 80gig Zune and the home a/v pack for what a 30gig Ipod, 30 gig Creative Zen or Archos would have cost me.  These others would have actually cost me more and I wouldn't have all the accessories I have now. I can't complain about the value for the money I paid.. If I try to get another brand, I won't find the storage capacity that the Zune has unless I pay more for it.    I am very satisfied with the Zune.  I didn't give it 5 stars being that I have nothing to compare it against and 3 stars just stated it was 'ok'.  It's more than ok in my opinion but it may not be  the 'best'.  I can't judge that snce I'm new to the portable media player world.

<Title>Thank you Microsoft! : )
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I originally thought that amazon had sent me two defective zunes, but after getting my replacement zune I called Microsoft and found out that the premium headphones were actually defective.  Microsoft is replacing them for no charge,  (if you hear noise through your headphones when the hard drive is spinning try another pair of headphones! If the problem goes away than just call Microsoft and get replacement headphones.)  Back to reviewing the Zune  Pros - -Easy to Sync and Update -AAC Support with more file types to come (supposidly) -Good Video support (WMV, MPEG-4, M4V) -Nice Clear Easy to read Screen -Built in Radio -Podcast Support  Cons -  -At this time it cannot be used as a storage drive (portable HDD), -No Ogg, FLAC, or APE Audio support -No search function on the Zune Device -No Audio book Support (yet) May be added in new Firmware -The zune software won't let you have albums with multiple artists   grouped as one album (Microsoft says this will be fixed in a software update ASAP) -If you don't have the same music on your computer and your zune you will not be able to play files off of your zune when it is connected to your PC.  Overall the Zune is a nice alternative to the ipod Classic 80GB. The software is brand new and needs IMPROVEMENT, but Microsoft's Tech dept. says that there will be a large update coming out soon with updates to both the Zune Software and the Zune Firmware.  Personally I can't wait.  If you buy a Zune I think you will enjoy it very much!

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought a Zune 80GB and a Zen VW.  I returned the Zen.  I came close to returning the Zune, but I am reluctantly keeping it for now because for the most part it does what I need.  I primarily bought the Zune for video and that is the focus of this review.   Here are some of the things I like about the Zune: 1.	The display is excellent.  When the Zune is placed next to the Zen VW, it is easy to tell that the Zune's display is far superior (Crisper picture and better colors) 2.	It has an aesthetic design and the device user interface is also very slick. 3.	80 GB is great especially for the low price.  The Zen VW only has 30GB and the price for other players with comparable capacity is much higher. 4.	The device menus respond quickly.  There is very little lag unlike some other players.  When you click a video it plays in under a second.  The Zen VW can take several seconds to respond. 5.	The case is compact and light weight as opposed to the Zen VW which is like a brick. 6.	The TV episode navigation on the device works very well if you go to the trouble to program the WMV metadata. 7.	The dock (optional) has component and composite output.  Without the dock you still have a composite output if you buy an optional cable (which is included with the dock) 8.	The dock (optional) has a remote control and charges the device during use.  The dock also functions as a convenient stand. 9.	It can play most WMV files without conversion or transcoding which is good if you use Windows Movie Maker or have lots of WMV files.  I found that the Zen VW has to convert every video I tried which usually takes longer than the length of the video.  Now for the bad: 1.	The worst thing about the Zune is the Windows software.  It is dumb downed so anyone can use it, which is bad because it greatly lacks many useful options and there is almost no ability for customizing.  Also it can be very time consuming to perform simple tasks. 2.	The Zune can NOT be accessed from the Windows Explorer.  It would be great if content could be added and removed like with a flash drive.  The Zen VW has this type of interface and it makes managing content much easier.  The Zune forces you to use their terrible Windows software.  There is a registry hack to allow some Explorer access, but it does not work well. 3.	The Zune device does not have any options for editing or deleting video content.  Everything must be done in the Windows software. 4.	There are no folders for video.  This terrible because if you have a lot of videos it quickly becomes unmanageable. 5.	There is a trick to get video folders by using third party software to edit the metadata of WMV files.  You can trick the player into thinking a video is a TV show and then it will put all similar episodes in a folder.  However, this can be very time consuming.  Also I have not found a program to edit MP4 metadata. 6.	There is no sorting capability on the device for video.   If you add all the videos at once it will sort alphabetically when you drop them in by folder.  However if you later add videos episodes they will not be in order. 7.	Once you add metadata, the Windows software no longer shows you the filename.   Also the Windows software will not display video folders.   It only shows you the episode subtitle which is usually something like S02E04.  Even worse it sorts by the episode.  This causes all shows to be mixed together.  They look good on the device, but when you look at the software you can't see the TV show names and you can`t tell what anything is.  I find that when I want to add or remove shows, I have to delete all the video off the device and then reload. 8.	There are no video playlists.  You need to manually select each video to play it. 9.	The Zune does not play AVI's or DivX.  Also the software won't convert them.  You have to use third party software to convert them to WMV or MP4.  Even then the Zune software tends to need to reconvert all MP4 files.  Also WMV files tend to be larger after conversion.  The MP4 files seem to have better compression and quality, but they don't work as well with your computer (more third party software is needed.) 10.	Two sets of video are required.  Since the MP4 or WMV conversion are usually poorer quality than the original AVI or DivX files, it behooves you to keep both which takes up a substantial amount of computer hard drive space.  I keep the originals to play on my computer and keep the conversions so I don't have to reconvert them in the future. 11.	The touchpad is more trouble than it is worth.  The touchpad has a dual role.  You can press it to navigate or brush you fingers against it to navigate.  Unfortunately, I find it is way too easy to brush when you want to click.  Fortunately, you can disable this brushing feature. 12.	The wireless is difficult to set up and not very useful. 13.	There is no built in speakers.  The Zen VW has speakers which I used frequently.  14.	The Zune does not come with a case or protector. 15.	The Zune screens turns off when the video out is turned on.  There are times when it would be beneficial to have the option to use both at the same time. 16.	It requires too much navigation to turn on the video out and the only way to turn off the video out is to turn the Zune off and on.  The Zen VW is better because the video out automatically turns on and off when connected. 17.	The screen aspect ratio is the old standard 4:3.  Most of the new video content is formatted for HDTV at 16:9 ratio.  This means that most of my video has black bars on the top and bottom.  The Zune screen is already very small.  The bars make the picture even smaller.  The Zen VW's screen is much bigger and uses 16:9 which is a big plus. 18.	The optional dock is expensive.  Without the dock you do not get the video output cables or the remote.  The Zen VW comes with video output cables.  In conclusion, I am still on the fence on whether to keep the Zune.  I am very tempted to exchange it for the Cowon A3, because it is suppose to be able to play almost any video without conversion and it works more like a flash drive.  The Zune does work well, but it takes way too much time to prepare, convert, organize and transfer video content.

<Title>Best Of  The Best
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son had an 20 gb Apple Ipod. It lasted about 3 weeks. Each time it was repaired, a different problem occurred. At the end of our warranty, it was still being repaired and Apple wanted to charge $210.00 for repairs.   Take my advice, Microsoft has now perfected this product and many of my son's friends are regretting/envious the day they bought an Ipod. You or your kids will be very happy with this Zune.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player w/ Few Drawbacks to Lose 1 Star
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just purchased my Zune and think it is a great MP3 player.  I think Microsoft really hit a home run and as many other reviewers have said not one MP3 player is perfect.  I'm going to start with the negative since that's what I typically look for in reviews and then will get to the positives.  Cons:  1. Only their DRM Protected files are supported - This is just immature on Microsoft's part and if they really want to compete against Apple, they would allow them all as Creative and others do.  I had to spend hours converting my DRM protected music to MP3 format so I could have all of my music on my Zune.  Silly. 2. No audio book support.  Again, this is plain silly.  I'm sure Microsoft is fighting Audibles because of the DRM protection thing as well, but they don't offer an alternative and in today's world it makes it very apparent they aren't focusing on the customer's needs, but their needs.  You can convert the Audibles file to MP3, but lose the ability to skip to chapters and have to keep track of place and fast forward to spot in recording.  Given that, Audibles should wake up and stop putting DRM on their stuff.  If these are important to you, Creative may be a better choice or you can  go into this purchase knowing you'll have to deal with these issues.  Now the good stuff:  1.  Ease of setup.  I thought it was incredibly easy and the only problem I had was with my own firewall.  I don't understand other reviewers not wanting to install their software.  I don't know any product I've purchased lately that didn't require some type of install. 2.  Ease of use.  I played with both the Ipod classic and the Zune in the store and hands down the Zune wins.  I've never owned an Ipod and only hear great things about them, so was shocked to find I hated their user interface.  Their wheel is annoying.  Microsoft did remove one feature that was in the older version which was a shuffle all on each music area, such as genre, artist, and playlists and made it like Apples so you have to go to settings to turn the shuffle on and off.  Why they feel they need to do everything Apple's way is beyond me - keep it original Microsoft. 3.  Quality of headphones - They are really good and they came with smaller sizes which is always a problem for me with in-ear headphones.  I like the "rope" their made of too instead of the plastic wires of all other headphones. 4.  Speed of syncing - I was amazed at how quickly everything loaded.  It took about 5 minutes to sync over 1,000 songs.  Amazing - especially since other MP3 players I've had would have taken hours. 5.  Software - There are a lot of complaints about the software.  I really haven't seen the problems others seem to have with it.  It located all of my non DRM protected music files automatically without any problems.  I bought more music from Amazon and those showed up immediately in Zune.  Within the collection you can sort, drag and drop and there are many views to meet your needs.  Especially nice is the ability to see where you are in the sync process.  It's easy to set up playlists.  There are two drawback with the playlists though.  1) They allow you to put the same song in twice and it actually shows up twice, 2) They didn't put a sort feature on the playlists, so the songs show up as you added them.  If you accidentally duplicate a song and put it in there twice, it's very  hard to discover and correct.  However they allow rearranging of the songs by dragging them lower and higher on the list - very strange.  There was some weirdness with album art, but in reading online, you simply need to turn off the auto updates of cover art and music details.  I was able to easily add Album art by finding it on the web, copying and applying it to that album on the collections page by right-clicking and adding the art. 6.  Screen size and resolution.  We compared the Ipod and the Zune side by side and no comparison.  Microsoft has this battle one. 7.  Sound quality.  Excellent.  I only have to put the volume at 5 or 6 and it's pretty loud.  Never used an Ipod, so don't know if it's better or not, but this is great.  Completely satisfied with my purchase so far.

<Content>At one time I would carry 30 or 40 cds with me in the car,at work etc.. I bought the 30 gb zune and found it to be awesome.Unfortunatly I ran out of space so next comes the 80 gb.I currently have 10381 songs on the Zune. All I have is from my collection I dont steal from the ones who made the music...This thing is great,I put it on shuffle and its a radio station I love to listen to,adapters for car,home stereo,bedroom and a docking station for work.I listen to music pretty much 24/7 so this is excellet. Easy interface with windows media,nothing to it.I recommend this thing to anyone who love music but hates the radio....UP THE IRONS....

<Title>one month review
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the device on Black Friday, and wanted to give it some time before writing my opinion.  I initially picked up the IPOD classic the day it came out, and ended up returning it due to compatibility issues with my Vista OS.  Those issues I expected would be absent with a Microsoft device in the Zune, and largely that has been the case.  Pros -Fantastic bright, clear display.  Excellent for watching videos and viewing pics. -transfer rates for WMV clips is superb.  Its literally the same speed as moving files onto a USB flash drive.  With the Ipod, you have to convert first, which took forever using Itunes.  Here you can use Windows Movie Maker to convert to WMV. -radio availability.  The Ipod did not have this feature, and its nice to be able to tune in, albeit FM signals only.  Cons -absolutely poorly designed, antiquated, confounding Zune software.  Its completely counter-intuitive, and lacks so many features in terms of sorting music, creating smart playlists, and simply transferring what music, pics, and videos you want to put on the Zune.  There are dozens of duplicate songs on my Zune 80 which I still haven't figured out how to remove via the software.   -where's a sort feature on the device?  On the Ipod, you could type in a few letters and the songs that matched the letters/words would pop up.  Imagine trying to locate a song which you can only remember a word or two in the title, and you're forced to scan through your entire collection to retrieve it.   -I still haven't found a decent case for the Zune...Microsoft has to do a better job in promoting this product as the accessory market only enhances the Zune 80's value, and right now its non-existent.    On the Ipod there was a game feature, which pulled trivia using the songs you had on the device.  The Ipod is the superior device today in terms of features, software, as well as being slightly more attractive.  I blame the Apple monopoly for the problems I had using it on my PC, otherwise the Ipod classic is largely appealing.  To sum it all up, the Zune 80 is still an excellent foray for Microsoft to at least get them onto the field.  Its still not even though, but I expect as time goes by Microsoft will push this product to catch up with Ipod, along with some innovations, much like the XBox going up against Playstation.  I recommend the Zune 80 for Windows users who want better integration with their PC.  I suspect there's nary an Apple user who has picked up the Zune 80 in place of the Ipod classic.  It gets 3 out of 5 stars only due to its grossly inferior software.

<Content>This product is ideal especially for those of us who aren't techies.  It is very easy to download music and move it to the Zune.  That is the only purpose for which I am using this device.  I have over 500 CD's; many of them are multi-discs, operas, symphonies, etc. and this will hold everything and I'll still have room left over for additions.  I love it.

<Title>Tough Critic= Very Satisfied
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well. As you all know, the 1st generation Zune had a good bit of bugs and problems. To thick, horrible battery life, shutting off randomly, etc.  Well, thank God for the 2nd Generation!  This piece really, truly is great. Fast, bright, easily installed, everything about this little thing is wonderful.  I noticed I no longer have to charge the Zune daily. It can go for days! Now, mind you, that solely depends on how much time you listen to it.  I have zero cons, no complaints. Beautiful wide screen for Movie or enhanced music video usage. Love how when you plays songs, the title of the album shows up, and even better. The forward button for getting to a part of the song is really fast. And syncing the songs is very easy, and actually fun to.   Microsoft. I have talked sooo many people out of Apple's Ipod, that you wouldnt believe. Thanks for making a terrific product!

<Title>Large Screen / Horrible Support
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 80 Gig Zube has a great screen and a great picture, but Microwsoft support is horrible.  When I received the Zune, it comes with "premium headphones" with interchangeable ear pieces for comfort.  The ear pieces on the headphones were too large, but the interchangeable ear pieces I received did not match, there were no two alike.  I called Microsoft to get new ear pieces and was told I would have to return the whole product and get a new one.  This after spending about 5-hours setting up the music and videos.  Plus there are no instructions that come with the product, you have to go online to find any help.

<Title>Adequate.  Hampered by software and concept
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>1.  The glass screen is elegant...and horrible.  It is a fingerprint magnet greater than any imaginable.  You will need to clean it constantly.  2.  The software works...sort of.  The latest version on my computer blinks and flickers horribly while doing most operations.  The warning for epileptics in the worthless booklet (I am not kidding...read it) should be directed to this software.  3.  FM reception is merely adequate.  4.  Video reproduction is impressive.  Audio reproduction is NOT superlative...merely OK.  5.  Navigation is impressively simple.  6.  The whole Zune DRM concept is junk.  The marketplace is awful...the stupid device will not even cooperate with Amazon.com which adheres to the Microsoft idea of 'Sure Play.'  Give me a break...they decided to milk the Zune like Apple does the Ipod.  This is a horrible buisness model.  If you have video capability, make it seemless to buy video!  Why is that rocket science?  Oh, then Microsoft recently has acted like a hydra with almost amazing ability to contradict itself and ruin product.

<Title>80 gb black zune
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was slightly sceptical about the zune, having heard all sorts of conflicting data on it.  The sound quality is superior.  I love the big screen.  The software was easy and quick to install.  Very easy to use.  The only drawback I could say about it is the headphones which I dispise. I am going back to the store to purchase some sony retractable ones.  They continually fall out of my ears, but that is an attribute of all earbud headphones.  Much prefer the clip on ones.  but there is something different about the headphones.  Maybe it has something to do with the magnets on the back side of the ear pieces so they stick together, but they amplify every sound the wires pick up.  It almost acts like a microphone.  It is extremely annoying.  Today I walked from my car to work and I could hear my feet walking on the pavement louder than the music.  Headphones definately have to go.  Other than that, I love it and plan on keeping it for a long time.  One more thing.  I read in a review that it doesnt convert itunes music.  Well that is not true.   It does not seek out and find itunes folder when doing a default search, but if you go into settings and find the folder, it imports the music just fine.  You will be very happy if you purchase this product.

<Title>Outstanding MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>OK, so I am a 50-year old MP3 Player owner.  I owned a Creative Zen Touch prior to this.  I have a very large music collection.  Prior to owning the Zune, I only listened to music on the Zen Touch.  Size: I know it is not as small as an iPod, but it is a good size, feels well-built, and looks good.  I keep it in a case most of the time anyway. Touchpad: Admittedly, I have not used an iPod more than a few seconds, but I have no issue using this interface and touchpad.  It is accurate and responsive.  It took no time to get used to. Menu Structure: No issue here.  It would have been nice to be able to save playlists on the machine or have a few more options on the Music options, but I do not feel I am missing anything. Syncing: I have not had any issue with syncing.  I noticed that a couple of times, the name of an artist changed after I loaded it, and so naturally, those files were resynced.  Example "Bruce Springsteen" vs. Bruce Springsteen and the Session Band". Wireless: I tried it.  Setup was simple.  It worked.  It was a little slow, but still worked.  I keep it turned off.  It is no big deal to turn it on or off.  My collection is not so utterly dynamic that I have to have urgent daily updates to it.  I do not have daily podcasts.  I do not add music that frequently.  When I do, I hook it up and let it do its magic. Sound and headphones: Very happy here.  For me, the in the ear buds were painful for me to use, but now I am used to them, and I like the idea that the sounds really tunes out the rest of the world.  Yes, the headphones make noise when the wires are touched, but that is true of all these type of headsets. Software: I do wish that the Zune software had more advanced features, notably more tag editing features.  But I have WMP for that.  I am confident it will improve over time.  Decent podcast content, at least for me.  Not a fan of the micosoft bucks, or whatever it is called, as it obsures the real price.  But there a plenty of places to buy tunes.  Amazon's MP3 prices are very attractive to me. Video: For me, the video looks great.  The glass screen is nice too.  I read all about the resolutions, but I find the pictures just fine.  I do not plan to spend a lot time watching video or looking at pictures.  But when I do, it looks great. Bottom line: I think this is a great little player.  Everybody I show it to agrees.  No one device is perfect, but I am looking for a way to LISTEN TO MUSIC.  This fits the bill and so much more!

<Title>Does not support asian characters
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune looks very nice and sleek. I love the big screen, the huge letters, and the choice of using the touchpad or simply clicking. I've had an ipod for the past 3 years, so I've been used to the scroll wheel, but this is very easy to get accustomed to. For most people who listens to english music primarily, the zune is a wonderful choice. But for those who are asians, please think twice before purchasing this! Upon receiving the zune in the mail, I hastily synced up my chinese albums to the zune. I couldn't wait to begin using it. But what do you know?? The zune does not support asian characters! Not chinese, nor korean, nor japanese. All the titles came out in squares. Are you kidding me?? In this age and time when asian population is so huge, microsoft decides to NOT include support for asian characters. WHY?  Of course I thought, there must be a fix for this insanity, so I went online and tried to look for all kinds of patch/hacks for it. Indeed there ARE hacks for this HUGE flaw, but the hack seems to stop at the previous firmware, not the current one of 2.3 (which is what I have) I've been slaving in front of the computer for 12 hours now and I still can't get the device to read asian characters.  If you're experiencing the same problem, a good website to look out for for a future fix is at zune boards. I am still waiting. I don't know if I'm going to return it or not... if 90% of my music is going to turn out to be squares, on a piece of equpiment I spent 240 dollars on, I'm pretty sure I won't be very happy.

<Title>5 star device, 3 star program
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>To put my review in context, I have owned a 30GB iPod classic, 1GB iPod Shuffle, 30GB Creative Zen Sleek, and 2GB Zen V Plus.  The Zune is easily my favorite player out of all of the past mp3 players I've owned before.    It does everything an iPod does, and more.  One feature I particularly love is the wireless sync.  Being on campus, I don't have to be in my room every second of the day.  Say I'm waiting for my favorite new podcast to come out, or for a CD to finish ripping.  I can leave my Zune software on, and then at any time during the day wireless sync from anywhere on campus and get my new podcast or album delivered to my Zune.  Now, granted, those without huge wireless networks to connect to will not be limited to their house (as the Zune can only detect one network at a time), but for a college student on a vast campus, this feature is UNBEATABLE.  Furthermore, the song sharing is pretty darn fun.  Whenever I see another Zune around we immediately beeline for each other and swap some songs, and it's a great way to branch out and meet people or find some new bands.    Everything else that is considered "standard" on mp3 players is executed flawlessly.  Getting around the player is intuitive, and despite having 60 gigs of music on it, it is very easy to find what I'm looking for.  Even has a radio tuner so when I'm in the gym I can listen to the TVs!  The screen is also gorgeous, and I've noticed quite a few disgruntled iPod uses enviously looking over at it.    The downside is definitely the software.  Now, given that I hate iTunes more, I was hoping the Zune software would let users deal more with the nitty gritty details, rather than "oversimplify" everything as Apple is (in my opinion) known for.  I hope that with a future update, they will allow Zunes to be synced via WMP11, and allow them to act as external HDs.  Finally, the lack of video formats is frustrating.  In my library of over 400 GBs of videos, only SIXTEEN were in the proper format.  Not including the most popular video format, .avi, in their list of compatibles just seems lazy and or a sloppy oversight.    IN summation, a few things could be EASILY remedied and that would earn the Zune 2 a full 5 stars.  The flawless execution of the hardware, coupled with the unacceptable oversights in software, earn it 4 stars.  Pros: -large, beautiful screen -intuitive controls -wireless syncing -song sharing -FM tuner -easy to manage library (but almost too simple)  Cons: -not enough "advanced" features in Zune software, I.E. difficult to completely customize -cannot be used as external HD -can ONLY be synced via Zune software (using WMP11 or drag and drop would've been nice) -lack of video formats supported

<Title>Zune all the way
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Zune 80GB is absolutely wonderful! I love it! There is no comparison with the iPod because this product has everything you could ask for in an MP3 Player. Large screen for video, FM radio, storage of over 20,000 songs, 25,000 pictures, or about 250 hours of video. It even comes with the new zune pad feature which makes me love this product even more! There are still some minor bugs in the software, but nothing that microsoft cannot fix in their next update. Overall, 5 out of 5 stars!

<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>ive had 3 types of ipods: 80 gb, nano 3G, and shuffle  all different and none as good as the new zune 80bg  the first gen zune was a trashball, but this is cleaned up big time, no scroll wheel, but uses an intuitive touch pad = much much better then going round in a circle - actually very similiar to the ipod touch in terms of seeking material  screen big, albeit somewhat grainy - if you have high quality material def not a problem  battery a bit sucky, but you can easily buy a 10$ battery online and install it with ease to get about another hour of playtime - takes 10 minutes to do and no you cant break the zune unless you are dumb  it is stylish and the leather premium case is perfect  the headphones are also way better than anything apple distributes and this player suports many file formats  also i hate apple because they are overpriced, an image, and really hate customers, plus their language support is terrible.... microsoft own the computer world and if they keep up the same kind of imporvments they did on the zune they will soon own the mp3 world

<Title>Love my 80 Gig Zune
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I waited several months for the new 80 Gig Zune. I wanted something big enough to hold my entire collection, but I did not want to have to deal with Apple products that from my past experience tend to be very restrictive.  I waited for about a month after initial release to see if there were any major bugs or problems there did not seem to be so I ended up buying on Amazon.  Love the hardware. Light and easy to use. The transfer from Windows media I was a little diappointed that the play lists I had established on Windows Media Player did not come accross to Zune.  The Zune software is easy to use but I liked some of the media player features that do not seem to be available. For example when looking at a playlist on the computer it does not seem to be possible to sort by column. This makes it hard to figure out if a particular song is in the playlist already. In short the various sorts are less user friendly.  Overall, as I figure out how to work around the software difference I am really glad I went Zune.

<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great player. The price was much lower than the ipod when i bought this and the zune doesn't have all those proprietary cables, it just simply outputs to AV. It plays anything I want and has a very easy to understand transfer application. Don't let the fact that it's a microsoft product discourage you it's very solid.  The screen is large and very clear. I would have no trouble watching a movie while on a plane.  I did a lot of research on this player before i even picked it up and it's even better after you have it in your hands.

<Title>Much Better than Ipod!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this player the other week, and I must say it is much better than the ipod classic.  Let me compare...  Screen Size - Zune wins with a bigger screen Navigation - Zune wins with the new sweet Zunepad navigation Headphones - Zune easily wins providing much better headphones Material - Zune wins with their scratch free aluminum Software - Here where Ipod has a slight edge, but Microsoft just came out there new software so expect updates soon  So there you have it Zune beats Ipod Classic easily.  And for all you people saying the software is HORRIBLE, download the latest firmware update that was released on Christmas and you should be much happier!

<Title>BLOWS IPOD AWAY!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I spent a month carefully comparing features, expandibility, capabilities, and pricing between the ZUNE 80, and the IPOD.  The ZUNE 80 won hands down.  IPOD has too many format limitations and seems more proprietary based, while the ZUNE 80gb will play and store almost anything your heart desires.  And now with M.Soft agressively expanding their podcasting, song, and video database on top of the fact that third party manufactures are clamoring to get onboard with new gadgets and creative changes, it's a clear winner.  It holds 250 movies, 25,000 songs, has a built in FM radio (IPOD doesnt), has wireless capability, and more.  For the money, and the features, it simply outpaces the IPOD by leaps and bounds.   It worked great upon receipt.  I strongly recommend buying the ZUNE 80gb Skin w/protective screen cover from the beginning.  (Be careful which one you choose, because only one of them actually comes with the screen-cover.)  M.Soft has finally come into their own with the ZUNE player.  Happy in La.

<Content>all you have to do is to go to the zune forums (ESPECIALLY in the software issues section), and see the hundreds and hundreds of zune owners who are totally disgusted with the usage of this "crapware" for the device AND the total lack of any response, the deafening silence, from the folks at Microsoft.  Why? They have our $$$ already...why say anything? the software is practically a beta testing program:  syncing is a joke, mixing all albums and artists up, deleting music from the zune and very, very slow...a total resource hog. do youself a favor and WAIT until something new arrives for it...don't get this thing now or you'll have a $249 paperweight!!!

Only issues I have are the screen tends to smudge often (but its made of glass so it is more scratch resistant and better looking), and there is no dedicated volume buttom (but neither does the ipod).

She raves about the sound quality, much better than her old 2gb MP3 player. She loves the sorting features, being able to sort by Artist, Album, Genre', etc.  My only issue is that she doesn't answer her cell phone (can't hear it ring through the ear plug type ear buds.

<Title>Better than iPod Classic, but could be better
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>[UPDATE 4]  The rating is actually 4.5/5, but since Amazon doesn't allow fractions, I put down 4 stars.  [Disclaimer]I work for Microsoft. I think I have been objective in this review--you can draw your own conclusions.[/Disclaimer] Also know that I do not work in the division that makes the Zune, so I have no insider information.  Let's start with my likes and dislikes of the Zune 80:  THE GOOD * Beautiful, bright, large, glass (not plastic) screen. The size (3.2") is so much better for viewing videos and pictures. * Size and weight (lighter than iPod Classic). * Capacity (80 GB). * Built-in Wi-Fi and associated wireless sync. * ZunePad. * UI (both of the device and the PC software). * FM radio. * Ability to rent music (allowing one to listen to whole songs before deciding whether to buy or not). * Build quality. * Customizable backgrounds.  THE NEUTRAL * Wi-Fi sharing--if there aren't enough Zuners around you, this is not of much use. * Simplification of the 5-point song rating scale to a 2-point (like/dislike) scale.  THE BAD * None of the Zunes work as mass storage devices (portable hard drives)--every other player on the market has this ability, so why not the Zunes? * Automatic playlists are no more.   Now for a more detailed review of some features...  SYNC-ING: USB OR WIRELESS?  Here's the deal: Over-The-Air (OTA, aka wireless) syncing is going to be slower that USB syncing, but more convenient. So use USB sync for bulk transfers (e.g., when you sync your Zune 80 for the first time ), and OTA sync for smaller, incremental transfers (e.g., nightly updates). To realize the usefulness of wireless syncing, consider this setup: keep the Zune dock connected to your Home Theater (HT) receiver in the living room, then when you put your Zune in the dock, the player gets charged, the music gets synced and you can play your Zune's music through your HT setup! I think the wireless sync is a very useful feature and finally MS is beginning to realize the potential of the on-board Wi-Fi (though more is possible).  MUSIC: RENT OR BUY?  Both. Renting music allows me to try out unlimited number of songs an unlimited number of times. Buying allows me to not worry about keeping up a subscription--I know that my favorite songs will always be with me. Renting also works well for "in" or "hip" music--this type of music typically gets overplayed and becomes boring before long. The subscription model allows me to fill up my Zune with the latest music for (say) a party, while keeping my options open for permanently acquiring some songs. The Zune Marketplace supports both models.  ZUNEPAD  The ZunePad is a great combination of D-pad (Directional-pad) and a trackpad. It took me all of 30 seconds to get used to it. Scrolling through long lists of songs is a breeze and fun too ;-). You swipe up, down, left or right to navigate the Zune. A quick flick of your thumb will send a long list of songs scrolling in the intended direction, and a touch on the ZunePad will stop the scrolling (the scroll will come to a natural rest too). The whole action is very intuitive and works as expected--for example, the speed of list scrolling is proportional to the speed of your upward or downward swipe.   COMPARISON  It is inevitable to compare any new entrant in the Digital Audio Player (DAP)/Personal Music Player (PMP)/MP3 Player market to the corresponding iPod--the Zune 80's natural competitor is the iPod Classic 80 GB. To compare the Zune 80 to any other device in the iPod family would be like comparing bananas and oranges ;-).  How the Zune 80 is better: * Larger, better screen (screen size vital when watching video) * Wi-Fi and associated wireless sync (possibility of new features via firmware updates) * FM radio with RDBS display (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTEER4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2465725-2294338">a saving of approximately 50 bucks</a> vs. iPod Classic) * Sound quality * The UI is far more visually pleasing, both on the computer and on the device * Subscription-based access to entire Zune Marketplace song catalog * Zune marketplace has a well-developed social aspect to it (not such a big draw for me personally, but others will like it more). * ZunePad. Thumb motions on the ZunePad are simpler than on iPod's clickwheel (or so says my right thumb, still recuperating from a serious, though unrelated, injury).  How the iPod Classic is better: * Mass storage device capability (aka portable hard disk) * iTunes store has bigger song collection, and has videos too * Cover Flow (while visually snazzy, CoverFlow isn't very useful for people like me who have mostly individual tracks, not albums).   SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS  1. Enable mass storage device mode/capability (aka portable hard drive functionality). 2. Use built-in Wi-Fi to enable direct download/purchase/rental of songs from/to the device (I hope this is already in the works). 3. Bring back automated playlists. 4. Let users choose 2-point or 5-point rating scale.   I will add more to the review as I keep using the device...

<Title>Outstanding.  
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned 5 different kinds of iPods, as well as the original Zune, and I must say, that this product is by far the best of the group.  I spent the day trying to return my iPod Classic (80GB)so that I could get my hands on one of these---and I had to look just about everywhere in town to find one.   Is this better than the iPod Classic?  Undoubtedly.  I can make a fair comparison, as I have been toying with the Classic for the last two weeks.    Pros -   Screen- Glass screen looks much better than than the original Zune's plastic one.  The 320X240 resolution looks great.  Looks far better than the Classic's screen.  Turns sideways to take full advantage of it while watching videos.  Ipod Classic? Nope.  Video quality is great.  Although this is technically the same resolution as the ipod Classic, nano, and Zune 4 and 8, it still manages to look great.  You will notice that the quality on the smaller Zune appears sharper, but that's only because there are more pixels per square inch on them, due to the smaller size.  Still looks awesome.  This screen is slightly larger than the 1G Zune, but it is still smaller in both thinness and height.    *Update - 26 Nov 07* -Been using it for about two weeks now, still no scratches on the screen (for those that care).  Much more durable than the iPod classic.  Glass > Plastic.    Build- This thing is built to last.  Feels a lot denser and sturdier than the last year's model, although I don't know if it actually weighs more, or if it is in fact less (as it is much thinner).  The first generation Zune couldn't win a beauty contest by a long shot--but I think this one's a winner. Aluminum back reminds me of the iPod line, although it's much better because it is brushed metal.  (Meaning you don't have to keep it in a glass case, and bring out gloves when you want to handle it, like you did with the iPods).  Doesn't look like it'll be scratching anytime soon.  Update - 2 weeks in, and still no scratches on the back.  I see no need for a case.  And it passed "accidentally putting it in the same pocket as my keys" test.  Although I wouldn't recommend trying it.  Zunepad- Forget the iPod's scroll wheel.  I was skeptical at first, but Microsoft nailed it.  You can choose if you want to flick your fingers across the "touchpad" to play your music, or you can just press the buttons to navigate.  Nothing against apple, but the scrollwheel on the classic wasn't nearly as sensitive as the 5th generation iPod video's.  Aren't you supposed to make progress when you release new hardware?  Apple messed up.  I can definitely see myself navigating menus much faster this way.  Update - Zunepad doesn't work with gloves of any sort.  Not that big of a problem, but I have noticed something interesting.  Even the analog buttons underneath the Zunepad do not work if you are wearing gloves.  It must sense that your skin is actually touching it to work correctly.  I found that rather odd.  I get some response out of it, but it usually doesn't respond the way you want it to.  This is a big deal for me, as it is getting cold.  Taking off your gloves to change a song is a burden, although I still enjoy using it more than I did the scrollwheel (which worked with gloves.)  I've tried cotton, leather, and suede.  This sounds crazy, but it is my biggest gripe with the Zune 80.  Firmware- Not too much different form the original, aside from aesthetics.  It just looks pretty.  Oversized letters are nice to look at, in addition to some decent animations.  You can set your own backgrounds, as opposed to having the iPod Classic automatically flowing album art in the back.  The "twist" interface is much easier to use than that of the Ipod.  I'm pretty sure I can get to a song much faster than someone with an Ipod.  I think it works similar to a spreadsheet, as you have artist, songs, albums etc. listed at the top, with the contents of the respective categories listed below.  A simple lick to the right or left immediately changes categories. Microsoft definitely wins in this department.    Radio- You'd have to pay for this if you bought an Ipod Classic.  Although I don't use it, it is still nice to have.    Zune Software- WOW.  I'll be honest, I've been using itunes for a few years now, and I hate it.  When I bought the original Zune, I thought that escaping itunes would be a good thing.  I was wrong.  The original software was abysmal.  BUT, the new software is outstanding.  It's almost too simple.  And it's also easy on the eyes.  I may consider using this as my default player from now on---something that I would have never done with the original software. The reason why I got rid of my original Zune in favor of the iPod classic was the software.  I was tired of using it.  Now I have more reason to keep my Zune.  Update- I have noticed a few quirks with this software, mainly that it seems to sync a small group of songs over and over again.  This doesn't affect anything at all--it's just an oddity.  I see this being fixed by Microsofts next update.  I've been using it for awhile now, and I am not entirely as optimistic about it as when I wrote this review.  It is STILL superior to itunes, and definitely the original software, but they need to fix a few issues with it.  Namely the syncing options.  The software recognizes some of the videos in the mpeg 4 format, but not all.  I am thinking that this might have been a problem with the conversion software (Xvid->mpeg4).    The sound quality, which is probably the most important part of this review, is outstanding.  I'm not an audiophile, but I believe that it sounds better (and louder) than the ipod.    Note- My Ipod Classic, when connected to my computer, would freeze Itunes, and slow down my computer significantly.  I have a core2 duo and 2gb of RAM running vista, and my processors would peak at 100%.  Hasn't happened with the Zune.  Premium earbuds.  These are alot nicer than most other stock headphones.  They're the in-ear type, and they will take some getting used to if you've never used them.  Bass response is a plus.  I tried them earlier and they are comparable to my more expensive Sonys.     Neutral -   DRM- I don't know alot about this category, so look at the comments that people have left at the end of this review.  I don't use this type of content.  I do understand that anything downloaded from itunes will not work on the Zune.  So if your entire library was downloaded on itunes, don't get this MP3 player.  It's their way of making sure you continue to buy their products, as well as preventing piracy.    Wireless sync.  I really can't use this.    I hear it works nicely though.  I can't really imagine using it, so take this one as you will.  I really don't see the big deal about this.  If I'm syncing my music, I want my Zune to charge as well.  Maybe this feature is for lazy people, but I see it as worthless.   Cons -  Drive usage.  You can't put anything on here that doesn't run through the Zune software.  In other words--You won't be using this as a portable hard drive, even though most of us will not fill it up with music.  You can do whatever you please with an iPod.  There ARE hacks online that require you to alter your registry available online.  Google is your friend.  Try it at your own risk.    Battery life- Haven't been able to test it yet, but I am not hearing good things---especially with video playback.  I'll update.  Update - Okay, the battery life isn't too shabby when just playing mp3's.  I went a weekend with reasonable use without having to recharge it (forgot usb chord in the car).  Battery life with video isn't good at all, but I don't think it was too far off from that of the Classic iPod.     I'd prefer the large screen and lesser battery life over that of the Classic any day.     Conclusion-  I'm not a Micro$oft fanboy, contrary to what this review might look like.   I've owned nothing but ipods before owning the 1G Zune.  I must say that this seems to be the best one I've owned, and I don't regret returning my Classic.   If the iPod classic can earn four stars, this definitely gets five, as it is the superior mp3 player---by a longshot.  It's not without its shortcomings, but they are forgivable, considering we've been under "ipod control" for the last few years.     That's about all I can think of.  Hope this helps.

<Title>DO NOT BUY - SOFTWARE HORRIBLE!!
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune hardware is pretty good (because it's made by Toshiba), but the new software they make you put on your PC is an abomination. The new software is actually MUCH worse than the original software that came with the first Zunes. They have dumbed down the new software to the point that it's VERY crippled! They have removed many good features. The new software was supposed to be an upgrade, but it's a massive DOWNGRADE. This is so insulting to us customers, to give us something that is much worse than what we had.   The people on the Zune team are really horrible. They are incompetent in everything. They are terrible at creating software. They completely ignore the customers and what we want, even though we have told them many things that we want. The Zune is capable of many more software features, which the Zune team refuses to give us even after an entire year has passed and the competition is now far surpassing them. We the customers get no support from the Zune team. So be warned, if you buy a Zune, you will be abandoned. The Zune team is a joke, except it's not funny after you spent $250 on their machine. So I recommend do not ever buy a Zune because you'll get really terrible software and no support. I bought a Zune one year ago and in that time we have gotten nothing. We only got a couple of very minor updates that did not give us any new features whatsoever and made no noticeable difference.  The Zune is very poor in features compared to other premium mp3 players now. It just has basic abilities, and that is really not good enough anymore. The latest mp3 players from Apple, Samsung, and other companies have many more and better features than the Zune now.   I really hate the Zune team because they seem hell bent on denying us new firmware features for our Zunes. We keep pleading and they keep ignoring us. They won't even give us a measly clock on the Zune. And now they give us this new PC software which is massively worse and massively less functional than the original one. It is crippled. I can't stand it anymore. I am sorry I bought a Zune. I am sick of being ignored and given very bad service by the Zune team. I have had enough. I want out. I don't want anything more to do with Zune. I'll probably buy a Samsung YP-P2 because it has a lot of features I've wanted.   It seems like what Microsoft does is give us major products with huge problems and expect us to be the beta testers and suffer through it for a long time, and they generally take far too long to fix the problem, if ever. Here is a clue for Microsoft: you are supposed to thoroughly test your products and work out the bugs before you put them on the market. The customers are not supposed to be your beta testers. From now on I will not be inclined to buy Microsoft products and will look for alternatives.  Also, a suggestion for the Zune team: give people a freaking manual along with their software!!! Stop making people figure out everything on their own, or go searching for a manual online, or learn how to use the software from other people on the internet. Give people the dang manual up front so they can have all the info from the beginning. Don't make people hunt for information on how to use the software. That is so stupid! It's like you think it's cool not to give people manuals for your software. Not only should you give people manuals, but it would also be nice to give people visual tutorials to make things even easier. You know nothing about business or serving customers, obviously! The entire Zune team should be fired and replaced! Get some competent people in there for a change!

<Title>In one word WOW!!!
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I totally disagree with the reviewer below who says this unit is flimsy and cheaply built. I find this player to be very solid and feature rich. The ZUNE 80 player has trumped my expectations in about every aspect. The interface is terific and the library is very intuitively linked together. The player really takes advantage of the album art and integrates it to create a really stylish GUI. The sqircle controller at the bottom is very responsive and intuitive for browsing. Before I bought the player I heard a rumor that when the player was locked the touch pad stayed active, however this is not the case. Everything just seems really well done and you can tell Microsoft put a lot of effort into this product. The sync software took me a few minutes to get oriented with, but I have had absolutely no problems with it and had my device syncing my media in about 5 minutes. The wireless sync was also very easy to set up and is a nice touch as are the premium headphones that come with this model. Not only do the headphones sound good, but they have braided cloth cords that don't get all tangled up as easy. All in all I was very very impressed by the ZUNE 80 and decided to go with it instead of the iPod for the following reasons: -Much bigger screen than comparable iPod -Premium headphones compared to the stock white iPod ones -Nice matte finish that isn't a magnet for fingerprints -Built in FM tuner which is an extra accessory you have to buy for the iPod -Wireless syncing -Zune accessories are universal across the models -Microsoft has been good about upgrading old model's firmware (The first generation players were allowed all the second generation features for free!!) -I personally also like the interface better  So basically much more value for the money than the iPod in my opinion.

<Title>Impressed - Great Improvement over V1
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The interface so far is a plus. Bigger LCD = better looking movies than the first Zune. I've been using wifi sync for part of the day, and it seems overly slow, but is to be expected on 802.11g. The case also feels like it may not take as good of a fall as the original Zune could, but the LCD cover feels like glass on this one, which is a big plus.  Unfortunately my Zune stopped working after the first few days, and the hard drive began clicking. Upon looking at the box it seems it took a rather large fall so I'm now in the market for finding another 80GB.

<Title>Great media player
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this device yesterday and I haven't been able to keep my hands off it. I was one of many people who made fun of the v1 zune but this device is a huge improvement.  The interface of the desktop software is very clean and easy to navigate. The software on the zune works really well. The Zune pad is a big surprise. I wasn't so sure when I saw pictures of it but this touch sensitive pad is great. It makes navigating your media very effortless.  Setting up and using wireless synching was incredibly easy too.  Now for the down side: 1. Getting help when using the desktop software could use a little "help". 2. Every once in a while there's some distortion on the headphones 3. Increasing the volume while playing video isn't as easy as it is for audio  Overall, this is a great device and it's going to be my buddy for a long time.

<Title>Shiny and pretty letdown.
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After owning an ipod and having it die, I decided to go with something else..  And I found I rather liked the Zune I played with in the store. When I found that the second generation Zone was coming out, I waited and got my hands on one as soon as they came out.  First, it is quite pretty, and the glass screen is very nice.  It is well-built, and has the potential to be a great music player.  However the touchpad is tricky to use, even if you switch the touch function off and use it as buttons.  It has four directions and a center select, but it is small and featureless.  I find it difficult to scroll a lot without accidentally selecting, and vice-versa.  The required software is abysmal.  It makes me long for iTunes.  Again, it looks pretty, but is buggy and clunky.  It frequently gives album art to the wrong files.  I accidentlly deleted a playlist, but couldn't re-create it because it says it already exists, though it's not showing.  If you have thousands of files, it is difficult to dig through them an manage them in any way.  The search function is terrible, and you can't simply drag things from Windows Explorer into the software, which would have made things far easier.  The software is slow and bloated; a lot of time is spent waiting as the computer hesitates because you clicked on something.  Anyway, with a fantastic screen and great audio, I like the player itself, other than the scroll button.  But that, along with the terrible software, is just another example of the modern tendency to make things complicated and pretty, just for the sake of having it look pretty and be complicated, at the expense of usability. Because simple, easy-to-use lists aren't good enough; they need to be changed into icons and animations and other garbage to impede practicality.

<Title>1 word SOUND!!! it blows the "Idontknowwhatmusicissupposetosoundlikepod" away
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm only giving this 4 stars because i can't believe the zune creators didn' put any kind of equalizer on this thing no equalizer at all huh. but i must say it sounds freaking awesome even without an eq. let me start off by saying i have used the new classic ipod and i can't believe for such a popular and expensive item they sound the way they do my musicjust did not sound the same on an ipod. well i bought this yesterday and OH MY GOD this thing sounds incredible i challenge anyone who has an ipod to go and buy one of these and listen to the sound and tell me your ipod can even compare. and if you don't like it just return it. but anyone who has been using an ipod for years don't know what there missing. this thing is awesome for sound alone but all the other new features are killer to. hopefully the eq will be addressed in a firmware update. go out and get one you will love it uhhhhh what music should sound like!

<Title>Dangerously Close to PERFECTION!
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Dangerously Close to PERFECTION!  Dangerously Close to PERFECTION! I always wanted to buy the original Zune but didn't bother due to the fact it was only 30GB and at that time I was already on my 80GB iPod. When I was on my 80GB I was already on the borderline of a shortage in GB so I was ecstatic when Apple released the 160GB. I have so much videos and that's what takes up all my memory space. After purchasing the 160GB I realized how disappointed I was. I hated the new cheap plastic cover they used; the screen didn't get any bigger, the user interface was spotty and slow (because it takes time to load album art), the scroll wheel was AWFUL and very unresponsive. In short, I was disappointed. The only plus was the memory space. Now the only way I would have enjoyed the iPod was if the 160GB was released in the body of the iPod touch. Instead Apple decided to only utilize 8GB or 16GB as some sort of test drive before the bigger drives get released. I called everywhere in Manhattan yesterday for the Zune & nobody had it. They either had it or their 6 dollar an hour minimum wage employee refused to check if the item was in stock when I called. Anyways I called Circuit City and or course the 18 year old kid that answered said they had tons of Zune's & that he unloaded it off the truck himself the night before the release date but at the same time he refused to put one on hold for me. I go out of my way to go to Brooklyn and of course when I got there they didn't have any. Lucky for me while I was at the store a customer was returning his Zune because he hated the user interface and he thought the device was too big so he exchanged it for an iPod Nano classic. Ok let's get to device. Overall I am very pleased with the device. Like I stated it's dangerously close to perfection, but not quite their yet. I love the design; its very sleek, sexy, futuristic, and very heroine sheik (Wish other colors were available). I've been using iPods for years so I am use to iTunes and the iPod structure menu. So it took a quick second to get use to the Zune interface. The scroll wheel is nicely designed and can be used in 2 ways. Like the original Zune you can hit to select or touch the scroll wheel to browse. The best of both worlds and you get to turn off the touch feature if you want as well. I like the menu setup and I like the fact that you can customize the backgrounds with what's included or with your own pictures unlike the iPod. The pictures look nice & crisp on the 3.2 inch LCD screen. The only thing that was a disappointment was that the album art when a song is being played isn't the clearest image. I guess in order to save memory space the resolution was toned down. I love the fact it has a radio. After having an iPod for so long I realized how many years it was that I didn't get to listen to the radio due to the fact one wasn't built in. Zune also has updated software so that was a nice change even though I didn't see anything wrong with their original design. Last compliant is I wish with all the technology we had that syncing songs would be at faster speeds. I clocked myself last night & it took 3 hours to port all my songs which was about 6500 songs & just a few movies & TV shows onto the Zune. Please note to all teckies out their lets build a better way of syncing songs so it doesn't operate at the speed of a crawling turtle. Bottom line is I am so pleased with my Zune. It really has done what the iPod hasn't been able to do and that's called EVOLVE. Having both devices I really prefer the Zune over the iPod. It's the best of the bunch and with some more advertising people will actually pay attention to this device. Bye Bye iPod Nation, Hello Zune Nation.
