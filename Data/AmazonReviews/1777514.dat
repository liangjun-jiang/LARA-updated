<Title>hunk of garbage, proprietary spamware junk. 
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>its supposed to be an mp3 player.  you put files on it and they play.  whats so hard about that.  Sony has made this as difficult as possible to do.  all your mp3 files have to be run through their program before they get onto the machine, they get renamed and re-formated to some propriatary file system, and if the mp3 is not formated with author, title, date, time serial number etc exactly as sony likes it this system screws around with the file so you can't find it on the mp3 player.  this is a disgusting hunk of over-engineered junk.

<Title>i think this item is great
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this item at circuit city for $90. its 2 gig memory gives me lots of space for all of the things i need. it's battery life is amazing, i've never once seen it go below the full mark. it's design is very sleek and i love the way it looks. the sound quality is great and as long as you don't have giant sausage fingers the buttons are just fine. the ear pieces didn't work out for me but no ear pieces i've ever tried have. the software, SonicStage, is a relatively easy program to use. it's a little slow at times but it gets the job done. anything you dont understand can be looked up in the Help section and it's very easy. i dont know why people say it's so horrible, anyone with a face can use that program and for the price this is a great mp3 player, hands down. i use it every day for hours at a time and i think it's wonderful. i highly recommend this product to anyone who even half knows their way around a computer.

<Title>The manual does NOT match the product
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On page 44 of the manual, the instructions say to go to the MENU and there will be a selection of "FM AUTO PRESET".  There is no such selection.  Obviously, if the product does NOT match the user's guide, then either the software in the product is incorrect or the manual is incorrect.    A call to Sony yields nothing.  They just offered to send me another (incorrect) manual.  They are not interested in actually helping you use the unit or interested in correcting the manual.  It's not their responsiblility.  Well, who's responsibility is it?  Apparently, all that hype back in the 1980's about Japan's "quality control" was just that--hype.  If they can't make the software match the manual, then they need to fire their Q.A. people or get smarter tech writers who can actually make a product manual match the actual product functionality.

<Title>Good player - rotten software
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Plays ok, good tuner, but...  Trying to get an audio book loaded was a pain. First try, wound up with the mini chapters loaded in almost random order. Used another ripper, copied them to the player and it would not play the files. Loaded those files through their software and got everything in order, but it removed the names and changed the MP3s to their pet format. Should never buy a MP3 player from a company that sells CDs.

<Title>It Won't Play MP3's
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this today and I am returning it tomorrow.  It claims to be an MP3 player, but you can not load mp3's onto it.  You must put Sonicstage on your PC, transfer all of your mp3's to that program, and then convert all of those files to ATRAC (?) format on the player.  This thing is horrible.

<Title>Nice and compact but does not actually play mp3s
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very light and compact mp3 player. Unfortunately, it does not play mp3s! You need to use Sony's proprietory software to convert your mp3s into another music format before being able to play them.

<Content>I like the size and convenience of the player.  I often don't do the mainstream thing, so I didn't want an iPod or iPod-like player.  The minimalism of the controls appeal to me.  And they are quite easy to use.  However, like many other people, I am quite displeased with the Sony Sonicstage software that you need to transfer files.  I accidently clicked on the 'connect [to the internet]' button, but canceled the process before it had gone too far.  I finished transfering my files and then turned off my computer.  But when I started it again I didn't have access to my ActiveX controls (which control all my desktop items), my security settings were changed so that I couldn't get ActiveX back, and all my WindowsME registry settings for HKEY...USER were gone.  I've reinstalled WindowsXP on a new hard drive.  I have my old drive, with all the files thankfully still intact, set as a slave.  And I plan on installing VMWare and loading up a new virtual operating system.  I'll reinstall Sonicstage on that virtual OS, so in case it destructively changes my settings I can just re-add the virtual machine again.  Unfortunately having a virtual machine meas I need another copy of WindowsXP.  I give the player a 5-star rating.  But the software to transfer files gets a 1; I'd give it a 0 if it was a choice.  I plan on sending Sony a copy of this review.  Because the software, because they're attempting to make it copywrite-protected, screws with the operating system.

<Title>Simply awesome
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This the greatest little MP3 player ever! It leaves Ipods for dead, way cooler and way smaller and the battery life rocks. The controls are a little tricky to get used to but once you have it down it all makes sense. I don't know what all the fuss is over sonic stage, it's not bad at all and it DOES NOT force you to convert your mp3s to atrac, you can transfer and play them just as they are. The FM tuner is another great feature that ipods wish they had and another reason to get this mp3 player.

<Title>Decent MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I got this mp3 player I was really amazed by its design and light weight. It's easy to use and if you pass through the Sonic Stage utility through which you has to upload your music to the device, you'll be just enjoying listening to your favourite song. I really appreciate that the battery life claimed by producer is almost the same as the one you'll be reaching in reality. In fact I found only one disadvantage of this machine. When you select to sort songs by artist and album, you can then see on the display only the name of the song or the name of the album either, but never the name of the artist during playback. And if the capacity is 2GB, you easily come to several songs or albums with similar names... Than it's hard to skip to song or album you want to listen at the moment without mistake. If you could get use to this incompletion, you can easily live with this mp3 player...

<Title>You HAVE to use their software
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You HAVE to use their lousy SonicStage software to transfer songs to it. That is just stupid. Well, not just stupid, arrogant also.  I was attracted to this thing becasue of it's size, battery life (which is exaggerated by at least 50%), radio tuner, and most of all its support of AAC encoded files. Apple's products have no radio tuners, and if you've chosen AAC as your audio codec, you haven't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your AAC files.  Kudos to Sony for allowing it to play AAC audio files, it's about time someone besides Apple implemented this MPEG standardized codec in their "MP3" players, but why force poorly written software (SonicStage) down our throats? Why force any software down our throats? With almost all flash based mp3 players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system; you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop. Then also you can use them from Windows, Macs, Linux, whatever.  And why are they still pushing ATRAC codecs? It's a waste of their time and money, and the world does not need Sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs. It's by no means superior to the standardized MPEG AAC codec or Microsoft's proprietary (although basically free) WMA codecs. Dear Sony, your codec is not significant, it is not a player in the audio codec world, and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us. The same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies, e.g. betamax and Memory Sticks. You just make the world more complicated, in the end you lose, and your market share goes to zero. (Although I did think MiniDiscs were a good idea.)  It's a good piece of hardware, but in order to use it you have to jump through Sony's hoops. Just say no.

<Title>El mejor MP3
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>En mi opinion el mejor mp3. La calidad de sonido es sorprendente (todo lo qeu esperaba de un producto sony), y para mi... esto es lo que mas vale en un reproductor mp3, al fin y al cabo... para eso lo queremos no? para escuchar musica.   El programa que viene incluido para grabar las canciones en el mp3 (sonic stage) no es tan dificil de usar, el unico punto que no me gusta es que no marca las canciones que ya pasaste al mp3, lo cual me parece un tanto tedioso en caso de que kieras actualizar tu coleccion.  Gran capacidad de almacenamiento gracias al sistema de compresion de sony (atrac), las canciones pesan menos y tienen una mejor calidad de sonido que en mp3 (claro si las conviertes del cd a ATRAC directamente, si pasas de mp3 a ATRAC obviamente escucharas la misma calidad de sonido).  Tiene sport timer para los que lo usan, o bien lo puedes usar como "sleep" ya que la musica se detiene al acabarse el tiempo que le pongas.  El aspecto de este mp3 es increible, es muy peque�o, del tama�o de un pendrive(se peude usar como pendrive tambien). Lo unico malo es que es bastante propenso a los rayones, pero bueno es el precio que tenemos que pagar por una apaciencia tan buena.  La duracion de la bateria es asombrosa, 28 horas segun la caja, realmente no lo he probado como comprenderan pasar 28 horas seguidas escuchando musica es algo complicado jajaja tiene una funcion de cargado rapido, lo conectas a un puerto USB y en 3 minutos tienes 3 horas de duracion. la pila se carga completamente en alrededor de 30 minutos depende de cuanta bateria le quedaba antes de la carga. Lo unico molesto es tener que encender el computador cuando esta apagado solo para cargar el mp3, pero esto se compensa al poder cargar tu mp3 en cualquier parte sin llevar ningun aditamento extra, solo necesitas una computadora (en todos lados hay una).  Recomiendo este reproductor a quien quiera escuchar musica con una alta calidad de sonido. Si no eres un gran amante de la musica y de los detalles en ella hay opciones mucho mas baratas que este reproductor. Un reproductor caro pero con una altisima calidad (yo lo compre en una rebaja de amazon a 65$ por suerte), el mejor MP3 en cuanto a calidad de sonido que hay (probe varios antes de comprar este, incluso mejor que los creative en mi opinion pero ambos son MUY buenos).  PD: sony ya soluciono el problema de que no se podia ver el artista de la cancion, al darle al boton home podemos cambiar entre el titulo de la cancion, el artista y el album.
