<Title>Review of the Reviews
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't understand why people are writing "reviews" of a product you have most likely not seen in person much less actually purchased and used. As I write this, the iPod Video is not available for purchase, yet that has not stopped people from "reviewing" it here on Amazon, comparing its video screen to the PSP and other small Video devices , etc etc.  It looks like most of the reviews are just die-hard fans or they hate any iPod that comes out because it doesn't have FM.  I plan to purchase one in the near future, and at that time I will write a review, until then I don't see the point in any reviews of a product that is Not Available Yet!  what is latin for "reader beware"?

<Title>WOW
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>OH MY GOSH, THIS IS THE BEST MUSIC PLAYER EVER!!!!! Sure, lots of people complain about how the screen is too small, that not many people will buy it because of that, but I just bought it and it's BRILLIANT. I bought a music video from iTunes as soon as I installed it, played it on my new iPod, and the picture quality was BEAUTIFUL. Of course, if you can't buy it because it's too expensive or you simply don't like it, buy something else. There's the iPod shuffle, nano, photo, mini, the Sony PSP, and lots more. By the way, you don't HAVE to get an MP3 player. But if you absolutely need (or want) one, this is THE ONE to get.

<Title>Very nice (yes, I actually have one)
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As of this writing, no reviews are from someone who actually HAS one of the new iPods (10/19). That is about to change....  My 40GB iPod's hard disk had been deteriorating for a while, until it stopped working altogether. That happened to be the day before the iPod video announcement (last Tuesday).   On to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from Apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:  1) Can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? What about the video quality?  In short, if you're holding the iPod as close to your face as you would hold an older iPod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. The screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old iPod width). If you're wondering how the quality comes out on an iPod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. It takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).  With regard to movies, the iPod doesn't support chapters. My guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. This will allow chapter skipping. That said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.  I loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the iPod would allow. The actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an MPGE4.  2) What the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?  It is about the size of older iPods. It is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo Gen4 40gb). The front is a flat screen, much like the iPod nano, but bigger. The clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older iPods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) The screen  I have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. If you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. This is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....  4) Is it worth it?  Jobs called this a regular iPod with "video capability." I'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. I don't yet have a composite adapter, so I can't see how this comes out on a TV...  With regard to exporting video to TV, there ARE the following options: TV Out (on/off) Video Signal (NTSC/PAL) Widescreen (on/off)  If your iPod is breaking, or is pretty old, I'd definitely upgrade. If you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), I'd definitely get it. If you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.  5) Firewire  The tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so I had been wondering whether it is supported. It actually is not supported at all. In fact, I tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the iPod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. Please use the supplied USB cable."  6) The "case"  I saw that a case was included on the Apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. I got a 60GB model, and it barely squeezes into the case. That said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have SOMETHING to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).  Anyway, I hope this answers any questions you might have. I've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the iPod photo.  If you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. It is really quite nice.

<Title>Excellent except for battery life from video
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me say this is my fourth ipod. Got my first one about 2 1/2 years ago with the 3rd generation. I. got it replaced after about 2 years as the battery died quickly. They replaced it with a 30 gig photo ipod. Then when the BLACK nano came out, I just had to get it! Love it except everything scratches it, including cotton pants! Thats the only downside to the nano. Then yesterday at the San Francisco Apple store around noon the new IPOD with video came out and I snatched it. Its the white 30 gig (thats all that was availible). The thing is spectacular and the picture quality is awesome. The plastic front looks like its made of the same material as the nano so I'm being extra cautious and actually put a screen protector over it that was made for my Compac Ipac. It works great. YOU just have to cut it to fit over most of the ipod and the scroll wheel still works great with the plastic over it.  The bad news is the battery only lasted 1 hour 45 minutes as I just tested it with a full battery. Barely enough for a movie but the ipod is mostly used for music. I can use my PSP for movies.  You have to buy the plug in adaptor as this model along with the nano does not come with one but thats understandable as the units are fairly reasonably priced compared to other MP3 players and the first ipod was only 5 gigs, this is really a deal. My nano is black and the screen protectors works great for that one too. Apple's computers aren't the best but I think their mp3 players are!

<Title>Commuters dream?
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Not really a review, but a feature or service suggestion:  If Apple could provide Tivo2Go for Direc TV with Tivo service on the optional Universal Dock via USB Apple provides with the device (or any DVR docking feature will do) then I will be one of the first to buy one of these devices today and support it.   I commute 2 to 4 hours a day by public transportation (buses and trains) in NYC and this would be a great distraction for me, plus this way I can catch up on all my Tivo recorded shows on my way home and have something to look forward to, going and returning to work to pay for this device.

<Title>The New iPod with Video
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The new Apple iPod with video playback brings a much anticipated facet of technology to the pocket portable world.  With the capability to playback crisp and vibrant video in both H.264 and MPEG-4 formats, the new iPod enables you to take your shows on the go.  Matched with the new QuickTime version, creating your own movies for play on the iPod is just as easy!  The new flat-faced, slender design not only brings a new asthetic quality to the orignal iPod line, but also brings it together with the recently released iPod Nano.  The new, smaller scroll wheel, no longer sporting a rounded center button, fits the overall design much better as well.  The face of the new iPod features the same clear laminate coating that the iPod Nano was treated to, serving to both protect the new 2.5" screen better and allow the iPod to be produced not only in the original white, but the new and decidedly appealing black.  The new 2.5" screen holds to the same Apple quality most have come to expect.  Clear, bright and easy to watch at nearly any angle.  While many compare this to the Sony PSP's larger screen, the two technologies serve decidedly different needs, and the iPod executes its purpose well with the design.  All in all, the new iPod is the same old great functionality and design with the ability for video added in.  The "icing on the cake" as Steve Jobs put it. [...]

<Title>Beautiful, Simple, Another Winner
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Very satisfied new ipod "video" 30gb user.  Overall the thin shape, bright colorful screen and just the classic ipod interface has been a great first impression.  Loading media unto it seems to take a few minutes but after its there, everything just works.  Videos and photos both are sharp, colors viberant, and run with ease.  As most noted, it only works with USB, no Firewire support, but that shouldnt be a huge deal since most users are USB equipped, I would recommend USB 2.0, 1.1 would take a very long time.  Thanks Apple, I enjoy this newest revision, 5 out of 5 stars to you in my book.

<Title>Creative is better
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I literally spent dozens of hours researching, trying to find out what mp3 player was the best.  I can't even list all the ones I looked at, but a good place to go to find the different kinds (...); just search for mp3 players.  In the end it boiled down to two: Creative, and Apple, with Creative standing head-and-shoulders above Apple.  (...)  Another thing is the picture display.  iPods have the worst color displays, with only a 60,000 color OLED screen, while most other mp3 players, including all of creative's colored models, have 262,000+.  This has changed with the iPod video, however, which now boasts the 262,000+ color OLED screen.  The screen is of course HUGE at 2.5" diagonal, but the screen on other mp3 players are never too small, except maybe the Nano.  As far as output, Creative puts all the other companies out of the market.  With a signal-to-noise ratio of 96dB for mp3s, and 46dB for radio (that's right, it's got an FM radio, from which you can even record), their sound is incredible.  They rate their battery time using 64kbps compression, while almost every other company (including Apple) uses 128kbps.  At first it seems like Creative is skimping you, until you listen to it.  Listening to a song at 64kbps on the Creative Zen MicroPhoto sounds better than a song at 128kbps on the 30gb iPod Video.    One thing I prefer on the iPod video that isn't available on the MicroPhoto is the ability to play all of an artist's songs.  On the Microphoto you either play every single song on your player, or just one CD.  Another thing is the touchpad on Creative products compared to the click wheel of the Apple stuff.  I think the click wheel is better because the touchpad is a little sensitive.  You can adjust its sensitivity, but I still think I prefer the click wheel.  The iPod has a couple of games, but they'll probably get real boring real quick.  The iPod lacks the ability to adjust the volume without backing out of whatever you're in, click on "Now Playing," and use that neat scroll wheel, while with Creative products, you either have a volume button or a menu button with which to access the volume from any screen.    Creative products are for PCs, while Apple products are, of course, for Apples.  You can convert from anything to anything with either one, but if you own a PC I think you'd be much better off with Creative.    The MicroPhoto is infinitely more customizable than the iPod, which is a definate plus for people who know what they like.  The iPod does not allow you to change the order of your main menu, customize your EQ settings, change your background, adjust your theme, change the click wheel sensitivity, etc. etc.    I'm listening to my iPod video right now and with only 3 albums on it, no photos, and no videos it has a lag time.  My MicroPhoto, with over 42 hours of songs and hundreds of photos, never had a single skip, bump, or jump.  I even dropped my MicroPhoto a handful of times, sat on it, had a person sitting on my lap who was crushing it, etc.  The iPod has been under no such abuse.    I could probably go on and on for hours, but there are a lot of things you're never going to find out until you actually buy an mp3 player and start playing with it, so my advice is to research (not nearly as much as I did, though, because I almost went insane), head to Best Buy, and buy one.  Play with it, take it back for another, rinse wash and repeat.  If I never had anything to compare it to, I'd be happy with the iPod.  I'll admit that the iPod, especially the 30gb video, is the sexiest looking mp3 player on the market, but if you're looking for better sound, better customization, better picture, more options, faster menu surfing, better durability, and cheaper prices, go with Creative.

My mini never scratched and my 3rd gen 20 gig didnt show scratches like these until after months of playing. There is obviously a problem with the coating that is applied to both the lcd and front bezel. I can only imagine how bad it will look in a couple of weeks :( Beware and stay away from the ipods until apple gets there stuff together and fixes this problem!

The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.

<Title>so far, so good
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've only had this product for...maybe a month, and so far it has worked fine. I do think i have to reset it more than usual when i'm trying to turn it on, which i find weird. Basically, sometimes it won't turn on when i press the play button. i usually listen to it at night, and fall asleep before the playlist ends, and when i try to turn it on the next day, i have to do the 'reset' procedure. maybe i'm just not used to the little quirks of an ipod? battery life has been decent, since i use my ipod practically everyday, i do have to charge it every night or so, but i knew about battery life expectations when i was looking for an ipod. i bought a case for it, because i wanted to protect the ipod (since i use it on a regular basis). Other than these 2 things (battery and reset), the ipod has worked software-wise when i have to plug it into my computer. it has lived up to my expectations for an ipod.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought the 30 GB version and we love it.  - The screen is small but clear and sharp. Go to an Apple store and see it first to make sure you're cool with it.  - The audio is excellent.  - It is very stylish. The 30 GB version is thin and convenient and holds a lot.  - It is very easy to use. iTunes is a breeze to use (we have a PC).  - Chinese characters show up just fine in the iPod text.  - We bought QuickTime Pro ($30) because it was the most convenient software I found for converting video to the iPod format. Videora Converter is free and useful for getting video into the H264 format, but I found I needed QuickTime Pro to get it to the final correct iPod format. The final conversion is very, very slow.  - It comes with a reasonable case, but I'm hoping for an after-market case to hold it and the headphones. Ideally there would be one that would protect the screen and let you view it clearly. In general, we're just very careful.  - It comes with a cable to hook to USB 2.0. Early USB version apparently may not supply enough power to recharge the iPod.  - The Lithium Ion battery charges up to 80% really quickly (less than 3 hours from dead zero), and then trickle charges to 100%. The battery may be recharged at any time w/o risk of "memory" like a Nickel Cadmium battery.  - Playing music, a full battery is supposed to last about 14 hours. Playing video it lasts a lot less. I would estimate about 3 to 4 hours on a full charge.  - Replacing the battery currently means sending the entire iPod back to Apple and getting a new/refurbished one. See the Apple web site for details.  - I saw a review about it hanging on the language selection screen right out of the box. Ours did, too, but I just followed the instructions on resetting it. No problems since.

Video playback is much beter than I expected, but it does drain the battery more than playing music files (naturally)One suggestion--get a carry case so you'll avoid any scratchs and dents for the iPod.

<Title>Better then PSP
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the new Ipod video last week, when it was released, most likely one the few that has it.  I just have to say its great, my sister had the Ipod photo, and the video makes that look obsolete.  The best thing is watching video's on it, the screen might look small, but its not bad watching music video's, etc.  The only thing negative I would have to say is that Apple should come out with a FREE software that will transfer my DVD collections into the right format for the IPOD, they have Quicktime Pro, but I really don't want to pay for it.  But even with that one negative it still is the best ipod out yet.    Comparing it to the PSP, I would get this, the PSP does have internet access, game capabilities, movies and music.  After buying the PSP you have buy a new card, because the standard one is a joke(32MB), you can not store anything on that.  The interent and gaming is cool, but i'll ready have PS2 and a computer, and i'm not really ever going to use those when i'm on the road.  THe games cost 50 BUCKS, to much in my opinion, then for the DVD's that another 20 BUCKs, its get expensive.  To get like 2GB(max for the PSP) you have to shell $100plus.   Apple has 30GB for you to store everything, enough storage for movies and music.  But there is a lot of waste on battery when watching a video.  The battery just gets zapped.  Plus they still don't have a compatible Car adaptor that will let you play video's from the Ipod to you car stereo.

<Content>I wasn't planning on replacing my 4th generation 20GB unit, but I saw the new iPod in person and had to bring it home with me right then. Everything I love about the 4th generation unit is here and it has the beautiful new screen that feels much larger than a 2.5 in 320x240 screen.  The couple of videos I transferred to it encoded in MPEG-4 look great on the screen, but I haven't hooked it up to a TV yet. That said, it's still mainly about the music/podcasts and audiobooks for me, video is just a nice bonus.

<Title>Blown Away by 30gig Video iPod
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a first-time MP3 Player purchaser, I had no idea how the 30 gig video iPod would change my entertainment life. Suddenly, I am now able to rip all my CDs gathering dust on a shelf and play them while on beach walks or even driving to work. I suddenly became obsessed with purchasing and downloading music videos offered on Apple's iTunes Music Store for $2 and playing them back on the iPod. All my friends were impressed by the saturated colors, super-sharp detail and smooth playback. I was a devoted iTunes user, so the absolutely impeccable iPod integration allowed me to create playlists quickly and drag and drop into my iPod. I use Windows XP and no player beats iTunes for easy playlist creation and management, quick burning, fast and efficient ripping to MP3, and also playing back videos -- though it cannot play .wmv and .wma files. So, iTunes 6.0 and iPod go hand-in-hand.  I have a large archive of music videos that I have downloaded off the web. Using Quicktime 7 Pro and Premiere Pro I have converted them to the proper iPod codec and uploaded them using iTunes to my iPod -- and they play perfectly. Now, I can play my videos anytime, anywhere with no required connections and they look perfecto.  The iPod is a marvel to hold in your hand. It is as sexy as any gadget can get. The enemy of anything new is scratches, from your new car to DVDs. The iPod comes with a velvety slip-cover that allows usage of the iPod click wheel through the material. I think a hard case will be my next purchase.  The iPod ear-buds don't fit my ears, so I use Sony's MDR-Q33 headphones instead.  Battery life while watching videos is a concern. There are a lot of accessories for the iPod including an intriguing FM Transmitter so you can tune in your iPod on your radio while you drive.  I now realize the iPod with video capability is a micro-computer, with tremendous potential. Future iPods may offer internet connectivity using a broadband wireless network so you can surf the web and email. A future iPod may take digital photos video -- and even edit videos. But these are only potentials right now.

<Content>It plays videos, but according to the Apple website, you get two hours of video playback before your battery drains.  Crash and burn.

<Title>amazing little toy
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After owning the iPod Mini for over a year, my music library had far exceeded the memory limit and this beautiful little toy seemed like a reasonable upgrade. After enduring an anxious week of waiting, I finally received the G5 iPod yesterday and have had no problems whatsoever. The design is beautiful and practical. I plugged it in to my Powerbook and after pressing a button or two, my entire library of 1,700 songs was synced within 20 minutes. The screen is very nice; a tremendous upgrade from the previous generations. However, I am not fully satisfied with the resolution, as anyone (or rather, everyone) who is used to the high resolution offered in most television sets or computer monitors will notice a small, but definite difference in resolution quality. This isn't too bothersome, and I have found watching music videos and even full length movies to be very enjoyable. That being said, this iPod is a portable music player with 14 hours of battery life and simply offers the option of video playback. It would be wonderful if Apple found a way to extend the battery life to more than 2 hours on video playback, but that is unforunately not so and should not detract from the other quality features of the machine. It is commendable that Apple managed to retain the same retail price as the previous models while incoporating so many upgrades.

<Title>Ipod Video is the best out there
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my ipod video today at best buy. Downloading songs is a snap. I think having to buy videos at apple is ridiculous especially when we already bought the dvd's we want to download it on. I found a awesome website for 34.95 it is all you need to put your full dvd's on the ipod video and it only takes 40 minutes per full length dvd. Screen is very clear and bright. Not sure if it scratches as easily as nano (i returned that one for this one) because i still have the plastic, but so far it is a great investment and i look forward to using it often.

<Title>Scratches very, very easily!!!!  
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the new ipod with video for 1 day. It has never even left my apartment and has a ton of scratches on the screen. I have read that there is a lawsuit about the nano scratching easily. Apple should be ready for some more lawsuits. I dont know how you can release a product like this. Great concept but be aware. Read the fine print as well, IF you get yours engraved you cant return it....

<Title>A more perfect iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think this one sentence is a pretty concise review and an effective counter to most negative reviews: THIS NEW IPOD IS THE SAME PRICE, HAS MORE BATTERY LIFE FOR MUSIC PLAYBACK, AND HAPPENS TO HAVE VIDEO PLAYBACK. Who cares if the battery life for playing videos is short? It's the same freaking price and the battery lasts longer for music. Video playback is just a bonus. There's no reason to rate it any lower than a normal iPod.  That being said, I was surprised at how good the screen is. Videos are easily watchable on it (my friend has Desperate Housewives on his and it looks great). The image is surprisingly clear. The entire unit is a bit larger to fit the bigger screen, but is also slimmer, which I prefer over the old design. All in all, Apple has done a good job in perfecting the iPod.

<Content>This is a great little device. Even though it is a reconditioned item the only thing I can complain about is the face scratchs easily. Works great in the car hooked up via a audio connector directly to aux imput.

<Title>Good But
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a IPOD and I bought this for my cousin in India. IPOD looks cools but when its comes to using I think I am missing something:  I have more than 100 albums in my IPOD. Its a pain to rotate and reach the albums at the bottom in the list.  The itunes does not install easily, I have some installation problems.

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPods are very cool, they have many more features than just playing music. This one is the best choice in my opinion 30 gb can hold TONS of songs, unless you are a music adict with this baby you will be set for a while. Ipods nano look good, but they don't have much space and they don't play videos. This one is 30gb, plays video and it's worth the same price than a 8gb nano.  However something weird happened to me, I ordered a white 30gb ipod from amazon. And my surprise when I opened the box, the ipod was RED. Yes, red. In the back it said that it was colorware edition, I went into the webpage of colorware and they paint ipods and notebooks, for $100. So I feel unique with my red Ipod haha.

<Content>I love my Ipod!  I can now take everything I might want to occupy myself in the case I have some lag time between appointments, or easily show off my latest photos of my kids.  Fits just right inside my purse, and the calendar function comes in handy, especially for birthdays, and other things that occur regularly throughout the year. Between my cell phone and this baby, I really do have everything I need right at my fingertips.
