<Content>Wow. I'm definitely impressed by this MP3 player. It is super compact, lightweight, perfect for anyone. It is powered through batteries, so it's super easy to replace. No need to worry about an internal battery losing its charge over time.  Another thing that impressed me was sound quality. It FAR surpassed my iPod's sound quality. Amazing.   I paid about $90 for this MP3 player, and it was worth every penny!  
<Overall>5
