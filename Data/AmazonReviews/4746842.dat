<Title>1st MP3 Player & impressed what all the features!
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player and am totally pleased. Read all the Negative reviews first than the positive. To my surprise none of the negative items reported happened to me, yet. First they say battery life stinks well I read that the iRiver comes only 50% charged and it takes 1 hour to charge at 50% & 2 1/2 for full charge. Not bad when you get at least 20 hours of use for full charge.  Only being able to use Windows media player is not bad but there are so many options like rating your songs, artist, playlists, genres & star system. FM radio is great either in the car with FM transmitter or on the fly. The finger print situation is real but I bought a Invisible Shield for $9.99 with a lifetime warranty works great.  The toggle screen is ok but when you start listening to a song and the screen goes black to save battery life you have to press the screen twice once to get it illuminated and the other to go where you want just irritating.  Did not use the earbuds because it is not applicable to my ears but bought Phillips behind the head headphones here on amazon and the sound is great from the iRiver. Did not use the video option yet because I just wanted the MP3 option so maybe later when I expand to video we will see but I see no point. Also the pictures may be a faster option that I want to use and you will need a converter from iRiver website (free) to resize the image to fit on your iRiver screen and with the excellent clarity it will be great. The cradle is nice and sounds better than I thought but when you want to connect to your Home Theater receiver you need to purchase a y adapter cable unless you have a new receiver for USB connection.  If you already have a cable to connect to your Receiver than forget it because it will not fit into the back of the cradle you need the cable that came with the cradle since the housing is smaller.  The iRiver will charge from your laptop computer with no problems my main way of charging.  Also bought the iRiver FM Transmitter and works great if you can find a dead station to broadcast your signal and it has 3 presets.  So far there is no problem at all, great product and well worth the money sometimes there are problems with products and/or ignorance from users but take a chance if you read all the bad and good reviews and if this unit fits your needs!

<Title>good purchase

<Content>I was referred this product by my good friend.  Overall, I like this product, the only downfalls are: 1) a little difficult to use and 2) the battery life...  in previously owned mp3 players, I get a beep or a warning whenever the battery is running low.  However with this iriver, it just shuts off completely when battery is down.  the radio function is excellent.

<Title>Do Not Buy iRiver
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the very short period of time it worked, it was great. It began freezing up with software problems, and support is the helplessdesk. These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned. I really believed, even after many weeks of research, that I was getting a quality product. It is junk. Don't waste your money or your time.

<Title>Amazing

<Content>The click system is fun and easy to use. The player itself is nice and compact, and thin. The sound and movie quality are top notch. The packaging itself shows the effort that went into the product. It looks great and oozes a lot of wows from others. Overall great product.

<Title>Very nice, a bit small and died after a year
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got the 2GB Clix ($135) in Dec 2006 for my 14-year-old teen.  The screen is very small and it is very easy to use. It is a nice MP3 and Video (avi) player and very cool with lots of features like Flash games, nice FM radio, Alarm clock etc. A few days after the 1-year warranty passed, it suddenly stopped showing up as a Flash drive when connected to a PC. The support person said he works for a third party service and that this problem is common... If this had happened a few days ago, I would have been able to send it for repair. Unfortunately, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I formatted the device so all we can do with it now is listen to radio...

<Title>good one, but not excellent
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am satisfied with it. Many features are very good. The sound quality is as good as ipod and others. The FM radio can receive signal in many place, quality is also good. The picture quality is wonderful, better than I expected. Some review said about the charging problem, saying it can only be charged through the computer. I bought chargers so don't have that problem.  There are several things I am not happy with. First, it is not very easy to learn how to transmit resources from computer, especially in vista. I still can not find the way to put in video and songs which are not mp3 files. Second, after charged, it can not find back where I was listening.
