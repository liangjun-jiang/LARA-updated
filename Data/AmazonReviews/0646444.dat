<Title>The best sounding MP3 player currently on the market
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an owner of an 80 gig Apple ipod, the Sony NW-HD5 and the Creative Zen 30 Gig "M" player. When it comes to sound, the Apple ipod surely comes in last, and while the other two have great sound quality (especially the NW-HD5), the Sony NWZA818 REALLY blows the others out of the water (so much so, I was somewhat taken aback).  There are so many EQ adjustments on this player, it's silly. The hardware and software design is great, it feels solid in spite of it's size, the buttons are well-placed and it is simplicity itself to load and delete music. It's also got a fast processor, a vivid, colorful (albeit SMALL) screen to watch videos and wonderful battery life.  GOODBYE SONICSTAGE, and good riddance! At last, Sony has done away with the notoriously buggy software that it previously used for managing its portable devices. Now users have the choice of using either the "drag and drop" method or Windows Media Player to manage their music files, thanks to Microsoft's "Play For Sure" compatibility.  The included headphones are outstanding in both build and sound quality; as some have taken note, the going price for Sony's MDR-EX082 Headphones is around $50. What this means is that most people will be quite satisfied with the sound right out of the box, with no need to buy a decent pair of headphones to supplement the player (a rarity indeed amongst MP3/MP4 portable players).  In fact, while there are some negatives (the unnecessarily proprietary USB charger, no removable battery slot, no SD card slot, relatively small hard drive capacity, no FM radio, no recording capability), they are not enough in any way to negate this player's awesome positives... particularly the Sony NWZA818's truly exceptional sound.  If you're an audiophile like me, this is simply a must have.

<Title>Pleasantly Surprised!
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Sony Walkman NWZA818BLK, 8 gig MP3 player and I couldn't be happier! I love it! It looks much better in person, I think, than what you see online. It is sleek, smooth, shiny and very cool. It is something you won't be embarrassed for others to see. Actually, you will probably want to show this one off! If Fonzie, or the Fonz, was transported to our time, he would definitely have this MP3 player. It is made of metal with a silvery high polish and complimented with black. It is the "Harley" of MP3 players!   I have had all sorts of MP3 players through the years, everything from A-pple to Z-en. I didn't buy a Zune though, as I thought it looked cheap. My friend has one and I borrowed it. Glad I did, because it just doesn't look great and I don't think it looks well made. This one looks like it will last. Sony must have decided to come back to the market and bring back a simple to use, well made construction player with EXCELLENT sound! The sound is about as perfect as you can get for a MP3 player. You can customize it with many choices. For example, there is a function for Clear Sound using a cord, an extention cord too. Playback can be in all ranges or selected. The Equalizer has None, Heavy, Pop, Jazz, Unique or you can customize it. There is VPT Surround Sound of None, Studio, Live, Club, Arena, Matrix or Karaoke. DSEE Sound Enhance can be on or off. Clear Studio and also Dynamic Normalizer can be on or off. There is also an AVLS Volume limit you can turn on to protect your hearing, if you want it. There is a Time and Date Screensaver to pop on every so many seconds that is nice. You can also decide when the screensaver kicks in such as 15 sec. 30 sec. or 60 sec. The battery life is wonderful. Look for many hours of fun.   I also bought the Sony Docking Cradle. I got it at the Sony website for around 50-60 bucks. It looks fantastic with the Walkman. It is also shiny high polished silvery steel with black. You can record to your Walkman, play to your stereo or speakers, transfer data to and from your computer and of course the nicest feature of all, you can charge it up without the computer. You do get a USB cable with your Walkman for transfer of music and to charge it via your computer.   The headphones are sleek, super cool looking and there are three ear piece sizes to customize your earpieces to your ears and they sound wonderful. I also tried the Walkman with my Koss and other Sony headphones and they work equally well. Sometimes I like the larger headphones to have the music surround me with sound, but these earphones supplied work very well indeed!   I tinkered around with my music settings and for me, I love the Live VPT sound. It sounds like they are right there in the room with you! I like the Heavy for the Equalizer. I thought Pop sounded a little off, to me, but that may be because my music is more geared toward Bass and more heavy sounds. The Dynamic Normalizer really works great for me with it on. I notice a big difference. Clear Sound on also made my music more crisp.   The pictures look great on here. The menus are simple and easy to move around. One of the best features is the very simple drag and drop via Windows Explorer. I tried the Windows Music Player you can download with the supplied software and used the Sync function, but it was WAY too time consuming for me and I have a Duo Core Intel Pentium, so not exactly a slow computer. The Windows Explorer was quick and easy. I made sure I have my file folders put into each music group. Like Pop, Rock, Oldies, Latin, Classic, Jazz, etc. Then I just drop those into the Walkman and Voila! I use the Music Library Folder and it takes me to my folders and I can just go to and hear whatever I am craving.   Also it has a nice search function. There is the video function I haven't used since I filled my Walkman with all music! There are shuffle functions, playlist function for dropping playlists into as well. All functions are quick and easy. Note: You can also use an online CDDB or some database to sync your MP3s to update genres and all that, so you can go right to each category. The folders alone work well for me and don't take hours to do. It can play a lot of different files such as WMA, WAV, MP3 among others. It can even play AAC, MP4, if they are not copy protected. I wish Windows and Apple would get together and allow ALL music to play on ALL players, but still, this player plays more types than many others.  Pros: Simple to use; sleek and cool looking; well made, metal looks great with the black; excellent sound; easy to use menus and transfers; nice clear pictures; bright, crisp window; excellent battery life and the Fonz would approve! I have had many players and by far this one is the best sounding player I have ever had and one of the easiest to use.  Cons: I wish it had a few more gigs, like 10 or 16 gigs. Still I have more then 2,000 songs on there, so that is a lot! There isn't a carrying strap included, so you need to factor that into the price of buying one, I think one should be supplied. I wasn't impressed with Windows Media Player's sync function. But you don't have to download Windows Media Player at all, which I like that option. Windows Explorer is just easier and quicker. The earphones, as great sounding as they are, should have just one longer cord instead of two sections you connect together and should be longer, but it is adequate. I use other earphones on this player too and they work equally well.  I am SO glad I purchased this one. Thanks Amazon!!    UPDATE: I have had this Sony player for about a three weeks now and just have to add that it works great! I have not had any problems with it. I got Rhapsody To Go on it without any problems, despite someone commenting that you couldn't use Rhapsody with this player, but it works great on it.   The only thing I wish is that it had a 16 gig since I have to take off music and put music on, because I have too many music files.  I have to decide which to put on and to take off, but I do not regret buying this one at all. The sound is excellent and I have already had several people comment in public about how nice a player it looks and my friend with the Zune has begged to trade with me. NO WAY! He updated his Zune and now it won't play due to the sorry software on it. Anyway, Sony did it right with this player!

<Title>Buy This Product - No, I'm Not A Corporate Shill
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sony FINALLY scuttled its abysmal propietary SonicStage interface.  FINALLY.  That is the first observation anyone familiar with their older players will make.  I had long wanted Sony quality, but was unwilling to grit my teeth and use the horrendous software Sony mandated. The whole tactic smacked of Microsoft.   That software is gone, so I purchased this without hesitation immediately.  This player is MTP, meaning you plug it in, it appears like a hard drive, you drag and drop files. It supports all the usual playback options, sorting by Artist, etc., but also lets you sort, view, and play by FOLDERS.  This simple but highly useful feature is not available on Sansa, Creative, etc. players.  I put my audio books in one folder, lectures another, music another, and have subfolders for artist/album.  On most other players, they all get jumpled into one heap, and if the ID3 tags aren't perfect (frequently the case with downloaded music), you have a mess on your hands no matter how perfect the interface.  Being able to switch to folder view in certain situations is a VERY useful feature I am amazed so many manufacturers neglect.  Everything else is what you have come to expect from Sony, especially the:  Breathtaking sound quality.  I cannot overstate this point.  I listened to 2-Pac, Enya, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra, Britney Spears. . .songs that sound somewhat flat on other players have life on this one.  The bass resounds for Tupac, Enya's high notes really resonate, you can hear the horns in Louis. I do not have an audiophile's ear, and was very surprised that I noticed such a profound difference in sound. I have owned Creative, Sansa, and a few other players (no I-Pod because I won't tolerate I-tunes any more than Sonic).  This player has FAR & AWAY the best sound I have ever heard on an MP3 player.  In part this is because Sony spent the extra few bucks on some great, space-age-looking headphones (the ones that arrived with every other player I ordered were a joke, and thrown out).  But when I run this player through my Alpine car unit with a plug-in headphone jack (I have MB Quart Speakers), it sounds noticbly better than other players.  Clearly, Sony has learned something about the electronic guts of music players that other, primarily computer, manufacturers have not.  It just makes sense: do you buy your MP3 music player from a computer maker like Apple, or a company that has been producing high quaity audio equipment for decades?  The interface is the easiest I've seen, the three button format allows you to truly browse like a web browser, going back or forward. The player is remarkably small, much smaller than comparable products, and constructed with pleasing, subtle aesthetics.  The screen is clear, bright, very readable.   Cons:  My 8 GB player has 7.3 GB usable space, there is always some loss, but this was very significant. No extra memory card, so buy a big one. Proprietary connector (USB to Proprietary), meaning gougathon on cable replacements, and when travelling, another cable to add to the pile. Wouldn't it be great if companies stopped this, and a single cigarette-lighter adapter and USB cable allowed you to operate ALL your devices.  Too much to hope for, I'm sure, but a company that did this would earn many converts. Flowing text on screen is somewhat slow, cannot find way to speed up, but I do read fast.   These are pretty serious cons, but they are dwarfed by the exceptional sound quality and easy navigation of this player.   I'm generally not a fan of corporations, but I have bought Sony products for years and have NEVER gotten anything that wasn't outstanding.   This is a pretty glowing review, and I have to reiterate the fact that I am not some corporate shill. I didn't bother writing scathing reviews of Sansa and Creative products due to time, but this is such an impressive product I hopped online to spread the word.   I can't speak about the features of I-Pod, but I know this sounds better. Much better. Tried it side by side with my buddy's with the exact same files. Not even a contest.   Simply put:  buy this player.  Any minor shortcomings in features will be FAR outweighed by the ridiculous sound quality.

<Title>hot tunes!
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I am not going to provide a technical-intensive review of this player, BUT I do want to share that I just received my player in the mail today and I am thrilled with my purchasing decision.  The player sounds fantastic, the userface is uber intuitive and nicely organized, drag and drop data transfers are thee bomb!, and the player is solidly made-- it looks and feels great.  And I also purchased the hard, clear case for it, which I initially found to be pricey at $27.99 at my local SonyStyle store, but I am now very happy with it.  It'll be perfect for my runs.  I bought this player with the priority of enjoying my music; the video function is definitely secondary for me, and an fm tuner and audio recorder I decided weren't essential.  I'm ecstatic with my selection.

<Title>Fantastic MP3/Video Player
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sorry Amazon i orederd directly from SonyStyle to get the Silver.First Impressions out of the box. Very stylish and sleek.  Easy to use...I turned it on plugged it into my USB port and synced with Rhapsody to go.  The sound quality will blow you away.  I have/had the Sansa View, E280, and ipod Nano.  Playing music through this just feels solid.  The ear buds are very nice.  This is my first experience with Sony ear buds and was a little confused at first with length of the cord for the left ear bud being shorter than the right.  One call to Sony tech support and problem solved.  Tech support was very friendly and prompt and even followed up with an email pertaining to my problem.  I would definitely reccomend this to everyone.

<Title>This Walkman Simply ROCKS!
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>WOW.  This player simply handles music superbly well and just ROCKS!!!  Before getting this player, I originally was going to get either the iPod Touch or the Samsung YP-P2, from my dying 4G iPod and insufficient 1G 1GB Nano.  The touch interfaces are pretty cool, but eventually thought that they were ultimately a gimmick and also provided no tactile controls.  Plus, excellent sound quality is a top priority for me, and then cost.  Before I made up my mind to spring for the YP-P2 for it's above average sound quality versus the Touch on Amazon, I came across the Sony Walkman NWZ-A818 which won a CNET Editor's Choice for it's excellent sound quality and bundles of features.  After reading CNET's review, I became a member of AtracLife forums and read almost all of the reviews for this player.  Sony has always made quality players with superb sound quality, but software packaging always marred the overall user experience and package.  However, I learned that this Sony, the NWZ-A818, no longer supports the notoriously horrid SonicStage and thus the ATRAC format. Rather, the player supports Drag & Drop and MPT, which users will be able to sync and use the player with Windows Media Player, and music formats of WMA, ACC, MP3, and WAV.  I have always been a fan of iTunes and it's excellent integration with iPods.  Before the iPod, I had a Rio Karma, which I still miss today because of it's excellent sound quality.  After the Karma came the 4G iPod, and then the 1G iPod nano.  I have always thought the iPod's sound quality lacked something, a particular enveloping warm sound and low levels of bass. (I highly disregard the iPod's EQ, but bass reproduction is certainly biased with ok to good sound with the use of Sony's MDR-EX51 or Vmoda bass freq, or so I thought until I got the Sony A818)  Then came this Sony NWZ-A818.  I simply cannot emphasize how excellent the sound quality of this player is, so I'm certainly not biased in anyway in giving high praises for this Sony Walkman.  I listen to a variety of music genres, but my love is for EDM genres such as trance, dance, or drum & bass.  Sound quality is of a high caliber on the flat settings.  I'm listing to the player as of writing this review.  I have the volume on a relatively low level, at 10/30, and the sound is very well balanced.  The treble and bass are very well defined and correlate together perfectly in harmony.  And then there are the multiple options of boosting the sound even further with two custom equalizers (5-band parameter settings) along with other presets and other 'surround sound' (most noteable is the Matrix setting).  Not to mention that it comes with Clear Stereo, proprietary DSEE (sound enhancer for high bitrate files), and dynamic normalizer, which all work well. As a bonus, Sony included $70 MDR-082 earbuds, which are one of the best balanced earbuds I have owned.  The player above all simply works great right out of the box, with no hassle of purchasing better earbuds.  Many user reviews for the sound quality of the NWZ-A818 are certainly not kidding (such as the excellent reviews from "S. Su" or "Wookalia 'Wookalia'").  It really doesn't surprise me since Sony and sound quality really come hand in hand since they have nearly 2 decades of sound expertise from their original Walkman.  You will really appreciate the sound quality of this player, especially coming from the iPod line. Sound is crisp, warm, and enveloping, which is just simply bliss. Classical music sounds clear, so well defined that you can hear all the ranges.  Enya never sounded better.  Sound reproduction of her work is so good that she seems to be literally standing in front of you and you can visualize the movement of lips singing. From what I hear, the treble is very crisp and detailed.  With bass on the flat settings, it is clear and defined.  It doesn't have the low quality muffled sound that degenerates the treble.  I have to be honest and say that I'm a basshead. The "Clear Bass" of up to +3 definitely cures any of my cravings for pounding bass, and the name is very appropriate... the bass really is clear and not muffled.  It is deep, defined, and and gives off a very nice punch.  Bass heavy tracks are just simply amazing. Kanye's work is very punchy but not overwhelming so that you can't hear the treble, in another words well balanced and you won't be fatigued with long listening periods of bass intense tracks (on flat settings). Tracks from the more electronic genres such as Tiesto, Trentemoller, Armin, or Diesel boy simply makes my head spin with joy.  Apart from sound quality, the excellent user interface is logical and fast to find songs.  A 35 hour battery life is just stunning for such a thin package.  I got a polycarbonate hard clear case for this model and it's still thin at 14mm (which i prefer over the original player of 9mm).  How thin is too thin? Probably when Apple comes out with the iPod Pico, that is literally paper thin and has 1 hour of battery life, considering the rate that each phase of the nano is going haha ;).  Pictures and Videos look excellent, but I rather save the memory for of course music ;).  Sony is also coming out with Media Manager for Walkman soon, which is a software that will offer even tighter integration with music files (hopefully gapless) and conversion of various files.  One downer though about this player (at its current firmware) is that it does not support on the fly playlist creation and rating songs.  I am quite sure sony will address this issue with future firmware updates, since the NW-A808 (a European sibling of the NWZ-A818) supported playlist creation and rating of songs on the player.  I can live without these features missing at the moment, since my music library consists of 106 GB and playlists can be transferred quickly from iTunes to Windows Media Player and then synced to the player.  All in all, I am extremely happy with the purchase of this player, and quite frankly will probably not go back to the iPod line until Apple does something about it's sound quality (such as a custom EQ), which will probably be never since I have been waiting for that feature since the 4G.  It is VERY VERY ironic since they can create such a fantastic User Interface and OSx on the iPod Touch but not create a much more simpler program such as user defined EQ?  Ultimately, the build quality, sound quality, user interface, and other unique features of this Sony NWZ-A818 most definitely outweigh any of the player's cons. I'm very confident that true music lovers and audiophiles will not be disappointed with this player :D.  [EDIT]  After owning this player for about a week, it's really amazing what this player can do.  Not to kid, but the player actually has breathed new life in my older songs.  For instance, the bundle of the player and the MDR earbuds enable me to hear subtle background noises with great clarity, such as the ping of a music triangle. Seal's new album "System" just sounded wonderful.  I was listening to the player in the library at a low volume of 6/30 and even at this low level, the music is still VERY WELL defined.  I do use the dynamic normalizer on the player and the sound image (at flat settings) is just amazing!  To me all ranges of the treble, mid, and bass are just perfectly balanced.  Or rather, this player really enables you to truly listen to what the artist originally recorded. Perhaps it was the significant upgrade of the MDR-EX51 to the MDX-EX082, as headphones do make a huge difference in sound quality, but i did a sound comparison of my 4G iPod and this Sony.  With the Sony stock earbuds, i hooked it up to the iPod and played "I can't get no satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones.  Volume was at 50% and sound definition was good. But lower than 50%, i started to lose the sound definition.  What is interesting though was that the Sony at a volume of 10/30 matches the volume level of the iPod at 50% approximately. Of course the Sony sounded much better, sound was definitely warmer and more defined in all ranges.  Even at a lower volume on the Sony, say 5/30, the sound retained the track's definition but at a lower decibel. I can definitely see why this player got the CNET's Editor's choice, this player really makes me appreciate the artist's work!

<Content>I recently purchased this player on the strength of the glowing reviews I read and with some wishful thinking that Sony had at last removed its proprietary limits.   It IS a good player, but I discovered it would not work with Rhapsody to Go.  Both Sony and Rhapsody confirmed this.  Before buying, verify that it will work with the subscription service you plan to use with it.   I will reluctantly  return my Walkman to Amazon.

This passes all the teste with flying colors.  I use a Mac, and the drag-n-drop features work flawlessly.  The sound is dynamic whether I'm using the stock phones (pretty darn good ones) or plugging it into my car stereo. I listen primarily to Americana/bluegrass and West Coast blues and it handles low and high range just fine.  My only gripe and the reason for no 5th star is the proprietary cable (no std USB), but that's a minor complaint. This is a superior MP3 player and I plan to get plenty of use from it.

<Title>so much better then my old I-Pod
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My old ipod fell apart a few weeks ago and the search was on for a new mp3 player, I was thinking about a zune, because i bought one for my wife and actually liked it, but didn't want her music on my player and visa versa.  So I stumbled upon this little thing.  Why sony is not promoting this mp3 player better is beyond me. now that i've had it for about 2 weeks now and have everything on it like, photos and music, I know without a doubt this was the best choice for me. fits in my pocket perfectly my old 30 gig ipod was a little uncomfortable. The sound quality is amazing.  the battery life is insanely long, photo resolution is crisp and clean. I like being able to zoom in close on a cd and show my friends what i'm listening to if they like it.  I can't see myself ever going back to apple.  Sony had let me down a few times in the past but this was a nice suprise and a first step at them regaining some confidence in me and buying there products again.  I hope in time they make some models with my space, but I can live with the 8 gig for now, and like a few other people have said, the cord, it needs to be about 3-6 inches longer and that's it, i'm 5' 10" and at the gym it tends to tug on my ear and that is about the only complaint I have about this little wonder.  If you are contemplating an 8 gig mp3 player and can't decide between apple,microsoft or Sony,  Sony have jumped into my number 1 spot followed by my wifes zune. you absolutely can't go wrong with this machine.  buy it.  glad I did.
