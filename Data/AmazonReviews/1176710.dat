<Title>Good Value for the Price but is Also Now Obsolescent
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As the title states, the Dell Digital Jukebox is a good value for the price. The construction is sturdy and the unit's controls are both well placed and intuitive. It is also properly proportioned though it may be slightly on the heavy side. Batterly life is excellent. The best feature is the scroll log as it compares favorably to the iPod's scroll wheel.  Now for the bad news, the unit is now obsolescent. It does not presently support Napster's and others "Playforsure" WMA subscription format, meaning you cannot use this First generation Dell unit for those subscription services. Dell states that it has not "yet" have a Firmware update for the Jukebox to make it compatible with Playforsure. What that means is that it is not likely to ever have a Firmware update to make it compatible with Playforsure.  There is also the bundled software. MusicMatch provides an interface between your computer and the Jukebox. MusicMatch is clumsy and not intuitive and also has the nasty habit of locking up. One can also transfer music by right clicking on MP3 or WMA files and sending them to the connected Jukebox. Luckily, there is also the DellDJ explorer which is serviceable.  Finally, for the bad news, there is no built-in FM tuner.   If you are looking for a basic "no frills" MP3 player, the Dell Digital Jukebox is a good choice. If you are looking for extras as well as the ability to use the MP3 player for subscription based Music Services, look elsewhere.

<Title>Don't Buy Dell DJ's
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like ther other cases my DJ 20 lasted only one year ans to quote Dell rep. "Your DJ has died and cannot be repaired" you can buy a replacement for $150.00. Sad thing is that it was the SECOND Dj that they had sent me that died and it froze up like the other ones you have read about. These units have a manufactures defect..don't buy them, like other Dell products ...junk.

<Title>I love my dell dj
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my dell dj 20gb version used from a pawn shop almost 2 years ago. I have never had any problems with it. Found it easy to use. I was uploading mp3/wma files to it within 30 min., after downloading some albums and the software. I have tried the Apple ipod, and comparing the two I found the use of the dell more practicle and easier to use. I love creative nomads, but few of them hold enough music for my tastes. In my opinion, I have yet found another mp3 player that is as easy to use. I personally have never had a problem with the software (the most common problem with other mp3 players), or the hardware. I couldn't be happier.

<Title>Too Many Problems
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a version of this for my 15 year old son about a year ago. We bought the Dell Pocket DJ and there has been problem after problem with it. When the first one arriaved, the volume could not ajust. It stayed on one value, which only dogs could hear. The second one we got worked for a while and we thought it was ok, but then later, the play button did not work. We sent that in to get a new one, only to find out they discontinued it, and any one we got for fixing would be refurbished. Ok, fine. The third one could not hold it's charge. The battery did not last as long as it should. My son would turn it off at night, and in the morning the battery would be dead. The fourth one we got was ok for a while. Then, one day the songs just stopped tranfering from the computer to the mp3 player. We went to tech support. It said to enter the serial code. It said it was located under the barcode. Only one problem, the barcode and everything on that sticker had been wiped after repeated use. We could not get tech support for it. I decided to call customer serivce and ask how to get tech support without a serial number. All tha lady did was give us the number for tech support. No help at all. Later on the tranfering worked, but for a month it did not. My adivce :don't buy any Dell DJ

<Title>Do NOT buy the Dell DJ (20 or any one from Dell!)
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Dell should stick with its dayjob: PCs & printers. Portable music devices, is just NOT their thing. I first bought the Dell DJ 5G: endless problems with it - every problem you could think of. I have made numerous phone calls to their tech support, spent HOURS trying to repair it - FIVE UNITS LATER, they sent me the Dell 20 (the price went down, which was equal to the original price I paid).  So - I have the Dell 20g, and it DOES NOT work with Napster. I have spent HOURS with Napster tech support - uninstalled and reinstalled Napster, DRM files, Windows Media Player; everything they told me to do - twice over.  It does not work. I would NOT recommend ANY OF DELL'S pocket DJ's. You can have mine for free!  If you know of where I can get a) a new player and b) an online subscription To-Go, with a portable device, I'd appreciate your recommendation.  Thank you. -Rebecca  New York rebeccany30@yahoo.com

<Title>fantastic audio player
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a dj 15gb which I had now for approximately three years.  I love it. I read the reviews that the player will not support playforsure audio.  This is totally incorrect.  I download music from Walmart and all their music is in the playforsure format. I never had a problem using MusicMatch to download audio onto my dj.  The dj controls are easy to navigate. My only compliant is that there is no review button.  The sound is superb, I suggest you purchase KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs. I previously owned a RCA Lyra which had a FM transmitter.  It was a waste of money, because I never listened to FM. What is the purpose of a FM transmitter when you have your own music to listen to? I would never consider owning an ipod, for all my downloaded music is in the playforsure format, which ipod definitely does not support.  Sony ipod is a rip off, because it does not allow you to use any other format, except itunes.  An ipod is NOT the best or economically audio player. It is only a popular audio player.

<Title>Dell DJ 20
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Dell DJ for over 2 years now. In all that time it's only locked up on me three times which was easily remedied by resetting. I've still got a long way to go to fill up the hard drive, it's about 9GB full and I've got all the songs I'll ever need to listen to. I don't use MusicMatch to transfer songs over. I don't think the application is all that great. I use RealPlayer instead and it works like a charm. It's literally drag and drop from my hard drive to my player. For considerably less money than an IPod, which by the way is not without some very negative reviews, I've been very pleased with my purchase.

<Title>Incredible Mp3 Player
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a first generation Dell DJ 15 gb Juxebox in June of 2004 for $199.  Since that time I've had zero problems or complaints.    The battery life is still easily 9+ hours It's survived numerous very hard falls without a problem Everything works perfectly  The only problem I had was with the default Musicmatch software it installs, but it also gives you the option of Dell DJ Explorer software which is as easy and intuitive to use as Windows.  For Christmas I was looking for an mp3 player for my brother and couldn't find anything that came close to the memory storage and quality I bought in 2004 under $200.  I ended up buying a creative zen player and the results were dismal.    I can't believe Dell discontinued such a fine product.  Although I've read about problems with the second generation DJs, I've never heard or read about anyone that had reasonable complaints with the first generation players.  The only complaints I've heard have been with the player's size and with its scrolling wheel.  1. While the player is bigger and heavier than an ipod, it's only about the size of a pack of cards, which is fine by me.  Plus the well constructed and durable frame of the player beats any ipod and provides unparalled protection.  2. The scrolling wheel may be difficult for some to use effectively at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually faster than the ipod.  To test this theory I had a race between two of my friends (both ipod owners) and myself to see who could access specific songs and artists the fastest.  The scrolling capabilities of the Dell won hands down.  This is especially true for people who have large amounts of music.  If I was to buy a new mp3 player I would buy the ipod video, but only because its video playing ability is surperlative.  However if video is not important to you, I would highly recommend purchasing the 1st generation dell dj over any other mp3 player on the market.  I've owned an mp3 player since 2000 and have read literally thousands of reviews on different players.  The 1st generation Dell DJ is hands down the best deal out there for your money as long as your priorities are storage space, battery life, and reliable playback.  Note: I'm not one to write reviews, especially long drawn out reviews like this, but there has never been any other electronics product I've ever owned that has served me on a daily basis as reliably as this mp3 player.

<Title>Why on Earth did Dell discontinue these?  They're great!
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Dell DJ.  20 gig hard drive that can hold 10,000 songs, great sound quality and stability, easy-to-use interface, seriously, what could be better?  I love being able to store every single song I own on such a little device.  I have a lot of music (over 5,600 songs) so the extra storage space is greatly needed.  And it sounds great!  I love the earbuds that it came with, except I sometimes have trouble getting them to stay in my ear.  I also bought a cassette adapter so I can take my music on the road.  Another feature I like is the ability to create a playlist on the machine itself.  With the iPod mini I used to have, the only way to create a playlist was on the computer.  The MusicMatch Jukebox softeware is not the most user friendly or the most reliable, but it gets the job done.    This is an excellent player all the way around.  Dell discontinued these, so you might have to do some hunting in order to find one (I suggest eBay), but it will be well worth your invested time and money.

<Title>One of the Best buys I ever made!
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought my Dell DJ20 several years ago with my computer. I'm no techno-geek & knew very little about these mp3 players.   I have a physical disability which affects my hand dexterity, which made switching discs often in a disc player frustrating! My DJ has been a joy, 1350 tracks loaded & still plenty of space! It's not very heavy, fits in a pocket, & the buttons are fairly easy to use, (On/Off requires more pressure & holding for a few seconds - but at least to turn it off you can also just press pause & let the auto-off engage).To be able to build playlists & even repeat them allows a day filled with the songs I love - not what some radio station with bad dj's & tons of commercials picks!  The musicmatch sync can be a pain at times, but bearable considering the benefits.  I've wanted a second one just to load my audio books & now that I've found out Dell discontinued them, I'd better hurry!    If anyone from Dell reads this, please bring these back!!!

PLus! ipod has itunes to go with it. If you ask me i think dell should stink with its comp and printers. NOT MADE FOR MP3 PLAYERS!

<Title>3 years and going strong!
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my 15 GB Dell DJ in May 2004. I've had it for 3 years and have no complaints! My sister has already had to buy a new iPod after her battery wore out in 1.5 years; my Dell still plays for hours before it needs recharging. If you care about functionality and a good, quality product, this is for you. It's very easy to use with a home, scroll, and back button similar to web browsing. Dell also has great customer support for these. This thing is also very tough - it has traveled with me to three other countries, fallen off my treadmill several times, and fallen onto concrete quite a bit (I'm not the easiest on things) and is still going strong! My first and only review I'll write for something, but I really love mine!

<Title>Great
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a Dell DJ for almost 4 years and loved it.  It got stolen 3 weeks ago out of my car so I am going the Ipod route now.  Things I loved about the DJ... Intuitive interface, Solid as a brick (I dropped mine many times, and punished the hell out of it.  Eventually I just accepted the fact that it wasn't going to break and just did whatever I wanted with it. ex. throw it in my bag.)  Battery is pretty good,  Sound is as good as an ipod. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles an ipod does but it is a heck of a good machine in my opinion.

<Title>It's a great mp3 player
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I won my Dell DJ (15GB version), so didn't pay anything for it. I've had it for a few years now and it's sadly obsolete - big and square and heavy....but it still holds more music than you'll listen to in six months, and the battery lasts 20 hours which is longer than some these days.  I use it mainly in the car, on flights, and at work.  I can plug the adapter into an inverter in the car for power, so for long road trips it is perfect.  It also works with Linux, which is a big plus for me.

<Title>Was nice, Until it died on me...
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Dell DJ in the spring of 2004.  It was a great little MP3 player with long battery life and good audio.  It wasn't long after I had it until the headphones that came with the DJ got a short in them and quit playing.  So I contacted Dell support and they sent me another pair ASAP only to have them do the exact same thing.  The plastic around the plug is very cheaply made and prone to cracking, which was the source of the problem.  Then one day in the spring of 2006 I was walking on the tread mill listening to my DJ when it suddenly stopped playing.  Something had went wrong with the hard drive and nothing I could do would make it work again.  So I tossed it in the trash and bought an iPod which was much better.
