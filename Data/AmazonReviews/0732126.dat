<Title>Excellent video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 604 30GB is fantastic. video quality is amazing, dvd quality, and it supports DIVX although this is not mentioned in the literature.  The audio quality is very good too, though the earpieces could be more comfortable.  It is a pity that it didnt have a USB input. Note however that recording can only be done if you buy the optional DVR station (which i did, for $100) Downloading movies and stuff is very quick. Synchronisation with Media Player is good but has a few quirks at times.  Battery life for audio is good, but video is just about 2 hours.  The player is rather bulky and not ideal for carrying in your pocket.  You also need to invest in a proper leather case. That which is supplied is pathetic.

<Title>The perfect multimedia viewer!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm on my second Archos player and this is the one to beat. The wide-screen is huge compared to my old 2.2 inch screen, the controls are simple and intuitive, the KICKSTAND is a Great Improvement (it allows the unit to sit up at a 15 degree angle so you can watch movies hands free), user replacable battery (you can get extra ones too), Excellent photo viewer, NON-proprietary file formats (not locked down to one format for videos), built in speaker and microphone!  The not so great: Lets face it. Earbuds don't fit most peoples ears so great. The supplied ones are good but you should go out and buy a pair that fit into you ears. Sony makes a pretty good, inexpensive set. The supplied case is a dog. It's a nylon sack that offers no protection.  That's it. Go out and try one. You won't be sorry.

<Title>I love it. (repeat 3 times)
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very solid product. Very satisfied.  I did a lot of research (Internet) before purchasing. Was able to play with it in-store before purchase at a Sharper Image. Have not tried any other devices. What was important to me? Size, reputation of Archos, quality and feel of unit, options, many glowing reviews out there, and the ability to transfer photos from digital camera.  Experience so far: Easy to use, great screen, great performance, no skimping on construction - feels solid and looks really great. I bought both plug-ins, as well as the helmet cam.  All work flawlessly.  Tech Support great - I called them with questions about plug-ins before I purchased. Less than 5 min wait, very helpful.  For the money spent, my expectations, and the product delivered: No regrets.  Couldn't be more pleased.

<Title>It's a great little video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 604 for recording video in odd places, like on a roller coaster for instance.  At first I was quite disappointed becasue it doesn't have any native way of inputing video, you have to buy a cam or adapter from Archos.  Well, when I first got this unit in September I got what I thought was the helmet cam to go with it but it turned out to be the helmet cam for the older av500 series.  Neither the adapter or camera were available at that time.  So after much waiting I ordered the newly available travel adapter in early December, it finally arrived yesterday, 1-3-07.  I am frustrated that it took so long to arrive.  But it works wonderfully, I hooked up an external camera to it (the camera needed it's own power) and it worked great.  I connected it to a TV video source and again it worked just great.   So, in the end, it took 4 months to get the parts together to use it as I wanted but it works very nicely. Yes, it plays other videos I've downloaded to it too and does a good job.  It works as an MP3 player too, but hey, that's what my Ipod's for.   My one big concern it that I live in fear of breaking that nice big screen while it's in my pocket, or fanny pack while using it in the field.  A hard case would be nice but it'd have to fit over the travel adapter too in order to be useful. Oh, one gripe, why o why couldn't they just have included an input jack on the unit for video thus eliminating the need for the travel adapter??? Finally, if you've got the money, and need it, buy it, it works great. Mike

<Title>Excellent Product
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading numerous reviews, and searching for at least a month, I finally decided on the Archos product line.  They have the absolute best bang for the buck, hands down. I won't say anything bad about the other devices that are in the same category as this device.. other than none of them can compare to the features, support, and quality of this product. Let's just say that the screen and menu system is the best that I've found, when it comes to the other ones out there in this models range.  I actually did have to contact support because of a small problem with downloading one of the additional plug-ins off of the web site. I received help, and had the plug-in installed no more than 5 minutes later. Very fast and helpful support team.  The best feature is price vs what you get. Sure, having a record feature might be nice to some, but I'm not one of those folks. Having the ability to buy it later if I change my mind is very nice. I bought it for my wife for her birthday, and she has enjoyed it immensely as well. This device has the absolute best picture viewing ability (zoomed thumbnails on roll over, etc.), which is mainly what she wanted it for.  If you buy this device, or any other Archos product that supports them, I highly recommend that you buy the additional plug-ins. Well worth the small change for the functionality on the device. It would have been nice to incorporate them into the device on purchase, but having them so cheap for what you get was fine by me.

<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment you pick up the Archos 604 from its box, it has the look and feel of a quality product, and by many accounts, it is. The brilliant 4.3 inch screen puts it in a class by itself. This is why I bought this PMP over all the others. The 604 does connect easily to a PC and the transfer of videos, music and photos is quick and easy. I did have to spend a few moments going over the website instruction manual to figure out a couple of things - and it does take about a day to get use to the buttons - but all-in-all, this is a very good Personal Media Player. In a perfect world, I would like to see the screen a tad brighter and the audio output a little stronger. I am not crazy about having to go to the website to pay for a number of firmware updates, but conisdering all the little nice features about this PMP, you tend to overlook some of the short falls. The Archos 604 is a very nice piece of equipment - perfect for traveling or something to use around the home or office.

<Content>Buy this player if you are not sure. I spent a month looking at every review and every spec and this is by far the best PVP, or even mp3 player around. The ONLY thing that I was disappointed with is the charging through the USB cord. I bought a 30$ charger on amazon, and now can charge with any outlet.  The resolution is far beyond what you will ever need, and it stores more than enough video for vacation. Screw the wi-fi model, buy this one!

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good device as a viewer for pictures, however movie downloads are a bit more complicated. We tried to click and drag, use Windows media syncro and it didn't see how to get files into the device (as the files come up separate and don't integrate). The easy way is to buy for $100. USD the Archos docking cradle and record off Dish, VCR, DVD or TV. It is slim and fits into your pocket in it's case, has good resolution for viewing and is fairly simple to learn to use. Picture files are easy to download and has a scrolling picture viewer in 3D or flip and fade. You can also use it to carry business files around if you so needed. Overall is it good technology and seems fairly substancial.     Jazzbebop7

<Content>Incredible device. I have been watching this courtesy of Maxmim PC and they reviewed the 604 recently I decided to get this item ($312). This blows every other Digatal LCD player away. 4.3" WS 16:9 LCD is truly amazing and it reads PDF's, plays music, holds photos, is a sports recorder, a dvr and plays DIVX/XVID avi out of the box. I paid 20 bux for mpeg 4 and VOB support and now it plays dectrypted dvds right out of folders. This is THE device to have ! Amazon was the cheapest by 30 bux and I was shipped fast and arrived perfect. Will shop again!

<Title>One serious little toy
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment I saw it online, I knew that this was my son's Christmas present.  We were not disappointed.  Battery life is good, operation is reasonably easy, good feature set, beautiful screen.  Perhaps most impressive of all is the obvious feeling of "fineness" and quality.  It's not light as a feather or tiny; you *do* have to pay extra for one or two video drivers; and the user interface isn't perfect.  But it gets the job done, and I anticipate that we'll be happy with the 604 for quite a long time.

<Title>Dude, Sweeet!
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Product is absolutely fab darlings! I've just recently bought my Archos and have had it now for about a month and am enjoying every inch of it. All the great things about it have been mentioned in the other reviews, but the thing that I just went ga-ga for is not having to pay to put movies on this thing. Also, I'm not a big fan of the questionable things we view in movies; every now and then I'd just like to watch a wholesome movie not tainted with drugs, sex, profanity, and violence. So when I'm recording movies on my Archos I like to do what movie makers call, "jump cuts," where I pause the recording when a scene in a movie comes up that I don't care for viewing, and resume recording when its over. So when I finally watch the movie, any contents I didn't want in it won't be. How cool is that?! Works out great with the kiddies.   The Archos doesn't hurt your pockets either. Again, as was mentioned before, its reasonably priced for all the things you can do with it unlike the ipod. Its funny cause each time I buy a media player or MP3 player I compare them to those rinky dink iPods, but they can never measure up. You buy an iPod for this price you get music, videos, and pictures. You by the Archos you get movies, TV shows, music, photos, digital camera connection capability, PDF capability (my favorite), audio recording (also my favorite), TV playback with the DVR dock station, or all these tarveling with the DVR Travel Dock. Is that a Steal or what?   The only things I didn't like about the Archos 604, which wasn't enough to make me get rid of it or not purchase it, is the fact that the buttons don't light up(making it hard to navigate at night or if you just happen to be in a dark area; this can be remedied by buying the Archos' with the touch screens), and it didn't have an FM tunner(not that it really needs this feature, but it couldn't hurt.).   I Compared the Archos to the Zen that I have by Creative. And I must say, although they're both great buys, I use my Archos the most. I don't see why more people don't use these as opposed to the iPod. And if it appears right now that I'm abasing ipod, I'm not. They're just not the better buy.

<Title>Get the dock
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this unit from Amazon last May and use it primarily for travel.  Before a trip, I choose some interesting movies from Netflix, pop the movie in my DVD player and record it to the Archos.  The screen is so nice that people sitting by me on airplanes ask about it.    Since I have used it for several months, I have some observations:  1.  With the dock (which, in my opinion, should be included with it), you can record directly from a DVD player or DVR.  I have recorded programs on my Dish Network DVR and then just played them later, recording them to the Archos.  2.  On an airplane, the audio is really too low (even at full blast) unless you have noise canceling headphones.  I tried the earbuds and could hardly hear my movies.  My Bose noise-canceling headphones give me a great experience with the Archos on an airplane.  3.  I subscribed to Urge subscription music, which was dovetailed with Windows Media Player 11, and subscription music worked fine.  I downloaded lots of subscription music to the Archos and as long as you did a sync at least once a month, the DRM dates would be updated by WMP automatically.  Alas, Urge merged with Rhapsody a few weeks ago and guess what?  Rhapsody is not compatible with the Archos.  Neither is Napster.  So if you use subscription music, this player isn't much good.  Obviously, your purchased music and CD rips work fine on it.  4.  I would like to see a better way to manage files on it.  Deleting files from it to make room on the hard drive is easy enough, but I haven't found a way to delete whole folders.  For example, I can easily delete individual songs from an album, but there's nothing on the menu that lets you delete the album all at once.  Little quirks like that make using it take some getting used to.    5.  It is a little heaver than most similar devices, and I haven't found it very good if I am walking or running ... a smaller mp3 player would be better for that.  But for video during travel, it can't be beat.  Overall, I consider this a good purchase and love my unit.  I bought an extra battery (video sucks battery pretty good, but I can generally watch at least 2 full-length movies before the battery dies) and the dock, and would highly recommend both purchases if you want to use this unit.  Of course that adds to the overall price so keep that in mind when comparing, at least if you want to get full functionality from it.

<Title>Great for watching movies, not so much for audio on the go.
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Archos 604 30gb for about 2 months now, and I've been using it practically every day.  It's a fantastic PVP, and when it comes to watching videos on the go, I think the screen size is right in the sweet spot.  Any smaller (I used to have a Zen Vision: M) and you tend to get eye strain or motion sickness; any bigger and it becomes too heavy.  Anyway, here are my major pros and cons:  Pros *Great screen! The resolution is not the highest out there, but the size and contrast keep videos looking great. I Compared it with my friend's Zen Vision and his resolution was a bit sharper, but the Archos' viewing angle was far superior.  *Audio quality is great, and audio enhancements like an EQ and Bass Boost are included.  *Nice option between Mass Storage Device or Win. Media device.  *Fantastic base price. Mine was a steal at $180 refurbished.   Cons: *Silly button layout that takes some getting used to and requires two hands (one to support the device, one to push buttons) to operate. Very difficult to operate blindly.  *Blasdesign. Ok let me be honest... It's just plain ugly compared to the slick curves of the Zen or iPod product lines.  *Limited video format support out of the box. You can purchase an upgrade for $20.  and the most nagging con... *DELICATE!! I know it has a spinning physical hard drive in there, but this thing is touchy to the point of frustration. Just the slightest tap or bump to the device while it's reading the drive will cause it to lock up, at which point you have to remove the battery (!) and press a Reset button with a pointy object. You don't lose any data except the time and date, but I must admit I feel pretty darn silly dismantling my device and resetting it in the train, on the street, at work, walking around, etc etc. I can honestly say it's crashed 40 - 50 times already in the past 2 months. I'm sure these crashes will destroy the drive eventually as well.  The bottom line: If you are like me and like to listen to music on the go, make sure you stuff this thing into the included case (at which point it's the size of a small book), or be ready for lots of hard disk lockups. But load this baby up with some TV episodes or Movies, find a nice comfy place to sit, and the Archos 604 with its great screen and adequate battery life (about 4 hrs) really shines.

<Title>Archos 604 is perfect for video on the go
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before buying this product, I was actually looking at other DVR's but I didn't like the fact that I could not record all content I can view on TV.  So pairing the Archos 604 with the docking station not only gave me the ability to record anything that I can view on my TV, it also gave me portability.  Another thing that drew me more toward this unit/dock combo, was the price.  Around $390.00 was an excellent price for the functionality and portability and a regular DVR will run you between $200.00 and $300.00.  All and All I throughly enjoy my Archos 604 but I didn't give it 5 stars becasue I expected the playback quality to be a little better when viewing on my TV.  Now I have to mention that I am using the Composite Video and Audio outputs (not the Component output) attached to a 40" SONY Bravia HDTV (KDL-40V2500) and this may be something I can correct by tweaking the settings and using Component video.  I'm not sure.  But viewing on the unit itself is CRYSTAL CLEAR!!!

<Content>This unit is great. Nice heft to it. Does not feel like a cheap platic toy. The size is pefect and while it is a bit too big for my pants pocket, it does fit.  The picture and video quality is perfect. The films do not lag or pixelate in the least bit. Very smooth and easy instructions that will soon become second nature to navigate. Files are loaded with a very easy drag-n-drop feature. The photo viewer and slideshow are very nice as well.  The only negatives I have is that the sound is horribly low (even at full volume) you will HAVE to use earphones or buy an small external speaker at Best Buy for a couple of bucks. Also, in order to play VOB files you MUST download a CINEMA plug-in for $19.99 from the ARCHOS web page. Very easy to install and set-up. I just don't understand wy this wasn't part ofthe program to start with. Kind of cheesy on their part.  Overall, if you love to watch TV or movies...you'll really like this unit. I haven't recieved my TV dock yet, so I can't comment on that.  So far...I am really enjoying this. :-)

<Title>Keep Your Receipt!
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I opened my Archos 604 package on January 11th, 2007.  The machine was sleek, sexy, the protective cover didn't have bubbles (so I just kept it on).  It was exciting.  After having read several reviews though, a part of me remained cautious.  I kept the packaging it came in, the reciept... everything.  Archos simply has terrible customer service, and you have to be prepared!  I let it charge for the 2+ hours it said on the instructions, loaded my music, photos, videos, everything!  It worked like a charm, and I loved it so much! With the PDF viewer, I used it as an eBook as well, taking along my favorite books, comics, heck even a D&D companion guide or two (or ten).  The date is now February 2, 2007.  I've had my archos for less than a month, and now it simply doesn't work.  The battery has always been charged according to the directions. I have installed the latest firmware, and exhausted all of the troubleshooting forums that google could scrounge up, and there is no hope.  The archos turns on, then shuts down after five seconds or less.  That said, why didn't I give it a score of 1?  Here's a list of pros and cons as I saw it.  Pros: * 4.3 inch scratch resistant screen with great viewing angle. * Ultra long battery life * Headphones in the package sound great with their own volume control * Gunmetal exterior is rather sexy * Will actually fit in your pocket  Cons: * Obviously... it doesnt work * Archos has terrible customer service * Navigation is not intuitive * Documentation is lacking * You have to buy accessories to access the device's potential * No FM radio  Overall, until it stopped working, I loved the device. So if you want to risk it, then risk it.  Just KEEP THE RECEIPT!  AND THE PACKAGING IT CAME IN! Make sure you review any return policy associated with the device, no matter who you buy it from.

<Title>Windows, step down. This OS is worse. More bugs than a jungle.
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am incredibly upset with my purchase of the Archos 604. Out of the box, this pseudo-entertainment center rocked and did everything it was supposed to, but about a month into the purchase loomed a very ugly problem. Cut to the chase, this product is horrible. If it's not suffering from one malfunction it will invent another. I've had so many "corrupt files" that I might blow my brains out. For whatever reason, this device likes to shut down in the middle of transferring to and from the computer, making it impossible to get a whole song on, much less a whole album.  Ah, but it gets worse. You only think it's working when all of a sudden it just freezes! Why? I have no clue! It takes forever to load all my songs because it uses a hard drive, it takes forever to find a song because the hard drive slows down when you try to file through 3000 songs, and it takes forever to get used to the HORRIBLE buttons on the side. Half the time I press the wrong button and then my song ends and I can't get the hard drive to load it back up! It drives me absolutely crazy!  Besides the horrible layout of the buttons, the speaker is next to worthless; if you crank up the volume all the way the speaker fizzles and gives you a horrible mess of a noise.  The only good thing is that the clarity of the screen is fantastic. It makes my images look crystal clear and my HD videos look as good as my HDTV. That is, if you can get the confounded thing to actually play my videos. Maybe I got a dud and I haven't tried contacting Archos, but I will asap. I thought I should let everyone know to stay away from this product as I know there are many others out there just like it. I even bought the DVR station (which is cool and would be perfect if the actual Archos would work) but I cannot say I'm pleased in any way with my purchase. I just hope I get some refund for this.

<Title>Returned because of major issues with PlaysForSure media
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Note:  I updated this review because the problem is more serious than I thought earlier.  Amazon does not allow reviewers to change reviews to one star, but I would downgrade my rating if I could.  -------------------------  In some cases, I agree with many of the positive reviews given by other reviewers.  The screen is bright, the interface is intuitive, and most features work well.  However, since I bought the player I encountered an issue where I would plug the USB cable in, select "connect as Windows Media Device", and click OK.  When I opened Napster or tried to view files on the device, it crashed and rebooted to the ARCHOS logo.  I called tech support, which was very helpful, and they got an answer to me within two minutes: that the cause of my problems is that ARCHOS does not support Windows Media Player 11.  They require everyone to downgrade to WMP 10 and plan to address the issue in a "future firmware upgrade."  However, I downgraded to WMP 10 and the problem was not solved.  I called again and they said I had a defective product.  I returned it and got another, but the same problem exists.  I cannot use Napster with this player, and since I listen to music more than I watch videos, this device is useless to me.  I returned it for a refund and bought a Creative Zen Vision W instead.  It really is a shame.  This would by far be the best player on the market if ARCHOS would resolve their software issues.  As it is, though, there are just too many bugs to make this player worth purchasing.

<Title>Cool device, but connectivity problems 
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family. The device didn't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation. My opinion quickly changed when I ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it. While I was able to download and synchronize (via Windows Media Player) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn't recognized as a USB device anymore and also froze the "external hardware" management function on my PC.  Right now I cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive, and so far customer service at Archos has not been able to help me, blaming the problem on driver issues on my PC (seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops), a  really frustrating experience. Seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced, so this may not be as isolated as I thought.

<Title>100 stars
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know what these other reviews about it not working with windows media player are about, but I love this thing. I always connect it to my pc as a hard drive to add files to so maybe that's why mine doesn't crash on me. Anyway, the screen is like a little plasma tv. Not Exaggerating. Very Clear. The hard drive is more than enough space. I record movies from my dvd player (optional dvr station needed to do so, about 70 dollars at walmart) which on dvd is about 5 gigs, but when recorded to the archos its only about 1 gig for a 90 minute movie. Same when recording shows off the tv. If you are thinking about buying a ipod video, i highly suggest looking at a archos first. The only bad things about it are: you have to pay extra for the dvr function the protective bag that comes with it is useless it only charges by usb unless you have the dvr station the speaker is trash, but you can buy add on speakers  Thats about it though...everything else is very good. And also, if you want to play any video format other than avi, you have to download the plugins from their website and they charge like 20 dollars for it,,,,but if you are smart like me, all you need to do is download a free video converter from the net and just convert everything you need to avi. If you record from the dvr station (tv,dvd player,cable box,satellite,xbox 360,etc) then it automatically converts it to avi for you. I can go on and on about this thing, but my hands are getting tired. Please don't let these negative reviews about crashing with windows media player stop you from getting one..just don't use media player to sync your files. Just drag and drop like a regular hard drive. This is one of the best things i have ever bought.

<Title>Excellent Product. Would Recommend with some suggestions for ARCHOS
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own just about every tech device on this planet. My wife and I like to travel and I decided to pick up an ARCHOS 604 for her (so she would be able to watch her favorite shows at the airport). The pictures of this portable media player online does not do it justice. When I opened the box, I was surprised to see how sleek and cool it looked. It even felt good in my hands. The Wide Screen is awesome compared to my ipod and zune. I was also surprised at the sound of it when I used my earphones. Prior to buying the Archos, I read reviews about the soft sound and that it would be hard to listen while in an airport. I beg to differ. The sound is very good and the picture is quite phenomenal. I especially like the way they have the volume control on the ear pieces line. Very convenient! The only reason I did not rate this product as a 5 star is because of the way it is offered to the consumer. I had to separately buy: a better case, a dvr docking station and also had to buy the plug ins to play podcasts and other things on it. This device is so awesome with all of the optional accessories and plug-ins--However, Archos makes it inconvenient for the consumer when they don't include everything in a nice package (I am the type of consumer who likes to have everything ready to go out of the box!). Overall, I have to say it is a winner when combined with Amazon movie downloads and cinemanow. The multi functionality for the Archos makes it the only device you need for your vacations. Plays music, Captures your digital camera pictures and videos. Able to record live TV and back up your DVDs. I have read some reviews about the difficulty of using the graphic user interface and the difficult time people had using the navigation toggle controls--I must say that I don't find anything wrong with them. I am easily able to navigate and use the controls. Sure it is not as easy like an ipod or zune, but it is just as functional and I don't have any problems bringing up the movies, music or photos I want. After working on this Archos for my wife, I am seriously thinking about putting my ipod away and buying another Archos for me! I really recommend this portable media player. I think it is the best out on the market at this time.

<Title>Couldn't Have Choosen Better
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really did my homework before choosing this device, and I'm glad I did. It was time I jumped into the digital age, and for a brief moment I considered buying a video Ipod, but I quickly learned that Archos is the way to go for the movie/TV buff.   All of the great reviews for the Archos 604 stand true. I'm not the most tech savy person out there, and I have a very easy time utilizing all the features of my new toy. There's no software to install; just plug in the USB cord and go. It's user friendly in that the buttons are mostly intuitive, the drag-and-drop capability makes it simple to copy files from a PC, and navigating the menus are a snap. The LCD screen is beautiful. The picture is crisp and crystal clear even outdoors. The external speaker is a nice feature that a lot of other PMPs don't offer, and the sound is okay for what it is, but the headphones offer great quality. The volume control in the cord is awesome. I thought I was going to have to buy a storage case and was pleased to find that wasn't the case. The pouch that everyone hated so much has been replaced by a semi-hard case that envelopes the device. It holds it securely, leaving the headphone jack exposed for easy access. I haven't purchased the DVR docking station yet, but I'm excited to test it out.   Overall, I highly recommend this device. It's well worth the price for the pop-culture fan who's always on the go.

<Content>I would give this product 10 stars if I could! I've had the unit for 4 months and have absolutely no complaints! I love love love it!  Riding the train to work = TV time. No more in my tent for 12 hours waiting for the sun. Just pull out the Archos and watch a TV show or a movie! Drag and drop your shows or tunes or any files onto the HD. No iTunes to "manage" your stuff. Plays many many formats! Man, I just love this thing! One of the best purchases I've ever made!  I'd buy it again and again. Buyers may want to pick up the 605 which will be out in Sept. which has a little better resolution. I'm such a fan I may pick one of those up too.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Functionally, this product is pretty sweet. It plays videos, the image looks great and the Cinema plug-in let me play broadcasts recorded on my PC with DirecTV.  However, I really bought it for the helmet-mount camera recording feature. And after recording several videos it stopped playing back music and video, would not connect to the computer or recharge and I had to send it in to be serviced. Their customer support has a very frustrating web interface - I wouldn't even bother with it because the info they ask for on the webform, they ask for again by e-mail. I had more success calling the toll free number and waiting for a live customer support person.  Anyhow, I just got my unit back. It was reformatted which I expected - lost many gig of ripped music but my bad, didn't make a backup. However they changed the internal product key (different from the firmware version or serial number) and the $30 Cinema plug-in is keyed to that. So the one I purchased and installed before doesn't work!!!  Hello???  Is anybody thinking up there? If you're going to charge for all these add-ons you should have the courtesty to reinstall them or at the very least enable me to reinstall them.  I just sent another e-mail to their customer support. We'll see what happens. If they can't make it right I will reduce my rating to 1 star. If they are somewhat responsive, maybe I'll bump it up to 3.  I'd like to recommend this product but I think they've spread themselves too thin and are still trying to work the bugs out of their products and support procedures. Maybe they'll get them right eventually.

<Content>This is a great personal media player, I've used it to play movies, MP3 Music, and podcasts.  The sound quality it top notch, the video quality is beyond that.  If you are looking for a good all around personal media player, you can't go wrong with the Archos.  Another nice feature of this unit is that you can use it as an external USB2.0 hard drive.  I no longer use my thumb drive, I just carry this around with me, and keep my key files on it.

<Title>Excellent Video, Poor Audio
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Video display is excellent even when seen at 45 degrees angle, excellent recording and was even able to record movies I rented from Netflix. I have no technical problems with the unit I got. From personal experience the 30 gb unit could only hold no more than 15 full length 2 hour movies. The only negative comment is the very poor audio. I was on a plane trip to the orient and was very disappointed that I did not heed someone's advise to buy a noise cancelling earphone. An earplug type would be useless. The audio of my home movies was so much better. If you plan on recording rented movies there is no need to buy anything else but the base station which I used to transfer photos, music and home movies. I consider this unit useless without the base station. This product is highly recommended but don't forget to buy the noise cancelling earphones for long plane trips to enjoy your videos.

<Title>Not an iPod Rival
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, this is nothing like an iPod. Archos cleverly are staying away from that battle and seem to be ploughing their own furrow with a portable media center as opposed to a pocket music player. To be honest if you are looking for something to listen too as you head to work then pick a Creative Zen or an iPod. If you travel a lot and get stuck in airports or long haul flights, then this is the beans. Video quality is excellent and the screen is well big enough not to be tiring. It will play pretty much everything although you have to buy a plug in if you want to record in anything but mpeg4. Doesn't seem to be much of an issue to me. I bought the optional DVR station and it does give the unit a bunch more flexibility and worth the few quid it cost. I also bought an additional battery - should give me enough to deal with one long haul flight of around ten hours video. One thing to note for those who don't live in the USA like me, you can choose to record and play in Pal rather than NTSC if you wish, which makes this a pretty flexible bit of gear. For the price it is just stunningly good value and well made with an aluminium case. I don't think it would take a big knock like my Zen has on occasion, but I guess it shouldn't be dropped. I did buy the foldaway case which but to be honest it's not much better than the supplied one with the only advantage being that it (precariously) will allow the player to stand at a viewing angle. If you want a totally flexible media player and recorder in a small package then this is it.

<Content>Bought this device and Fell in love with it.  The screen is great, The audio is excellent.  It also has a bass boost which I think is cool.  The only thing that I found as a problem was the $40 for the extra software it need to read mp4.  After putting my pictures on it I noticed it kept freezing when I tried to view them, but it was because the pictures were too large.  After changing the size to 1600x1200 it stopped gliching.  As far as the static I only notice it when I playback video that I recorded, and it's so minute that you won't really even notice it.  I would probably change this to a 4 3/4 stars

<Content>I just purchased the Archos 604 about 3weeks ago. So far so good. It interfaces very easily with the computer. Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos.  The only negative that I have so far is that the volume, at its highlest level, is difficult to hear on an airplane. You may need some noise canceling headphones.

<Title>The Archos 604 exceeded my expectations
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing little product. Bought it here at Amazon (best price plus I had a $25 bonus coupon from using my Amazon credit card). It arrived practically overnight even though I used free shipping. I bought the optional dvr dock to record and the plug-ins at the Archos website so it can play all my movies and clips. A couple of small issues were quickly and efficiently handled by Archos' excellent customer service and sales staff.  First off, the screen quality is perfect. I can very comfortably watch a full length movie on it.  I use it mostly at the gym while I am on the elliptical machine.  Makes an hour go by just like that.   I have recorded from every device imaginable, including my portable 7" DVD player. It hooks right up, you put your DVD in and record it onto the 604 in real time.  Plays back on the 604 flawlessly (but will not play back on a TV when the video is copy protected.) Attaching the 604 via a USB port to my PC, I simply drop in movies files (unprotected), pictures, and music from my PC. It's cool the way you can zoom in on pictures too. You can upload your pictures and then hook it up to play on tv with a nice slide show and your own music in the background. Plays your videos on tv too. Oh, and 30 GB's is more than enough space.  Don't spend the extra money just to get more GB's. I put a full length movie, some clips, a couple of hours of tv, a bunch of hi-res pictures and all my favorite music and the memory hardly decreased at all. This thing would hold 85 movies and why would anyone want to store all that on the player anyway?  The bottom line is this Archos performs like a magician. Takes a bit of patience and looking at the manual to learn all the many features and buttons though but much of it really is intuitive.  The hardest thing was setting up the tv scheduling to record from the tv.   I could not recommend this product more highly.  They even upgraded the case everyone was complaining about. I am going to carry it in my purse so I am never without it.  Yes it is expensive, and so I wish they would have included the plug-ins and the recording feature as part of the package, but I think it is worth every penny.  I haven't had this much satisfaction (or fun) from an electronic gadget purchase in a very long time.  If you are thinking about buying it and can handle the price (player $309, dvr recorder, $79 and plug-ins, $30 bundled), do it, you won't be sorry!

<Title>Archos 604 w/camcorder accessory
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hello to all from NJ USA  I wanted to start video recording my long distance motorcycle trips. Researched for several weeks evaluating different systems and methods before deciding on the Archos 604. Bought the 604 w/most of the important accessories (docking station, A/C adapter, travel adapter, and car charger) including the helmet camcorder from Amazon for what I thought was a very good price. The 604 itself was $313 USD and free ship. The unit dropped in price to $284 before it shipped. I notified Amazon and they honored the new price. Saved me another $29. Got all pieces within 5 days in three shipments. I give Amazon's email support 5 stars for response time.  My first impression - I like the 604 unit. I like the way it looks and feels in my hands. Buttons layout works for me. The screen is unbelievable. I managed to operate it well enough w/o 1st reading the manual. I did upgrade the firmware. It was 1.5.xx and it's now 1.6.20. Firmware is free from Archos website and easy to install from following the site instructions. Built-in internal speaker is very weak. Should either be pumped up or left out.  My primary reason for getting this - helmet cam. Pleased w/the quality of the video. Love the overall compact size and weight. I like the cam w/built-in remote on/off, status lights and microphone. Putting the remote under my jacket reduced the overall background noise of a motorcycle at highway speeds and it was still able to pick up my voice, abeit a little muffled. I can live w/that. I ran it straight for 49 minutes and 40 seconds. File size is a bit over 1 GB.  Not pleased w/cam on one point. When activating a record session for the 1st time, from the remote or unit, the Archos reboots. After that, it doesn't matter how many times you start and stop recording, it works fine.  Cam does draw above the normal amount of battery power. Specs state 5.5 hours running the unit alone. The unit, w/the cam, ran for over an hour before it ran out of power. The battery ran out on the second leg of my m/c trip. Vids that "close" this way will not play and are marked corrupted by the system. I need to run more trials to determine total battery time. I did get the Archos car charger. The bike has a power accessory plug. I noticed after loading the firmware, the unit can run and charge at same time now on the travel adapter w/A/C adapter plugged in. I have not tried to run the unit w/the car charger yet.  After loading the MPEG4 codec (free on the web) to my XP home computer, video and sound worked flawlessy in Windows Movie Maker. Used WMM to make a small vid of my trip to send to my grown kids in FL. Email attachment vids leave much to be desired, quality wise, but you can see and hear what is going on. Full 640x480 makes much better viewing.  I have ordered a more robust cam housing to velcro to my helmet. The headband that comes w/the cam, might be ok on a bicycle or just walking about for some, but not under a m/c helmet. It's a tight fit and picks up the edge of my eyeglasses. For power considerations, I may get one or two spare 604 batteries, just in case when on the road. I don't want to miss anything!  Update 04/24/207: Unit does work w/the car charger or A/C adapter plugged in. Battery does get real warm operating like this. When powered up this way, my unit stopped the rebooting thing on the 1st vid start. The power cord was way too short from the M/C power accessory outlet to my pocket. I picked up an affordable 10' power accessory extension from a local nationwide electronics retail outlet known for selling radios from a shack ;-) Another use I've been trying out, car cam. In the car, I wrap the headband holder around the passenger head restraint pointing out the windshield. Get in an accident that is not your fault? Insurance company, let's got to "tape". Mount so the speedo shows, get pulled over for speeding when your not, go to court and Your Honor, let's go to "tape". Neither has happened to me, but w/it running, it's like a flight data recorder for your car. Of course if the accident was your fault or you were speeding, don't keep the vid ;-) Still very pleased w/this purchase.

<Content>From the information I saw prior to purchase, this player would play anything that's out there.  Based upon that belief I purchased one, only to discover that not only will it not play mp4 files, it even has a built in message indicating the necessity of going to the archos site to purchase one!  To me that's serious customer abuse - setting me up to expect a fully functional product, then indicating "Oh, you want to play podcast video?, Well, that's extra...".  Note that my rating isn't for the product, it's for archos and its sleeze-ball marketing department.

<Title>A really excellent portable video player
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the player for a couple of weeks now and am very impressed with it.  It's not so great as a music player, since the interface is awkward.  It shines as a portable video player though.  I have a TV capture card in my computer which records shows in MPEG2 format.  I convert to MPEG4 on the computer and copy them to the archos.  It's a great unit for the plane or the gym.  Battery life seems to be about 5 hours.  I would recommend buying a spare battery so that you always have a charged spare.  I bought an extra charger from newmp3technology, but did not read the description carefully enough - I thought it was a wall charger, but is a USB charger, so it isn't that useful.   I especially like that there is no special software needed.  Turn it on, plug it into your computer, and it shows up as a USB drive (I use Mac OS X and Linux).

<Content>I bought this as a gift for my mother. She takes lots of photos of the grand kids using her Sony digital camera. And since she doesn't print them, she hardly gets the chance to see the images besides previewing on the 2" screen on the camera. Also, it doesn't take her long to fill up the 1 Gigabyte flash card on the camera, so the photos need to be moved of the flash card often, usually to a computer.   With this Archos 604 along with the USB docking adaptor (separate accessory), she can view the thousands of pictures on a nice 4" screen. And it's small and portable enough, she can carry with her in her purse. So she can show off the pictures to anyone she wants at any time. The buttons and navigations take a few hours to get use to, but its functional enough that its not that hard to learn. The USB docking adapter also allows her to transfer her photos directly from the camera to the archos 604, without requiring a computer, this is plus feature.   The Case that came with it is decent, it slides in tight for a snug fit. But I will buy her the alternative case that Archos sells, I think its better. For video and Music playback, it is alright. I bought the extra software codec for Mpeg. It plays videos that was shot from the camera, and it seems well enough. Music playback is okay, nothing to praise about. The built in speakers are not great, so earphones are definitely better for music. The unit runs warm to slightly hot after long periods of use. Battery life is decent, depending on usage, you can get 2 or 3 hours of use per full charge. The software on the unit is a bit unstable. Sometimes, it would not display new files that were imported. And I have to try several times before the unit recognizes the new files. I'm hoping a future firmware update will fix this.  Overall, its a solid media player. I bought mainly for the photo browsing and viewing capabilities, and it does that well. I'm thinking of purchasing the new Archos 704 with the 7" screen. If you have kids, you can use it as a video playback device in the car. It has a mounting strap accessory for the headrest in the car. So this can be an alternaitve to a car DVD player. But for carry around in a purse or pocket, the 604 is better as its more portable. Archos still is the better choice in portable media players as of right now. Until Apple make an iPod with a 4" or bigger screen, Archos is the way to go.

<Content>It's not often that a piece of electronics can be described as perfect but this is it.  I purchased it and used it on a plane the next week.  I had two rows of people asking to see it as they just couldn't believe it.  Picture quality was suberb.  I purchased it as a mobile DVR and player but plan to also keep a few movies on it.  If I had to pick one flaw on it, it would be that the buttons do not have a backlight feature so that when it is dark, you can't see the buttons.  You would not be disappointed with this product.

<Title>Not good for treadmill running
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought an Archos 604 to replace a busted iPod video. I used the iPod on my daily treadmill runs at the gym. I set it on the treadmill and was able to watch what I wanted instead of what was on the TV. Had it for 2-1/2 years before it died. Decided to try the 604 because of the larger screen size.  Screen is great, interface is great, works great showing my shows. Not crazy about Archos Link software. And apparently you need to buy some other software from Archos to watch video podcasts, at least that is what I inferred, never got that far with it.   Problem is that as I run I sweat and sweat gets on the device (happened to the iPod, too). After two runs, the sweat was behind the screen (disgusting, I know), and the screen was not usable. So I took it back.  If you are not using it for that purpose, I think it is a great device. But because it was so bad at the use I had, I gave it one star.

<Title>A home run.
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Archos 604 Video player is wonderful piece of electronics.  It is a great update of the venerable AV500 and takes care of all of the problems of its predecessors.  Package Contained Archos 604, 1 battery, nice ear bud headphones, 1 proprietary USB 2.0 cable used to charge the device and transfer content from your computer, setup guide and legal stuff, DVR station adapter and a storage sack.  The Great The screen is totally amazing: Big, Bright and Beautiful in a 16:9 layout. It has a 30 Gig HD which many people will think is probably on the small size, but I find it more that enough to store 8-10 movies and 8-10 TV shows leaving more than 20 gigs for music. And how much do you really need for movies and TV.  These are not like music files: once you view a TV or movie a few times you will want to delete it and put newer movies and TV shows on the unit. More space would be nice, but the 30 here is more than enough for what this unit will be used for, ie watching on the go.  Viewing angle is very wide. The unit itself is well constructed and is made up of a high density plastic and metal - a nice surprise when most people are using only plastic to save money and lessen weight. Here too the 604 has really improved the surface of the metal with a very nice brushed surface that always looks clean: no fingerprints show.   Included are a few sample files to show off the 604 abilities in the video and music areas. The manual is right in the unit in a pdf file which is a very nice feature. The 604 can view most pdf files and the screen is so nice reading and viewing them is a pleasure. I bought my 604 to watch stuff on the go, and this unit is PERFECT for that.   Archos technical support is easy to call and they pickup and give advice without putting you through the ringer or automated FAQ system - another nice surprise.  The 604 has a Replaceable battery!  Don't by any product where you can't replace the battery.   Battery life is wonderful for music at over 14 hours when listening to music only. When using it to play videos, I am getting 4+ hours of use before the battery is exhausted. Looking at pictures and listening to music falls somewhere between 7 and 10+ hours.  The interface looks really cool with lots of interactive items. When connected to your computer it asks you what you want to do: charge only, sync (via Windows Media 10) or mount as a hard drive. No installation discs come with the unit as they are not needed. Only thing you need to do is make sure Windows Media 10 (a free download from Microsoft) is installed if you want to use the it for syncing files, but it is not required as you can drag and drop files on the the 604 in HD mode just like any regular hard drive.   The speaker is small but actually sounds good considering its size - perfect for office or desk listening or to share video clips with friends gathered around. The built in Kickstand is extremely cool here and makes playing videos and watching them at your desk very slick.  The built in microphone works exceptionally well and picks up even the softest sounds clearly.  The photo viewer is great and and is fun to use (slide show, rotate, etc.). You can even listen to music while you view pictures which is a wonderful feature: just start listening to music before you switch over to viewing photos.  The Not So Great Many might be disappointed that it comes with no cables to play back video on television, but again what this unit is really useful for is watching video ON THE GO. If you want a DVR for your house, get a Tivo or something similar or get the additional add-on that make the 604 a full featured DVR, but if you go this route, I would suggest getting the 504 with the bigger HD. Although there to you will pay more for the additional storage size, and you will also have to buy the cables to enable it to record live shows.   The navigation buttons take a bit of getting used to of course, but the design is really quite simple and straight forward.   Things to do when you get your unit. Be sure to go to the archos website and get the firmware update from the download section for the Archos 604 and update it right away. It adds functionality.  The very bad The storage bag is useless: provides no more protection than a zip-lock bag. Don't worry, there will be many people selling skins for this unit soon.  Update on 9-20-06: I wanted to pass along a few more things since my review. I have used the Archos 604 for the past 3 weeks now and I am even more impressed then when I first wrote my review. The unit is just so light and compact for what it offers. This is not like an iPod of course, but with that you gain such a beautiful screen for doing all the things an iPod or similar just can't do. I use the Archos to workout (cardio), currently watching LOST, and the time just flies by.  I have not had any problem connecting or transferring files to the Archos 604: it just works well.  Update on October 4th, 2006: I have played around with the display setting for brightness and have discovered that if you reduce the brightness to the minimum level (still super acceptable for viewing IMO) you can get about an extra 1 hour of viewing of videos.  Update on October 27th 2006: The H.264 - AAC sound plug-in was released a few days ago. I downloaded it and installed it easily. The plug-in is tied to your unit so no sharing the codex. Now there is no reason to convert iPod videos for the Archos, they play perfectly with this new plug-in. The plug in was $19.99. The DVD video plug-in also works perfectly and I installed it also without problems and have watched some wonderful DVD movies without having to convert them to a different format. This plug-in was also 19.99. I wish Archos had included these in the original price.  Update on December 5th, 2006: The Archos 604 as of this date supports the following files types (some may require a plugin: see the Archos website for details). .divx .xvid .wmv .wma .m4v mpeg-4 mpeg-2 .vob  .mpg .ps .mp4 .ac3 .acc .mov (H264)  Summary This is a very cool device and is certainly easy on the eyes. This blows away any other portable video player (PMP) on the market and the price is incredibly low for what it offers. The very low price will make this a must have item for watching video on the go if you can find it for sale. My 604 is just such a joy to use. I am never without high quality TV shows or DVD movies now no matter where I find myself. The size is just perfect, any larger and it would be cumbersome, and smaller and it would produce eye strain like I had with the video iPod.  Overall, I continue to be very, very happy that I bought the Archos 604.

<Title>Great Device for Newcomers
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been an Archos AV500 user for some time. The 604 is the replacement device for the AV500 and for those of you who have not yet joined the wonderful world of portable, small screen entertainment, then the Archos 604 is an excellent choice.  For AV500 users, I'd recommend holding onto your current device. I recently purchased and returned the 604 for the following reasons:  1. Screen, while larger and supporting more colors, was not as bright, nor significantly better than my AV500 (and yeah, I adjusted the brightness levels in both devices to similar levels for comparison).  2. Lack of DVR capability out of the box (recording from a DVD player, television, or other device). While many do not want or need this feature, right now the 604 does not support as many codecs (different types of digital files like MPEG-4, MPEG-2, etc.) as the older AV500.  I was hoping for a slimmer device, brighter screen, and a kickstand. What I got for my $350 was a device essentially just as thick, a bit longer, similar screen, and a kickstand.  New users - get an Archos - definitely a high quality product. AV500 users - you might be disappointed - it's not really much of an upgrade.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Archos started making portable video players 6 or 7 years ago. It seems that they have relentlessly tried to continue to improve and evolve their basic machine. IMHO this is a great update to all of its predecessors.   The box and packaging are very plain compaired to all the fancy packaging that comes w/most digital players today - a good thing IMO, spend more on the development of the player, and not how cool the packaging of the box is.  Box contains:  Archos 604, 1 replacable battery, ear buds, proprietary USB 2.0 cable for charging the device and transfering content, setup guide, DVR station adapter and a piece of crap storage bag.   The screen is awesome: big, bright, 16:9 layout, w/a wide viewing angle. It's about as thick as my 60g ipod. Most of the surface of the player is taken up by screen. The operational buttons are well layed out and after a little trial and error, quite functional.  The unit seems well constructed, made of high density plastic and metal. The metal has a nice brushed surface that looks clean, showing no fingerprints. Even though it is similar to the AV500, I think it looks a lot more stylish, and the navigational buttons are much more intuitive.  The first thing I did while charging the unit was download the latest firmware as well as a newer version of the manual contained in a pdf file. It came w/a pdf manual already on the unit, but the one on the website is a newer version.  The interface is pretty cool, sporting animated icons for all of the basic funtions. When connecting to your computer it asks you if you want to: charge only, sync (via WMP) or mount as a hard drive. Since I pretty much hate WMP (even though 11 is a bit better), I chose the latter.  Transfer speeds were pretty quick for music, photos and some videos I already had converted on my puter's HD. I use iriverter to convert my DVD's, which works quite well and efficiently.  Through Sony headphones (don't know about the included earbuds as I chucked those as I do w/all the devices I purchase) the music sounded very good, the pictures are crystal clear and the videos very impressive. You can make slide shows w/transitions and basic effects and watch them whilst listening to tunes. Music has gapless playback.You can also load and view pdf files - haven't done that yet  The speaker is small and sounds about as you'd expect, (a little soft on volume) but should come in handy on occasions when headphones or earbuds are impractical. The built in kickstand is a nice feature for propping the unit up on flat surfaces.   Has a built in microphone which I have not tried yet.   You can record from TV, VHS, or DVD player just like a DVR but it requires an optional $99 (list) dock - which really isn't bad considering the low initial price of the unit. The dock also enables transfer of photos directly from your digital camera and I'm not sure but I think video straight from your camcorder. I plan on picking up the dock when it becomes available.  Battery life is advertised at 14+ for music, 8+ for music w/photo slideshows, 4+ for video. I can't answer to any of that as yet.  I'll try and update after using the unit a bit more, but for now I'll summerize by saying:  This is one AWESOME machine! As stated before, the navigational buttons take some getting used to, the storage bag is a joke, has to be charged via puter w/proprietary USB.  No device is perfect, as this one is not, but I defy anyone to find a solidy built, feature packed, quality 30g unit for this amazing price.   I do want to make it very clear that this is a portable video device that also plays music very well. I say that just to alert you to the fact that it is large from a DAP stand point, but VERY sveltte from a portable video player stand point.

<Title>The perfect balance of portability and usability
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The screen is the size of a 30G iPod. Seriously, if you lay an iPod on the 604 it is the same size as the 604's screen. The video is beautiful. I didn't even consider the photo viewing capability when I bought this, but the screen is great for showing my family my latest pics when I visit.  The 604 is small and light enough to take back and forth to work with me on the subway, though it is not pocket-sized. It lives in my shoulder bag. On flights and long train rides the 604 really shines.  The screen is bright and crisp, and playback is flawless, so I can leave my laptop at home and still get to watch movies.   For me the biggest selling point was the OSX and Windows compatability.  The 604 mounts as a drive to either OS so you simply drag content back and forth, so I am not stuck with WMP or iTunes (actually, I guess I am stuck with BOTH iTunes and WMP... lol).  The navigation takes some getting used to with the dual-direction menu button, but it is intuitive enough that I haven't opened the manual yet.  Personally, I find the iPod too big for a simple music player and the video implemenation is laughable. I use a nano-sized Sansa if all I want is music on the go. I would argue that the 604 is the perfect balance of portability and usability for video and music.

<Title>bad experience with this product
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here are why - Most of files in my video libraries cannot be played on this player. It only supports very limited number of codecs. No plan to support real media in the future. - I bought it because I plan to use it as dvr. However, the supporting dvr station is not available on the market.   Because of the above two reasons, it makes the player almost useless to me.   Besides those,  - it suser interface is not easy to navigate - there's not protection skin on the market to protect the device. I am afraid of bringing it to gym; it might fall and break. - the sound quality is not as good ad ipod, make it less desirable as music player  If the dvr station is still not avalable in 2 weeks, you will see mine on ebay.

<Title>I'm in love with it
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the 604 for about 3 months now and couldn't go through a complete day without it. Everynight I schedule  recordings of late night ESPN SportsCenter while I sleep and watch them at my desk the next morning. I have movies, TV shows, video trailers of movies and games and also PDF manuals of my cell phone and Treo for quick access. I'm still finding new uses for it.  To clear up bad info that was written previously: The 604 and 504 supports MPEG-2 format (.vob, .mpg and .ps extensions), MPEG-4, MP4, ac3, ACC, divx, xvid, wmv, wma and m4v & mov extensions (encoded with H264) and more to come as Archos releases new firmware and plugins.  Pros:  Portable DVR player  Record your own TV shows and movies and not have to pay for them. Great LCD picture quality Photo album Kick stand Music player It's better than what you have. (Unless you have the av500 by Archos) NO SOFTWARE IS NEEDED. Although it does sync with Windows Media Player, you can easily drag and drop or cut and paste files into Windows Explorer and delete them just like any other file from a PC.  Cons: 30GB for some may be small, but considering my video collection alone is well over 200gb, adding and deleting files is my best option. A larger HDD would be nice but I would eventually fill that up and wish for even a bigger one (see the stupid cycle Apple is taking thier consumers through).  It doesn't record out of the box. You must buy the DVR station to record your own shows Archos is currently charging for additional codecs. The battery can only be charged by USB unless you buy the adapter   All in all, Archos provided another great product for those who love portable video. If you're like me and already have a large video file collection of movies and TV shows (or what ever you watch...*wink-wink*), this is a must. If you dont have a large collection, buying the DVR station isn't a bad idea considering what networks charge to download thier shows from the internet.  oNe

<Title>Glad I finally pulled the trigger
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My co-worker and I have been considering buying an Archos for quite some time now.  We considered the AV500, AV700, and whichever model was before the AV500.  Until now, the prices were too high for us, but now the prices are in iPod and Creative territory, which made the decision a no-brainer.  The toughest decision was whether I should get the 404, 504, or 604.  What I like:  - One reason I chose the 604 over the 504 was the size.  The 504 is a little thicker, and I thought the 604 would also be too bulky, but I'm very pleased at how sleek the unit is.  - The reason i chose the 604 over the smaller 404 is the 16:9 ratio.  If you're getting an Archos, it probably means you watch a lot of video, so this is a must.  - The screen is pretty nice, picture is vivid and colors bright.  Decent in indirect sunlight, not really tested in direct sunlight.  - The buttons were a little on the tough side to figure out (I don't read manuals) but once I learned the features, I really like the interface.  - Fairly straightforward to get content onto the unit.  Similar to the Creative players, in that you can open up the Archos as a folder and drag/drop, copy/paste, etc.  - The DVR dock (sold separately) has several output choices - component, S-video, RCA.  The new, "modular" aspect of the Archos allows this increase in features, and also the ability to buy the Archos at a lower price if you are not seeking DVR capability.  - Overall, a stylish unit, and looks much better in person than in pictures.  What I don't like:  - The Archos seems to be much more limited in playable content than its close competitor, the Cowon A2.  It turns out I have quite a few videos encoded with AC3 audio, and the Archos will not play this content (and apparently MP4 as well) without the purchase of their plug-in ($19.99)  - No subtitle support.  I watch a lot of Asian movies w/ subtitle files, and was not considering this when I purchased the Archos.    Another advantage of the Cowon A2 is that it apparently has subtitle support.  - Need to buy add-ons to use DVR functionality, as well as being able to charge through an AC outlet, but this could also be a plus for certain people who want to trim the extras and keep the price low.  - Speakers are adequate at lower volumes, but lacking at high volume.  - Picture can get a little blurry in fast action sequences.  Overall, I am very pleased with the Archos 604 and my purchase was worth the wait.  If my dislikes sound like I would rather have a Cowon A2, yes, I would, to be completely honest.  But this is for specific reasons and does not diminish my impression of the Archos in any way.  Another testimonial in favor of the Archos is the fact that my gf, who usually ignores me when I talk about my gadgets, told she might want to use the Archos if I end up getting the Cowon, and not to get rid of it yet.    If you've been considering getting this, I would recommend the Archos, but also qualify the recommendation and strongly consider what your needs are first.  If you are looking for DVR capability and playback to TV, I would go with the Archos.  However, if you have are looking for a pure video player, consider the Cowon.  As a last comment, I just noticed that someone tagged the Archos with "iPod".  I'm not sure who would do this, but if you're even remotely considering the iPod video as an option against the Archos, I would say you don't belong here.  Blunt, yes, but this is a product some would call an "iPod killer".  UPDATE 12/20/06 So I gave the Archos to my gf and got the Cowon A2 for myself and did a side-by-side comparison.  Just going to list a few areas where one is better than the other.  Archos - easier to use interface once you learn the buttons, loads videos quicker, scheduler for tv recording, a little slimmer but feels a little more solid, overall better for the typical user  Cowon - more flexibility in types of files playable and features, built in recording capability, built-in FM tuner and recorder, 'prettier' external design and menu, slightly more advanced menu interface  To confirm my earlier speculation, the Archos is probably a superior unit overall, but the Cowon might offer better features for users with particular needs and/or who are a little more technically and technologically savvy

<Title>NO RAW file support!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The following review is only interesting for photographer:  The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  I upgraded my Archos from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.  Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative.

<Title>Best of both worlds!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Archos 604 after reading reviews (mostly on CNet) of the Cowon and Creative alternatives.  Overall I am extremely happy with the 604, comparing to the Creative Zen M, iPod Video, and Archos 420 I'd say it blows them all away.  I mainly bought this out of curiousity but it has taken the top spot for audio and video in my collection of players.  This is what I love about it:  1) I love a big beautiful, bright, crisp screen and this screen is to die for! 2) Allows connection either as Windows Media Player or as a hard drive, very convenient (big plus after using the Zen M!) 3) Supports more video formats, more easily than any other player that I've tried. I rarely have to convert any WMV, AVI file to play on here and thats most of my videos.  Once I bought their plugin it also supports MP2 among others. 4) Create, edit, delete on the go. The screen is so big that you really can be effective in creating playlists on the unit.  I really love this feature, something I find severely lacking in the iPod and rather limited on the ZM.   5) Once you get used to the navigation buttons, which did take a little practice I admit, you can really whip around in your music library very quickly and easily.  When you have 2000 songs it can get a bit difficult to navigate on an iPod or ZM. 6) Great battery life, I haven't even used up the battery yet. If you've ever played video on your iPod you know how impressive this is. 7) Love that built in kickstand :) 8) Sound quality and power is excellent, when I compare the sound as pumped through my Bose car stereo I have to give the top rating to the 604 over ZVM, iPod, or 420. 9) Did I mention I love a big beautiful screen?  Well its worth mentioning twice if you ask me!  Of course, nothing is perfect and everybody likes to see the downside of a product before purchase so here we go:  1) Kinda slow to boot up. 2) You do have to buy that plugin to support MP2 and other formats; that don't seem right to me!  In fact, Archos does seem to be doing the Apple thing and forcing you to pay for just about anything over the basic unit. 3) Can't find a decent case to save my life, of course thats always the downside of buying anything other than an iPod so its no big surprise. 4) Not as easy as I would like to play it blind, unlike the iPod or ZVM I can't just reach in my pocket, push the right button and have sound come out. Have to turn it on, then push "OK" button to get the music to resume.  This makes it a slightly less convenient music player but I feel the other features outweigh this minor flaw so I still use it as my main player. 5) I'm really having trouble creating playlists for this thing, partly because I find the Windows Media Player a little difficult to use for this purpose.  Seems easiest to create playlists on the unit itself, kind of the opposite of the iPod. 6) Getting some weird playlist behavior when I save playlists I often end up with several playlists with the same name... must be a software bug which I hope they plan to fix soon! 7) I can't seem to find a simple wall charger for this thing.  So I take the cable they gave me and plug it into an iPod USB charger and that works well enough.  Overall, this has surprised me by becoming my favorite music and video player which is amazing because I really expected that my ZM would continue as my top music player.  Hence the 5 star rating in spite of a few flaws :)

<Title>Great Media Player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This media player is amazing it has an impressive interface with many features. It supports nearly every format I have tried on it, the product itself paired with the cool accessories such as a DVR station and Camera makes it a great buy. The only two reasons I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is first the button layout is somewhat of a challenge to get used to. One button is up and down, another is left and right, and another is diagonally basically. Just a strange setup id you ask me. The other reason is The built in speaker is very sub par. This isn't too big of a deal because you should basically be using headphone on it as it is an mp3 player.
