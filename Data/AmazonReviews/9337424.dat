<Content>Easy to load up with music and movies. Great display many features can record from cable tv and play to a tv screen. nice sound thru the head set. Comes with everything need to use. I am really enjoying this PMP. One of things I don;t like is there are no easy way to stop music file from playing once started exiting music file dosn't stop the music you have to reset the PMP to stop music files from playing. Wish they had had the larger unit when I bought this one. They now have a 30 GB PMP. Overall I lie this PMP unit very much.

<Title>Coby's PMP4320/PMP4330 is an impressive device  that shows what other PMP's are lacking.

<Content>Strengths: Wide Screen, Built-in Speakers, FM Radio, Records Content Directly (no docking station needed), Plays Most Content, Fits in Pocket  Weaknesses: Power Adapter Required to Re-charge Unit (No USB Charging)  I saw a prior CNET review and wanted to set the record straight because I thought it was unfair and we (as consumers) need to tell companies when they are doing something right. As an experienced PMP user, I can tell you that there are only two choices that make sense for users who want PMP's with the most comprehensive video functions, that can still be slipped in your pocket: Archos 604, or Coby PMP4320/PMP4330.  Archos was the leader in power PMP's until they split their product into two separate products.  Now you must purchase a separately-priced docking module to record video, and use proprietary cables to connect the unit to a computer. Archos did this to get the price closer to the low $300's because the days of selling $400+ PMP's are over.  Coby, however, has managed to deliver a product that allows you to have your cake and eat it to. You get a self-contained unit with all the features of the old Archos models in a very compact package for around $250.  For $269 (in a recent sale) you can get the 30GB hard drive and an SD card slot with the PMP4330 model (recommended). You don't have to purchase anything else to record content directly from the unit, and it uses normal cables that are included.  The 4.3" wide screen blows away the competition. If you haven't used a PMP with a wide screen, you don't know what you are missing. Many PMP manufacturers are moving this direction. Coby allows you to set the ratio and fill the entire screen regardless of the video. It would take about 3 iPod Video screens placed side-by-side to get the same effect. This is a good unit to watch video on. My advice, don't buy units with square screens.  The stereo speakers are surprising good and blow away the lousy speakers on my other PMP's and even my laptop! You rarely see this in a PMP. I think the reason for this is the curved design behind the unit that allows optimal space for speaker positioning. I'm not an expert, but you will be satisfied. I can't figure out how CNET's previous review got it so wrong.  The FM radio function is excellent because Coby designed a user-friendly radio interface that looks and feels the part. My wife couldn't get over the screen that looked like a car radio and was so easy to move through the automatic presets. She wanted one of her own just based on that feature. The reception quality was as good as any car radio. Optionally you can record any radio content to MP3.  I think this would be most useful if you want to record a radio talk show and listen to it later.  As an MP3 player it doesn't impress or unimpress me. Most MP3 players deliver content that is pretty standard.  This is no exception. One benefit of this model is the equalizer, but that is something I expect on any unit. If you don't care about video and just want an MP3 audio player, buy an iPod because you will be able to recharge it using a USB cable and it will have a smaller foot print. I similarly have little to say about the voice recorder or e-book functions because they are bonus features to me. I have tried them and they work. Good enough.  The File Explorer is about what you would expect. It is nothing fancy, but it is simple and uses a directory hierarchy like any computer hard drive.  One nice thing is the ability to rename files and directories using the unit, but you will probably end up using your computer to organize the files. When you connect the unit by USB, your computer recognizes the PMP as another drive and allows you to manage files just like most other PMP's (except iPod). It's a simple, universal USB cable. Archos, what are you thinking?  Recording video content directly from the unit is a HUGE plus and separates it from the newest Archos models which do not record video unless you buy the $100 docking model which is a deal-killer. This is great if you have a lot of programs TIVOed and want to move them to your PMP. You get typically large .asp files which you can keep and play as-is or if space is a concern (and it will be), you can use a utility like ConvertMovie 4.0 to reduce them by 80 percent with the same quality in MP4 format. Ten episodes of the Simpsons can be reduced to about a gigabyte. One thing I noticed is that it takes about 5-seconds to start after you press record, but no big deal.  It has a typical timer so you can set the time or you can stop recording manually. No fancy scheduling, but that's what my TIVO is for.  The form factor and size is unmatched by the competition. It is a little wider, a little thicker, and about an inch longer than a 60/80GB iPod Video, yet it does so much MORE. It still slips easily into your pocket, and the back of the unit tapers inward so it appears smaller and fits easier into your pocket. I own an iPod Video and I can tell you that the only things iPod has on this unit is the smaller size and the larger hard drive.  That is it. I even disagree with the previous review about the controls.  I have no problem with them and find them easy to use, actually easier to fast forward video than the iPod.  The previous review talked about the quality of the unit being low. I have to disagree. Yes, it is plastic, not metal like the back of an iPod Video, but it is decent quality and as good as the materials forming most new laptops. Just because iPod sets the bar high with a metal cover on the back does not mean that all other cases are cheap. It is a practical design that works. Everything is plastic anymore and it keeps the price affordable.  White plastic always looks cheaper. If Coby had used an all-black design, then the previous reviewer probably wouldn't have noted anything.  I actually bought this unit as a present to replace my daughter's current PMP, but decided to give her my hand-me-down iPod Video instead.  I think that's for the best.  I hope that Coby keeps doing what it is doing in providing another option for consumers.  If you are in the market for a video PMP right now, you won't beat this deal and you won't be disappointed.  Maybe Apple, Microsoft, Archos and the rest can learn something from what Coby is providing.

<Title>Let me save you some trouble...

<Content>First of all, I owned this product briefly, but was so disappointed I had to return it. I really hate returning stuff too.  Pros: It does have a wonderful display. It does a great job recording and playing back video. It works well as an external HD, and 20GB is fairly comfortable. It reads SD cards like a charm, and can copy files to and from the card. The built in speaker has adequate volume, and the overall sound quality is pretty good. For that, I'll give it an extra star, but...  Cons: If you have a any delusions about using this as an MP3 player, you need to look someplace else. It will not leave the directory you set it in. If that directory has a lot of files (more than 50) you can expect navigation troubles. It's slow, and frequently stops responding as if somehow it's just bogged down by too much info. But wait! It gets worse! Your battery life is also going to disappoint. It takes 4 hours to recharge and less than 8 hours to drain. Did I mention the built in microphone? Yeah... It picks up the sounds of the hard drive as it records, so there's an annoying "click, click, click" throughout your audio. Using it as an image viewer is also a bit slow to respond as well, and some of the features are more of an annoyance than of a any real use. Why is there a button completely dedicated to playing a slice of your MP3 over and over repeatedly? Sadly, it doesn't look like Coby is ever going to release a firmware update for this device, and that's sad, because it could have been so much better if the user interface were to operate more smoothly. Good luck finding eBooks for it, and the radio feature has some kind of glitch that makes you have to futz with it before you get any sound. I could also go on to criticize how thick it actually is, as the pictures are deceptively thin, but that's just nit-picking. I was just simply awestruck by the poor functionality.  No, I can't say this product is one that I could ever recommend. I really wanted to like this product, but instead, I just got my money back.
