<Content>equals no sale. Closed system that excludes me is more "proprietary" than iTunes/iPod combo. You are not forced to use iTunes to use your iPod, any CD can be ripped to it. You are not forced to use a particular OS for your computer either, with an iPod. Not so with this wanna-be. Zen-casting? give me a break!  no zero star option available

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for my son this christmas. He likes it but finds it too bulky and no way near as easy to operate as his cousins iPod video. He's swithcing to the iPod as soon as he sells the Creative. I must say that the video on the creative is very good looking. Sharper than on Apples iPod. But keep in mind that the Zen is a portable videodevice and the iPod is a MP3 player with videocapabilities. It's NOT a Video iPod. Maybe something will incarnate at Macworld !

<Title>Blows Apple Away
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has it all of over Apple's Ipod.  More importantly it is getting more and more obvious that Apple Fanatics (probably shareholders) go around and give every non-Apple product only one star and then make up some ridiculous negative review.   But the worm is about to turn for Apple as the competition is now coming up with superior products at better price points.  Which brings me to the new Creative M.     Superior battery life, FM Radio free (not a $50 add on like the Apple)and wider compatibility.  Enough said.

<Title>Solid features give plenty of bang for the buck, excellent PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off let me say I have experimented with the iPod Video (friend got it for Xmas) and generally liked it. Just for my needs, it wasn't the right choice. I use XP mainly and wanted more video and song compatibilty options. After much research (iAudio X5, iPod Video, and others) the Vision:M came out on top. Now that I've received mine and had a chance to play with it some, I think it's obvious by some of the alleged "reviews" posted by obvious iPod fans, they really haven't even tested this excellent unit.   Some highlights: 1- works with the subscription based music services, which was high on my list. iTunes may someday offer this option, but at least for now does not. I like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player (PMP). Sound quality for music is very good, with an EQ to tweak to individual tastes.  2- video quality is top notch, with several different formats supported. It was quite easy to transfer recordings from my Snapstream PVR setup on the PC to the Vision:M, so now I have several episodes of The Simpsons, Scrubs, and 60 Minutes to watch during trips. Nice.  3- The menu navigation is just like the Creative Zen Micro, and I think most people will get the hang of that relatively quickly. It's not perfect but I had it pretty much down in the initial hour of playing around with the unit.  OTHER INFO: I haven't had a chance to play video for a long stretch to determine true battery life, but specs and reviews on sites like CNET indicate it is about 4 hours for video and 14 or so for music. That is plenty for me. iPod is more in the 2-3 hour range for video.  As for size, I've seen some who make a big deal that it is thicker than the iPod Video. However, the Zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand. I have no problem at all with the size. It's plenty small.  I've noticed some people claim Creative has ripped off iPod for the look, but really, the Creative Zen Micro MP3 player (about 2 years old) is what struck me as a near replica as far as size/design goes. Similar to iPod Video, sure. But far closer to Creative's already long established MP3 player.  Features like microphone recording, FM play and record, Outlook calendar / contacts compatibility, etc. are nice little bonuses but weren't a real factor in my selection criteria.  With the upcoming vast increase in choices for video, podcast and music download availability (as evidenced by recent announcements at CES and elsewhere), the Zen Video:M should be a great choice for anyone who rates features/quality over the "hipness" factor iPod currently has over the masses. I give Apple credit for how they achieved their iPod success with great marketing and a solid product, I just think if you do your research you may end up choosing the Video:M as well. I wouldn't hesitate at all to steer a Windows XP user to it.  P.S. Tested out the ZenCast feature (in beta as of my writing) and it shows promise as a way to collect video and audio podcasts from a centralized location.   Creative Zen Video:M gets a big thumbs up from me...

<Title>Just trying to even things out.
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey I think the ipod line of products are fantastic! I think apple is doing some really great stuff. The fact of the matter is that Creative and other companies are doing great stuff too. The zen vision:m is an example of this. Why cant both products be good at the same time?!  Of coarse the reason I chose the zen vision:m is because of its ability to play multiple formats of video. I also have a subscription with napster to download all the music i want for 14 bucks a month. I do not like the iTunes interface and setup...but thats just me. I think that some people are better off with iPods (mainly the people who dont have a clue about technology). I also think that the 2hours of video on the iPod video is not enough for me...again this is not true for everybody. The zen vision:M gives a solid 4 hours of video playback time. Hopefully more people can come to love both products instead of sending hate one way!

<Title>Quality lacking
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this one for Christmas. After using it for a few weeks, it's going back and getting replaced with an iPod. My wife has the iPod, and it is much easier to use than the Creative. The Creative certainly is not as easy to use as the iPod, and it also feels as though it is not made as well. You can pretty much tell after using them side-by-side that this is Creative's attempt at copying the iPod. They do a good job of making it look similar, but it just doesn't stack up to the quality of the iPod.

<Title>A lil dissapointing, but I don't think anyone else could have done much better
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now, I don't see the hype between the iPod video and Creative Zen vision.  I can see why some people love iPod and can think that the creative is just a rip-off.  Well it is not a rip-off, because that's what companies do.  Competition is a vital factor in advancing our race.  Here, I'll do some pros and cons  Pros for creative: -Vivid screen, very nice colors, the iPod video screen is not so good -Compatible with most video codecs when the iPod is not (see specs above) -2 hours more battery lfie for video than iPod -a few more hours of music playback than iPod -When connected to the computer via USB, the battery charges using the USB power -Well made in my opinion, pretty sturdy, however I don't wanna try dropping it. -Connects to the TV and works perfectly (I tried it with a previous AV cable made by panasonic for my video camera) -Great sound quality -DOES NOT CONVERT MUSIC FILES TO AAC.  MUSIC FILES CAN BE DUPLICATED -You can change the background to any image you have on the creative -You can zoom in onto pictures quite nicely -Dubbed the iPod killer   Cons: -A bit bulkier (I don't mind, since it is pretty small to me anyways -Battery cannot be removed and voids the warranty when it is opened -Navigation is different, not hard.  People that are use to the iPod will always think highly of iPod's navigation system -Converting video is slow but I don't think iPod's is any better -The power plug is kinda big and im a bit confused why it comes in 2 pieces -The back is not black as well, I would have liked the back of the creative to be black as well as everything else including the cables etc -The video seek is slow, but I'm thinking that because it is a hard drive and not a flash drive.  I highly doubt any other hard drive based media player can be any faster -$30 over the price of the iPod video 30 gb, but it costs money is your a pc user in order to connect  I can add some more later after I use the Creative Zen Vision: M a lil more.   Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.

<Title>A real Vision M Review...
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>****Updated Review**** 1/17/2006 (original below)  I've installed Windows XP as a dual boot on one of my machines. I was able to install the Zen Vision M and Creative Media Source software without any issues. I also successfully installed WMP10 without issues.  While I was getting my pc ready to install XP I played with the player to see what I could do with it alone. I figured out how to quickly adjust the settings using the slide and tap paradigm. The Zen Touch has a similar paradigm but the Vision M extends it, the touch pad actually has left and right clicks as well. After a bit of frustration I realized that sliding through menu's should always be done with the finger on the surface of the pad, if you lift and reseat your finger the player would interpret that as a "tap" and thus commence whichever setting you happened to be on when you were sliding..I did this a few times before I got the hang of the slide and tap. Also, it took a few minutes to figure out how to enable submenu options using the lower right icon. Once I was up to speed (took about 10 minutes WITHOUT consulting the sparce instruction book) I quickly went through the task of selecting my name for the player, adding a background (I used one of the samples provided in the picture section), setting the date and time. I then moved on to checking out the radio feature, you can set the device to "auto" scan and it works perfectly. It picked up and preset every station inside of 10 seconds, awesome! I live in a basement apartment and I was suprised at how clean the signal was coming from the radio from such a small (read: tiny FM antenna) device. The next thing I wanted to try was recording, from the radio I was able to enable recording, the sub features are really very intuitive. Again, I did this all without consulting the book within a space of 20 minutes. The hardest part was the first 10 minutes of getting used to the slide and tap paradigm. Now on to the XP experience...  I finally got XP up and running, I installed the software and fter the obligatory reboot, I plugged the port doc into the player and connected the mini usb plub into the doc and the doc into the pc's USB port. Within seconds, the sync screen flashed on the player and the pc reported the synch process had been started. The Vision M software loaded up and showed my connected player fine.  The layout is very intuitive and nice, the inards of the device were layed out by category (music,video,recordings..etc.) and subcategories and folders where necessary. I could freely create or delete subcategories under the main categories. I am still miffed as to why this functionality couldn't have been provided in basic form for every known OS but only Creative and Microsoft have the answer to that riddle.  I proceeded to upload a ripped album ( I have several hundred cuts waiting to go on the player) unfortunately, I have USB 1.1 on the box I installed the XP on so the transfer is not as fast as it could be but it is acceptable. The entire folder of 14 mp3's took about 4 minutes to copy to the player. I tested a cut, the sound quality is really excellent. ( I rip at 192kbps)  Now that I have gone through the inconvenience of installing windows XP just to use it, I am very happy with the player itself. It is a shame that broader OS support isn't in place but that should be easily rectified with firmware upgrades (are you listening creative????). As much as I'd love to give the player a 5, the pain I went through to get it to work really demands something lower but not quite a 4. Hmm....I guess I'll have to give Creative the nod, after using the player now for a week I am  really impressed with it's performance in all areas. So 5 stars it is (this should tell you just how good the player is despite the hell I went through to start managing media on it).  Player highly recommended but make sure you have XP!     **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006** **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006**  How some are claiming to have this at Christmas time in the US when it wasn't even available until this week is telling of the mental disturbances behind some peoples needs to assert the superiority of products they prefer because of one one manufacturer or another. Sad.  That said, here is my real world review of the Creative Vision M. I just took possession of it today, UPS came through 2 days as promised by Amazon.  Previous player experience:  I have used a few other mp3 players but have never owned one until now. I've used the Apple Nano, Ipod Video and the Creative Zen Touch.  Packaging and box:  The box is well designed and sturdy, a sleave and box design gives it a artsy touch, however it makes it more difficult to get at the player..no matter it's just a box.  Player and contents:  Upon taking out the parts I enjoyed the well built and finished look of everything. The cables , port adapter and the player itself are very well made. Contrary to what some have said, the size of the player is quite small in my medium sized hands. I wouldn't want it any smaller, it fit in my hand comfortably and was a lot lighter than the Zen Touch which I bought for my ex girlfriend last Christmas. In comparison to the Ipod Video it's about twice as thick but weighs and "feels" about the same. In the hand they feel similarly, so all talk of the weight/size being a drawback is bunk or those complaining need to do hand strengthening exercises ;) The surface of the player is very cool, much like the Ipod video the black (the one i got) surface is glossy. After charging the battery (takes 2 hours) I turned it on, the screen is quite beautiful to behold with rich vibrant colors. In comparison to the Ipod Video, though technically the M has more colors both have enough that video on them looks amazing, I guess I'd have toplay something on both that stretches the gamut of the players to see which is better.  Software Installation?:  The first major issue I ran into with the player was installation of the software. First, Creative includes a warning card indicating that Quicktime versions 7.0 and 7.0.2 will crash the installation so you should upgrade first to 7.0.3 (which fixes the bug) or uninstall Quicktime, install the Creative software then install Quicktime again.  This isn't the deal breaker however, the insurmountable problem for me is that I use windows 2000 and windows 2003. I don't have XP on any of the 8 running pc's in my home/business network. I own an IT business and have no use for the annoying "features" of Windows XP, why Creative didn't think to maximize software support to as many OS's as possible is beyond me (actually it is not I have some ideas..). Beyond that, why the player just doesn't attach to any pc using the USB port as a drive is also inexcusable.  ****Creative! wake up, many , many users still are on windows OS's that are not XP and if a thumb drive can auto doc without software surely your $330 player should be able to as well!!!****  Now that said, I had to figure out how to add content to my player. I figured Creative has to have software available for windows 2000 so I decided to contact customer support to find out. Page 2 of the "product information guide" indicated that customer support services are located on the installation cd in the "support" folder, I explored the CD and found the english phone number on the "customer support service center" page.  For service in the U.S. in english (french,brazilian,spanish numbers also available):  405 742 6622  I called the number expecting a long wait time, 2 minutes turned to 5, 5 to 10...and then I realized the number was long distance, "complementary" service should always be on a 1 800 number other wise it is not really complementary is it???. The nerve of Creative to call this so called "complementary" service. I hung up quite pissed off. I figured maybe I'll have more luck at the website. I went to www.creative.com/support/downloads , and tried to select my product from the list, of course there is no listing for the brand new "vision m" player.  Now I was really seeing red, how can a company release a product for sale and then not provide the necessary support services??!!. Not one to give up (ever) I decided to see if anyone with my issue had posted to the public forums (always the best place..should have done this straight away)..I went to the mp3 player forums page and queried "vision m and windows 2000" and the results were not encouraging at all, of the 8 total posts that referenced the words together, only 1 had ANY replies. (I guess the Creative support team is keeping away from answering legitimate customer complaints about this issue???)  I dug into the only thread that had responses hoping a solution to my problem would be found there in.  http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=pmc&message.id=4967  Bad news was waiting, only one post was by a Creative moderator and they offered no help at all. I do have a copy of windows XP on site that came with my Dell Laptop, back then I immediately ripped out the XP and put the more functional windows 2000 on. The idea of installing XP is anethema to me just to use the player really sucks. If I didn't have XP I would have no choice but to return the player! There is no way I would give M$ $100 bucks just because Creative has a secret deal to lock us into M$ proprietary protocols.  The most egregious aspect of this situation is that the older players (Zen Touch I bought for ex) did support 2000 in file mode, why Creative went the restrictive route of only supporting the Micro$oft proprietary protocol exclusively has something probably to do with some "relationship" they struck with MS no doubt. It really stinks, here I am unable to use the device on my desired OS. I am seriously debating weather I should just send it back or if I should install XP on a box JUST to use my $330 mp3 player. (which is a pretty deck of card size brick otherwise)  Conclusion:  ***WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, IF YOU HAVE ANY OPERATING SYSTEM OTHER THAN WINDOWS XP , YOU CURRENTLY CAN NOT USE THE VISION M TO DOWNLOAD OR MANAGE MEDIA. IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 98,ME, NT, 2000, MAC OS, YOUR ARE DEAD IN THE WATER.***  Hopefully with enough of a stink being made of this ridiculous situation Creative will move to provide a firmware update that provides the WIDE OS support that existed PRIOR to this NEW product. The player itself works fine, the sample videos that were on it played with excellent clarity and color, the sound was excellent. The touchpad was a bit sensitive on first touch but that was rectified by turning down the sensitivity in the settings. However, the OS support severely hampers my ability to give this player a top rating. In fact I would have given it a 5 if it just worked with my OS but it doesn't (not even as a removable drive..come on Creative even a $30 USB thumb drive can do that!!!) so I will have to take the rating down 4 points to a 1 out of 5.    ...now I'll have to find that old copy of windows XP lying around to grudgingly install it on one of my boxes.

<Title>Best MP3 player out in the market
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got mine last week so i'll just try to list some pros and cons  Pros  - the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the iPod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better) - sound quality is also better, this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic.  I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today(i am a former 3rd G ipod owner) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store, then switched it with the Creative ones. The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass, as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ, whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound. Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life, Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours. - though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, IMO the size is perfect, it's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do  Cons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it's easier to press - no "on the go playlist" like the ipod, if there is i haven't found out how to do it yet  i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. It was the first mp3 player I've ever gotten, and as long as it keeps working, probably the last.   First of all, it is extremely durable. I'm really hard on electronics, but this thing can take a beating. I've dropped it a few times (once into a bathtub full of water... while it was playing) and the only show of abuse is the corner is cracked and it sometimes has a tendency to freeze if it gets too warm. As long as I'm careful, it's not a problem.  The best thing about it is all the space. I have over 1000 songs, 51 videos (mostly short ones I've taken myself, some music videos and some classic Ren and Stimpy cartoons), and almost 800 songs, plus two gb set aside as removable storage... and I have 20 gb left.   Aside from music, video and picture viewing, it can take short voice recordings, has an FM radio (with pretty good reception, too. I can get channels that my stereo can't pick up), removable storage up to 8 gb like I said earlier, and an date planner. I've never used that feature, since it has to be done on the computer, and I don't need it anyway.   The only really negative things I can think to say about it is that the battery doesn't last as long as it says it should, and the touch pad, even on the lowest setting, is a little too sensitive sometimes. Also I think the screen is a little too bright, even on it's lowest setting. The size is a little bulky as well, but for the for the amount of storage space it gives you, it's worth it. And it also tends to freeze, but I just put that down to me dropping it a bunch of times.   I don't know how it compares to an iPod, since I've never used one, but I think this player is worth every penny.

<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is amazing.  If you are a PC user, and not in need of the "baby-me" features of the iPod this is for you.  Personally I like the product most because it requires no proprietary software to transfer data to the device.  Just plug it in, and drop in the music.  I have had it for about a year now, dropped it a few times on subway platforms... I dont baby it- and it has proved extremely rugged.  Tales of the screen easily scratching (to a point of unusability) are just that - tales.  The controls are a little sensitive, but it is a small price to pay when you consider the limitiations of the zune and especially the iPod.  If you want something pretty buy the iPod.  If you want something rugged and functional, with very good sound quality GET THE ZEN!

<Title>Not for iSheep - Zen Vision: M == Death Knell for iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Multiple Formats. Multiple Functions.  Better Screen.  Better Battery Life.   Bye bye Mr. Jobs.  Creative's Zen Vision: M has been released stateside and with it ends Apple's reign of sleek yet mediocre HDD mp3 players.  Ignore all the bad reviews posted about getting Vision: M's in the states before early January.  Unless these people imported theirs from Singapore they're simply iPod-fanboys lying through their inordinately white teeth.  Finally the audio world can awaken from the delirium placed upon it by Apple's continued ludicrous drive toward form over function.  Got mine yesterday and I can already claim it's better than any iPod I've ever used.   Hey look, an MP3 player that looks great and actually doesn't treat me like a retarded child with 400USD in one hand and a pacifier in the other.  Boo hoo!  No Mac support!  Now that Apple has finally kowtowed and is using Intel chips in their machine, the noose just got a little tighter around its brand loyal drones.  Wake up!  PC has been the more versatile and functional platform for years.  It's no coincidence that the Vision: M is as well over Apple's mp3 player, the iPod.

<Title>Stop comparing this to an ipod!
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading reviews over and over, and almost all of them compare this to an ipod, why?  is it because they look alike? well look at creatives past models, they all look similer to this, including the touch pad.  Creative did NOT steal this look from apple!  It is the generic look for hardrive players.  I also recall that creative and rio were the creators of mp3 players almost, not apple...  This costs more than an ipod because of the technical specs, and the screen resolution.  The screen resolution is twice of what the ipod can display, and 4 times the color.  Also this can plays wma (which is more common than aac), mp3 and wav.  Ipods use aac, mp3 and wav.  With the video, this can hold wmv, avi, divx, xvid, mpeg2, mpeg4, and m4v.  The ipod can only play mpeg4 and m4v.  Also, the creative vision m comes with the wall charger, and apple charges $30 for thiers.  One more thing... This is the vision m, which means it is a decendant of the vision, which is in a totally different class than the ipod!  The ipod is mostly for music where as the vision is a portable media player.  Yes I realize this is a comparison of the ipod, but the point was to prove that creative didn't just pop this out because apple put out the ipod video, these things take work to put out.  And they already had portable players that could utilize all these, and that this is just a smaller version of them.  Creative even had their PMC out for over a year before apple brought out the ipod video.  I apologize for the ramblings, and no I have no hands on experience of this player, except that of creatives older generation players, which are superb.  I don't mean to talk down to the ipod because it is infact a nice player, but this thing over shadows it by a loooooong shot.  Also, you people who love ipods so much can thank toshiba for supplying their hard drives.

<Title>I LOVE THE ZEN M!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My 14 year old techy son received the 30g IPOD for Christmas.  I purchase my ZEN yesterday.  He was begging me to pay the restocking fee and return his IPOD, unfortunately the Apple store only allows 14 days for returns.  I do find it odd that the Zen wasn't available till now in the US, after our Christmas season, middle of January at which time all who may have rec'd IPODS for Christmas couldn't return their IPODs if they chose. Even the salesperson who helped me at Frys returned his IPOD and purchased this, lol  Notable differences:  better screen quality, better programming, being able to download from several sites, doesn't SCRATCH as easily as the IPOD!!! The radio is awesome! Recording from the radio is very, very, very good, not excellent though...but hey, I will still definately use this feature.    The ZEN box states *15,000* songs, the IPOD 30g states *7500* songs (the 60g IPOD states *15,000* songs) I am a little confused about this, you would think that both  the 30g IPOD and 30g ZEN would state the SAME.  The recorder is pretty darn good, I just purchased a digital recorder two days ago for $100. and now will return.  This is a valuable feature for all those college kids!  I am very excited to be able to record my classes, come home and burn onto CD's!!!!forget tapes, a thing of the past!!!!    Needless to say, I am tickled pink about this Zen M, and yeah, I probably woulda purchased the Pink one if it were available yesterday, but all they received were the black ones.  lol  I purchased the IPOD 30g for each of my 3 children for Christmas, my kids in turn surprised ME with one....having done my homework, cuz lets face it, kinda pricey toys....I read up on the Zen, customer service @ Creative informed me that it wouldn't be available in the US till 1-15, so I let all the kids make up their own mind, they of course couldn't wait...."I" however, being older and thus wiser, returned mine, and waited.....well worth the wait!!1!!

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this player for a few days.  Previously had the Zen Sleek.  This is a great model.  The screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy/clear.  They really did a nice job with the touch pad this time.  It has a great feel.  It also works flawlessly with Yahoo Music Unlimited.  My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll pad are very, very stiff.  Perhaps this is unique to my player.  But it is a little annoying having to press down so hard.

<Title>I now own 2 Vision:M players
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had ordered one of the players as a gift for a family member, then realized how difficult it appeared to get them, so I ordered another from a second source.  I received the first unit as promised.  I immediately started loading this on it.  It's a little thicker than the iPod, but I actually like how it feels in my hand better (IMHO).  The screen is beautiful, the file formats that are supported are great, the integration with WMP10 and the on-line stores is certainly better than the iPod.  I just love it.  I loved it so much, that when the second unit arrived, I decided to keep it for myself :)  I have used iPod many times before and I do like them.  But they can coexist and the competition will make all the players better.  If you love the iPod's great.  Again, I like them too, but right now I would pick this player.  I have synched up CD music, on-line songs, even a bunch of my TiVo shows (via Tivo To Go TTG).  I have taken those shows and played them directly on my TV too (with an A/V cable).  The currently availability of accessories is a bit frustrating, but livable - I am sure it will not match or surpass the iPod in that respect.    Like the iPod and other devices like this the screen scratches pretty easily.  I immediately bought some Palm protectors and cut them to fit.  I have customer shields ordered (from theinvisibleshield.com) but this will do for now.  This FM radio works fine.  I personally like one integrated.  It doesn't take any more space and it's nice on rare occasion.  I have read other reviews that say having the FM radio is a "negative" of this player.  Huh?  Why?  If you don't want it, just don't use it.  There is a reason why this little player just won the overall best of the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  Even my friends that have iPods snap their heads when they see this.  But again, this shouldn't be a religious discussion of iPods vs. non-iPods.  Buy what you like best and suits your use.    This one suits mine.  I am even thinking about buying a third one.  Why?  I don't want to share mine (or my wife's) with the kids LOL

<Title>Simply Amazing
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Zen Vision: M a few weeks ago.  I had first contemplated ordering an iPod, but simply hated itunes, and was skeptical about this.  My last mp3 player was a Zen Jukebox, but I found it to be a bit too bulky.  Right out of the box I had an easy time transferring all my files onto the player.  Putting videos was simple, and video conversion was not a hassle.  The screen is absolutely beautiful and it has impressive battery.  I actually prefer its controls to the ipods simple click wheel.  Instead of constant scrolling I can just use the letter listing menu on the side, search for a specific song, or hold down to scroll.  It feels good, small and sturdy, in your hand.  I especially like the recording and FM radio features, particularly useful for recording class lectures.  Overall this is a great product and simply amazing.

<Title>A great product for technophiles everywhere.
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Tired of all this Apple lifestyle propaganda?, sick of all these Apple's true believers with their childish zealotry?, then this gizmo is for you.   Creative hits the spot with multiple video format support but still no Ogg Vorbis format support for audio which according to recent conducted tests reigns in quality above all other formats and no support for free lossless audio formats like FLAC & Wavpack which absolutely rule in the audiophile world. Seems the industry doesn't want to support these superior audio formats because of their open/free and no drm'd nature.  Nevertheless,this product is the current King in its category,it simply ravishes Apple's Ipod line with more features/more value,i wont supply more info on this,just read the reviews in various dap sites.  The only flaw i find for this product is its clonish look with Ipod,but taking into account the momentum the Ipod has in consumers psychology it seems Creatives decision to drop an original interface and copy the Ipods is somewhat justified.  I believe Creative used Sigmatel's latest chip for this player,the STMP3600, but since this a new chip with lots of features/power it would be wise if you're not in the immediate need for owning a unit now to simply take patience because sooner or later more products with similar features and better price will appear in this highly competitive market

<Title>8 months, two dead Vision M's-don't buy this player!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've now gone through my second Vision M. I loved it, still love it. I bought the first one in March, the player froze with a "hardware problem" that required replacement after 3 months. Happily, Amazon replaced it. I now have had the second one since the summer and yesterday that one died on me. It now won't sync despite changing cables, etc. And between fatal hardware problems, there were multiple episodes of freezing screens, need to reboot (and lose then subsequently re-download all my stuff) and general MP3 mischief. I don't use my player very often, I always took care of it, never dropped it, etc.  Now hoping to decide between the Vision W and the Zune, so if anyone has an opinion, would be helpful.

<Content>This is my second one. I also have a new 16mb flash player. I bought this one because of the capacity. But my first ones HDD died after 1 year , after the warranty was up. So if you buy one get the three year protection plan from Amazon. I believe Creative know about the HDD problem as it is very hard to buy a new one of these anymore even from Creative. Creative are cheaper and better than Apple, especially if you already have your music in MP3 format and do not need to but it.

<Content>This product is defective! It doesn't work and there's absolutely no guaranty process to take care of this. We bought this product in Dec 07 and after 1 month of using it very sporadically it froze! There was nothing we could do to get it back on. Took it to the store and got it replaced just fine. New unit froze in less than a month later! Store refuses to replace it and sent us to the manufacturer. Manufacturer doesn't provide a process to replace this piece of garbage! If you are in the market for something like this, pass on this garbage! You will be sorry if you don't. By the way, there's no way to take the battery out and reset it. You are out of options on this garbage! Please, please pass on this. Thanks for your patience. Good luck on your search!

<Content>Just figured I'd add my review here since most reviews happen shortly after someone buys the device. Unlike Ipods, which tend to have an average lifespam of 7 months, this player lasts and lasts and it still has better features and compatability than the brand new Ipod videos. Highly recommend it !!! Better sound than the Ipod, better features, compatible with any format and a pleasure to use.

<Content>I have had my Zen Vision M for over a year and a half now and have had no problems at all. The first couple of months I had it i had some problems with it freezing and I had to reset it a few times, but after I went to the website and downloaded the new firmware. I have not had any problems at all since. It has been dropped many times and there it still nothing wrong with it.(I use the leather case that buttons over) The screen display is stunningly clear. The controls are great after you figure out how exactly to use them. And its easy to install on your computer and add and remove files. I am glad I bought this over the Ipod.

<Title>The creative zen player is terrible and customer support is rude and unhelpful
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Vision: M about 6 months ago.  It worked ok, until I got a new computer.  I installed the software and immediately the player froze up and refused to work again.  After spending days trying to figure it out, I finally called the company, but it also took me forever to navigate the website.  I didn't buy the protection plan, but I thought they might still be able to help me.  I got an Indian guy on the phone who was really hard to understand and refused to help me unless I bought the plan for 12.99.  I know it isn't a lot but, I felt like it was a trick just to make more money.  Apple will help you no matter what.  I told the man that I was pretty disappointed in the product and he laughed at me! So, I emailed them and got NO help from that.  I tried to reinstall the software one more time and my windows XP crashed!  I am done with this player and company, its not worth it if it's going to mess up my new computer.  I'm just going to stick with Apple because at least they don't outsource their customer support employees to India.

<Title>Better to spend more for an ipod...
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I admit, I loved this player when I first received it. It had a beautiful display, was easy to use/configure, and was cheaper than Apple for the same amount of storage capacity. Unfortunately, that didn't last long, as a little over 3 months later my player completely died, lasting only a few weeks after my warranty expired. Doing a little research online, I found that this is a common complaint with most buyers of this model, and most of the other models Creative makes. I had a similar problem when I owned a Creative MUVo micro prior to this, but was easily able to fix it by going online and updating the firmware. No such luck with this one, after numerous e-mail exchanges I was told that I would have to send it back to be fixed at my own cost, minus the cost of parts(though it was THEIR fault the product was defective).   Researching further, I found that this was also a common response to the problem, replacing the unit for $25 only to have the same problem reoccur months later. So i decided not to deal with it, and opt to spend the extra money to buy an ipod instead which is much more reliable by far.

<Title>Mysterious Screen Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The zen was great for the first six months or so, but then one night I set it down by my bed to charge. The next day the screen looked like someone had stepped on it. There were blank strips and inky looking splotches, and the once beautiful clear screen was crossed with horizontal white lines.   Now, it's *possible* that somehow someone stepped on it during the night, but I can't imagine how that would happen, as it was not in a place where your feet could go when getting in or out of bed. So, to all appearances, the screen suddenly just went crazy.   I can still use it, and the features still work the same, but the whole point was for it to play high quality video, and now it just looks like pixellated crap. Has anyone else experienced this?  Besides the mystery of the screen, there were some other annoyances. As some other users have mentioned, it is VITAL that you buy a wall charger. If you completely drain the battery on the Zen, your computer will not recognize it or charge it, so you can only charge it from a wall charger.  Often I would turn off the Zen in the middle of a track, and turn it on later to find myself in the middle of a completely different track. This also happens when you're listening to an audiobook, which means you have to make sure to bookmark every time you turn off the zen, or you will lose your place. This happens very frequently, and is more annoying than anything else. In random mode, if you want to go back to the track it just played, you can't. When you hit the "skip backward" side of the touchpad, it just goes to a completely different track, forcing you to hunt down the one you wanted manually.  The touchpad is either too sensitive, or skips over a track altogether, which just takes more time.  The zen itself is pretty bulky, and not very easy to stick in your pocket.  Also, there is a problem with freezing/crashing, which increases if you try to go jogging with it (the zen isn't meant for much jostling).  That said, I loved the clear colors on the screen (while it still worked!) and the shortcut buttons. It has a very easy and intuitive interface, and it allows you to drag and drop files as well as syncing them, which I like. You can also delete songs straight off the zen, which the iPod won't allow. I just wish they'd worked out the bugs before they marketed it! I'm torn. I've seen a lot of very bad reviews on the Zen's overall durability, but I don't like any other media players because they're not as easy as the Zen. Plus, the price has actually gone UP since I bought mine! A dilemma. Any suggestions?

<Title>Thoroughly Impressed
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my opinion; Creative audio/video players are the best on the market in terms of value, performance, and features. These traits outweigh the aesthetic qualities of the ipod. What first impressed me with the Vision M was the quality of the screen; it is very bright, the abundance of colors is amazing and the backround customization is great. The navigation system is a little tedious at first, but it becomes a breeze after a little practice. The best thing I like about this player is the fact that it supports a large array of video/audio formats. I was able to transfer my video and music files easily.In regards to performance, the playback was perfect. I was able to watch a full length video and still have plenty of juice left to listen to music. The sound quality of the music was very impressive, (97 db SNR), add to the fact that you can use Custom EQ to tweak it to your liking. The only drawback with this device is the screeen scratches easily, but as one reviewer pointed out, you can use PDA screen protectors to preserve the screens finish.Other than this; the player is perfect. If you're looking for a product that will play your music and video files flawlessy and more, then this is the player for you. It is a better choice than the ipod and your dollars will go a lot furthur with this investment.

<Title>vision M is a winner
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the Zen Vision M from Amazon last week.  This thing really blew me away.  The screen is beautiful, video quality is amazing.  Sound quality is second to none (with quality headphones - not the junk they throw in).  It is considerably thicker than the 30G ipod video, but it feels much more solid and is more comfortable to hold in your hand.  Battery life is great (charger included!)  You can drag and drop mp3, wma, avi, divx, almost any audio or video file you may have and this will play it (or use the included software if you prefer).  On a few occasions, it said the video file was not supported, but with the included video converter, you're in business.  The user interface is great, much better than ipod's in my opinion.  The vertical scroll button now has side to side scrolling (an improvment on the zen micro).  Other benefits are the FM radio and voice recorder.  I tried the voice recorder and the quality was excellent, no spinning hard drive noise.  My only concern is how easily the unit scratches.  If you get this PLEASE get a case.. mine already has some minor scratches even though I have been careful.  Enjoy!

<Content>I have always been with the war against Apple's plan to take over the mp3 industry.  This little gadget should get the rest of the publics attention.  Although the Ipod video is thinner the vision is quite worth the extra 30 bucks, besides who really cares about the extra width.    Pros: High Definition Screen, custom wallpaper, verticle touch pad and pressure buttons instead of all touch, sound quality is rediculous, removable disk option, radio, video output to tv, compatable with most video formats, Battery life is excellant, compatabilty most applications, durabilty.  Cons: lack of silly Ipod like accessories  so sell your Ipod and get this

Wow, very cool.......except.....being portable......am I going to plug it into.....the wall at Starbucks? 6. Doesn't use one software? Yeah, you got me there. It uses REAL, or Windows Media player, or Music Match. Yeah, some winners there. Maybe I can use Sony's software and totally mess up my computer as well? Not. 7. Microphone. I believe you can get a mic for the iPod if you really want it. But are you expecting the Creative to be good at recording sound? A little mono mic like that?  Do yourself a favor and get an iPod. Don't waste your money on this. The hype is true. Treat yourself to the best portable video/music player.

<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ipod has an over glorified market.  My sister went through 2 Ipods and dealt with Apple's tech support. She said they are garbage, and said their tech support is terrible.  She also said their battery life is terrible.  After a short period of use, she said she needed to replace the battery.  I have consulted with her and since then she bought a creative MP3 player and swears by it.  She has had no problems after 2 years of use.  Another person I know bought an Ipod and said the same thing about their tech support.  He said when he called them up, they placed him on hold and must have just walked away.  He sat there for 45 minutes waiting and nothing.  He finally got ahold of them and they told him he needed to fax his receipt in.  He tried it 5 times from numerous fax machines and got the same response that it was unreadable.  If he was on hold so long for tech support, it could only mean 2 things:  1. They are ignoring his call because they don't want to deal with him.  2.  They are loaded with other callers because their products are garbage.  You can do the math, but from both cases, I think I have made my decision.  CREATIVE ZEN IT IS!!!!

<Title>A Truly Unbiased review!  Very good portable media player
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those of you looking to read something with substance, here's a review from someone who actually owns both an Ipod and Zen Vision M and has used the Ipod Video.  I've been looking for a feature rich portable media player (PMP or PVP) and was about to jump on an Ipod Video when I saw the press release for the Vision M in December.  I already own a regular 4G ipod and loved it.  The clickwheel made using it so easy.  I borrowed a Video Ipod from a co-worker and was impressed with the video capabilities; however I really wanted something with FM radio and better video codec compability.  The early reviews of the Vision were fairly positive, but had a few bugs like video buffer issues and no on the go playlists, but both are now fixed via new firmware.  The clincher was CNET's awarding it the Best In Show at the 2006 CES.  For a reputable site to recommends this as best in show over the hundreds of other new devices says a lot.  Ok, on to the real review.....  I purchased the Black Vision M and the two things that stand out is the clean front layout and thickness.  It is about .7 inches thick so it's signficantly thicker than the Ipod.  Although I would prefer the slim shape of the Ipod, the thicker Vision M was fine as it still fits in my pocket comfortably and is quite snug in my hand.  The instructions require you to do two things first:   1) Update Quicktime if it's version 7.0 through 7.0.2 before installing Creative's software   2) Charge it up first using the AC adapter which only takes about 2 hours (great advantage over Ipod)  User Interface and Slide Touchpad: The software is pretty straight forward and so is using the menu system on the Vision M.  The slide touchpad takes a little getting used and I have to admit the Ipod clickwheel is much easier to use.  However, it does have its advantages.  You are able to very quickly scan though large song lists by holding down at the top or bottom of the touchpad.  Alternatively the user interface allows you to search alphabetically via song, albums, artists, and genre.  This is something I wish the Ipod had as going round and round on the clickwheel sometimes gets old if you're looking for something in particular.  The touchpad also doubles as a previous/next or rewind/fast forward button by pressing it the left or right respectively.  Additionally, there are four buttons located around the touchpad:  Play/Pause, Context Menu (Options), Back, and Custom Shortcut where you can set it to whatever you want (almost, you have a list of options).  These buttons light up in aqua blue which is nice for night time use.  Sound So how's the sound quality?  Very good!  The headset that comes with the Vision is slightly better than the average as they fit snug in your ear and have good response.  In my opinion, both the sound quality of the Ipod and Vision M are good, but the Vision M is slightly better.  Additionally you can enhance your listening experience with the built in preset or custom equalizer and bass boost options.  I only wish it saved more than one custom equalizer setting.  Be careful when using bass boost as doing this combined with boosting the low end using the equalizer may distort the sound.  Oh, did I mention you can bookmark your music so you can pick up where you last left off which is something the Ipod doesn't do.  Other info Radio:  Very very good.  your headphones is used as the antenna and the reception is very good.  You are able to preset up to 32 stations (including renaming them) manually or thought the auto seek option.  You also have a signal strength bar (similar to ones found on cellphones)  Video:  The player's codec supports DivX4/5, XviD5, MPEG-1/2/4SP, and WMV9 as well as Motion-JPEG.  The included software will convert your videos to the proper codec and resolution including cropping if you so desire.  My only complaint is the 4-6 seconds of wait time when you start playing, but since this is a hard drive based device, it's understandable.  Oh yeah, you can even password protect files from viewing.  Screen:  Excellent, the 2.5" screen is bright and the colors are vivid; it's capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors.  Easily better than the Ipod Video which I thought was good to begin with.    Pictures:  The viewer allows you to choose from specified folder and displays contents in a 5 x 4 format.  You then pick the one you want to see via touchpad and then you have the option of zooming in.   Again, colors are vivid and you can even get picture details (via context button).  Miscellaneous features:  Voice Recording, Custom Wallpaper, Sync your Outlook Calendar option, Button lock (disables the touchpad and buttons), song and picture rating, Play music while viewing pictures, Compatible with Windows Media Player 10, 6 hours of video battery life, Smart Playlists (higher rated songs play back more frequently I think), Smart Volume (Normalizes volume of all songs), Video Out, power saving options, and PlaysforSure compatibility.  Weakness: So what keeps me from giving this unit a 5 star rating?  An overly sensitive touchpad (should get better as I get more used to it), lack of accessories at this time, lack of a removable battery, lack of lyrics display support, can't do anything with it when docked to the PC, separate 3 in 1 dongle for USB, AC connectivity and Video Out.  Overall these are  fairly minor complaints.  In summary, if you just need a decent mp3 player with video and photo capabilities, then the Ipod is a fine choice.  For those searching for a more feature rich player, this is an excellent option.   This item is selling well and I hope that translates to more accessories for this wonderful player.  I have thoroughly enjoyed using this player and hope you find this review informative.

<Title>This is to balance out all the geniuses who don't even own this
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own this unit either but some people are just ridiculous.  first things first, this unit has been out for only a month or so and doesn't have the benefit of rabid apple fanboyism so of COURSE there wouldn't be many reviews but even 37 various reviews of a unit is good enough info to know whether or not you'd like the Zen.  Saying "I'll trust 300 people rather than 37 people" and giving the Zen itself (what did the zen ever do to you to deserve that?) a low score is absolutely ridiculous and asinine.  second off, iTunes should NOT be seen as a plus for the iPod, rather it depends on the user. I like having complete control over my library and itunes is great for ripping and renaming/ID3 tag changing en masse but I HATE HATE HATE using it for my nano (it was a gift!). Some people love iTunes and that's their perogative.  Third, as for it's looks. GET OFF IT~!  Okay it's shaped like a box that's longer vertically, guess that bites off the iPod?  It has a 320 by 240 color screen, I guess that bites off the iPod? The interface has words listed vertically! JUST LIKE THE IPOD?! Whoa what a COMPLETE ripoff (sarcasm, oh btw didn't you know that creative has a patent on hierarchical menu systems before apple could?  Did the Firefox browser bite off of IE when they put the "back" and "forward" buttons on the upper left of their interfaces?  The only similarities fanboys are just driveling up is that it's a mono colored MP3 player, like an iPod but that's just silly; so if another MP3 player was one color, then it's biting off the iPod?  As for it's features..  1) Radio - I'll listen to it to find new musical content/bands to enjoy plus at times I just actually might get bored of my 20GB collection. Also you have to pay 30 dollars extra and bulk up your iPod to add radio to it.  2) Interface - I'll give yah this one. Creatives interface is pretty intuitive but the click wheel is a darn nice idea apple has. Still, it's not impossible for a normal person to use this unit.  3) Battery life - A person below me scoffed at the Zen having better battery life. Wow that's ridiculous. who WOULDN'T want longer battery life? In a practicality sense, more bettery life == using the unit more OR charging the unit less == longer battery life in the long run. Remember that Lithium Ion batteries have limited charges so charging it less extends the life.  The battery life is the same as the iPod however, except with Video (4 hours-ish for Zen).  4) Color Variation - I'm pining for the green one. If the iPod's have color variation, people would be flocking for them too.. oh WAIT! Why do I see so many females with pink and green iPod mini's still? ridiculous argument yet again. Choice (In this case, color of the Zen) is a good thing.  5) AC - My buddy lugs his power adapter (30 bucks extra from good ol' apple) around for his iPod. He doesn't mind and he charges it quite often actually.  6) Software - You don't have to use any but yet again this is up to the consumer. Some people like iTunes so that would suck if they used the Zen but I personally hate iTunes so it'd be good for me :).  7) Microphone - Usable in class lectures. Also people have actually SAID the sound quality from recording was good, instead of this person CLAIMING it would be bad.  Stupid arguments by Fanboys, it's quite pitiful. I say get whatever you want, iPod's ARE fine players but the people backing them can be pretty dumb.  It's all up to you! BTW Once I save up, I AM getting this but that's just me!

<Title>Review of Reviews. (silly but maybe a hint)
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think it would be a bit redundant at this point to review my vision m extensively, given the hundreds of others. I have had my Zen for about a year with zero problems. No freeze ups, no blackouts, none of that.   Going over the negative reviews I would like to say this much:    I saw a ton of customers (and a lot IPOD biases) who rated the product One Star simply because one malfunction which was more from their own part. For example, the oversensitive touch pad touch pad can be set a LOWER sensitivity level. I did find the pad a little difficult on the default level, so I set it lower. (I fixed this within the first week).  On the reviews were there was no fault to buyer, like receiving a bugged Creative, I can only say that "it happens". My brother received a dead IPOD-everything was replaced except for the case- and had to wait a few months to get a "fixed" one (same brand). This new fixed one had to be sent back again, because of bugs. This is just a universal mp3 problem.   HOWEVER; I do agree that Creative support is worth no time, and luckily I haven't had to test this theory. This is my first mp3 and I will probably get another creative. If my creative dies within the next year, months even, I'm fine to just buy a new product. (Considering my creative has outlasted numerous of my friends' IPODs I'm very happy with it.)

<Content>The battery could not be recharged after sitting off for 30 days. The online support pages were not helpful, and it was impossible to contact a person for technical help. Thanks for some kind people at a Creative forum I tried all the tricks and finally gave up. I won't buy another Creative product. I am now in the market for a new mp3 player.

<Title>Great MP3 but not without flaws
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my 30 gb zen for just over a year. I received it as a gift and have been very satisfied with it. The sound quality is great if you replace the worthless headphones the player comes with. The picture quality is good too. I love that I could set the background as a picture when the iPods weren't capable of that. The program it comes with is really user-friendly. Drag and drop, could it be easier? There is a large selection of free "zen-casts" as well, several to which i am subscribed. My main problems with this player are the heftiness of it: its thick, large compared to the new ipods and other mp3 players; and the fact that sometimes it freezes, and the only way to fix it is to stick a paperclip into the in-set reset button. This doesn't damage the player or the content in anyway, it's just irritating.   I'd really rather give it 3.5 stars. Overall, a really great player with flaws. For the price, I'd opt an iPod.

<Title>Creative Zen and NetLibrary
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Creative Zen Vision:M is quite acceptable for my purposes. I download Netlibrary books. You have to download the ZNVM_PCPatch_LA.exe to work with Window Media Player 11. You cannot download "Radio Quality" wma audio books to the Zen.  You must select "CD Quality" 32 kbps stereo books from Netlibrary. If your Zen unit does not charge, make sure you are plugged into a direct USB port (my expanded USB 2.0 card would not allow it to charge). My unit shuts down when charging (can't listen while charging). There are several updates.

<Title>Decent Player, rip-off service
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zen Vision M for 18 months now, and I am really pleased with the video quality and the ease of use. Sound quality is good too, and I like being able to hook that badboy up to tv when I travel so I can watch movies I've put on it.  Now the bad news - at least once every six weeks or so it freezes up and I have to reboot it. This sucks, since to reboot you have to wait awhile if you have lots of stuff on your player, and you need to find a needle (nothing else will fit) to reach into the tiny hole to trigger the reboot. This can be a real headache when you are riding on the subway or just sitting in a coffee shop somewhere, unless of course you carry around safety pins. Sometimes the reboots happen more frequently, but never more than twice a month. Still, that's kinda lame that its happening at all.  The worst thing about the Zen is the customer service - I dropped mine and the casing that covers the recharge jack came aloose, so I wrote to Creative to ask how much new casing would cost. $200 is what they quoted me (1/15/08)to install a new case!!!! Mind you, you can find a new player for cheaper than that on amazon. Now, there is nothing wrong with the player itself and I didn't want anything else done, just the casing replaced. The guy who wrote me back was even apologetic about the price, which tells me that the management is just out to squeeze every $ they can out of loyal customers, common sense be damned.  I sold my Ipod to buy a zen because I don't care for Apple's customer service, now Creative turns out to be much the same. I'd suggest that you either pony up for the extended 2 year warranty OR buy from a company that doesn't try to bleed you dry for what should be a minor repair. Between the freezing up and the exorbitant costs, I'd say look elsewhere.  Edit: Sorry, just looked online, since the Zen Vision M is no longer being sold at Fry's, Best Buy OR Circuit City, the price is an incredible $370 new!!!! I paid $323 new (at Fry's) for mine 18 months ago. I guess amazon makes a killing selling 2 a week (or month) but Creative seems to be really doing poorly if this is the best they can do in terms of marketing strategy.   Funnily enough, less than 2 months ago you could still find the M-30 online new for about $200 or so, but I guess this was before Fry's, BestBuy, etc stopped carrying it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ownership time: 1 month, refurbished player  Sharp screen, good clarity, brightness (even at 50%) and color quality.  I owned an older Zen Touch MP3 player and upgraded to this Zen and am not disappointed at all.  The best thing is that they cleaned up the touchy sensitivity of the touch bar from older versions.  Older Zen users might recall frustration trying to make the scroll bar settle on exactly the file you wanted to play.  The Zen Vision lets you either scroll with the touch bar or tap the ends of the bar to advance one line on each screen.    The interface has been made to operate more like an iPod, which I like.  The Random button has been replaced by a Today's Favorite button that does the same thing.  One thing I did like about older versions of the Zen that isn't in the newer one is that when you chose to play any song, whether randomly or by browsing to it, you could immediately call up the other songs on the album by moving the touch bar.  On the Vision this now increases and decreses volume, and if you hit the Back button you are taken to the main front screen instead of the album song list.    One other thing - the player supports limited video formats, mostly vanilla AVI, WMV and MPEG.  I have often found that Creative's built-in video converter will offer to convert an incompatible video type when you try to move the video file on to the player, but often times it goes through the whole process only to give you an error message that the file it just converted to wmv is not compatible with the player (???).  It doesn't happen all the time, only with certain video files.  Those nitpicks aside, if you have alternate means of converting video it's not really a problem.  Overall this is a pretty feature-packed player for the price and I don't regret my purchase one bit.

<Title>ipod beater
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some people are giving reviews going on about how the ipod is so much better than this music/video player. Personnaly i think they are wrong. The colour variation is a very good idea and you do not have to spend more money on buying differnt colour skins for an ipod. I also think that it is good that you can use different kind of players to put your music on this player other than just itunes. Another thing is that i have known so many people whos ipods have broken and as another reviewer said the tech support is awful. I have this player and i have had no problems with it and i think it is great. Do not get drawn in by the hype of an ipod.

<Title>Wow!  iPod on steroids!!
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I returned a Nano to buy the Zen (Amazon slowest refunds ever@#!)  But, the Zen is miraculous!  iPod should be very scared.  You can put music to slide shows (very simple process), change show transition types and speed (display on a TV is razor sharp-videos too).  FM reception is VERY good (blows my Sony hifi component tuner away, way away), battery life excellent.  NOT EASY controls and video settings, etc. at first--they took a bit to figure out since the manual was so sparse, but once you know how to use, controls are superb (the volume etc are very intuitive).  The hole Zen operation is near identical to a laptop touch pad with tapping, then you get audible confirmation with each selection.  For example, volume up, simply slide finger up.  The music sounds great, the unit looks sharp, and the functions are seemingly endless. Zen is not just a fancy CD player as iPod really is, and it comes with everything you need.  With iPod most will want a charger, maybe an FM adapter, blah, blah, blah.  All pricey, all bulky and all included with Zen.  Absolutely the right choice for me, I won't own another iPod.  BTW, bought theinvisibleshield.com's translucent protective covering ($15) for my Zen, a pain to apply correctly, but it is indestructible and clear as a bell when you get it right--forget the need of any type of case, etc. once applied.

<Title>I love it!!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 30GB iPod for my daughter and the Zen Vison:M for me. She has about 60 new songs and 10 videos for a total cost of $80.  I have over 2000 new songs(and more each day) for $15/month. They are both great products. But is comes down to what you can afford in the long run. As far as my Zen. I love it and know that I made a great choice. I have waited 2 years for a product like this. I love the FM radio and use it everyday to catch the news weather,traffic,interviews,sermons,ect. I can also record them a play them for others or future reference.  By the way, my daughter with the iPod, she wants to sell hers and buy a Zen Vision:M just so she can have more music. It also has voice recording that sounds great. I use it for song writing,lectures and meetings. I also love the calander and event planner. Another great feature is the ability to change the screen backgroud to personalize it. I find it very easy to navigate with one hand just using my thumb. I can even navigate it while running 7.5 mph on a threadmill, but do not try that at home kids. This is a great product and would recomend the ZEN to anyone. just remember: Even if you can afford to spend $1/song and be traped to iTunes only, I would still recommend the Zen just for the extra features,longer bat.life,and more color for video.  I have Napster to Go. It works great. I also have bought music from Yahoo and Walmart. Try that with an iPod.  Make sure you have a modern day computer: XP,USB 2.0  I see neg.rev. from people who should have bought a new computer and not an MP3 player who are complaining they can not use windows 98.   By the way, my daughter with the iPod wants to sell it and buy the Zen Vision:M so she can have more music to listen to.

<Content>I've spent alot of time on Amazon reading reviews on this product. I couldn't help but to notice that everyone who is loyal to Ipod gave this product one star. Most of these reviews are being written by people who have never even touched the vision m. People who don't want to believe that there is a product out there better then the ipod, like this one, are just bringing the rating down. Anyone who is interested in this product can visit Cnet.com they review hundreads of mp3 players a year and they're not bias to one company. This product is rated better than the ipod in more than one category on that site.

<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever had. I did extensive reviews before buying the new Vision:M and it is without a doubt one awsome all-in-one device. I now have several thousand photos and several thousand songs, as well as 5gb partitioned for data storage (you can choose between 512kb and 16gb for storage...awsome)...and still have tons of storage left. I also synched my Outlook contacts and calendar for added convenience. I have used the new Zencast to download video and podcasts, all with no trouble. I love how I can make any one of my photos the theme, and change how the image looks (color, black and white, sepia, etc.)...really cool feature. You can also listen to music while looking at photos. Neat.  Using it as a hard drive is super easy, and you don't need Creative's software to move data like some suggest, although you can use it if you choose.  Adding music is very easy with both the Creative software and Media Player 10, with no problems at all.  I have had no problems, no freezing and no skipping. The screen's clearity is amazingly bright and clear. I had a Zen Sleek before I bought this player, so I'm used to the touch pad which I really like. It is a little thick, which I wasn't sure I'd like. But, it actually feels solid and well built.  I have not owned an iPod and wouldn't want one after owning the Vsion:M.  The new Zen Vision:M is everything I was hoping it would be, and more.  Thanks Creative!!  And....how about laying off the adds in the review area? All it does is skew the ratings, giving false impressions of products.

<Title>Finally Settled!
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been buying mp3 players for over a year. With each one I buy, I planned on keeping it if I was happy. After 6 mp3 players, I've finally settled. I've been through an Creative Zen Micro, iRiver H10, Philips PSA612, Toshiba Gigabeat F40, and have returned all of them for various reasons. This Creative Zen Vision:M is a keeper!  The screen is absolutely gorgeous. My friends at work who have an iPod video say theirs are better... until they see the screen, and then their mouths just drop.   Another advantage is the compatability. You're not going to be stuck to some format like Apple who will trap you further and further into their money making traps, but with this, you're set free! Mp3, WMA, Divx, xVid, WMV, mp4... your options are wide open!   The touchpad takes a little time to get used to, but it's well worth the effort. Face it, when a person first uses a mouse, it's awkward, but it's extremely easy to everyone now. It just takes some time.   The dongle is a little annoying as you have to use it to transfer music or to charge up. I wish it would just charge and trasfer over a regular USB cord, but Apple doesn't have that either.

<Title>Creative > Apple
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Introduction I don't see what the big deal about iPods are. Especially when you have a product this much better. Yeah, there's people who say they just copied the iPod, but it's really not possible. Creative only had five months to see the iPod design, create their own item using that design, write software, throw parts into it, and market it. Not possible.  vs. iPod I don't have anything against the iPod. It has a really great design, and it's easy to navigate with no experience. The Zen Vision is a bit clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works great. No actual buttons to press, just tap the touchpad to make your selection. It's probably just as easy to use as the iPod, plus as others have stated, that's less buttons to wear out.  Another thing I think this player has over the iPod is that there is no real need for extra software. Right out of the box, I plugged into my Windows XP computer and I could start putting music on it immediately. I don't need the eyesore that is iTunes to put music on my device. One problem I did have though was dragging and dropping XviD and DivX movies into my player. I got a warning that said the file type is not supported, but when I used the software that came with my player (very clean and easy interface, by the way), it worked fine.  Features After having this device for about a week, I really can't think of anything else I could want. Of course, maybe wireless and a camera, but they're not very realistic wants. It plays pretty much every video I throw at it (MPEG, XviD, DivX 4 & 5, Motion JPEG, Windows Media Video 9), besides QuickTime and Real Media. It also does not have OGG or ACC support, but I think MP3 and WMA is plenty good enough. The screen is 2.5" and supports 262,144 colors. That's way better than any iPod video. It also has a Video output, so I can hook it up to my plasma screen at home and watch the episodes of The Office that I downloaded.  Customization Oh Lord, is it customizable. It has six different themes to choose from, all look very nice depending on your taste in color. Maybe you will be able to import more in the future? You can set a custom display background as well.  Also, the menu system is customizable. For example, if you want to remove the Radio, Microphone, and Picture items, it takes about four seconds. The only option you are required to have is System. I thought this was a very nice feature.  As you browse your media, you can also change the way it's viewed. For example, when viewing a particular artist, you may choose to view by album art, album title, or by tracks. This is consistent throughout the player for different types of media.  Pros - Supports many video and audio codecs. - FM tuner - Voice recorder (You can also record FM streams) - EXTREMELY customizable - Plug-and-Play setup - Video Output  Cons - No support for QuickTime and RealMedia - No Ogg or ACC support - Included headset is terrible - Desktop Dock sold separately  Conclusion All in all, this player really beats the iPod on all levels. That's just my opinion. I would rate it 6/5 if i could. Buy this player.

<Title>I am listening to it right now
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some would hallow the capabilities and the algorithms written for the iPod, yet they fail to notice the fact that Creative has been making sound cards for a LONG time.  They started making mp3 players even before apple and are now in the process of litigation/a lawsuit against apple for intellectual property infringement of Creative's interface.  Before you attempt to act affronted if you are an apple ogre, do some research.  Creative obtained the patent roughly two months before Apple did on the same design firmware OS.    In addition to that...phew-- Creative has two times the battery life (2hrs v. 4 hrs.), supports a plethora more file types ( and there is no *sound* reason to favor apple's format over others, it actually is less desireable because of sheer device compliance restrictions).  In addition to that, for people who have Tivo on their computer or in the standard format, the Creative accepts Tivo on the Go ( whatever that is), but for me, the video capabilities of this player allow me to circumvent approximately 2 hrs. of conversion for every hour of video that I wish to put on my player.  Apple also has no advantage with firewire (1394b) b/c both Creative and the new Apple video use USB 2.0.  Also, the AC charger is included with the player (a $30 charge from apple, that's the price diff right there).  The screen displays roughly 200,000 more colors than the apple and the interface is something you will get past in about 1 week.  I like it better than the wheel almost now.  With all of the advantages that I just listed, if you still want to buy an Apple iPod, I wish you good luck with your future endeavors in cosmetology.

<Title>I gave it a chance, and I switched back to the iPod!
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning an iPod for three years, I decided to "think outside the box" and get this video player from Creative Zen.  To say I was disappointed would be a severe understatement.  I was angry, confused, and frustrated.  Playing music shouldn't be this cumbersome.  The menus were hard to read, the controls are hard to follow, and the sound quality left much to be desired.  Plus, many of my favorite songs I got from iTunes can't be played on Zen.  Thankfully, I returned it and got a more updated iPod.  The Apple iPod is the standard-bearer of digital music, and I'll never switch to another player ever again.

<Title>Amazing Player....So happy I got rid of the Ipods
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't feel like writing a long review b/c most of the great points of this player have already been pointed out. Got mine the other day. Just want to say my part that this unit lives up to all the hype it's getting. I've owned a few Ipods and I must say in terms of build quality, features, sound quality & battery life this Creative model blows them away. I can't believe how nice the movies look on this thing. I also find the slider on this system to work better than the circular wheel on the ipods. If your thinking of getting one just go for it, you won't be sorry.

<Title>Started out great...
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>... but after a few months the player developed charging and connection problems. No matter how I tried plugging the device in (AC or USB), the battery would not take any charge. As for the connection issues, I tried reinstalling the software but the player just would never register on either of my computers. I visited Creative's web site for help (these are common issues for them), but their solutions could not fix the problem. Out of warranty repairs would have cost almost as much as a new mp3 player. So thats what I ended up doing. My Ipod is working great so far.

<Title>An all-around Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After getting my kids ipods and an iRiver device, it was time dad took the plunge himself. Since I naturally have a much larger cd collection than the kids, I wanted something with a lot of storage space. I had read many favorable reviews on the Creative Zen: Vision M and so I bought the 30GB model.   After 9 mos with this device, I can say I am 100% satisfied. It is stable, the screen is really nice, and the sound quality superb. I have found the battery life to be VERY good, too.   Once you master the touch controls, you can navigate with significant speed. I would recommend that you adjust the touch sensitivity to your unique touch - but wait 'till you've used it awhile. It takes some time to have it feel second nature.    I have loaded over 200 CD's on my Zen (over 2,100 songs) and I still have 75% of the ZEN's 30GB capacity left!! Amazing.   I also love the large screen and how it displays the album art so clearly.     My only complaint: I found the Creative software that came with the Zen to be clunky and didn't work well. After wrestling with it for months, I bagged it and now I only use Windows Media Player - which works perfectly.   My kids complain about their iPod not loading 100% of the album art (it still amazes me that Apple can't get that right). Not so with the Zen. 100% of the album art loads (in fairness, and as a side note, the iRiver also does an excellent job with album art).    I highly recommend the Zen. If you want to carry around the soundtrack to your life - literally hundreds upon hundreds of records/cd's, this is the tool.

<Title>Don't buy the Zen Vision M
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you do a little homework by searching the various forums where this device is discussed, you'll learn that if the unit works at all, it won't work for long. It will cease to charge it's battery, and it's unlikely that you will ever get the problem resolved.  Creative tech support is less than worthless! When mine stopped charging, I e-mailed Creative tech support. After a couple of days, I actually received a response... telling me to make sure it was fully charged.  GRRR!!! I will NEVER EVER buy another Creative product.

<Title>A good iPod alternative
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this player a couple of months ago as a birthday present. I had an iPod previously, but I despised the bloated nature of iTunes and the annoying limitations of the types of files that it could use.  First, the good points:  - The player has a great display, one of the best I've ever seen on a handheld player. Much better quality than anything turned out by Apple so far, my copy of 300 looks brilliant on it.  - Supports quite a few more formats. Avi. files were my main target.  - Great sound quality.  - Tons of space. I was really surprised how much I fit on here. I managed my entire music collection and several seasons of MST3K as well.  - The FM receiver is pretty handy when you'd like to get news or a weather forecast.  Now, the negatives:  - This player has a tendency to lock up if you are impatient in letting it load a song/video. If this happens, the player won't even let you turn  it off. You're stuck either having to hit the reset button (more on that later) or waiting for the battery to die. Either way, it's irritating when it happens.  - The reset button is unnecessarily difficult to push. Even a pen or pencil won't do it, you practically have to get a paperclip or needle.  - The touch pad, even on it's least sensitive setting, is still too inaccurate to compete with the clickwheel.  Despite these problems, it makes a solid alternative choice to the iPod if you're looking for a player with better video quality.

<Title>Somewhat good
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player in May of this year, and it has now just out of the blue started locking up on me. It includes an internal reformatting, and resetting function, which is good, but I guess I just got a bad player, because it locks up on this function as well. It's been good for the time I've used it. I've watched movies on it during flights, and I've continuously used it to listen to my favorite music while I travel, but now it's caput.  I just can't believe that after only 7 months I now have to look for a new player, and now the price is higher than when I bought it. I have to get rid of this thing, and it's beyond the returns policy.  I'm now leaning towards a zune. I just can't spend more money on a player that I already had that broke down on me after less than a year.  I'm very upset.

<Title>Horrid Repair Policy - Read  before considering a purchase
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the features of the Zen:M.  I have owned 3, but this will be my last.  The first one I bought had to be returned twice for problems with the headphone connector.  Recently the 30 GB version I own lost it's FM ability. So when I call they inform me the only service they offer for those of us who are out of warranty is to replace the unit ($249!).  So my issue is that I have owned 4 Creative devices, all but one eventually failed (within 2 years).  I can only guess that Creative has also seen the failure rate and has decided to bailed on supporting a faulty product.

<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got one of these and was very impressed.  Not as small as some of the new players, but small enough to do the job and go anywhere.  Size is about the same as a deck of cards.  Software which comes with it is a bit tough to get used to.  I like iTunes better.  But so far, so good.  Pretty easy to add stuff to the player.  Video looks great.  If I had to do it again, I'd get an iPod, but this is a solid machine with great sound and video.

<Title>Great Alternative to those others....
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Music is such a huge part of our lives.  No wonder Ipod has such a large sales base and following.  But I am not a follower...I was looking for an alternative to the Ipods and the Zunes.  My son had a Creative player for several years before it died tragically in a glass of water on his desk (don't ask).  When it came time to replace it, he only wanted another one.  Then my husband wanted one.  Then I bought one. And this Christmas, my oldest is getting one for a present.  We all have the same one- and all like it tremendously.  It takes a bit of time to get used to all the features and to even find them.  But once you are up and running you will enjoy hours and hours of music, videos, pictures....  You won't go wrong buying this one.  Even if it isn't one of the more well known.

<Content>I have owned two, first shut down after 2 or so months, had it replaced because of serious problems in the hard drive, and misplaced my second around here somewhere.  Considered getting a third, but I'm quickly reminded of my frustrations with the first Vision:M.  I know it's too much of  an investment again on my end for a device that may or may not be working in the next 3 months.  Easy to navigate (dummy-proof Windows format), with tons of space, great clarity, colors and all the works...if it decides to work when you're ready to use it.  Look elsewhere for all these features BUT with a more stable hard drive.

<Title>Geek Approved, you should consider getting it!
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best portable media player out as of yet.  Here's why you should get this instead of an ipod...  Ipod is all about restricting you.  You must download all songs/vids from ONE computer, and cannot transfer them to another, and it is format specific... It must be in apple format... BOO.  I have 3 pc's, and I sometimes move songs from my laptop to a desktop... NO RESTRICTIONS WITH CREATIVE.  It caters to more files, and doesn't try to play 'big brother' and be your conscience by limiting what you can and cannot download and transfer between the unit and your other pcs.  So, it has the speed, look and feel of an ipod, is compatable with more file types for both audio and video, and it won't try to be your moral guide by limiting what you can transfer and what type of file.  Enjoy!

<Title>Way Beyond Pleased
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned my Zen Vision:M for just over a month now and I figured that I am finally accustomed enough with my wonderful device to write a review.  I'll try to focus on personal experience as many others have commented on details and specs.    First of all, while it is a bit thicker than an ipod, it fits very nicely in your hand (its pretty close to the size of a deck of cards).  The screen is brilliant; much brighter and more vibrant than my girlfriends ipod and the sound quality is well above average. Pictures looked excellent, especially with the zoom function and movies were of very good quality as well considering the 2 1/2 inch screen.  It was very easy to adjust to the controls and buttons of the player. Everything is very intuitive and the vertical touchpad is very easy to use.  After a day of use I had next to no instances where I would accidentally hit a button.  If you ask me, the vertical bar makes much more since than the ipod (after all, you are going up and down in menus, why run around in circles?).  Getting music on to the player was a breeze.  I had about 2000 songs (mp3 and wma format) on my computer when I got my Zen and it took about 15 minutes to copy all of the songs to it.  As for my new cds and such, I like the ability to use any ripping device on the computer.  I've become a fan of Windows Media Player but I suppose that's a personal choice.   As a student, the removable disk aspect of the Zen is major plus.  I have all of my school papers, projects, web sites and such stored on it to access any time I need them.  My ipod owning classmates gave me the "I wish mine would do that" approach. Also I was pleased with the ability to be able to create playlists directly on the player without having to use a computer.  The radio feature is very good, providing reception equivalent to my car in most cases (I guess this could be seen as a novelty to some, but I have a morning show that I am strongly attached to and now I can listen to it from anywhere.)  My only complaint about the Zen is the lack of 3rd party products available.  However, I purchased a set of pc speakers for it and the included ac adapter makes the stereotypical ipod sound dock obsolete.  I also protected the screen with pda screen protecters from Best Buy (while not nearly as bad as the ipod, it still succumbs to minor scratches). The included case is decent for protecting it yet it is admittedly ugly and there is sadly an absence of alternatives.  Overall, I would -strongly- recommend the Creative Zen Vision:M to anyone who asked.  The ease of use is incredible and the features blow the ipod out of the water.  If you have all of your songs on itunes I would recommend sticking with ipod, but if your new to the market or have songs on your pc this is the way to go.  Fantastic product.

The Creative Toolbox software is okay but I converted my shows to DivX using Gordian Knot and then copy them over. Those have a fantastic picture and sound.   People in the IT dept at work were drooling. :-)  Some have complained that the touch controls are too sensitive. You can change that setting by navigating to System/Player Settings/Touch pad and setting the sensitivity to low.  I would STRONGLY advise buying a cover or case for this. Like the Ipod, it scratches easily and no matter how clean your hands are, you'll see fingerprints.

From just pure reading, everything sounded better than the ipod, especially its video capabilities.  From using this thing, I can honestly say it is the IPOD KILLER!  My friends even say so, and they own ipods.  If you're looking for the best mp3 player, go with the ZEN VISION M!  You won't be disappointed.

<Title>Nice, but a bit disappointed
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked every single day on Amazon.com and on Creative's web site to see when this product was available, and when I saw it was out, I bought it right away without any hesitation.  I really didn't care about the price.  I had done a lot of reading regarding this product and it seemed like a good buy to me.    I received it and was so excited.  I still am happy about it.  You read about all the features, so I won't even get into it.  I really like this device, but I was a bit disappointed because of the following:  1.  It scratches very, very easily.  I take such good care of it, and still it got a ton of tiny scratches in just about a month's time. This is exactly the reason I didn't get the ipod Video because I read that it scratches easily.   2. The battery life is not as good as advertised.  You'll have to put the brightness to the lowest, which is 10%, and just let the music play without changing the songs or using any other features of the player, before you can probably attain the 14 hours or so that they claim you can get out of the player.  Every time you operate the player, like touching the scroll or other buttons, the screen becomes a bit brighter and uses some extra energy.  In other words, when they say 14 hours, they really mean that you'll have to put the player on 10% brightness (which is not good for viewing pictures), and just leave the songs to play and not touch anything else, otherwise it will be more like 8-10 hours or so of battery life.  I took a flight from Paris to New York recently and the flight time was roughly 8 hours long.  I had the player on all throughout the flight except for takeoff and landing.  I had it at 10% brightness and I did changed songs and operate the player a bit, and right as we were about to land the battery went dead.  So you decide.     3.  I don't know if it's me, but the earphones just keeps falling out of my ears.  Well this is not a major issue, but I just think for a product that's $330, it should come with better earphones.    4.  The software that came with it is not the most user-friendly.  I just think that they could have made it easier.  It came with two different methods, one supposedly for the beginners and one for a more seasoned user, but even the beginners version is kind of complicated to me.  The process is just too slow, you have to click on each item you want to put into the player and then click "add"..., so if you have 400 songs and 400 pictures that you want to add to your player, you'll have to do this process 800 times.  I really didn't see anything like "select all" or "add the following" or something like that, you just have to do them individually.  That sucks.  If anyone knows of an easier way let me know!  5.  I was not able to get about 30% of my music and video clips into my player because of licencing errors or the file type was not compatible with this player.  I thought that quite a number of file types could be used without a problem... I really don't understand this part, all I know is that I just have a lot of songs that I can't even get into my player.    6.  They advertised that I can use Yahoo Music Unlimited or Napster with this player... I subscribed to both and found it very difficult to use when I used the "to go" versions from both of these companies.  The "to go" is that the music comes directly from these companies sites into the player and you don't have to pay for each songs.  I thought it was a cleaver idea.  It just didn't work at all using Yahoo To Go, and Napster To Go worked, it's just that each song took well over 10 minutes to be transferred into my player.  I called up Napster only to be told that this Creative Zen Vision:M device that I have is not compatible with Napster To Go.  Duh, so why did Creative and Amazon say it is?    So I gave the negatives about this player... but to be fair, there are probably twice as many good things about this player which I'm not going to name them all.  Some of the good things are: it has a huge capacity for quite a number of songs and pictures, it has voice recorder, it's gorgeous looking, very bright screen when you put it to 100% brightness, FM radio which you can record from and save it on your player, decent size... it's not too big and not too small... it's definitely bigger then the ipod video, but I like the feel of it, once you get used to it, the buttons and scroll is pretty simply to operate, the sound quality is great and there are 25 levels to choose from... and the list goes on.   Overall I gave it a 4.  I guess I am disappointed a bit because I had my hopes up way to high and anticipated this player for way too long.  Please e-mail me and let me know if you know of any fixes for the negatives I listed.  I will really appreciate it.  SilentSound2006@aol.com

<Title>Nice player, but won't play M4V files
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player mostly for the video feature.  The screen is very clear and the radio and audio quality are very good.  I was, however, very disappointed to find it won't play or even convert M4V (Quicktime) formatted files.  This file format is commonly found on ITunes (large selection) and is available from Creative's own Zencast service.  The Creative software that came with the player will convert different file formats, but not M4V.  Creative's recommended solution is for the user to buy 3rd party software (additional cost) and convert it (time consuming) before loading it to the Zen Vision:M.

<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the player for a  few weeks now and have used all the features available.  I would like to address some of the reviews I have read.  The battery is outstanding, if you condition the battery you will have no problems, please, please use the player until it dies and then recharge it try to do this at least 4 times when you first start using the player and it will work fine.  I use the player on my way to work ( I watch an episode of Family Guy) and listen to my mp3's and the radio all day and then on the way home.  I get at least 10-11 hours a day of battery life.  The screen is great the color is outstanding , the sound is as any Creative player,simply amazing and the custom EQ feature is a big plus. Radio frequency comes in very clear with little interference and I work in NYC midtown with lots of tall buildings. It's not as big as some users make it seem , it's actually the same thickness of my 4th Gen. 40 gig  Ipod but a tad wider due to the screen size but it's not cumbersome , agian it's the same size as the 40 gig 4th Gen. Ipod. and I see tons of people with those and no one complaining of arm fituge from holding the player.  All in all it's a great little package, since I got my Zen a few co-workers have put there Pod's on Ebay and are getting the Zen , more bang for your buck with 1 simple piece of equipment.  I have a case and screen protector that I purchased from www.i-nique.com that works like a gem.  I am very happy with this player

<Title>Best Alternative to iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Vision:M last close to a year ago and I have been nothing but pleased with it.  It can be diffucult to use if you are accustomed to the iPod user face, but after a while it becomes easeir to use than the iPod.  It has many functions aside from playing music, including video, photo, a built in microphone recorder, and FM radio (which you can record music off of to add to your personal MP3 library) and a shortcut button that you can program to take you to numerous places in the menu automatically.  All of these are very easy to use and gives me very little grief.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, coming from a brand not as well known as iPod, but I knew I made the right choice buying it right off.  In about 10 months it has frozen once, and with the reset button and the back of an earring, it's like it never even happened.  It has never been the source of any problems for me and has done its job, playing music, very dependably.  Even if the fact it is a sturdy well made MP3 player isn't enough for you, it is also very easy to customize.  It has 6 different color schemes(the color the font and selection bar are) and you can easily format any photo in your library to be the wallpaper on your MP3.  I have pretty much nothing bad to say about it.  It always functions and has a long battery life, unless you watch several hours of video.  My mother and my sister both have other Creative Lab MP3 players that are also really awesome, so even if this isn't what you want, but you don't want an iPod, chances are you can find something good from Creative.

I've used a couple of other brand players (including IPOD) and I like the Creative ones best.

<Content>This has to be one of the greatist products ever 30 Gb. in the palm of your hand. I was dibating between M the the Ipod but after i talk to my friend about his I pod which had mysterusly exploted (no kiding). When i head that i had no more respect for apple and all of there items. NEVER BUY A VIDEO I-POD EVER. I'm never buying any apple thing forever. I hope people will take my advise.

<Title>Great concept, great player... when it works
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Creative Zen for the basic concept.  You know, the idea that if you buy music you should be able to use it as you see fit.  A concept that has for some reason eluded both Apple and Microsoft.  I loved both of the Vision:M's that I have owned... as long as they worked.  Which was not very long.  In both cases, the unit worked fine for a few weeks but then mysteriously could not be recognized by my computer.  Or, for that matter, ANY computer.  There is no cure for this ailment, which happens frequently.  A quick google search will show you how prevalent this problem is with the Vision:M.  There is some discussion in other internet fora that seems to implicate the Gomadic charger for the fried Zen hardware.  Whether it's the Gomadic or the Zen, it appears plain to me there is a design flaw here that renders the Zen untrustworthy and as a result I cannot recommend it.  Give Creative an A for the concept, but until they fix this hardware problem they're not going to make any inroads into the market share of iPod and Zune.

<Title>Have had for over a year now
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>And it works great!    Charges last for hours and hours then only takes a fraction of the time to recharge.  Holds loads of music, pictures, and videos to keep you preoccupied over and over again.  The bright, crisp, clear display will make things look nice even if it is only 2 inches.    No installation CD necessary!  Take out of the box and plug into your XP SP2 or newer PC and it's instantly recognized!  Drag and drop icons from folder to folder for very easy file uploading and organizing.  Many reviews comment on easily scratching, but there's no scratches on mine.  Yes, it's in my pocket most of the day, however it's been slid around on tables and counter tops, even fell onto cement floors before - just a little wear on the backside, but the face is still almost pristine.  There's a manufactuar's overlaying display protector on the Zen and if you take care of your items like a reasonably responsible person, it should last you a long time for endless hours of portable entertainment.

<Title>Do not buy this...it only worked for a few months.
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product thinking it would be a great replacement to the Ipod I used to have. At the beginning it was excellent, the FM tuner is great. I used it at the gym everyday for at least 1 hour, for 3 months or so... Then one day the player would not turn on... I read that if I would connect it for a couple of hours and it would work again, I followed that advice and it did work for 2 days... the 2 days past and the MY ZEN M DIED.... it has turned on once since then, but just for a couple of minutes, funny thing... is that during the those few minutes that it was on the battery was totally full as well.  Anyway.... please do not waste your time or money with this product.

<Title>There are so many little things wrong with this.
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zen plays music; it doesn't play it badly, really. I suppose it does what I wanted it to do. There are just so many little things wrong with this player than make it inferior to the iPod that I cannot justify my purchase of it. Before purchasing this for myself, I owned a 4th gen iPod, and I loved it, but I abused it and after it broke I decided to try something different. After a year and a half I am STILL frustrated with this thing.  The good:  - I like the feel of the player in my hand. I know it's thicker than an iPod but that actually works for me. - FM radio is nice to have on occasion - Modifiable backgrounds, colors, etc. - The personalized button is great! I use it for "Random Play All", which is really fun. - Headphones aren't bad - Mine is bright green, I never lose it - I have to say, it has worked without major functioning flaws under pretty heavy use for a year and a half  The bad: - Very slow startup, especially if you haven't started it in a while. - Battery life isn't so hot after a year - I still like Apple's click wheel better than the touch pad - The four buttons on the sides are annoying to use; they require a very strong push. - There is no "All" tab when selecting albums and artists --- on an iPod, this exists. So it is impossible for me to view all the songs by an artist. I HAVE to view them by album.  - The software is horrible. I am pretty good with most technology but I can still not figure out how to make playlists on this! The software freezes all the time since I have over like, 10 songs, and I can never get anything accomplished. iTunes can be slow but it blows this out of the water. - If I open up a folder that has nothing in it, it freezes.  - When it loads songs sometimes, it makes an annoying clicking "processing" sound for a second.  - Sometimes upon starting a song you'll get strange feedback in the song. This happens at random and not very often, and if you restart it goes away, but it's still annyoing. I've seen this in other reviews. - The font looks cheesy, I'll just say it. - The charging device is ridiculous, with its various attachments.  - Menus are slow in general - When on hold, the screen goes black, and I can't see what I'm listening to. - The date and time are always wrong, no matter how many times I set them correctly.  - Also, the time is not displayed at the top of the screen like in an iPod, so I can't use this device like a watch. - No smart playlists; I miss this from the iPod  Overall, former iPod users will be very dissappointed with this. For a first mp3 player it might not be horrible, but at this point there are so many better, cheaper options out there. I've never tried a Zune so I can't comment on it compared to that. I just don't understand all the reviews praising the Zen. It has major flaws that make it annoying to use, and make it feel very second rate. Its one saving grace is that I have not had to call customer service ever; it has functioned "well" for a year and a half. However, I still can't use half the features on it, so I won't be buying another one when this one dies.

<Content>I will have had my Zen for a year in January and I haven't any trouble so far. Granted I have never owned a MP3 player before but I have not had all of the problems everyone else is compaining about. I listen to mine every day for a couple of hours with no problems. I would like to note that I usually drain the battery before I charge it. I have always heard that it is better for battery life. Oh and one time my computer didn't want to recognize it but that was a computer problem, I set it back a few weeks and voila no problem. I don't know what that was about but hey it fixed it. Kudos to an independent company putting out a good product.

<Title>Pretty good
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well to start, I really enjoy owning this player.  It beats any Ipod I've used.  I especially like the video capabilities and the design.  Originally I purchased the 30g version.  It was dropped about 4 feet onto a hardwood floor and that ruined the hard-drive.  The person who dropped it generously replaced it with the 60g version.  That one was working fine for a couple weeks until I got it out one day and, low and behold, the screen had cracked.  I still have no idea what prompted this.  (I do not recommend doing this) Since I still had the old one I took both apart and switched the screens and to this day I have not had any more problems.  I use Sennheiser HD 280 headphones with this player (sure its a little bulky but I don't mind) and the sound quality is superb.  Overall these should be 5 stars but the durability factor takes them down to a 4.

<Title>Best MP3 player!!
<Date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a gadget junky and have many MP3 players and PVP players and for the money and features it gets no better than the Creative Zen Vision:M. In reference to the iPod which in my opinion is also a good device, this has it beat in several areas that no other MP3 players have been able to do until now. With the Vision M you get a longer battery life than the iPod both in music and video, you have a wider variety of music and video formats that can be used with this player and you also get superior audio from this player. The Vision M also has an FM tuner which also allows you to record straight from radio to MP3 format so if you hear a song you love on the radio you can simply record it and have it stored for later listening. This player also has a voice recorder, calendar which can be synced with your PC and something that is a big plus is the Vision M allows you to customize your own wallpaper for your player and you can even use your own pictures as the screen savers something no other player allows you to do. The one thing that truly stands out aside from all those features is also the fact that this player has such an outstanding screen and it must been seen in person to believe as opposed to the iPod this player displays 262,00 colors to the iPods 65,000. Video playback is very smooth with no frame rate lose whatsoever and even if you get this purely for music, once you see the screen and the video playback this player will make you want to watch videos on it no doubt about it. The Vision M is very simple to use and the software makes transferring music, movies and pictures so simple its as easy as dragging and dropping which unlike the iPod requires you to use iTunes and as a consumer who purchases products at my own cost I want to be able to use my player as I like without having restrictions that I am bound to. The music play back on this player is superb and displays album art, artist info, artist track and you also have the ability to customize your own playlists, album of the day, rarely played and most played, ect. The Vision M comes in 5 colors and all look great, but just like the black iPod the black Vision M can scratch easier than the other colors so a case would be highly recommended, but then again with all things if you take care of your "toys" scratches can be avoided. I would also recommend a different pair of headphones as the ones included with the player sound great, but for true audio heads they won't be enough for your listening pleasure, but that is with any MP3 player new headphones are always a must. The Vision M is still brand new to the market so accessories are limited right now, but rest assured that as the market starts catching wind of this quickly sought after player, Creative will start pushing accessories just like Apple does and we will all be overwhelmed with the wealth of accessories. I truly don't have any cons against this player as it has far exceeded my expectations and if you are in the market for a new MP3 player and are debating between the iPod and this player, make no mistake you will be happy with either one, but why settle for what is the rule of thumb and go with what everyone else on the block owns and buy the Vision M and be the exception to

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Greets all I am the former owner of a Dell DJ and an Ipod Nano, and I now own a Vision M. After using it for a few days I must declare this gadget a masterpiece, I sold my DJ on Ebay and gave my Nano to my sister (darned thing was covered in scratches even though I took great pains to protect it) the screen of the Vision is worlds better than any MP3 player out there right now (brighter, much better colors&contrast) a longer battery life (4+ hours), and the wide variety of supported music and video formats will satisfy even the most jaded critic. When I first heard the Vision was gonna give the Ipod a run for its money I was doubtful, I am now a believer out to preach the greatness of this little wonder. Just a word of advise, to keep the face plate and screen looking like new I reccomend you purchase a custom shield from the invisibleshield.com, its worth every penny.

<Title>Software is an issue
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Others have posted more complete info, so I will not rehash that.  Briefly, I was very pleased with the audio quality. The video quality is very good also, considering the tiny screen. These should be deciding factors for many people.  The mechanical ergonomics and user interface takes a little getting used to, but overall, Creative did a fine job. You will probably want to set the pad sensitivity to low.   The player works with the supplied Creative software, and Windows Media Player 10. The problems I encountered importing my mp3's were duplicate tracks and album art. Depending on how many mp3's you have and if you care about album art, this may not be a problem for you. In my opinion, neither WMP or the Creative software makes it very easy for you.   The Creative Labs user forums are very active, and should be a good source for help on the issues you may encounter. Also, Creative company people also monitor and respond.

<Title>Better than the ipod video
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found this player just before i was going to buy a new video ipod. I just got the player and its incredible. The sound and video quality is the best ive seen, and very customizable. The navigation isnt as easy as the ipod's scroll wheel,but it gets the job done. the FM tuner and voice recorder are great, since i do not have to buy accerories for it,its embedded in the zen vision M. Like i said, the sound quality is much better than the ipod. The earphones themselves held up to a bass test that the ipod earphones could not handle without alot of distortion. The only trouble i had with the player is my m4a files, which i quickly converted to mp3 and loaded onto the player. Apart from that,it is a perfect machine and is, in my opinion, after using the ipod video several times,a better quality device than the ipod

<Title>truly a feature loaded player that's well worth the investment!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I consider myself well versed with MP3 players (i've owned an ipod and creative products), software, and features and after much research and questions, i decided to go with Creative for a second time and am very glad i did!  This is truly a feature packed MP3 player that's simple to use for anyone, and offers plenty of goodies for your money.  I've read some folks who are high on the ipod horse, however, i prefer not to be told where i have to buy my music and once i realized that the only way to purchase music for my ipod was to buy it at itunes, i felt like i was forced back into the apple store long after i had purchased my ipod.  Unless you pirate your music, the only place you can buy music is at itunes... the apple money machine continues to roll on.  When you buy an ipod, apple has you where they want you.  The Creative Zen Vision M takes the personal music player to another level by expanding on the basics of an ipod photo and gives you so much more freedom then you thought was possible.  The physical size of this unit is about 4" tall x 2 1/2" wide x 3/4" thick, making it slighty thicker then the ipod photo and weighing in slightly more.  When you hold this in your hands, you can feel the quality.  The buttons are located in easy to use areas and the backlights are vibrant and have a soft "click" when pressed.  The screen is incredible!  Believe the hype!  The color is bright and crisp and truly makes other named mp3 players look black and white!  The numbers don't lie... check out the specs and see for yourself!  The unit includes a USB 2.0 cable, A/C adapter (yes, ipod users, you heard that right... it doesn't cost more), software, headphones (that acutally sound halfway decent), and a carry pouch.  I admit, the pouch is a bit goofy and useless... creative really needs to stop doing the pouch thing.  You can purchase some great accesories including A/V Cables, leather case, dock, wired remote, and other goodies.    Setup is a breeze with this player, installing the drivers and software was real simple.  Once the drivers are installed, you can decide weather you'd like to use windows media player 10  or the creative managing software.  The included software is feature loaded with video compression software, mp3 encoding, photo management, and other goodies.  Transfering music is as easy as dragging and dropping as is importing photos and downloading movies to the player.  Learning how to use this player is half the fun!  Another great feature with this unit is the "plays for sure" technology.  This player is compatable with many of your music membership services like napster, rhapsody, or (my personal choice) virgin digital (best price per month).  Or, get this, you're actually FREE to decide where you'd like to buy music from, and no matter where you get it, it will actually play on the player!  How about that!  you can shop around for the best price on your favorite music!!!  You can even listen to your favorite radio station (news, talk shows, music) and college students will love the built in voice recorder for classes and organizing those recordings is a snap on your computer!  Creative is also working on the video content portion of their content and currently allows anyone to create and upload their own "Zencasts" to their website and share with others.  I understand that Encore is about to release video content for creative users with more on the way!  Audiophiles will love the sound quality and the features to tweek the sound to your liking.  The battery seems to last about 12 hours for me before completely dying and charging time takes just a shade under two hours.  I haven't noticed the unit getting warm with normal use at the office or during trips to and from. You should however be prepared for the co-workers and their questions and envy... two guys at the office decided to order one shortly after seeing mine.  This player is truly the best kept secret in a world that's seemingly dominated by a carefully marketed toy that scratches if you breath on it.  IF you're looking for the real deal, with flexability, and is truly feature loaded then look no further!  Creative has a real winner on their hands!

<Title>Why I chose this over an iPod
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll try and avoid philosphical discussions of the iPod and competition.  I don't know why iPod users seem to need to bash products that they've never seen or touched, but they seem to.  I was looking to replace my Zen Touch 20 GB.  I was almost going to buy the black iPod video 60 GB.  I went with this instead.  I only wish that it had a 60 GB model.  They've made improvements over the Zen Touch.  The buttons on the front are better, the navigation is better, and the USB cable charges the thing as well, the external power supply isn't required (although it is supplied!).  The iPod charges $30 for their AC charger, but this one is included, kinda.  The only bad thing about that is they both plug in to an external dongle.  The dongle plugs into the Zen Vision, and both the AC adapter and the USB plug into the dongle.  I'd like to leave my USB plug at home, and the AC adapter at work so that I always have power somewhere, but I have to remember to bring the dongle with me everywhere I go, or buy another one or buy a docking station.  Kinda irritating.  In addition to that, there is a noticeable lack of accessories for the Creative player.  If that bothers you.  So as for the un-avoidable comparison to the iPod... It's slightly less than once heavier than the 30GB iPod.  Not a big deal to me.  It's dimentions are identical to the iPod from the front, but it's a little bit thicker.  Extra space to house the FM receiver, recorder, and more battery life I suppose, not a big deal for me.  It's very stylish, solid, good looking machine.  So is the iPod.  However, the video iPod that I was playing with actually had a bit of a sharp edge where the plastic front met the metal back, which completely ruined the asthetics for me.  The Vision also has a screen with more colors and brighter images.  It just looks better.  But most of all, the great thing about the Vision is the fact that I don't have to use iTunes.  The iPod and iTunes are a great combination for those who aren't the most computer saavy.  But the Vision works with creative's iTunes equivilent just fine, in addition to windows Media Player 10, in addition to the windows file system directly, akin to a mass storage device.  So with a little knowledge, you have many more options.  I like that.  OK, so even more most of all was my real test.  One morning, I wanted to watch a 15 minute segment of a local new show on the train.  I was hoping to be able to plug it in to the TV and record it directly, like some other products on the market do.  I wasn't.  However, I was able to record it on tivo, transfer that video to my computer, and using Windows Media Player convert, resize and transfer to the Vision in one step.  All in all, it took about 30 minutes, but only because tivo is really slow.  If I had tried to do that with the iPod, I would have had to transfer the video from tivo, find some sort of software to convert it to a format that QuickTime Pro can play, then convert and save it in the right size/format for the iPod, and then transfer it to the player.  I never did it with the new show recording because I didn't know how to get it into Quicktime, but I did take a 5 minute MOV file that I already had and converted it to iPod format and that alone took forever.  It's this lack of flexibility that killed the iPod for me.  The Vision will take many different formats without converting, the iPod will only take a very specific format.  That's bad in my book.  Now if you only EVER plan on buying video from iTunes, then that won't be a problem for you.  The rest is just a pain in the butt.  I can't make that committment.  So that did it.  I love the thing, although I'm still kinda getting used to it.  I'm not anti iPod, but the iPod just isn't for me.  I'm above it.  Creative has been making these things for a long long time, and although apple has come along with a very good product for the masses, it isn't the end-all be-all.  Apple has, however, motivated some of the Asian players again, and there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.

<Title>Not a bad try - but still no iPod.
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While this is certainly the best player to come out to compete against iPod, it just doesn't quite execute as well as Apple.  A quick summary:  The Vision: M costs more per GB of storage space, is harder to use, and just isn't as cool and sophisticated as the Apple iPod.  While the Creative has a great screen and a built-in radio, these just don't make up for the cost and cheep-feel of the device.  While the screen quality is great, it is not that big of a deal.  The screen resolution is the same as the iPod video (storage capacity and battery life are also virtually the same between the two products).  The only difference is the number of colors the screen can display, which is hardly noticeable at that screen size.  I imagine Apple will have a similar screen soon if you really need the color.  As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck.  While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file.  I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file.  Apple is up front about their capacity.  For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer).  Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive.  Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M.  Take your pick.  Besides storage space, another item to consider is to is ease-of-use.  While they may look similar when it comes to input layout, they are not.  The Creative is much more difficult to navigate than the iPod.  Apple's menu navigation with the touch wheel is very intuitive, and simple to pick up on.  Creative's approach is, well, creative.  The menus are slow, and while you can learn how to use the touch pad, it is not very natural.  Stick with Apple if you appreciate ease of use and not having to look at your screen every time you want to do something.  Apple's wonderful iTunes software is another reason to stick with the incumbent here.  It is sleek and easy to use.  It organizes music better than any other jukebox out there, and interfaces perfectly well with your iPod.  Even though iPod doesn't play as many video formats, iTunes converts and optimizes video to play on your iPod for you.  Simple as can be.  Finally, just take into account quality and style.  Apple has been making quality iPods for years now, and they just keep getting better.   The iPod is proven, while the new Vision: M is not.  If there were significant benefits, it might be worth the switch, but the features are pretty much the same (except the radio, I must concede).  Apple simply makes a classier product.  The lines are simple and elegant on an iPod, and they feel great in your hand.  The Creative is very plastic and feels more like a toy than a sophisticated music device.  Even when Apple offered color on the iPod Mini, they still did so with a touch of class - the Vision: M just looks and feels cheep, although it is well build.  Besides, with the iPod, you not only get quality, but you get to say you own an iPod.  No one will know what you're talking about if you say you have a Vision: M.

<Content>I loved and took VERY good care of this thing for a year and 10 days, when it suddenly became a paperweight.  Creative support cuts off after one year and they will not cut you any slack.  You can't even get email support at that point.  They offerred to diagnose it for $120.    IF this happens to you, don't make the mistake I did.  Be sure to file a claim with your credit card company before thier deadline for "buyer's assurance" runs out.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with the Zune.

<Content>Great mp3 player, without the hassle of itunes. use WMP or other windows based software to sync.   Pros:  30 gb is a lot of room, consider 60gb or larger if you have a huge collection. Mine is currently full,(around 4k songs at 256) but I have every song I own on it and at a fairly high bitrate. Plays movies, slideshows, music. Much better than carrying pics in your wallet!  Oter consideration is the vision, bit larger in size, my wife likes it better. She has one. Cons:  Some may find the "touch" control very difficult and very frustrating to use. FM radio, poor reception, no memory card slots, no removeable battery. (have not had any problems with battery or battery life..approx 4 hours of music)

<Title>Great System and software
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision M has been a great mp3 player to me. I trully love this thing and I have had it for a little over a year now and it works fantastic. It is built pretty well I have dropped it multiple times and it still works fine. However, when you purchase it don't take it out unless you already have a case to protect the screen with becasue it is prone to scratches on the screen. I would suggest the use of both the screen covers and a case used in conjunction. Also I wouldn't use a case that holds the mp3 player in with velcro because the velcro fibers will scratch up the unit if you take it out multiple times. The screen is great and if you have windows media center you can take the DVD's you already have and put them on your mp3 player. in conjunction with the software that it comes with. Overall it is a great system and from now on I will be keeping an eye out for future creative products.

<Title>Too many flaws to love
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're a fellow Apple-loather and looking for a viable alternative...this, sadly, is not it.  The software is the first problem. It crashes frequently and sometimes fails to rip the last song on the CD for no discernable reason.  It often fails to convert video files to a format it can understand. Every time you attempt to synch it will try to install Microsoft Outlook on your PC.  Simply plugging your Zen into the PC will result in the Zen searching folders for any multimedia it finds and adding it to your player.  The player itself has a battery life that decreases noticeably with time. Recharging the player is also a pain since Creative requires you to plug a special widget into the device before it will accept a USB cable. Unless you carry the widget around with you, you're out of luck when you're out of power.  The unit also crashes too frequently for comfort, either by freezing up (which necessitates finding a paper clip and using the reset hole at the bottom of the unit) or by simply going black. In either case, the player then "rebuilds" itself which takes perhaps 20-30 minutes.  The interface responds erratically to finger input, and I often find myself being asked to rate songs when all I wanted to do was go back to the previous screen. The "random selection" function is also far less random than one would expect.  I'm already out of space on my Zen and will not be buying another one.

<Title>Zen Nano Plus
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my first experience with an MP3. I purchased it mainly to listen to recorded books. After years of carrying around shoe boxes full of books on tape to listen to, while I drive truck cross country, it was hard for me to believe that this small 1 gig device was capable of holding 10 or more books. It is how ever rather difficult to locate your book of choice if you have several books downloaded. Also difficult to bookmark or find your spot if you loose it.  This is a great device to listen to one book at a time while lying in bed or ridding on a plane or just sitting around. Creative's instructions are terrible and unless you have had previous experience operating other MP3's this isn't a good starter unit.  I have since purchased two larger units, a Sand disk E250 and a Creative Zen version M.  Both of these units are much easier to operate and you can see all your titles and easily select your choice from a list.   Creative's Zen Mp3 players will down load all formats, from the library as well as Audible books formats from private companies. The Sand disk E series will only download the Library wwwv format.  The E series Sandisk units are the easiest to operate and would be a better first choice pick.

<Title>Too good to last
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first Zen Vision M was immediately shipped back because it wouldn't turn on (so that didn't signal good things to come).  The new one I got worked beautifully for 4 months, but it just died.  First, the sound went out.  It continued to play, but the sound didn't work on my headphones or speakers.  Half an hour later, the screen went black.  An hour later, it shut down completely and my computer won't even recognize it. Attempts to contact customer service and get web support has been painful and arduous.  Their website is ironically faulty and they deliberately hide customer service contact information such as numbers and addresses so you just want to give up.  It's great while it lasts, but the company does not know how to run a business and is cheap when it comes to customer satisfaction.  Such behavior is reflected in their product.

<Title>Just Bought My 2nd One
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sort of good news/bad news kind of thing.  My old Zen had started to be hard to get to connect to recharge--it was taking multiple attempts before it was recognized by computer. Turns out it was the cable that went bad, not the player itself, but I didn't learn that until the new one came and I tried out the new cable.  So if any of you are having that problem, try the (much cheaper) cable first. But, I researched all the players all over again, as I was annoyed that the  Zen had apparently broken after a year and a half.  I'd not been at all careful with it--wearing it bouncing around on the lawn mower for hours every weekend etc.--but I still thought it should have lasted longer.  But, when I looked at the others, none of them had all the features I valued--great screen, bookmarks, FM radio and option of using the player as a USB drive of up to 16GB capacity.  So I ended up buying another one because they really are great players. Now my wife has inherited the old one that really was never broken, and everyone won!  I still recommend the Zen very highly.

<Content>I have had it for a month now, and I must say that I like this little guy! You can up load pics and set them as your backround, that is a fun function to have. The touch pad is a little too sensitive, just set it at "Low" and I think it will be way better to navigate arround! It will take a little time to get use to the Zen but once you do  it will be easy. Easy to set up and download the media.It is a little bigger than the I*** but it fits in your hand and you can get a good grip on it. It froze on me once but I just hit the reset button at the bottom and it was up and running again. I use it in the car every day and when I go for a run. Other than that no problems so far...

<Title>This is the one!!
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After researching several Mp3 players I settled on this one. I think for the money it is a great value. (I got mine at a good discount). The nice thing about the Zen is you don't need it's own software. Let me explain. When you plug in your Zen in with the cable Windows Media Player automatically  recognizes it. You press "Sync" on the media player and presto!! You can start adding your music. Plug and Play!! Zen recognizes Wave,Mp3 and WMA . Unlike The iPod You don't have to plug your player in to delete a song delete it right from the player! If your going to put video on the player Creative's software is easy to use. The video quality is great and with a program like DVDFAB you can adjust the video quality to fit your needs. Great Product!!

<Title>The Gizmo
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the larger version at 60 GB.  See my review of that if you like.  I am extremely pleased with the 60 GB.  Figure this is half the size of the 60.  Right now I have tons of music on it and still have 41 gigs left. When I bought the 60, Amazon had both sizes.  Right now, they are only carrying the 30 gig, but believe me, 30 gig is plenty of space--probably far more than you realize, unless you're tekkie enough to know what 30 GB means in English:-)  Creative Zen M is a great product.  The ONLY down side I found was that all the gadgets out there are available for iPod, not for Creative Zen.  If you don't need all the plug-into gadgets, the Creative Zen is a great product.  Jan 2008:  I just bought this for my son.  He finally killed his 60 GB Gizmo, but, in reality, it took a tremendous amount of abuse (like a Tonka toy truck).  Because of his electrician job, crawling around in claustrophobic spaces and up and down ladders, it got banged and dropped an awful lot.  It still kept going, held together by tape, fo a long time.  For an electronic, it took an awful lot of abuse.  He's paying for the replacement, or it will be his birthday gift.  Have not decided which yet, but this is a great product.

<Title>Fantastic Player
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a TON of research before I bought a player and this is the one I chose.  It was the right decision.  Great software, merges easily with my computer.  I run Windows and use Windows Media Player 11 to organize my music and this integrates seamlessly with that (you don't have to use the software it comes with at all).  It even grabbed all my pictures and video too!    The interface is feature-rich and has everything I'd ever want to use in it.  The controls do take a delicate touch to get used to, but I got good at it in about 5 minutes.  The screen is amazingly bright and easy to view, even for video (supposedly twice as bright as an iPod) and the battery life is remarkable.    All in all, much better than a comparable iPod AND it has radio.  Also a host of great accessories for it like remote controls and silicone protective covers.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.

<Title>Just awesome
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a long time and owning a few different MP3 players, I have found my favorite. It's just an overall great player.   Pros:  SOUND QUALITY. It's just as good if not better than an iPod. Note: No EQ settings required, this sounds great without any tweaking. Plays almost any audio format and most video formats without an issue 30GB at a very good price FM Tuner...that actually works in my office, so far, this is the only tuner to pick up my favorite station while I'm IN my office. Favorite button - Never knew how much I could appreciate this feature, but it'e great. I have mine set to play and shuffle all tracks. The display is incredible. The color and image quality and absolutely smooth movement, very well done. Videos - look great, you don't even mind the fact that it is a relatively small screen. Photo Slide shows, and the software automatically resizes pictures for best display and file size. Controls - Any laptop user will appreciate the touch pad controls.  Cons:  The battery life is great for a HDD player (especially with video), but nowhere near a flash player Updates - As soon as you get this, download the newest softwares. Loading videos was an issue until I did this. (On the upside, my downloaded podcasts translated very well) Size - not as small or thin as many players. Not a problem for me, because I like having a good size to hold, but I can probably say that this is my biggest acceptable size for a player. But the build is solid. The Sync Adaptor - while not too cumbersome, it is an extra part that should have been built onto the cables.  Overall - the best player I've owned and until something incredibly groundbreaking comes out, I will not be getting rid of this any time soon. Until it breaks, as I have no reason to even look at anything else.

<Title>I WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING IT
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like a lot of ppl I did my research b4 buying a new mp3 player. I had 3 choices: The IPOD, The ZUNe or The ZEN, i honestly did not know anything about it but I started looking around. I didn't want an IPOD because everybody has one and well the Zune was too expensive for me at the time. But looking and looking i came to the Zen more for the features, I love all the features many of them the IPOD doesn't have, I like the recorder because as a college student sometimes I like to record classes. 30GB it's enough space for me, I even have a couple of movies on there for when i need to travel, the size it's fine with me for all the features that this little guy has OMG it's amazing...

<Title>iPod or Vision:M?  Not black and white.
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Is the Vision:M a 5th generation (video)iPod clone?  You bet... right down to the little green battery charge indicator in the upper right corner.  Is it better than the 5th generation iPod?  In my mind there's no contest, but there are trade-offs.  Judge for yourself.  Creative Vision:M, why is it better? -Plays DivX and XviD video, as well as WMV-9 and MPEG1/2/4. -Higher color screen (262,144 colors vs 65,000 colors) -Natively plays MP3, WMA and WAV, without conversion. -Better signal-to-noise ratio under same frequency response. -Longer battery life (approx 4 hours video playback vs iPod's 2 hours) -Includes AC charger. -FM Radio/ Recorder. -Voice Recorder. -Compatible with popular music services, like Napster. -Customizable menu, with background image. -Organizer features Outlook sync support; Contacts, Calendar & Tasks. -Colors blue, green, and pink are also available. -The back side isn't made out of scratch magnets like the iPod. -Natively acts as external hard drive in Windows.  Apple iPod 5th Generation, why is it better? -Slimmer. iPod - 0.43in / Vision:M - 0.7in. -Lighter. iPod - 4.8oz / Vision:M - 5.7oz. -Clickwheel is still the preferred navigation input for many. -Lots of first and third party accessories available. -60GB version also available. -iTunes support. -30 USD cheaper.  If you're in the market for a 30GB player and you're considering the 5th generation iPod, give the Creative Vision:M a serious look.  If your friends ask you why you bought a "generic iPod," you can tell them with pride all the reasons why the iPod simply wasn't good enough for you.

The creative zen vision m does everything that the ipod does and WAY more. compare: vision displays nearly 4 times the number of colors of the ipod. the vision has a built in fm tuner and voice recorder, the ipod does not have eather of these features. the vision supports a WIDE variety of video formats that the ipod does not. the vision comes with neccesary cables and adapters. the only things that ipod has over the creative model is it looks shiny. They are both great players, but the creative model is simply better. just read the specs. if you want a quality product at a good price, definitely choose the zen vision: m.

<Title>IPOD KILLER!!! Awesome player
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had first written a review, and my original enthusiasm still remains for this player. I bought it on the US date of release, and have used it for a fair amount of time. I still love the player, and here's what's happened so far.  The Player (after a Firmware upgrade) still performs like a beauty. Most Divx/Xvid files downloaded from Torrent sites can be thrown right on. The Majority of the content on my Vision M are videos, which is my main purpose. The player performs well, and I can squeeze off a movie, and 2 TV shows, roughly 2.5 Hours of video, and still go on with about 6-7 hours of music (or possibly a few more shows).  The player is indeed a scratch magnet on the front. I had originally invested in screen protectors from Kroo. Unfortunately, they are of low quality, and a Screen protector is a must. I also snagged an Action Jacket for my Vision M, which increases the bulk slightly, but not enough for me to notice. The player has survived Coke and Sprite spills, and there is no evidence of discoloration.  The Player is obviously a little large, in a "brick" sort of design. Don't let this turn you away though. It is very easy to hold, and is very sturdy. The Buttons require a significant push, and the player feels like it is well built.  Sound quality is great. The Navigation does have a learning curve, and your Menu Colors are limited. Your options as far as customization go are wallpapers and menu order. The Main menu contains menu items, which can be deleted/rearranged with ease. There are 6 preset themes, appealing to different tastes. There is little lag in between menu options. The player is VERY sensitive, almost to the point to cause frustration in some people. Scrolling does have a clicker noise, which can be disabled, along with a clock, calendar, and dates. Customization is a key feature. Imagine an Ipod Scroll wheel, with all the options broken apart into 4 buttons, and the actual wheel became vertical. Enter, Vision M!  For the Ipod fans, I have used an iPod video enough to review, and it can be safely said that you will probably navigate easier on an Ipod than a Vision M. The Ipod's Navigation wheel is much easier to use. However, usually this has nothing to do with the actual features.  The FM Radio is of good quality, and features a little Cell phone style bar that indicates signal strength. I usually have full bars, and the reception quality is crystal clear. No hissing, buzzing, or such (for you Rio Fans).   The Screen is gorgeous, and re-encoded TV shows and DVD movies still retain their quality. I tested many movies, and all have been clearer than your standard Tube TV. Although the Vision M can support many formats, movies play best at medium-High Divx Bitrates. Oddly enough, XviD seems to cause problems such as synch (see below). Most of your p2p, Torrent, and Ripped movies will be ripped in Divx. It is best to Re-encode DVDs into around 700+ kbps Divx movies, to avoid problems. The codec is simple and most full-length movies will set you back 14-20 minutes. A good program is PocketDivx.  Now come for the Two Massive Cons. Movie Synching, and Freezes.  My player has frozen on me 5 times. 1 time included me asking a hotel for a sewing kit so I could use the needle to reset. All this time an image of Brad pitt was frozen on my screen. When the player freezes, the lights will usually remain on, and the on/off switch will not work. Usually I encountered this problem on XviD Movies. Divx however, was very stable.  Another Huge Con is the synching of movies. Again, usually with XviD movies, video files desynched after 20 minutes of play. This meant that the audio was about 2-5 seconds behind the video. The point of desynched was set in stone, and there was no fix. Desynching usually occurs when the Video Bitrate exceeds the Vision M's CPU capabilities. Recommended bitrates are 600-800 kbps, and a 14-minute re-encode to Divx can skip over such hassles.  The Vision M comes with a proprietary connector to Charge and to use Video Out. Video Out is good at the proper resolution, and looks like Basic Cable. Still fun to use, but don't expect HDTV. The Dongle can be annoying, and it is like an ipod dongle, but reversed.  PROS::: Amazing Feature set Crystal Clear FM radio Good Software for Transfer Gorgeous screen Sturdy Good sound/video quality  CONS::: Freeze/Desynch Bug WINDOWS XP ONLY! No Drag and Drop (not a biggie) Scratch-fiesta in your pants pocket Proprietary connections   Overall, I am very happy with the Vision M. It Performs well, and under good care, looks well too. Once you learn the navigation, and find your sweet spot to avoid the bugs, you'll be in heaven!   IMPORTANT!!! There are 2 different Versions selling currently. Once reported as a Vision M: lite (not a common term), there is a smaller box that includes a Vision M WITHOUT A CHARGER. The Prices don't seem to be different. THE PROPER BOX IS THE ONE THAT IS ENCASED IN A THICK COVER, AND SLIDES OUT LIKE A MULTI DVD BOX. The smaller version usually is the same price. THE SKU NUMBER IS THE SAME. You are safer buying the vision M in store, as Both Boxes will be acceptable with the same SKU.

<Title>Not perfect yet!
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before you buy, make sure it supports the codecs you use.  It has very good codec support but it's not perfect yet.  It may not support all forms of divx and xvid (it has not been certified by the divx company).  This player DOES NOT SUPPORT AC3 (the 5.1 surround track of a dvd). Many of the movies downloaded off the net use soundtracks encoded in 5.1 or 2 channel AC3.  Hopefully a new firmware will fix these glaring omissions in an otherwise very competitive product.  If you are looking for a small video player though, this is much better than the Ipod w/ video.  The screen is considered better by reviewers and the improved codec support means less time transcoding your videos.

<Title>Setting the record str8 
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would like to respond to the reviewer below who gave it a one star and is clearly some ipod fanatic club member.  The creatives vision m battery life is better than the ipod video - TRUE take a look at reviews online.  The one on CNET.com confirms 15 hours for audio (higher than suggested) and about 4 hours and 11 minutes for video under their test conditions.  This is clearly better than ipod's 2 hours battery for video.  Add to the fact that creative's screen is more vivid and bright - 262,144 color screen compared to ipod video's 65,000 color screen.  The creative vision m is an ipod killer - TRUE in terms of features and value.  The creative zen vision m is only 30$ more.  With that 30$ you get: A much more advanced display.  You get longer battery life for video. A more wide array of supported video formats (mpeg-1, mpeg-2, mp4, divx, xvid, avi).  Also 640x480 resolution is supported by the vision m unlike ipod video which is limited to 320 x 240 resolution.  The higher resolution allows the TV output to be much more clearer.  You get more audio format support, FM radio, voice recording etc.  Basically it does what an ipod video can do plus a few additions and features.  The biggest problem I have with the ipod video (I bought one when it was released) is that it scratches easily.  So much so that it will build up on scratches overtime and make the display look deformed.  I have not dropped my ipod once and everyday new scratches appear.  How could apple sell a product like this?  How could any company sell a product like this?  So I can go out and shell out more cash for a case?  I'll get a case to protect it from scratching from drops not from scratching that happens when I pull it in and out of my pockets.

<Title>Great player...lacking accesorries availability though
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this player for the past two weeks and have played around with it extensively.  As a Video/Mp3 player, it's great. Long battery life and also easy to navigate through the menus. Easy application to use, just drag and drop Mp3s like an external hard disk, no iTunes necessary. Supports album art which is great cause it looks cool when you browse for the album you want to play. Package comes with all the necessary items such as a power charger and usb cord and CD full of applications such as video converter, media manager and CD ripper.  I know people tend to compare this unit with the iPod. But the unit does what it does well and that should be all a user should worry about. There isn't many things wrong with the player so you can't really go wrong. But if you compare it with the iPod 30 Gig, Creative Vision : M has better video quality over the iPod, it has a FM tuner for radio and also is a voice recorder, it also plays multiple formats such as divx and xvid which is great for lunch time watching (I don't think either iPod or Creative Vision : M was meant for movie watching). Battery life is the same as it uses the same battery, although creative seems to have better power saving functions.  It's con is that it doesn't have USB on the go, it requires an adapter. And also because the product is new, you really can't find accessories anywhere. Hopefully if it is as big a hit as the iPod, alot of accessories will come out. As it has only just come out, the software is a little buggy such as album art does not always get uploaded properly and sometimes does not undock properly but nothing that can't be fixed by a software or firmware upgrade.  Overall a highly recommended system and a must have for people who want music on the go. Definitely worth the money.

<Title>Excellent Portable Media Player!
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Zen Vision: M for a total of about nine months now, and I use it practically everyday and I love the thing.   On the audio side,  The Vision M supports an adequate amount of audio formats, including mp3, wma, and wav for you audiophiles.  The player has a handy equalizer that really makes a difference with a ton of presets.     The area where the Vision M really shines is screen/video performance.  It supports a ton of formats, including xvid, divx, avi, mpeg, etc; this means that there is virtually no conversion required for most videos when transferred to the player.  However, some video files contain AC3 audio which the ZVM does not support and audio conversion to mp3 is required.  The screen on this thing is beautiful, being able to display more than four times as many colors as the iPod's screen.  You really have to see it believe it.    One amazing feature of the ZVM is to set a user wallpaper.  I love that you can crop, adjust brightness, and change color tone of your desired picture to get it to look the way you want.  Several themes are also available to choose from which changes text/dialog box colors and wallpapers.  The touchpad is effective, in fact a bit too effective for navigation and I set to low sensitivity.  The lighted tactile buttons are a nice touch, and an even nicer touch is the shortcut button.  You can use it access whatever menu you want with one press.  The FM radio picks up very well with autoscan, although I really don't use it so I can't comment on it.  But if radio is your thing, then you'll love that you can record directly off the ZVM's radio.  The built-in Microphone picks up voices in a crowded room very well and comes in handy quite often.    I can see how the player's removable disk (up to 16GB) feature would come in handy as a replacement for a flash drive or a full-blown hard drive for transferring large files; it does however seem kind of impractical that you have to carry the player along with the dongle and a usb cable around on you.  Needless to say I don't really use this feature.  The Zen, however is not without faults.  Its easy to forget that there's an actual hard drive in this thing, and  people (including myself) don't treat it as carefully as it should be treated.  I used to keep it in pockets and bags, throwing the bags carelessly.  The player has locked up on me a handful of times, requiring a poke of the reset button; considering the player has met tile floor a couple times, it has held up fairly well.  The M is also extremely prone to surface scratches; all past and future scratches can be concealed and prevented with an invisible skin from bestskinsever dot com for about eight bucks shipped.  The included software is pretty weak, I did not install mediasource so I cannot say much about it. The included video converter only works about half the time and will not work with long movies I have tried, but there is plenty of freeware for video conversion out there so it's no big deal.  I use MediaMonkey for ripping and tagging music, and the creative zen explorer to sync albums with album art to ensure it shows up.  besides that, for music, videos, and photos, it's as simple as drag and drop in windows explorer, which is very, very convenient.  All in all, the ZVM is a high-end player way ahead of the pack, with a great feature set that would be able to satisfy the most demanding portable media enthusiast. Minus a few faults, the ZVM shines. Even two years after release, is definitely one of the best players on the market and most deserving of your cash.

<Title>Zen broke within 3 months of having it
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the features of the zen alot... That is why I gave it a 3.  My Zen had a hard disk failure.  It is currently being worked on by Creative Labs and their service has been great (antoher reason it earned a 3).  The reason I am writing this review is to let people know that this "hard disk failure" is a "somewhat common" problem.  I found out about that when I did some forum searches regarding my players symptoms.  Great product when I was able to use it though...  UPDATE: (4 stars)  I sent my zen in for repair.  They sent back a new one.  It was a hardisk failure.  They replaced it for a $25 handling fee.  Great customer service at Creative Labs.

<Title>So satisfied with my Zen Vision M!
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this product for about four months now, so I have had a really good chance to break it in.  I love it.  Honestly, the only real drawback is that it's kind of bulky.  Bulkier than an Ipod and heavier as well.  It's cool though, because I have a clip I can use to put on my belt or pocket, or I can actaully just take the clip off and put in my shorts pocket.  I also bought the neoprene skin along with car charger and wall charger.  The adapter you use to plug into the computer is a little different since it comes with it's own special adapter to do this with.  I was having issues with the player for a while when trying to use my Yahoo Music Unlimited to Go subscription.  When I would try to download, the computer kept screwing up and freezing.  Songs would only download 70 percent of the time which was incredibly annoying.  BUT once I did the update for Yahoo Music Engine and updated to the latest firmware on the player by going to the manufacturer website, everything is absolutely pristeen!!  I have 3099 songs on it as of today and I cannot get enough of it!  I listen in the car mostly and at home as well.  I look the look of the player because it does not look like everything else on the market it would seem.   I do not have any videos on it as of yet, but the player comes with some demos installed.  I gotta say the display is wonderful.  Great color!  I never thought I could watch someting on a screen so small and enjoy it, but it's actually kind of cool.  Perfect for riding on the bus and listening or watching a video.  The sound quality is very good as well.  It comes with an equilizer option where you can customize it to your particular liking or set it to the common options of rock, jazz, classical, pop, etc., just like the Ipod.  Just remember, if you do the custom EQ option, bass can distort the sound if you do not set it correctly.  Sound is different in the car as opposed to a home receiver.  I have seen many complaints about it's navigation wheel but I disagree.  At first, when you are just a novice on the player, navigating can get frustrating because the button is sensitive and you tend to scroll down and press on the wrong link constantly.  Oh, you can change the settings for the button sensitivity by the way.  I set mine to low on day 2.  Yes, once I was but a student, NOW I AM THE MASTER!  Now scrolling is something I can almost do in my sleep.  I have playlists, tons of albums, and never a bad moment listening anymore.  By the way, creating playlists is another downside on the player.  The instructions on how to do this don't make any sense and when I tried to use them, it did not work as I wanted it to.  So now, I just create the playlist on the computer in using Yahoo Music Jukebox and it's a lot easier that way.  I really like the DJ option as well, since it will just play every song on my player randomly.  This is great when you stock you player with nothing but the tracks you love.  One remaining annoyance though is that when you download tracks from Yahoo Music Jukebox to the player, they don't stay in the order they were on the album for some reason.  You have to go and change them around in the player (which I do using Windows).  Would call the manufacturer about that, but once the first sixty days are up, no more free customer service calls.  It then becomes, I think, $12.99 per incident.  The forum on the website is extensive, but for someone like me, it's a bit opaque and hard to navigate if you don't know exactly how to word what you are looking for.   I have not had any problems with the harddrive freezing or crashing.  No hardware problems at all, especially since I did the firmware update.  The cool thing is that you go to the site and it can tell you all the available updates for your player and lists them with recommendation factors.  Sweet.  Battery power seems fine since full charge probably lasts 10 hours or so.  Features are many, almost too many to go into every single detail but some are calendar, organizer, most popular song play, rarely heard song play, yet to be rated song play, artist lookup, etc.  Probably the coolest feature of the Zen Vision M is the shortcut button.  You can set it to go to a popular selection like rating screen, equilizer, whatever.  That is pretty damn sweet if you ask me.   So all in all, I definitely think this is a great option vs. the Ipod.  Not to mention, the fact that I got the player, the neoprene skin (which absolutely rocks by the way), and the chargers all for less than the cost of a comparable Ipod.  AND I still get 50 bucks back in the rebate deal that came with it.  Absolutely awesome!  After rebate, my entire purchase ended up costing me less than $200 dollars!  That's right, I got a 30 GB mp3 player and accessories, both necessary and optional, for less than $200 bucks.  I am in the catbird seat with this one.  I definitely recommend the Zen Vision M.

<Title>ZEN better than ipod
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had an ipod for 3 years and I recently switched to the ZEN and I absolutely love it. I had a few issues with getting movies onto the zen but i downloaded some free software to convert the movie.  The zen comes with the ability to record radio and voice without an attachment, unlike the ipod. Also, there is not any copyright issues with the zen. Overall it's a great product and I would recommend it over the ipod.

<Title>Potential But Beware Hard Drive Issues
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Creative Zen Vision M suffered a "harddisk failure" that rendered it completely useless less than 4 months after I bought it. That being said, here are my pros and cons of the product when it worked:  PROS:  + Decent battery life + Capable FM tuner - I personally got good reception with it. You can also record FM + Videos display well on the screen. Colors have good saturation and images are crisp + Sound quality is good + 30 GB is more than enough space for music lovers + Has a voice recorder function (although it takes a few steps to get to it)  CONS:  - Charging. The Zen doesn't come with an AC Adapter. You must plug it into a USB port on your computer to charge it. Not only that, but there's also a separate adapter that you have to plug into the Zen first before you can even connect it to the USB cable. Heaven forbid you lose the small adapter.  - Hard Drive Failures. I know I mentioned it above, but it sounds like I'm not the only one that this has happened to. Hard Drives should not fail only 4 months after normal use. And no, I didn't use my Zen as a frisbee or anything that would have warranted an early death.  - Included Software. Ugh. Creative's included software with the Zen is uninspiring to say the least. Yes it's functional, but barely. The Video Converter software couldn't convert half the videos I tried using. And this is a player that touts that it can play almost any video file.  - Bulk. The Zen Vision M is fairly bulky compared to other mp3 players, especially compared to flash players.  - The Touchpad/Front Buttons. I guess either you'll love it or hate the interface. I personally thought the vertical touchpad was kinda neat at first, but after awhile it actually became annoying. The biggest problem for me was the touchpad's accuracy while scrolling up/down lists. It liked to skip items. I tried adjusting the sensitivity but it didn't seem to help. The other buttons work okay, but overall I was disappointed.  - It was unable to resume where it left off of on a song whenever I turned the player off for a couple hours. I would turn it back on and it would be in the middle of playing a completely different song every time. This made it impossible to listen to long podcasts or audiobooks.  - Lock-ups. A lot of MP3 players seem to have this problem and my Vision M was no exception.  Overall, I think with some changes the Vision M could've been a good mp3 player. And if the bundled Video Converter software worked more than 50% of the time, I think it would be a good video player as well. However, the hard drive issues and the touchy interface (no pun intended) make this a difficult product for me to recommend.

<Content>This is an amazing product. I have had it for at least 6 months now, and so far, there are absolutly no problems with it whatsoever. I love my Zen, and it is a much better product than an iPod video. The only problem with it, is if you are switching from an iPod to the Zen... becuase of DRM'd music, and Apple trying to lock you in with the iPod, any bought songs off of iTunes won't work with your Zen. This obviously is not a flaw with the Zen, its Apple being Apple.

<Title>Great mp3 player. Much more versitile than ipod
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player. I don't think I can say more about it. I believe all the other colors at the time of MY purchase still included the wall adaptor. Mine, unfortunately didn't. Just b/c it's the black model.  It does have scratching problems, but is more resilient than the iPod. I went from the iPod to this. You cannot use iTunes w/ this product yet. No 3rd party applications nor iTunes native support exist. My only "it could be better" for the Vision:M is to get a bigger HD. They only have 30 and 60 right now. I went with the 30 because I didn't want to spend more $$ and hate it. It's got tons better color than the iPod, has Radio which is good for walking (only works for fairly strong signals, though), can support wma (WMP 11+), mp3, and pretty much any avi file you can toss its way. XVid, DivX, etc etc etc. Great for home movies. The interface is semi-customizable, which is nice. You can use your own pics or theirs. It has different themes, it shows album art, syncs with a few good software pieces. I use MediaMonkey. You can use their native player, but it kind of blows.  The screen is a bit bigger or about the same size as the iPod. The only thing I would suggest before buying is to take a good hard look at the 60GB model, and perhaps consider the bigger screen. Hopefully they come out with a touch screen model, though, because it's kind of cumbersome-looking in regards to buttons.  The other great thing: The sound is far superior to the iPod if you get a nice piece of earbuds.

<Title>High Quality Media Player
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this about a month ago and after loading almost 500 songs & numerous photos & videos, the unit stopped responding. I was on the phone with Creative for 30 minutes trying to reset the unit & it still wasn't responding. They suggested I send it back to J&R Music for a refund or exchange. I did as they suggested and it took about 2-1/2 weeks for me to get a replacement. It seems to be working fine now. The sound quality is at least as good as an Ipod, if not better. The screen resolution is almost as clear as my High Definition TV -- the colors really jump out at you. The unit is easy to navigate and the controls are not too touch sensitive. The software it came with was easy to download. Unlike the ipods, you can sync music to the Zen from many media players such as Yahoo Music, Windows Media Player, etc. The difference between a unit like this and an ipod nano is that all your media is stored on a hard drive (ZEN) vs. storing on a flash drive (ipod). I would recommend this Zen to anyone who appreciates good quality sound with a high resolution color screen and the high capacity storage that the 30 GB allows.

<Title>wonderful
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my black Creative Zen player for about a month now. It took a while to get use to - but so did my other mp3 players. The battery life is decent, I could work a full shift (10.5 hrs) without fear of the battery dying.. and part of the next day if I forgot to charge it. I have about 2,000 songs on it right now and havent had any problems with it. Windows Media Player is so much easier to use then my last nightmare of Sonic Stage. The sound is amazing on it, and the volume goes fairly loud. The display is the most amazing thing about it, the colors are so bright.. but it also kills your battery. I almost always have my player set at the lowest dimness possible except when I want to show it off. I enjoy having a radio and being able to record directly from it and the reception works just fine for me.  Onto the dislikes.. the black scratches like no other. I was extremely careful with it and it scratched so easily. I did find a silicone type of case for it on amazon, but the damage had already been done. I did however drop the player from about 4 to 5 feet onto the cement recently and this thing is durable (pushed off a counter - wouldnt recommend it!). Ive never owned a harddrive based player before, but you can tell the difference. Theres a slight delay while switching between songs and a longer delay when choosing to randomnly play all songs. These things really didn't bother me when weighed against the pros of this player. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!

<Title>I love this MP3 player!
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not a particularly high-tech user of this device and have to admit that it's probably over-engineered for my needs.  But the Creative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and video player caught my eye when I was shopping for an iPod, and since it rated so highly in the tech reviews I decided to buy it.   My main interests are listening to albums and books, and being able to put photos of my family and friends under the nose of anyone who looks as if they might stand still for it.  The Creative does all that perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  Downloading and organizing my files is a cinch.  I haven't got much video loaded but I can see that for my needs I'll never run out of space.  I'm amazed at the crisp screen definition!  You can see every twinkle in my granddaughters' eyes.  Another big plus for me is the length of time this little object of desire plays on a single charge, especially playing audio.  I've never had to charge it in the car, it just plays and plays.  The controls are easy to use and the bookmarking is very easy -- helpful to me when listening to books.  My Creative Zen:Vision just looks and feels good and I take it everywhere with me.  A year ago I'd have said this technology wasn't for me.  I'm SO glad I changed my mind!

<Title>Player Works great - supporting Software is lousy!!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen 30 gig player and it works really nice.  But, the software that they send you to download for it is not compatible with any files that you may already have in your iTunes library.  You can load the files on the player and they work fine.  But when you dock your player and look at it through the Creative Media software, you cannot see any of the songs from your iTunes, even though they are generic MP3 files.  So you can't use their software to build any playlists - it really sucks.  The only MP3 files that will show up on the software are those that you rip from cd's directly through the Creative Media software. I ended up using Window Media Player 11 that sees everything and I can build my playlists through it.  But it is slower and more bulky, but I don't have a choice. BE AWARE!!  They will try to solve your problem, but it can't be done.  Nor do they answer their phone for their Customer Support - it just rings and rings and rings.  You have to do it all by email.  Buyer beware.

<Title>Bringing Zen to my life
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my creative zen vision last month and I am really enjoying it!  It was easy to learn to use and navigate, the thing I am still working on is transferring/syncing correctly, but once I master that it will be a perfect product.....    The sound and picture quality is amazing.  I just recently spent too much time in airports and my Zen made it bearable.  It got me through a whole season of a show that I was watching.  I would chose my Zen again any day.  I also would recommend getting a car radio transmitter, and a good case to protect the screen.  Again, go for it, the sound is great, the picture quality amazing and it is easy to use.

<Title>Good player for a certain clientele
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision: M is a great player for those of you wishing to listen to music in your car or at your house.  The sound quality, in my experience, is superior to ipod, and the battery life and controls are satisfactory.  The problems begin, however, if you wish to use this player as part of your workout.  Because Creative is forced to use a hardisk with the Zen, the player is not suited to exercising (even though there is an armband for sell).  I, personally, have very sparingly used this player for running, but have heard from others that after exercising with it for a while there player has begun to freeze consistently.  Compounding this problem is the lack of customer assistance that Creative offers.  Unless you invest in a full warranty, which costs over half the price of the player, there is little chance of getting assistance with problems, let alone being sent a replacement player.  Despite these problems, I have imensely enjoyed my Zen as I commute everyday.  If you are looking for a good player with a lot of memory and pretty good battery life this is the one.  If you're looking for something more versatile I suggest you opt for the smaller memory flash player that is more durable with no moveable parts.

<Title>a beast
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is STURDY. I have dropped it several times from like, 6 feet and it hasn't broken. Unlike the ipod, you can choose a background for your interface as well. This lends a sense of real personal ownership to this player. The only real downfalls it has are a sensitive touch interface and the fact it freezes up sometimes.When it freezes, it's easy to reset with a paperclip. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ITUNES! Plus, you can copy media files from this onto Windows Media player with no additional software. While this thing isn't perfect, I have given it 5 stars to compete with the 'trendyness factor' the ipod has in its advantage.

<Title>The Big Question
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well the Zen was purchased as a gift for my father for father's day.  My brother liked the features so much that he purchased one shortly thereafter.  However we have been unable to get one that even turns on.  I've downloaded all the product support from Creative Labs, as well as the new firmware.  The frustrating part about it is this is the second unit that is DOA.  My brother purchased his at a local store and works flawlessly, were my father's came from an online source.  The stupid thing will not even turn on.  And it takes "4" weeks to get a new one????!!!!  I'm not really happy at the moment.  My brother's functions awesome, no trouble at all, and he loves it.  My father's however is well ...... well you get the point.  Sorry B&H.  I spoke with the tech folks in "India" and they suggested a trick to get the batteries to fire up. The problem they said was the unit had sat too long and run out of juice.  So they recommended that I plug and unplug the unit 15 times waiting about 3 seconds before replugging the unit. Amazing it worked and things are running just fine. So the problem is B&H Photo Video...must be why their price is so low...over inventory on the shelf too long.

<Title>Zen v. Ipod: Two Big Lessons in Careful Shopping
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife bought me a Creative Labs Zen Mp3 player for my birthday. It's the most wonderful present I ever got, next to her and my children. She knew there were two criteria for me: a really good sounding mp3 player with enough memory to hold a substantial portion of my huge music collection. The rest was up to her.   Naturally, one of the candidates was the Apple IPod, and the other, Apple's biggest rival to date, the Creative Labs Zen Vision M. Both are pretty comparable in features, but that's where the comparison ends.   Before I go into how my wife bought mine, let me explain how I might have bought one. My first impulse was to buy a used IPod, which would have been a horrible move. Another reason is that it didn't have nearly the amount of memory I wanted on my Mp3 player. But that leads to my second potential downfall: instant gratification.   When I want something, I want it RIGHT AWAY. Instant gratification has always been one my biggest weaknesses. I would have rushed to Circuit City or one of the other "big box" electronics stores, compared the ten or so options available there, and would have walked out with an overpriced IPod because I would get instant gratification. I would have owned the most popular brand of Mp3 player. This would have been a very bad decision for many reasons.   As with just about every financial decision she makes, my wife's first move was to go online and do some research into Mp3 players in general. There she found what's important to look for in an Mp3 player, and what's not so important that marketing experts make seem important. Once she's narrowed the field down that far, she started comparing products.   Amazon.com is the best way to go for comparison shopping for two reasons. First, they give a good baseline price by giving their own price as well as prices for their stable of marketplace sellers who sell the same products new and used. This gives the buyer a very good place to start. In my experience shopping, these prices are always substantially lower than retail.   The second great feature about buying electronics from Amazon is their customer reviews. Amazon has spent years cultivating good, bad and ugly reviews of the majority of the products they sell.   doing so, my wife found that a LOT of people have had a LOT of trouble with their IPods. After a year or less, many I-Pods begin locking up and constantly needed to be reset for little or no reason, or they were failing to work at all. When reporting these problems to Apple, their pleas and complaints fell on deaf ears. The process of getting the IPods fixed proved expensive and time-consuming to the point where the owners gave up completely and moved on to another brand.   The Zen Vision M, meanwhile had a lot of great reviews from buyers, many of whom had owned IPods in the past. My wife also found that their warranties were more substantial, and that they had a better record for honoring the warranties, although given the quality of the product, they probably don't need to do so as often.   Thus, on my birthday I opened up the box to find a beautiful lime green Creative Zen Vision M instead of an IPod and I couldn't be happier. Besides having a way cooler name, the Zen goes with me everywhere, and will eventually have to be surgically removed. In buying my present, my wife got a better price, a better brand, a better product and a much happier husband.

<Title>Almost perfect ... almost...
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player. When my beloved creative micro 5gb died, their was only choice for a replacement- another creative. I have also had the 256mb muvo (that one died after one year of constant use and reformatting). Then I went with the micro, which was a gem, it really was, but it too died after many falls to the floor at the gym. When this died, I again turned to creative, only I wanted bigger, better, and video would be nice too. I have all these things which the Zen Vision. (I love the pink color). This player is close to perfect but not quite. The size is an issue. Unlike ipods which are slimmer, this is a bulky player. if you like to work out with music, this one is a bit too big for running, lifting wts, etc. But other than working out, the size is okay, it's not that heavy, and the screen size is great for watching video. It is very difficult to find a case, unless you get one that is custom designed for this player (not likely to find in retail stores, only online). I never wanted the ipod because i don't like people telling me what to do, and w/ipods you have to choose their precious i-tunes, or you are out of luck. With the zen vision, i use the programs i choose and it has worked perfectly. It recognizes almost any music formats, and can convert music and videos if it doesn't support the format. I have televisions shows, movies, music, etc that I transfered from my own library without a hitch. I have had this player since December and haven't expenienced any problems. Creative makes great players, but as with ANY electronic, an extended warrenty is a must if you pay over 100.00. Otherwise- you're gambling. And that is the truth with any MP3 player.

<Title>hands down better than iPod video...accessories an issue
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought myself this mp3 player on Xmas of 2006.  Simply put: it beats iPod video hands down.  Love the fact that you can throw any video format and it plays it.  If not, included software does the conversion job for you.  The only "issue" (that's why I'm not giving it the 5 stars) is finding accessories (that's the only regard were I envy iPod owners).  To top it all, the connector is proprietary; I wanted to purchase a docking boombox and ended up buying an overpriced one at Creative's store.

<Content>I had one of these and it was stolen.  I really liked it and so bought another one but when I upgraded the software for the Zencast organizer, it quit converting the videos I previously downloaded.  Now I can't download videos until I get this figured out.  I tried to get the Creative Labs support to help me but they were worthless.  I downloaded another video converter and it works but it is a lot of work.  This is the only problem I have with this product.

<Title>This trusty little powerhouse will serve you WELL........
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only reason I'm on here to write THIS article is because my 30gb Zen Vision M was stolen out of my backpack YESTERDAY, so I'm back here on Amazon to buy a Zen Vision W. But don't get it twisted. I'm only buying the W because I decided that I may as well go "out with the old, in with the new". Before my Zen Vision M was stolen, it was my best friend. When I first bought it a few years ago, I bought a leather case for it to protect it from scratches. I'm a jogger, so I of course took it jogging with me. I can honestly say that I dropped it at LEAST 20 times during various jogging sessions, and other than a hairline crack in the upper right corner from a particularly violent drop while jogging, it never stopped working. Also, it is the only player that I know of that can play all the video formats that it does WITHOUT having to convert them. Video is just as important to carry around as audio, so I needed a device that would play as many video formats as possible, and I didn't want to have to convert half the videos before being able to play them on the player. This player is PERFECT for that. It plays mpg, DiVX, XViD and avi formats without having to convert them. Avi is at this point the most widely used video compression format for quality videos.      The only drawback to this device is that infrequently, it would freeze while playing. I'll say that it happened on average maybe twice a month to me, and that's considering the fact that I used it EVERY DAY. I wasn't really bothered by the fact that it froze up a couple times a month. Now, if it were to do it every DAY or something, then I'd feel differently. When it froze, you'd have to reset it by gently inserting a pin into the reset pinhole, then it would reboot.      I would definitely recommend this product for audio AND video playing. The only advantage that the Ipod has over it is the thickness. It's about twice as thick as an IPod, but other than that, the Ipod can't even compare to it in terms of compatibility with various audio and video formats.

<Title>So Awesome
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Vision M two days ago, and I already have all my songs on it, and some of my favorite movies. It took me a while getting the hang of the file conversions, but it's not too hard to learn. I love the organization, the easy scroller, and the amazing sound quality. Before I bought this I had a Zen Touch which was made in like early 2000, but the scroller finally wore out and didn't work. Besides the limited accessories for this item, I believe this product is ten times better than the video iPods. You don't have to go through iTunes, you can drag and drop folders and files instead of having to update your iPod(which gets old fast, and you have to keep all the songs on your computer). Kind of experimentally, I put movies of different file types into my Vision, and they all worked. They take 10-15 minutes to convert if it's not the right format, but it's a worthwhile process. I love this product.

<Title>Zen Vision M is a superior player.
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was choosing between the Ipod video or Zen Vision M (ZVM).  Frankly, I really didn't care whatsoever about which player I bought - Ipod or ZVM; I just wanted the "better" one (Toshiba Gigabeat S was out of the question due to reliability problems and short battery life).  Now that I have the ZVM, here are the reasons why I bought the ZVM over the Ipod.  The ZVM has:  *Longer battery life - ZVM video lasts about 4 hours - which is twice as much as Ipod. As a result, I don't have to worry about the player running out of juice at the end of a movie like with the Ipod video.  Also, it's just nicer to have longer battery life.  *Digital camera storage - The ZVM can directly store my photos from my digital camera so that I don't need to bring along a computer to store my photos when I travel - just plug my camera to the ZVM, download photos, then erase my camera's card to take more pictures.  *Hard drive capabilities - The ZVM acts like a hard drive.  Just plug to a computer and download what you need.  For example, I can go to my friend's computer and copy all the music/video/etc files I like with drag-and-drop ease. Also, I can now store very large PowerPoint files on the ZVM so that my work presentations have a better bang - and I get better results.  *Multiple file format support - The ZVM plays a lot of video file format's that I already have such as divx, xvid and WMA.  This is not a major issue to me however because even with an Ipod, video/audio conversion is not a big deal - just an extra step.  *Software ease-of-use: With the ZVM, I don't have to rely on iTunes to get files loaded onto the player.  Itunes program isn't bad, but sometimes I think it is a little cumbersome.  Currently, I just use Windows Media Player and/or the regular Windows XP Explorer interface.  *Better screen: The ZVM has a better screen than the video Ipod. For example, the ZVM has 260+k of colors vs. 65k on the Ipod. The difference is readily seen with the ZVM having more vibrant colors and a less washed-out appearance.  *Accessory support: For $25.00, Amazon.com sells a combo that includes an AC adaptor, car charger adaptor, direct USB cable (no need for included ZVM dongle), and a battery pack (uses 4-AA batteries) for those long flights.    *Cheaper:  The ZVM is priced much less than the Ipod.  *FM Radio: Despite a large library of songs, it's nice to be able to hear fresh music over the radio.  *Recording capability: The ZVM can record FM radio.  But for me, I like the fact that I can put my BlackBerry on speakerphone and then use the ZVM to record the conversation for business legal and future reference.  *Short-cut key and easy navigation:  The short-cut key is great; I have mine set to the microphone record function.  I haven't had any problems with the ZVM's navigation on screen.  *Multiple subscription service support: Although I haven't used them all, I hear the music subscription support is great. For example, I heard that with Yahoo (at least for your 1st month), you can pay $15 and download all the music you want.  What a deal.  *Customizable EQ: The ZVM has preset EQs also, but I prefer to set the EQ my way.  Despite these features that the ZVM has, there are a few shortcomings.  For example, I wish the ZVM was thinner for the amount of hard drive space it has.  I purchased the 30GB simply because it was thinner than the 60GB, although I'd prefer 60GBs.    When the thin 60GB comes out, I'll be buying that and ebaying my 30GB.  I've found that the thickness of the 30GB is the max thickness I would want to have in one of these media players.  However, with the 30GB ZVM, I don't mind the extra thickness over the Ipod - probably because I don't notice the difference.  Maybe it's because the difference is marginal or that the 30GB Ipod and 30GB ZVM weigh the same.  If I could choose one word for the ZVM, it would be - versatile.  I'm not a Creative fanboy or anything. I just like the features the ZVM has.  If in the future, the Ipod has all the above features and remains thin with 60+ or more GB, I'd would be buying the Ipod.  For now however, I'm more than satisfied with the ZVM.  It's a great all-around media player.

<Title>It works
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well this thing works okay for me, I have issues with it but then there were issues with my boyfriend's IPOD when he had his, so I'm sure all brands of these things have their quirks. It works well enough for me not to be pissed off that I bought it but here are my complaints:  1. The touch pad is a lot more sensitive than I was expecting. I was hoping for something less sensitive than the ipod's touch pad but this one is more so. I constantly select the wrong thing by accident which aggravates me.  2. Songs on my playlist cut off early. The songs when I select them from their location under artist or album will play fine but when I compile a mixed playlist often songs will cut off just before the end (as opposed to after it's finished). A minor but significant inconvenience.  3. Yes it is a bit fatter than an IPOD of similar capacity. And I couldn't figure out how to operate the belt clip I ordered from them.  4. The software is pretty user friendly but it's difficult to edit mistakes of data entry once you've ripped the music.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Creative Zen Vision: M about two weeks ago. I fell in love with the monitor and how it displays beautiful colors. At first, I was a little agitated about the touch pad but once I started using it more I got used to it.   I was brave enough to try to convert some DVD's so that I could put them on my Zen on yesterday. It took awhile but I finally was able to convert to DVD's and upload them to my Zen. They play just like they are on TV and the sound is awesome.  I also like the fact that I'm able to use many types of file types on this particular MP3 player. I almost purchased an IPOD but I'm glad I brought this because it seems to be much better according to some of the reviews.  I would recommend this product if you are interested in quality video, sound, and a cool looking MP3 player. Yes, it's a little heavier but it's worth the extra weight. It's still small enough to fit in your purse.  I also recommend purchasing the skin versus the action jacket. I ended up purchasing the action jacket because I will use it to work out with but the skin allows you to use the touch pad more easily. I also found out that I could use one of my old cell phone adapters to charge the Creative Zen when I don't want to charge it using the computer. So, before you buy an adapter for this try one of your cell phone adapters. I had a few extra ones so I was lucky to find one that actually fitted.  Have fun with the Creative Zen!

<Title>The good and bad of zen vision
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the zen in white about a year and a half ago and I have had only a few problems with it.  The first issue I had was at the very begining the buttons would almost push themselves. It would turn off after a few minutes or skip a track.  Eventually though this did stop but it can be frustrating at first. So just give it some time.  The second issue is that after about 6 months it froze on me.  I was on a long flight to LA and not even an hour into the flight it froze.  There is absolutely nothing you can do if it freezes except wait for the battery to die.  This has happened to me 3 times and is equally frustrating each time.  The point where it generally freezes is when you use the button to scroll through a movie or to get to a certain point on a song.  The other issue is that the screen scratches extremely easily.  My screen has tiny scratches on it from touching the screen and from the screen protecter that i had purchased.  This mp3 player is very fragille!  So you have to be extremely careful with it. I would highly recommend a screen protecter. The screen protecters that you stick on work best as the hard ones tend to scratch it if you are not careful.  Also if you cary the mp3 player with no screen protecter make sure there is nothing else around. A pen, keys or any small object WILL scratch it.   All in all though it is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great valued mp3 player.  It is cheaper than the ipod and the sound and video quality are much better. While the ipod may offer more accessories than the zen you can easily find accessories online such as cases or adapters. I have had a hard time finding zen accessories in stores. The screen displays beautifully and I sometimes would rather watch video on this than on a tv.   The great thing about this mp3 is how easy it is to use!  It is so easy to sync files.  The software that comes with it is user friendly and makes it extremely easy to orgainze your files.  Even though i have had some issues with this mp3 I would buy it again in a heartbeat!  All you really need to do is be careful with it.  The video, sound, display, and user friendlyness make it worth $300 if not more.  I absolutely love the zen and get commented on it alot.  If you are thinking about the ipod go with this one!  It has lasted me a long time and is just as vibrant and as exciting as when I first recieved it.

The program is not as easy and as simple as they play it out to be and it was way too bulky, i called it the primitive of mp3 players. Alas, I purchased the creative zen, I have yet to find a con for it, all it is seems like a pro for me! but find out for yourself give it a try and you'll see its truly a great purchase that you wont regret! :)

<Title>Was perfect at first but after a few months....
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was so happy about buying this item from creative because I thought it was so much better than an ipod video 30 gb despite its lower price and bulkier look/feel, I even recommended it to a lot of my friends and most of them were actually impressed by it. The good things about it were the very very vibrant and colorful screen, the radio,voice/radio recorder,  the various file formats, the good sounding audio, the many personalization  choices, the ability to turn some of your storage into a flash drive, and some more things. It was perfect for me for about 4 months or so, but and then one time I tried syncing the device and my computer wouldn't detect the device, I thought it was my computer at first but then I moved the plug and it would work one second and then as soon as I let it go it wouldn't work anymore, so for 2 or 3 times I had to actually fix something against it so it would stay which was pretty frustrating, but I thought it was still worth it and coped with that problem...Until about 2 weeks later (I never once dropped it onto a hard surface or into water) I opened it and there was a HUGE expanded strike on the screen that wouldn't even let me see what the screen said. This was seriously very disappointing and annoying because I researched so much before buying it and thought I was getting the best device there was to buy and I felt totally ripped off. So it may seem like a good device at first, but don't expect it to last long guys if you buy it. or at least purchase a 2-3 year good warantee. As for me Tomorrow I'm going to try contacting creative to see if I can at least send them the device so they can fix it or give me a new one (which I doubt they will but I'll have to try anyways because if I don't it would be like losing a fight with garbage can for 200 dollars) And if they don't I guess I'll just have to save up or beg my parents for a few more months to buy me a new mp3 player. I'll be less naive this time and try an Ipod video.

<Content>Got the player about a month ago, my second creative MP3 player.  Have a MIcro Zen, for two years, and eventually after so much use the headphone plug on top of the player weakened, and I could not fix it.  Side note on the micro though is that I am sending it back to Creative and they will replace the headphone jack, of course for a fee. On the Vision M, I love it, very solid piece, feels heavy and It feels like it will last as my prme player for a time to come.  Audio is solid, video looks great, I have tried to download DVD's but keep running into conversion problems, but I am sure eventually I will figure it out.   The manual that came with the player leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to help in transferring music files and how to add video files.  It took me for ever to figure out how to download my music files from the micro to the "M". The instructions are not out there, on how to do it right the first time, takes a lot of trial and error, you are on your own!  But, overall get this player, it is  a great piece of equipment.

<Title>Good, but needs to be better

<Content>video freezes up not infrequently, forcing you to completely restart the device (which takes about 5 minutes).  The navigation is unintuitive and awkward.  Very good equalizer options though and good sound.

<Title>Creative Zen 30GB 
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After spending long hours comparing the differences between the 30GB Apple iPod and the 30GB Creative Zen, I ultimately chose the Zen. I had originally owned the iPod Mini and was wary of changing companies, as I had found no faults in my iPod Mini, except for the lack of battery life and small storage space. After researching, I came to the conclusion that both the 30GB iPod and the 30GB Zen were similar. The prices were within $20 of each other, each had the qualities I was looking for (the Zen being a little bigger in size), and each would hold all my music. But the Zen had the added benefits of a microphone, radio, and personalized background options that iPod didn't offer. And for $20 cheaper. I ended up buying the Zen and at first was regretting that decision. The iPod seemed easier to navigate and had an easier computer program. But as I've gotten used to it, the Zen has proven to be extremely easy to function, although I have yet to master the program on the computer. The radio is an added bonus, the organization of the Zen is excellent, I can now fit all 3000 of my songs, plus music videos, TV shows, and movies, and the battery life has lasted up to 14 hours, as the advertisement promised. My only complaint about the item would be it's spontaneity in deciding to freeze. In it's first 2 weeks, my Zen froze 3 times without warning or reason. Although it is easy to reset (simply use a paperclip or safety pin to press the reset button on the bottom of the player), I was surprised about the consistency of it.  Overall, I was very satisfied with the Creative Zen Vison:M 30GB and would recommend it over the Apple iPod.

<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Now that I have had this product for several months, I feel more comfortable writing a review. When I first got the player, I was very impressed. You can use several different programs to rip and install your music, you can listen to the radio, you can watch movies, you can look at pictures and plan out your week on the organizer. The provided Zen program is extremely easy to use. The player has many menus and options, so sit down when you first get it and play around. The screen is very clear and I haven't had a problem with smudges or scratches. I have used and abused this player and I have yet to experience any problems. I strongly suggest to anyone looking to buy this to have a look at the accessories. Unlike the ipod, Zen has very few accessories to choose from. It's the one area that it is lacking in. However, it has not kept me from enjoying the product. I do recommend that you update the firmware immediately after buying it. The Zen suffers from a few bugs straight out of the box and the updates will remedy that. Great player for the buck. Highly recommended.

<Title>So far, so good!
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own the Zen M (for 1 month) and Zen V (4 months). My Zen V froze on me 3 times so far, and I was able to restart/reset without trouble. The Zen M has not done that yet- so far so good! I play both every day, and I love them both! I use the Zen V for walking/exercising, the M for everything else. (The Zen M weighs about 8 oz, the V maybe one or 2).  There is just one problem I have with the Zen M, and that is the navigation button. It is way way too "touchy", and I have adjusted it to the "least sensitive" setting. Also, it doesn't always seem to be able to differentiate  the "scrolling" from the "confirm" mode. Sometimes I have to go over this several times, which is very frustrating. I wish the Zen M would come with the little joystick the Zen V has, that would be perfection!  Somebody mentioned the user manual is fairly useless-or skimpy, and I concur. However, if you go to the Creative website you can find extensive help screens, and I think there's also a manual on the installation disc. I've not had any trouble transfering songs from my computer into the Zen, and I haven't even read the instructions.

<Title>Buyer Be Ware!!
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have owned since 10/2006.  This was happening from the get-to.  When screen not frozen, this player is superb, however, when frozen, frustrating as there was no rhyme or reason or pattern.  When sent back to Creative, they claim the LCD is cracked and therefore will NOT honor warranty, extended or otherwise, due to so-called physical damage.  Told me they hoped I purchased shipping insurance and I might try filing a claim to recoup loss knowing full well shipper will not reimburse loss without proof of shipper damage and, Creative admits, the shipping was intact and had no damage.  They have no explanation to a cracked screen which left here with no known LCD problems.  I have since found massive complaints of spontaneous LCD problems that Creative apparently will not cover.  Very expensive lesson.  I will keep to disposable $30 models from now on - they last much longer!  Link to numerous complaints and possible class action suit. [...]

<Title>Disappointing Quality
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second Zen Vision:M 30GB player.  I had to return the first one only a few days after I purchased it.  My current Zen is less than 6 months old, and the battery is no longer holding a charge.  And trust me, I don't use it often enough to justify a dead battery within 6 months.  I submitted a warranty request to Creative, and they are charging me $25 just to look at it!  Even though it's under warranty!  Plus I have to ship it at my own expense.  While the features on the unit are appealing, and there is much more flexibility than with an Ipod, in terms of file formats, etc., I doubt that I will ever purchase another product from Creative.  There is just too much uncertainty in their quality control, and they don't seem to stand behind their products.  Otherwise, they would have covered this 100%.  If you absolutely hate Apple and feel compelled to purchase this item, I would suggest you purchase one of those in-store warranties from Best Buy so that they can just swap it out when yours stops working too.

<Title>Zen Vision:M.: A great media player!
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The unit i am rating is my third. I bought the first one for me and my sister wanted the ipod video. after playing a bit with it she said she couldnt "gop back" to the ipod. Going back quite describe moving from the zen vision M to the ipod video. It is my opinion that both units cant even be compared.  The screen of the Zen vision M looks like a high definition one. It is simply amazing. The sound it's better, although that might be only because the creative earbuds are much better than apple's. I dont hear any difference when playing through the audio outs in an an amplifier, but out of the headphone out i think the Zen beats the ipod.   When it comes to features the zen it's the way to go too. FM tuner and recorder. The reception is very good and the recordings quality are amazing. The voice recorder is also great. The unit works like a standard USB drive, you dont need ANY software to move files back and forth from the unit. The video out is quite good, but i understand it could be better.   Something that i particulary missed about the video playback capabilities is the divx ultra, or the ability to display softcoded subtitles (one or several subtitles that can be turned on/off in one divx clip). You need to embed (hardcode, without the posibility to turn it off...like the VHS)the subtitles to the divx clips in order to be able to have them displayed in the zen.    As a weakness, the apple lovers say the zen vision m lacks the lossless/gapless formats. Unless you dont have an orpheus(the greatest headphones ever built, most say) or some really expensive audio equipment you wont notice any difference in audio quality with 256kbps mp3s and lossless. You can also find freeware programs with ability to play lossless (flac, etc) in the zen vision M. After all the advantages i dont think the 1 sec. gap between songs can make anyne buy the ipod over the zen.    The apple is also a bit thinner, and weighs a bit less.  That is about the only real advantage of the ipod over the zen, and when u reconsider and think about all the features that you get with the zen and the ipod lacks (fm tuner/recorder, voice recorder, stunning screen quality), there is simply no conparisson between both. Check the ratings for each player here on amazon and get the right one. So many users cant be wrong. I am in love with the zen!  PS: accessories are widely available for the apple ipod obviously. But you can find most accessories for the zen too. Cambridge soundworks has a docking similar to the bose one that suposedly delivers great sound. I havent heard it so i dont know.

<Title>I will never buy anything from Creative again
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I truly regret ever buying this. It was a waste of money, I should have spent a little extra money and got an ipod. It freezes all the time, especially when viewing large pictures or setting a wallpaper. Also, I began getting pissed at it dying on me after only a short period of time, listening to music for 3 hours, on a half full battery, so today I fully charged it and then let it run until it dies. It says it should last 16 hours on audio, it only lasted 7 and a half. Another thing, it is only compatible with Windows XP, you cannot run the software on an older Windows OS or in fact any other OS. I'm saving up for a Mac Book Pro, so when I learned this, this angered me. I wasted over $200 on this piece of junk.

<Title>Mostly great with some caveats
<Date>Sat Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Zen Vision M for about 4 months now. On the positive side the music is very clear, it has absolutely great sound reproduction capabilities, The other major positive is that for $15 per month, you can sign up with Yahoo's Rhapsody music service and in one months time, you can download thousands of songs to the Vision M and all you have paid is $15. That is simply amazing. I have downloaded about 4500 songs and am never at a loss for good listening. Another really great feature is the FM radio. Sometimes you just want to take a walk and listen to your favorite rock, jazz station or NPR and this radio works really well.   There are a couple of things that bother me. It took a lot of getting used to the slide feature for clicking on artists/songs, etc. but I mostly have. I overshoot a lot and the thing is too sensitive, it can accidentally, with your slightest touch, put on a song or go to the wrong spot. Another thing is it has frozen on me about 4 times right in the middle of a song and I had to wait until I was at the end of my walk and at home to reset.  Overall, I find it is better than the ipod I had which totally stopped working after about a year and a half and I would highly recommend it.

<Title>Good product, bad service
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player as a replacement for my wife's Rio Karma, which she really loved until the hard drive went out.  The screen is awesome, but the interfaces (both the machine itself and the Windows-hosted software) is pretty clunky compared to Rio's.  If that were the end of the story, we might have rated the purchase as a three or maybe even a four.  But it wasn't.  After about ten month's of trouble-free use, the machine froze up while playing.  When we reset it, it froze up again.  After we reformatted the drive, we started getting error messages when trying to copy music back onto the machine.  Creative's support site didn't offer any alternatives to what we had tried, so we contacted them about getting it fixed under the warranty.  To our surprise, "warrantied" repairs after three months require a $25 fee.  Not my idea of a warranty.  After paying the $25 and shipping it off, we were informed that it was fixed and was on the way back.  When we got it back, it apparently hadn't even been touched.  It still had our old music on it and exhibited the same problem.  No phone number was provided for pursuing problems, be we used their sales line to contact support.  We got a run around (the person we talked even suggested that they just happened to test the machine with the music we already had on it!), but eventually they agreed to replace the machine.  We weren't out of the woods yet, though.  The promised mailing label never arrived, so we had to contact them again and wait a few more days.  Then it took quite a while to get the new machine after we mailed the defective machine back.  I wouldn't suggest buying an MP3 player from Creative.  The service is really poor and the interfaces are not very good (definitely not as good as Rio's).

Zen Vision M has FM Radio, Voice Recorder, and a better screen the iPod?!?!! WHAT?! It's 35 bucks less than iPod?! Duh! I'ma get ZEN!  Product came in two days. YAY! Loaded 2500+ songs from Windows Media Player 11 and URGE onto the Zen. Sweet! 3 hours of song syncing and I'm set! Amazing sound quality with Bass Booster on and V-MODA Bass Freq headphones. Way better than my friend's iPod (black 30gb)  Battery Life is fine. Seriously, when do you need 15 hours of playback without charging? With some DVD ripping software, I've gotten DVD's onto this guy. Honestly, the screen size is fine for movies. The screen is way better than the iPod; I compared Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest with my Zen and my friend's iPod. Pretty awesome difference in favor of the ZEN VISION M! The FM Radio is great, and voice recording is a great for "Note To Self"'s. I'm just so totally bummed I didn't get the 60GB ZEN VISION M; I've loaded up these 30 gigs already! Oh well, still an AMAZING value, I highly recommend for any WINDOWS over iPod. ZEN DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC! Just a note =]  ***UPDATE***  Yo, buy a case.

<Content>This product works fine with Gnomad2 and even with Amorak though to a lesser extent, which may be because of my own inexperience with Amorak.  Gnomad2 seems to copy files and music over without any trouble.  I wasn't sure if the Zen would be a good purchase because I don't use windows machines in my house but it's been great.  The battery life exceeds what the specs show, I've watched 3-4 movies at a time on the zen with 100% screen brightness.  It was a toss-up between this, the Zune and the iPod. I went with Creative because I have never had a problem with their other products and I try to not support Microsoft where possible so no Zune.  Apple's iPod is ok but the screen on the Zen is much better and this was $199 at Walmart on sale.

<Title>Ipod & Zune are good, but the Vision Zen M's the best!
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used all three brands, and put movies and music on them. Hands down, and by far the Vision Zen M's my favorite.  Like all of the players, if you take the time to learn how to add movies & music, the Vision Zen M can't be beat for picture quality, sound, and especially battery strength.    There's only 1 glitch that I've experienced; don't fiddle with the controls to fast forward, stop, then fast forward again (past commercials for example)take an extra moment to pause and let the unit process - otherwise the whole thing will freeze, and you'll have to reset the unit.    I wish the Vision Zen M came with a wall charger, but I'm very pleased with the wall and car charger sold by PCMICROSTORE on Amazon for an awesome price (well worth the $6.25 + shipping).  Well worth the $$ ;)

<Title>Kicks the iPod's butt!
<Date>Sun Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a 30GB ZEN Vision:M back in December of 2006 after looking very closely at my options, the ZEN Vision:M, the Zune and the iPod. I needed a player with a radio which left the iPod out(I still can't figure out why Apple doesn't include one) and that left me with the ZVM and the Zune. The Zune looks nice but I think this might be it's only strong point since it's wi-fi is practically useless and the screen, while being 1/2 inch wider than the ZVM's is still stuck at 65,000 colors like the iPod's.     The ZVM however has a screen that displays over 262,000 colors and the difference is obvious! Movies and TV shows come to life on the ZEN Vision:M, not to mention photos. Before purchasing this player I had heard about the bad viewing angle but honestly I can't see what those people were talking about. You can easily share videos or photos with people around you. One huge difference between an iPod and the ZVM are it's video playback capabilities. Just drag and drop DivX videos and the ZVM will play them. It will also play nearly all .AVI's without conversion.    Of course one of the main features of the ZVM is it's ability to play music and it does it very, very well. Combined with a decent pair of ear buds(I use JVC Marshmallows) and a few custom EQ adjustments the sound quality is probably the best I have heard in terms of clarity. The ZVM can pump out the bass but finding the right EQ setting is the key. The radio has pretty good reception although it will vary depending on the type of headphones you use( the headphones are the antenna). Voice recording works very well and the microphone is very sensitive and works great for lectures, etc.    My only complaint about the ZVM is the actual player itself. It looks great(at least to me!) with its shiny face and white magnesium back. However, be warned about the front and this shiny surface! Thankfully I knew this ahead of time and ordered a Best Skins Ever(BSE) for my ZVM. Without some form of protection, whether it be a case/skin or something like the BSE which when applied you can hardly notice is on, the front face of the ZVM will scratch very easily.    My experience so far the Creative ZEN Vision:M has been great and I actually look forward to listening to music or watching a show on it. Sometimes when you dare to try something different it pays off. A good example is this player. Creative tried to match the iPod and make the best player they could. The funny thing is, they not only matched it they succeeded in making the ZVM the best in its category and I couldn't be happier to own one.

<Content>My preferred use for this player is to use the "Random Play All" feature - that way I can have fun listening to a surprising music list of the 14,128 songs I have loaded. Unfortunately, when it is in the 'Random Play All' mode - there is no FastForward button if by chance a song plays that I don't want to listen to at that time.  Rather - hitting the upper left button simply re-loads all the tracks and re-starts the Random Play All. I wish it just had FastForward like my 60GB Creative ZenXtra has.

You can even use windows explorer to edit the player's content. Great purchase; hours of entertainment; incredible battery life and there is even a digital recorder and built in microphone.

Suddenly last week I started to get a message on my computer when I plugged the unit into the USB port that said that it couldn't recognize the player.  I went on Creative's website and followed the support suggestions to remedy the problem.  Needless to say the problem remained.  After getting on the customer discussion board, I found that this is a very common bug that isn't at all easy to fix.  Many people spend countless hours trying to fix it. While some get lucky, many don't.  After 4 days of researching, reinstalling software, messing with USB and device settings, it still doesn't work.  This effectively renders the Zen useless since you can't upload anything to it anymore.  After 2 days, I still haven't heard back from Creative's help line and naturally, I'm passed the time period for free phone tech support.  Basically, I've wasted lots of money and time on this product. And I don't appear to be the only customer who's had this experience.   Creative's perspective appears to be that this is a Windows issue, however the product worked for 3 months but now can't be recognized on 3 different computers (2 of which it had never been previously connected to).  Before buying this product go to Creative's web site and look at their customer message board.  There is a whole section on the Zen and known problems. Don't be a victim of this purchase!  I'll never buy another Creative product again.

<Title>Great Looking MP3 that Locked up after only 2 mths of use!
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not typically the type that likes to write a review of a product. However, if you've spent as much time as I have trying to find that "perfect" MP3, then you may want to read this.   I purchsed the Creative Vision M - 30G in April 2007.  After reading many positive reviews and comparing it to an IPOD or ZUNE, I felt I made the best choice for me.  I was confident my money was well spent.  However, to be safe, I also purchased an additional 2 year replacement warranty. I do a lot of running as well as using my MP3 in the car or docked while we are camping.  I'm glad I did! The first month of use was terrific.  It's a head turner! Many people carry IPODS and they were way impressed with what my MP3 had to offer.  I purchased many expensive accessories to go with my Vision M, including a protective case, docking station, chargers for in the car or on the wall, and numerous other gadgets.  However, by June 2007, my Vision M completely locked up on me.  The battery runs itself down, I recharge, reset...nothing.  It's dead.  After doing a few more searches online, I've discovered that several other people have also had the same problem. I am lucky, I have a replacement plan.  And due to my many accessories, I guess I have no choice but to get another VISION M.  But I also can't recover any of my 500 saved songs or pics so that's many more hours of my time spent in front of the computer. Great.   Do yourself a favor.  If your reading this post because you really want to take the time to make an informed decision about which MP3 to purchase, you probably need to keep shopping.  I love mine, yea, it's cool looking, great options...but not a lot of good when it doesn't turn on.  I look forward to getting a replacement and trying again.  But if I had another option, I wouldn't buy this one.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have personally never used the similar IPod, so this is not a comparison. The Zen works very well and the battery life is actually about 4 hours for video - I recently tested it on a trip and it actually may have lasted longer but I recharged before it was completely depleted. Video quality is excellent. As for anyone complaining about bass - have you manipulated the settings? You can get quite a bit of bass if you change the settings to fit your preferences. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially now that the price has gone down. I'm having a hard time trying to use up all 30 gigs!

<Title>Freedom!!!!
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Freedom from iTunes and the Nazi-like Apple rules. The software that the Zen comes with is amazing and simple. Songs, videos, and pics are an easy click & drag loading.     You can also move the Zen from computer to computer. Meaning, unlike the iPod, the Zen is a 2-way street. Pack up 7000 songs from your computer and copy every single song to any other computer, even without the software. Just the same way an external hard drive works.    Speaking of external hard drive, you can partition up to 16 gigs of the 30 gig hard drive to act as a storage drive for any fyle type, to move files from computer to computer easily.    Choose from 6 different menu themes, and even use your own pics as your background.     Album art is easy click and drag style, and you can browse through the Zen by album cover, as if you were thumbing through real cd cases rather than just text.    I used to own a video iPod and comparred to the Zen, it's like comparing a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a fully loaded banana split sundae.

<Title>Disapointed
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I should have learned the first time. So my Girlfriend ordered this product about 6 months ago and right out of the box it was defective, so we exchanged it for another one.  (same model) well that one also came defective but she called and trouble shooted with Creative zens tech support and got it working. And I have to admit it has been working well. So I figured I'd give them a try myself and guess what. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX IT IS DOA. (dead on arrival) So I think I'll be buying the IPOD for the extra $40

<Title>Warning: Be patient when you first get it.
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok first off if you've just gotten the UPS package and opening this baby up, you gotta be patient.  When I first got this and plugged it into the USB, I thought like most other devices it should be able to power on immediately while it's charging.  However it wouldn't turn on, and I thought to myself "What the F?" However, the power light was blinking, so I just left it alone for a few hours. Once it finished charging, I was able to turn it on just fine.  The major reason I bought this is the Comprehensive Video support         Not all supported extensions will work though, depending on the codec the video was encoded in. However Creative provided a video converter to go around this.         In any case, this is much better than Ipod (.MOV only) or Zune (.WMV only).

<Title>very good, but not great
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After considerable research, I purchased the M 30 GB. I was swayed by the rave reviews on this site. But after using the M for a week, I am surprised by what was left out of the reviews: Did you know that to use the fm radio you must use the earbuds supplied by Creative or (I was informed by Creative's customer support line) ""Sony works, too."" Unfortunately, I have excellent Sennheisers, hence no FM radio; The Creative charger, purchased at additonal cost, works extremely well, which is good news, because after three hours of play, the battery is half-empty; I have normal hearing, but like to play my music loud. Not loud enough to burst an eardrum, but loud. To do that, I have to set the volume to 24 or 25, which is maximum; This last complaint is, I admit,a quibble, but as a first-time user of the product, I turned it on and was unable to find the main menu to get to the music library. The supplied guide was no help at all. Support finally explained I had to keep clicking on a specific button to get there, and, if I needed additional help with the M, to go to the manual that I had downloaded on the initial install. Which would have been nice to know since Creative's enclosed guide never tells you there is a manual on the internet. OK, enough grousing. The good news is the M is a delight to use (and look at, the black with the blue background is really cool) and the sound quality is excellent. I can live without the radio, and I don't mind charging the thing up a lot. Still, it is not the perfect piece of equiptment some fans have gushed about.

<Title>finally upgraded from my Zen micro,..
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>after 3 great years of daily use of my Zen micro, I just wanted something new. As King Lear would say "oh, question not the need.." I didn't need a new player,..I wanted it.    just like my previous Zen,..the thought that goes into this product is amazing. I've had a PSP for over a year and never figured out how to easily convert TV shows and watch them,..with the Vision I had several TV shows (dragged from Windows Media 2005)and a couple DVD's loaded on the first day. Wow, I appreciate that kind of user-friendly programming. Plus,..I am "reading" a 1.2 gig audio book (Truman, over 1000 pages) and the bookmark feature works great,..not to mention that the Vision goes right to your last page when you restart it. Love that. There's nothing better than drag and drop,..and the Vision software is on the money. If you're already used to the Zen micro program, this is even better. Also, the battery life is excellent,..even better than the Zen micro.   Now for the gripes:     1. what's with the non user-replaceable battery? that's bad. that's apple, and I hate lowering the bar like that.      2. I hate everything about earbuds,..and this comes with them. They sound great, but I hate earbuds.      3. My Vision has a bug. About every 15 chapters of audio books, it starts buzzing loudly. I have to restart the chapter to stop the noise. This is not a huge problem,..but it might be a harbinger of some coming doom. Or, it could be the Truman book I downloaded that has the bugs,..    Conclusion: the Vision might be a couple bucks more than the 30gig Apple,..but is richer in features,..and I think the controls and software are better. Also,..the Vision is so drag and drop, so you'll save a lot of money in the long run by not giving all your dough to Itunes.

<Title>Great sound if you can find your music
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, and I got it solely to store and carry around music.  I shopped extensively and picked the one I thought would be the best.  And, the sound quality is amazing.  (Do upgrade the headphones.)  I thrashed around a bit learning the controls and how not to run the battery down too quickly.  Customer service was very helpful with both of these issues.  It's great to have so much music and the complete collection of someone's music.    However, I am an old-time music buff.  I listen to albums, not single cuts of this and that.  Finding my music and playing it as I expect to hear it is close to impossible.  First, there's the issue that it files under "the" if that's the first word in an album title or group's name.  Second, I don't know the name of many albums, I know the artists.  But I can't find them easily because it adds pretty much everyone on the album to the list.  For example, Walter Trout and Friends: all the friends are listed.  It's overwhelming.  I want to flip quickly through my extensive blues section, but that's really not possible because I own so many blues compilation CDs such as all of the Blues Masters albums.  On Media Player, when I select a genre (and I carefully filed every album I ripped up to the computer under my system), it then shows the list of albums.  On the Zen, the list is artists -- including all those ones I don't care about.    But a much bigger problem is missing cuts and disarranging cuts.  If I go to listen to N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda by looking up Dr. John, six of the cuts don't play.  If you go in by the album title, everything is there.  Some artists, where I have two or three albums, only one or two cuts are listed under the artist's name.  On some albums, the music is all there but it plays in a different order than recorded and ripped.  It's like reading chapter 9 before chapter 3. No, I'm not into "random" play.  Creative can't solve this problem and I don't have the time and energy to keep trying new ways of filing and ripping that work.  I've looked at programs you can buy but they are intended to organize single cuts.  Don't care.  Some even want to remove the duplicates in your library.  Whoa:  I can keep the Dylan original of "Man Gave Names to All the Animals" but it's going to delete the wonderful Tim O'Brien cover?  No way!    Finally, I tried to put together a playlist so I could just push a button and listen all day.  It worked great, until I tried to change it.  It didn't sync up the way I wanted it to.  It added the stuff I wanted up further in the list to the end of the list and didn't remove the albums I wanted to delete.    Is there a more organizable MP3 out there?  I don't know.  But I've talked to many people I work with and no one listens to music the way I do.  Albums are just passe.  So many have told me, I can get any album and find one good cut to save.  Well, that one good cut is a fluke, folks.  I don't care about it.  I want a solid album start to finish.  I might drop a cut here and there, but not often.   I'm keeping the Zen and gnashing my teeth, but if you're in the market for an album-playing MP3, I'd look further before settling for great sound that is totally disorganized and sometimes unfindable.

<Title>Great player for my son
<Date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Vision M player for my son about a year ago and the puppy is still going strong. All of the technical stuff can be found in the previous reviews so I won't do a rehash. The Ipod looks a little slicker and being very thin is great, but the reason why my son wanted the Vision M are these:  1) It is not an Apple Ipod. I guess he wanted something a little different. He had a tough time getting his purchased Itune songs converted to play on his cell phone. This may be a reason why he was anti Apple.  2) The battery life is better. He listens to a lot of music, but also watches a lot of the videos.   3) FM tuner. He likes to listen to the radio and record the songs  4) The screen seems a little sharper. I can't really tell a difference, but he swears that it is there.  Other than that, the Vision M has held up like a tank. Either the Ipod or Vision M would be a good buy and possibly that Zune thing from Microsoft!

<Title>Incredible!!
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Im 12 years old, and I got my Zen just last Christmas.  I absolutely LOVE it!  I use it just about every day.  With a 30GB hardrive, you NEVER run out of room to store stuff.  The screen looks like a Hi-Def TV, and the photo viewer is nice and user-friendly.  Plus it has tons of extras (fun to mess around with) like the voice recorder, FM radio, organizer, and tons more!!  Videos that you can purchase in the Amazon Video Unbox thing go very nicely with the player.  I have a lot of videos from there.  But there are a few small problems.  The screen is kinda scratch-prone so BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR!!  Or like a case that covers the screen.  Those work good too.  The battery dosent keep a charge very long, but if you put in the lock position when listening to music and turn the screen brightness to 50 or 60%, that helps with battery life a lot.  Touchpad can be too sensitive occasionally but with some use you can get used to it.  I highly reccomend this product.  ITS AWESOME!!

<Title>Great Product - While It Works.  Otherwise, Product Support is Awful
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for almost a year now, and the good news is that, while it's working, it's great.  During that time I downloaded about 2500 songs, and perhaps 500 videos on the Vision M.  While I was actually using it, there were not many complaints about quality of sound, video playback, or things of that nature.  Matter of fact, until last week or so, only complaint was that the Creative Media Organizer (the software program that lets the device interact with your computer) had a tendency to freeze every now, and a few times the Vision M itself froze while in operation, but sticking a pin in it to reset it solved the problem, so no big deal.  Then last week while I was tinkering with my playlists, the Creative Media Organizer froze, necessitating a rebooting of my computer.  When I did, I found to my horror that the vast majority of what had been stored in my Vision M had disappeared.  Instead of 2500+ songs and around 500 video clips, there were now 350 songs and no videos.  To make things worse, the Vision M stopped being recognized by the computer - whenever I tried to use any of the software that I'd been using for a year to interact with the Vision M, I kept getting variations of the request to "please connect the device to the computer."  Went to the customer support website - it's mostly self help.  Long and short of it was that after many fruitless hours, the only remaining solution was to reformat the drive.  Downside is that doing so erases the drive completely, which means you have to restock it from scratch.  Although I had all the media files stored in my computer, I still didn't want to go through that - they were arranged in a certain way in my device, and my playlists were arranged just so, etc.  So I email customer support to find if there's any way to retrieve the data short of reformatting the drive.  First customer support response is an automated email telling me to visit the customer support website and a few links in there, and if that didn't help to write back.  Well, that hadn't helped so I email back.  Takes three or so days for a "live" person to write me back - and he basically resends the same links from the automated email, that boil down to what I'd already figured - reformat the drive and thus lose all data stored in it - which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place.  In the department of unintended irony, he tells me to save the data on the Vision M to my computer before reformatting - which was kinda difficult since the problem is that the device won't connect to the computer any more.  Email ends with additional instructions in very poor English to the effect that if that didn't work to arrange to have the product shipped back for repair.  Well, by then I'd already given up on the customer support route and had gone ahead and reformatted the Vision M thus erasing all the data, and then had to restock it with the back-up data stored on my computer.  Now I'll have to try to rearrange it the way I had before, do my playlists again, etc.  Some of the things to bear in mind when deciding on whether or not to purchase the Vision M:    1.  Although the quality of performance isn't bad while the product is operating, there's a high possibility that at some point you'll have trouble getting the product to operate in the first place.  2.  If you do have trouble with the Vision M, Creative's customer support is very poor - assumes a higher computer tech savviness on the part of its customers than is realistic (e.g.; came across some self-help instructions that assumed the reader knew what a BIOS was, let alone how to tinker with it, or go into the product registry for various items), relies on automated responses, takes days before a "live" person emails you back, and chances are that person, whether tech savvy or not, simply doesn't have enough command of English to be able to effectively communicate helpful advice.  3.  The warranty is extremely short - 60 days.  4.  Outside the warranty, you need to shell $25 minimum just to have somebody take a look at the product - with the added caveat that you "might" get billed for more (i.e.; real world translation is that you *will* get billed for more once you ship the Vision M for RMA).  5.  At some point you likely will end up with some corruption in the drive  for which you'll need to reformat the Vision M and thus lose all data stored in it.  If you have it backed up, then you only have to deal with the (relatively) mild hassle of reorganizing it once you restore it to the Vision M.    6.  If you don't happen to have your data backed up, you're SOL. Of course, the need for backing up in the first place runs counter to the Vision M sell point that, in addition to entertainment, the device itself can be used for storage and data backup for things you don't want to clutter your computer with.  All in all, I don't think it's a horrible product, but I doubt I'll be getting a Creative MP3 player next time I upgrade.

<Content>I got this ZEN because i liked the design better than iPod's and at first view it does have more functionalities at a lower price. Yes, everytime I show it around people think my 'iPod' is bigger than normal because it's not as thin but aside from that looks better and works perfectly for me, havent had any trouble with it just yet, in fact I was just in a class where I used it to record my teacher's speech so I can review the whole thing later on again. I have also watched movies in it when I'm travelling and the quality of its screen its as good as my friends' iPods (if not better). It's really easy to put music in there too because of the friendly software and you can even use windows media player to do the same and sync it.

<Title>Excellent Player
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision M is, in my opinion, unsurpassed in sound quality. It was exactly what I was looking for in an Mp3 player at my time of purchase.  In my estimation sound and video playback exceed that of the 30GB Ipod. While its styling is somewhat more pedestrian, not nearly as sleek as an Ipod (about twice as thick) and its touch pad controls are a bit overly sensitive(sometimes to the point of being maddening,) its sound and video quality are unrivaled.  Its only major detraction is that it does not have a replaceable battery.  Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase.

<Title>Excellent player with some issues
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>By now you've probably heard how great this player is. Excellent video, intuitive controls, great sound. Therefore, I won't elaborate on these features.  However, there seems to be an issue with battery drain right out of the factory. I replaced my Vision:M twice before I realized what happened. The player stays in the factory so long that the battery completely drains. However, in order to charge it through usb, the player needs to power up. Because the player is not packaged with an AC adapter, this makes it impossible for you to turn it on or charge it right out of the box. Irritating right?   The only real solution to this problem is to buy an AC adapter with your player, or to find a compatible charger (PSP chargers work great). The next step is important. Remember to install the Creative software beforehand. While charging the player through AC, attach it to the computer through the USB adapter.  Immediately update the firmware. There's another issue with the old firmware that prevents some players from being charged through AC and USB (it'll turn on, but the battery won't charge. Instead, you'll see a power chord symbol). Once that's done, you should be all set.  I would say it's an issue that Creative should address on its official site. It's a fairly well known problem, so I don't know why it's still not acknowledged. If you get past this (really, it sounds harder than it actually is), the player itself is great. I use it daily and I wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player out right now.

<Title>Unintuitive and short battery life
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I borrowed my grandmother's old Zen Vision:M after my Zen Nano died. I uploaded my music collection, turned on the player... and couldn't figure out how to work it. I'm a very tech-savvy 14-year-old, so why couldn't I work it?  Selecting songs to make a playlist (which can't be done on the computer, only on the player) is extremely cumbersome, and then naming the playlist is even harder. And then you can't add songs to the playlist without recreating it.  In addition, it took me multiple attempts to try to understand the radio controls. The radio feature is excellent once you figure it out, however.  The battery life sucks. While I got 14-16 hours of playback on one AAA battery in my Creative Zen Nano, I got about 7 hours on a full charge on the Vision:M. I played only 40 minutes worth of video during that time, so what will happen if you try to watch Lord of the Rings on an overseas flight? I think part of the battery life issue is that the backlight doesn't fade to black during periods of inactivity, and you can't set it to do that. Sure, you can change the blacklight's general brightness to 20-30%, but that makes it that way ALL THE TIME!  The only other things I liked besides the radio were the shortcut key (which you can pick a function for, very handy) and the fact that you can change the background color, which you can't do on an iPod. But you're still much, much better off sticking with an iPod or, if you don't need much space, a Creative Zen Nano.

<Title>Buggy MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Simply put, the Zen Vision M just doesn't operate exactly as it was engineered to. Apparently Creative knows this as evidenced by numerous unhelpful firmware updates. Some of the issues I've encountered include: 1) Limited/No accessories in stores 2) "Random" play isn't very random at all 3) Occasionally a song will play with horrible distortion (approx. every 20th song) - skipping then returning to the song alleviates this problem 4) Player freezes forcing you to "restart" or "restore" the mp3 player.  Those 5,000-10,000 songs and 400 pictures you had loaded on your player? Forget about them. Theyre gone. You will have to reload your player.  Buy a really comfortable chair for your PC because you will be spending lots of time in front of your computer loading and re-loading content on your gremlin-loaded Creative Zen Vision M.  Buy a Zune.  Edited 30 December 2007: Its only fair to say that since installing updated to the Zen, its operated reasonably well (i.e. no distortion and no data-dumping freezes).  It is still limited on accesories, but in retrospect, it turns out that I've definately gotten my moneys worth out of the Zen Vision M.

<Title>Awesomeness
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Zen Vision:M exceeded my expectations. The 30GB drive is a lot of space to store a huge song collection and videos as well, both which are played flawlessly. The Zen is kinda bulky compared to the iPod, but thats not necesarily a bad thing. It feels great in your hands, and its back is not a finger print and scratches magnet at all, which is just perfect. The sound quality is superb, videos run amazingly well, and the extra features are just the icing like FM Radio, Microphone, Photo viewer and such. Setting custom wallpapers is also really nice to have. The touch pad gets a bit of time getting used to, but ull get the hang of it in a day or two. The face buttons are excellent and makes controlling the player way too easy.  I just love this thing and Ive been using it every single day since I got it.

<Title>No durability
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Initially I thought this was a great product.  However, I expected it to last more than 4 months.  If you buy this product, make sure you get an extended warranty because you will be returning it several times during the two years of the warranty, and the Creative warranty is only good for 90 days.  Also, the Creative company just ignores you if you complain.  Not a company that stands behind its products!!!

<Title>This is my second one...
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>and for the most part, it does it's job. Not quite as blue as it is in the picture, this little device fits 30 gigs of music which is nearly 15,000 songs IF they are at a measly 64 kbps and are a wmv file. It also enables you to put pictures onto it if you choose.  Besides the music though, my favorite feature is that it can also play videos (and at most places it's cheaper than the iPod Video which is good). The main reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that once in a while, my player doesn't want to connect to the computer, making it impossible to put anything on to it. It's happened maybe twice but it doesn't need to happen at all. I paid good money for this product.  It's quite extra to me and I don't really know how to use it yet but there is a FM radio and voice recorder included right in the player. I hear the iPod doesn't have that. But to be fair, I heard that the iPod let's you play games. Anyway, I WOULD have chosen an iPod but:  1. Most people have them 2. The Creative Zen Vision definitely looks better 3. That's about it :P  And unlike the Creative Zen Micro, you can actually rate songs on this player (I owned a Micro first, then a Vision, and now am on my second Vision). However, I noticed that the search engine for the Vision isn't as good as the Micro's was when using Mediasource, but I can live with that.  All in all, it's a good player. Pictures look nice, videos are pretty and work well - I think you'll get your money's worth.  Worth the time.   P.S. Not that you care, but I wrote this review on May 19th, not the 20th. Crazy amazon...

<Title>Brand new & wouldn't take a charge
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision:M on 5/09/07 and when it came a week later the box was in perfect condition, however, the unit would not take a charge. It did not display any charging icons or any life at all. I left it overnight on (2) different computers charging via the USB cable. I even went out and bought an A/C wall charger, all to no avail. I have requested that Amazon ship me a replacement unit. At this point, I don't fault anyone, I just want a unit that works. I will post an update once I get the new one.

<Title>good sound, impossible controls, poor service, inconvenient charging
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player in February. I listen to recorded books downloaded from my library and needed more than 1G storage.  The player downloads well and holds as many books as one could wish, but it is next to impossible to access them. The touch pad is either too sensitive or too insensitive so that while one can see many options, it is not possible to reliably choose any. I sent it for repair while under warranty and they sent it back the next day but the touchpad still doesn't work properly. Given that sending it for repair entails packaging, insuring and mailing costs and since I had sent it for the same problem previously, there seems to be no point in trying again. So I can now download books and keep going to "album of the day" and hope the book I want shows up there. Phone help, by the way, costs $ after the 90 days warranty has expired. Finally, it seems it will only charge on a PC USB slot, not on a Mac or the same shaped cell phone charger/adapter that plugs into regular electricity and charges my Samsung YP-T7J (a very easy to use and far superior device though less storage).  I also have an Ipod Nano but my library downloads will not play on Mac products.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned my Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB for 10 months.   I was disappointed with the stability of the product, support, and integration with software.   I have now decided to purchase an ipod and retire this unit.   I have experienced intermittent problems causing the unit to hang during the power up process.   I suspect it has to do with the hard drive.    I have been gentle with the unit so I am surprised the drive would fail.  Trying to diagnose the problem or get technical support was frustrating.   Creative provides no place to call for the support I needed and limited support on their website.  I felt unsupported.  I eventually had to resort to googling for help.   Finally, the software they provide is confusing and un-intuitive.  I used Microsoft Media Player to manage the Zen which was only average to this purpose.    On the positive side, I like the size, the battery life, and the quality of the screen.  The touch pad controls were too sensitive at times.

<Title>Prone to defects, poor support provided by Creative
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With all its bells and whistles, the Zen Vision M is an amazing alternative to an iPod--when it works.    While not every unit is plagued with problems, many of them are...  A month after buying it, the FM radio spontaneously stopped working.  Well within the warranty, I sent it back to Creative for repair and got a brand new model a few weeks later.  Shortly after the year mark had passed (and thus the warranty ending), the unit randomly started malfunctioning--freezing up, displaying only a black screen, resetting wouldn't work, even formatting the hard drive didn't do anything.  Outside the warranty, the cost to fix it?  The same price as a new model.  Creative does not support their defective units.  All one has to do is browse the Creative forums to see how many other people have experienced this same issue...  Avoid Creative--get an iPod.  They supposedly last.

<Title>It was great when it worked
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hi.  I went through two of these and I'm sad to say, I had problems with both of them.  I had the first one about a month and a half before it started acting up.  It froze during a song and it just went downhill from there.  I tried resetting it but to no avail.  I returned it to the store (not Amazon) and they were nice enough to exchange it for me.  Just my luck, the replacement froze up the next day.  I am now just going to return it for a refund and try something else.  When my units were working, I loved them.  They worked great.  I was just unlucky I guess that I had problems.  And no, I didn't drop them or bang on them or abuse them in any way.  Thanks.

It's way better, even if there's thousands of things out there that are compatible with ipods, nothing compares to the zen. I love that i can have the picture of my family or boyfriend as my background and it's not just plain white like ipod. It also stores a lot of music and battery lasts long. i love it. BUY IT!

<Title>Except for the interface, a great device
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>No matter what awards it has won, I loath the interface on this thing.  It is so darn hard to use the up/down touch sensitive thing it drives me crazy, and just try to give it to someone to use without any instructions.  No one knows what to do, and even if you tell them, just watch them for a minute - they'll always put it down in frustration.  I also have some gripes about the menu system and controls in general - you can spend 5 minutes building a playlist, but just be very careful as you go.  If you accidentally hit the play button instead of menu/scroll/add to selected, then BINGO, you've just wiped out the whole playlist, and it simply plays what you were trying to add to the list.    Another annoying example:  You can set bookmarks all you want, but it doesn't remember any of the things in your playlist at the time, so, for example, you build a temporary playlist with 20 songs, you get to #10 and say save as bookmark.  Next time you go to the bookmark, it will play song #10, and that's it.  You have no way of knowing what else was in that list.  The same goes for audiobooks, which is really annoying.  So now that I've complained, what's good about it?  Well, it does work, and has tons of features, including an FM radio and voice recorder.  Also, it works flawlessly with my Urge subscription music service, including showing all the album art, it shows beautiful video, and the sound quality is excellent with my Shure headphones.  Also, the battery life is excellent.  So overall, it's a great player marred by an absolutely terrible control system.  My  2 1/2 cents.

<Title>I love it and can't function without it
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm no MP3 player buff but I did a lot of research before I bought this and I can say that I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I cannot recommend this enough to people who aren't too fond of IPod's. I've always been a Creative Labs fan and really love their sound cards and the audio quality of this player is great. I put all of my CD's on this thing and have about 10 GB's left. The thing I don't like about IPod is that whole copyrighted/protected music thing.  Whenever I rip music to my hard drive I always want it to be MP3. Less snags y'know. I like things to be simple because when your ripping your entire CD collection to your hard drive it should be as painless as possible. Creative makes it easy enough to do that too. I don't use it hardly at all for videos. I have put movies on it before but the whole process takes too long. It has nothing to do with Creative though. I bet if you have a lot of YOUTUBE stuff it would work great. The screen on this little thing is awesome too. I wish there were more downloadable content for it though so that you could have more choices to customize it. but if you want you could put your own photos as the background. And the photos look terrific on this too by the way. I love how it will sycnhronize your music on your hard drive with the player itself too. There's just too many thing I like about this player to sit here and type it all.

<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would not recommend this product to anyone. It froze up two days after I got it and needed to be reset. I should have sent it back as soon as that happened. After that it continued to freeze on a regular basis. A few months later, out of the blue, it stopped connecting to my computer properly. To fix that problem I had to reformat it and lose all 3000 songs I had loaded. After the reformat it started to die a slow death.  The last straw for me was when I tried to turn it on and nothing would happen even when it was fully charged. I got fed up a put in the trash can. I will never buy another Creative product.

<Content>This is by far the best DAP I've ever had. You gotta love the screen. It's very bright and colors shine alive on it. Audio quality is top notch and you can adjust it with many tweaks (custom EQ, Bass Boost, volume normalizing), The UI is really responsive and easy to use, but it also offers some advanced features. It plays and record FM radio stations, record sound, and support MP3, WMA and WAV files.   One of its strong points is Video reproducing. You don't have to do any further recoding or converting to play your videos. You just drop them in there and this beauty will play them. I've only had a few issues with some movies with rare video and audio formats, but it will play most of your video collection.   Also, this thing is a beauty and an eye catcher. I keep getting compliments from everyone that sees it. My only gripe is with the glossy front finish, it's a scratch magnet. But I just put a "Best Skin Ever" (brand) invisible protector and this is almost scratch-proof and it's hardly noticeable. You don't have to worry about the back, as it is made of some aluminum alloy.  Get this baby with no doubt if you were even thinking about it. do it now!

I have had a few little problems mostly because I don't read the darn paperwork, but this baby is a lot more bang for your buck.  The video is very clear also.

<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wish I could tell you that I have been completely satisfied with my Zen Vision M. I bought mine in October 2006 and started having problems in January 2007. Apparently, I "dropped" it, damaging the hard drive. This completely ruined it? It would not start up and merely went to the opening screen. I had to pay an additional $100.00 to have it fixed and had to wait over 1 month to have receive it back. After being aggitated by that, around a month later, now, the same thing happens again, except I know for a FACT i did not drop it. All of the options in the Recovery Mode of the player do not work, for me at least. I am not looking forward to sending it back again, and I definetly wish now that I had gone with my first instinction and bought and IPOD. Maybe I will switch over to it now..  The player was great while it lasted, but it is not trustworthy enough if you are an avid listener.

<Title>Definite Improvement
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player was purchased for my daughter to replace an iPod which had pooped out on her while living in Japan. She swore she would never own another iPod because she went through 7 of them in the year and a half since she bought one. Not because of hard wear either. Since my son has also gone through multiple replacements, I sympathized and did substantial research to find a replacement that would be more reliable. The Creative Zen is it. My daughter loves the unit and sings its praises whenever asked. The only drawback is that the unit ships with extremely high control sensitivity. Once set on the lowest level, the unit performs magnificently. It plays everything, is easier than the iPod to put files into, and lets you manage your files with ease. My son's next player will also be a Creative Zen.

<Content>This mp3 player is AMAZING; it beats the similar iPOD, hands down. It has a built in microphone/recorder which I use everyday in my classes, it has a radio for when you get bored of your own music. The images are sharp and clear, sound is terrific (even better if you have their noise-canceling earphones!). It has NEVER frozen on me, NEVER done anything unexpected. Once, I accidentally deleted my own library, but it was entirely my fault (I pressed the delete button on my computer, foolish). The maximum capacity of 8Gigs for a removable disk is great for when I need to store files for school. It's perfect!

<Title>Awesome device
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The device is great as a music player, sound output can get real loud with the given ear phones. Screen is vivid, bright and video quality is good, however plastic tends to scratch easily. Player hangs if MP3 song is corrupt and only way to get around is to reset it let battery run down. Player starts automatically when connected to USB port, did not charge from my dell D610 Laptop though.Can use any DC convertor rated at 2Amps - 5 V and having the yellow ended connector (sony?!)with inside positive. Mic recording quality is great and can be used as a dictaphone. Connects to TV using Zen video cable or odinary audio video cable with jack modified as follows: Identify and mark the three wires near the jack end as WHITE,YELLOW and RED.Then cut the cable close to the Jack end. rejoin as follows (each wire has an uninsulated wire called ground and a thin insulated wire called Hot). Jack part------------------------------------RCA part RED Hot.................to....................ground of all 3 wire ground of all 3 wires..to....................YELLOW Hot WHITE Hot...............to....................WHITE Hot YELLOW Hot.............to....................YELLOW Hot  User interface is great, but takes a while to get used to. when Video cable is connected the Display blanks out and gets transfered to TV screen!!!. In short great player

<Title>This manufacturer has no concept of support and service.
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To be fair, before trashing this manufacturer completely, I purchased a 60 gig Creative Zen Vision M a few months ago and was/am very pleased. Easy to use, great picture quality, and have raved about it. So much so, that my wife wanted one in white. After not finding one and calling US sales and learning there were no plans to sell the 60 gig in the US in white(?), she opted for the 30 gig.  First it took a couple of weeks and an email complaint to have it shipped. Then the unit did not work - it would not power on, recognize a USB port or charge. We returned it to Amazon (great service by them) and had a second unit in a couple of days but it had the SAME PROBLEMS. By this point I felt that I should go through Creative for help - not Amazon's fault, why should they continue to pay for shipping etc.  Here is my warning - terrible customer/tech service. To start, their website, when it worked, was not user friendly or helpful. Secondly, you can't find a number to call when you click the 'contact us' button. Finally, even if you click the 'send an email' button, you get sent around in circles to 'list your problem' and never get to send an email for help. So, I opened the literature in the box, found a number, had to pay for the call and I ended up with a tech guy in Singapore. Though he was very nice - he did not solve or even seem to understand the problems. As my 60 works just fine through my computer, my USB ports are not an issue, yet he continued to tell to disconnect them and reconnect them. Then he told me to do the reset - great, but one itty bitty problem - to do the reset the battery has to be charged...it charges through the USB port...which it won't recognize and therefore won't charge. Hmmm.... Finally, he said I should update the firmware...once again that pesky little issue with NO USB CONNECTIVITY. So, they did not solve my issue. His suggestion, send it back. OK, do you want my address for the call tag? No, you (the customer) have to pay to ship it. WHAT? I requested that someone from customer service in the US call me. I got a call from Singapore by a friendly lady who informed to try all the same things I had already tried. The really frustating part was that she was even reading my case file from the previous call and KNEW that those things did not work. She then told me that they would be happy to take back the Zen and run a diagnostic on it and either replace it or fix it and ship it back, BUT I had to pay the freight both ways. I hit the roof - and have requested a manager to call me on Monday. I'll let you know if that even happens and what transpires if it does.  So, as my wife is really wanting her MP3 player, I did another return on Amazon tonight. Only to get an email that they will now NOT send me a third unit (can't blame them really) because there is possibly a widespread problem with these units. They are telling me to wait a couple of weeks and order again. Oh, how happy this makes my wife who was so excited about it FOUR WEEKS AGO when I ordered AND still doesn't have an MP3 player that works.  SO, suggestion - wait for a while or save yourself the potential frustration and buy something else. Maybe their help and customer concern will get the message. I want to return my 60 gig to Creative and have them buy all the accessories we purchased. I want to get all my money back and go iPod at this point. Which is sad because my not being a fan of the proprietary nature of iTunes etc. was the whole reason I chose the Zen in the first place. But at this point it seems the lesser of two evils because the help and customer service at Creative has me boiling. Good luck. UPDATE : MAY 1, 2007 : Creative did have a manager call. He was polite, but not helpful in resolving the problem. In fact, they deny that there is a widespread problem, it must be my bad luck to receive two units with 100% dead batteries. So, my wife gave up and purchased a 30 gig iPod today. She seems happy.

<Title>Read "almosthappy" review for workaround to DOA issue
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first Zen we bought would not turn on at all. We used the Amazon return process and quickly received a replacement.  In the meantime, I read the comment / review from "almosthappy" about how to charge the battery on a player that was Dead on Arrival. The second player was DOA as well. We followed his instructions and used a wall charger from an old CD player. Once the battery had enough charge we could boot up the player.  It would be nice if Creative provided a wall charger with the MP3 player.  (One can be purchased as part of a pkg with a silicone cover, and a travel and wall charger. I found them on Amazon for ~ $26.) We have three Zens in our family and so far they seem to work well. We will have to reserve judgment until more time has passed. I recommend buying a decent set of earbuds if you find the ones that came with the MP3 player to be uncomfortable.

<Title>Worked for 2 weeks 
<Date>Tue May 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Controls are difficult to master and the documentation is sketchy.   Real problem came after 2 weeks.  With about 150 CDs loaded the device is no longer recognized by the Creative Media Explorer software.  After a few hours of digging on their web site and discussions with tech support, the only solution they can offer is to reformat - deleting everything - with the hope that this will work and it will again be able to accept data.   So my choice is (1) to chance the reformat with the best case scenario of having to spend several hours reloading the disk - or (2) live with the music I have already loaded.  They say the problem is likely a "corrupt" track on one of my CDs.  All my CDs are legit original copies.  Not being able to deal with this is a serious design defect.

<Title>Less Than Dazzled
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have delayed my review of the Zen M 30 GB MP3 because I didn't want to slam the product in haste. From the previous reviewers you have already noticed two camps: those who are delighted and those who have gone through a bad time (or in some cases, a really, really bad time) simply to charge the Zen M for the first time. I count myself in the latter "bad-time" category.  I do not consider myself technologically challenged, but this product came close. First, let me say that the "documentation" that accompanies the product is laughably ambiguous and unhelpful in every way possible. A visit to the Creative web site and cruising their knowledge-base self-help do not illuminate. Whoever writes their procedures should be fired. Let's just say much detail has been left out.  It should not be this painful in a "plug-and-play" MP3 player to charge it and get it up and running. The battery was dead, dead, dead. Forty-eight straight hours of USB charging yielded nothing, nada, zip. So after two days of trying to charge it that way (oh yes, a USB port on the back of the computer, not the front!) with absolutely no results, I opted to order the charger, which apparently prior to July 2006 was part of the package and not an additional purchase. This is a crummy way to gouge more money out of the consumer. Whatever revenue gained from this tactic must surely be balanced by the loss of good will at such a transparent ploy.   After I received the "optional" charger, it took another two days to charge. Initially, the only thing the charger would do was allow me to play the music that was factory-installed. No charging, however. After much trial and error, I set the date, time, and owner name. And suddenly it started charging, flashing light, the whole deal. I have no idea what I did, or if I in fact did anything to bring about this miracle.  As to performance, that is subjective. Mine works fine, but the earphones come out too easily. Otherwise, I have no specific complaints. I did not have to go through the agony of updating the firmware as yet, but I'm sure that will be necessary somewhere down the road.   In summary, I wasted a lot of hours to make this little machine work. Customer support is nonexistent. Was the effort worth the result? Maybe. Should a charger be standard equipment? Absolutely!  Would I purchase this brand/model if I had it to do over again? Probably not. I could have been caught in the return quagmire, trading one lemon for another, so I guess I am one of the lucky ones. It seems to be fairly random as to whether you get a good Zen M or a bad one. To paraphrase the immortal words of Dirty Harry, "Ask yourself, `Do I feel lucky?'"

<Title>very sturdy
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>those who think the vision:m is bad are those few unlucky ones who received the rare DOA players. I've scraped it on the pavement, dropped it multiples times and had it bounce, and left it in my car in 103 degrees weather. I've even kicked it. It still works great. Albeit, with the occasional glitches in accessing the key pad. But with all I've put it through, it's a miracle the thing hasn't just exploded. Can those popular and flimsy players stand up to the abuse? And of course the screen is great, the sound is great, and the radio and recording features are great.

<Title>Software heck
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Cute!  Has FM radio, The 2nd player works fine. Cons:  Does not play nice with software.  I've been trying to avoid the ipod and had done OK with a Creative Nomad Jukebox + Notmad software until I found out there were no replacement batteries to be found.  So I splurged on this cute green vision m.  It crashed all music software, even Creative's own.   There was a bad block on the disk.  Creative quickly and courteously replaced the player (there is a 2 month warranty), and I was finally able to transfer my 15G+ of music to it using MediaMonkey, but I cannot use any software to view and edit more than about 20% of the music.  My PC is not brand spanking new so that may be a factor (I've tried Creative's own software, Realplayer, MediaMonkey, Windows Media Player won't even recognize the device, I upgraded the Notmad program, but that will also not read the device.)  Others have had better luck, so you may or may not find yourself spending more time on getting this player to work than you would like.

<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first bought the Creative Zen M I was initially very happy with it. But now, a few months later I'm regretting my decision. The player is large and bulky and very heavy and the screen is so baddly scrached I can barely see in it. The sound quality is good, and I like the option of being able to change the background, but those features really aren't worth buying the player.

<Title>Turned out to be the right purchase for me
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having spent a lot of my career in the technology field, I tend to adopt new electronic toys after other people have climbed the learning curve and discovered the ins and outs. So I came to the MP3 player game after the memory prices dropped and the small hard drives became commonplace, which meant that I didn't have to spend much money to get good technology.  My Zen purchase was to replace a flash memory based player that was stolen from me. I found that I really enjoyed being able to carry a large music library around, especially at work where I spend a lot of time doing solitary jobs. My flash player was great and probably would have kept me happy for a long time but I was hampered by the need to remove items to clear space for my changing music tastes and moods.  I did a fair amount of research when the time came to get a new player. Flash models were out, because I wanted maximum space and don't have a need for a unit that can handle heavy shocks. I learned a long time ago to buy at the top of the current technology curve, because no matter what is on the market today it is already outdated by what is coming tomorrow.  The Creative Zen 30GB fit the bill. With its massive storage capacity, a quite usable interface, and a reasonable price it looked like the player for me. I have been very happy with my purchase. I have filled it up only about halfway, even with all of my pictures loaded on it (which I don't really want, but since space isn't an issue it has been nice to be able to show pictures when the urge strikes me).   I don't use it for movies or TV. With the small screen I don't see that as being a lot of fun - I'm not much of a TV fan in any case. I could always connect it to a larger screen, but I already have playback devices of various sorts on all my video equipment.   The Zen has been trouble free and has performed as advertised. Thumbs up from me...

<Title>It's okay.
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think this player is okay. However, I find that maybe one in every ten songs that I play on it have a horrible static noise accompanying the song. This is fixed by restarting the song, but it still annoys the hell out of me.  I'm also rather upset with the video capabilities. I wasn't aware that if you rip a dvd into too high of quality that it wouldn't be able to play on it. Hell, it won't even let you transfer it onto the player. [And reformatting it takes FOREVER when you're dealing with a movie.]  Other than these cons that I've mentioned, I really do like this player. It hasn't gotten frozen during playback as of yet, and is generally a very nice player.

The second one was even more broken.  When plugged in, the light didn't even come on.  I left it there for a few hours hoping it might have been charging anyway, but was never able to make it come on.  I returned it for a refund.

<Title>READ IF YOU CAN'T TURN ON YOUR NEW PLAYER
<Date>Tue Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When you receive your new Zen Vision M, there is a very good chance that the player can neither be turned on nor be charged. If it CANNOT BE EVEN TURNED on, all other pros and cons of the unit are irrelevant. So I will spare all such details in my review.   In my case, it took me TWO replacements and a lot of headache to finally figure this out. Here's the issue: if your new player's battery is completely drained - which is often the case due to inventory sitting in some warehouse for a long time, then you're in for a world of pain! The player is not shipped with a wall charger. So out of box, the only way to charge the player is to connect to your PC and charge it via the USB. Here comes the rub, in order for the charging logic in the embedded code to activate, the player needs to be turned on and recognized by your computer's USB controller! But if your battery is completely drained, you cannot get it turned on. I think you can appreciate the chicken and egg problem here. The ONLY way to get around this nightmarish problem is to find a wall charger. Luckily, I found an old PDA charger with similar power output/polarity/connector to get the thing going. My advice for you is to look around your house, chances are you can find an old cellphone/CD player/PDS AC adapter that plugs into the DC input of the sync adapter. But for most people, the only option is to bite the bullet and pay extra for a wall charger.   I think it's as low as a company can go to exclude the accessory that's ESSENTIAL for the basic operations of the product. Even worse, no where on Amazon, on Creative's website, and in any of the included documentations, is this documented. Very lame. I'm not a lawyer, but I think a scheme this lame warrants a class action law suit (Mr. Ambulance Chaser, please contact regarding this proposition:).   Once you do get the thing to turn on. Then you're all good. You can charge it using the USB for the future (unless your battery is completely drained again, in which case you will have to go back to a wall charger of some sort).   I know I said I wasn't gonna go into all the pros and cons. But I must say something about the sync adapter. The thing is ridiculous! The larger-than-iPod form factor allows all such connections to be built in. There is really no logical reason for this kind of ugliness. Why? Very ugly engineering. Perhaps Creative will decide to exclude the sync adapter  AND the wall charger in the future.

<Title>A piece of art

<Content>I've had several MP3 players, and have tinkered with others that friends own,  the Creative Zen is the best I've had, not because of the space or the look, it's just has  a better operating system than the others. You can browse by letter inside of a category to quickly find a band, adjust the volume no matter what screen you're on, and it has a customizable button that allows you to jump to any option. You can even make it look better with a wallpaper from your pics. The battery blows away the Ipod big time (I've had the 4th and 5th gen and both were disappointing).  I grabbed the 60 gig version of this which is slightly larger, but far better than anything I've bought before.

Zen is much more complicated, can't use my already purchased itunes songs, can't find many video/movie downloads. Hard to find accesories. The owner's guide didn't cover in detail how to download. Software very complicated. I liked the ease of downloading on the itunes. I finally got some music on mine and its OK, but I think the ipod was much easier to use. Wish I would have bought the ipod video. Even though the screen and colors are great I am not as happy as I should be with it for the money it cost:(

All in all I'm very satisfied with the purchase, although I think the player is a little bit to heavy, if you want to go jogging with it. Sometimes it crashes, if it gets moist from sweating.

<Title>My player hangs...
<Date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very recently I've purchased a Creative Zen 30GM player. Off late the device started to give me problem. Its just hangs up and I end up resetting it. This happened almost twice on previous occasions. I don't exactly remember what I did  that caused the device to hang up.   Few weeks back I took it to a very important event to record the entire audio session. The entire team was counting on it as I took the  responsibility of recording the event on my Creative Zen player.  I started to record the event on this device that went well into 3+ hours and at the end of it when I selected the stop menu, and IT JUST HANGED!!!!. I waited for almost 20 minutes for it to come back. But it did not. It would not respond to any key and it would not shutdown. I waited for over an hour before I used the reset button and when I came back I did not see the recorded file. IT WAS LOST. I disclosed this to the team members and the look on their face was terrible....Yikes!!!  I contacted Amazon and they shipped me another player and now I've copied over all my media files onto the new device. I was not able to copy the playlists that I created to the new device...  ..and the story continues...

<Title>I hope you don't want to add media
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My experience with the ZVM has been very rocky since the start.  The problem isn't playing media or use of the actual device (although it is a bit clunkier than i had hoped), the issue is transferring files onto the ZVM.  It's very touchy; sometimes you'll be able to get hundreds of songs transferred at once, but other times you'll go for one or two songs and the player will just freeze at 77% transferred or so.  The real problem is video.    One of the main "bragging points" of the ZVM is the ability to hold multiple codecs of video.  Good luck getting some videos on the machine to enjoy that.  I have many mpg, avi, and wmv clips that I wanted to transfer to the device, but almost every time, there's some sort of problem.  For example, avi is a designated format that is supposed to be compatible with the ZVM, and I already have 5 or 6 avi movies loaded.  However, the touchy machine will sometimes choose to reject your "compatible" movie and force you to convert to less than half the quality (the "best" option).  Even then, sometimes conversion will be "unsuccessful" with no other information as to how to solve the problem.  The Creative support team offers little to no help.  When I called, they informed me that the player can only hold one type of video.  Even though it's advertised as multi-codec and even though I already had more than one codec on the device, it's only meant to handle one of the options.  That's all the assistance they could give.  Troubleshooting was not an option.  My last negative point is the sound.  It's been impossible to balance the sound to having rich bass without "crackling."  I've tried this with many sets of headphones and even speakers, but the device doesn't leave many customizable options, either no bass or a bass overload.  Overall, if left with the choice to purchase a different mp3 player, I absolutely would not buy the ZVM again.  I used to own an iRiver before it went obsolete and was intrigued by the options the ZVM seemed to offer as opposed to the iPod, but it's failed about every test miserably.  My overall opinion is that, beautiful screen and comfortable size aside, the experience I have had with the ZVM has been frustrating and not worth it.

<Title>When there is trouble, there is no real technical support.   
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am one of the unlucky ones who got a Vision M that does not work properly (a search online shows that many people find that their computers do not "recognize" the USB-plugged device, as was only part of my problem). In the past I have had effortless and quality experiences with IPOD, but, as noted in a good many negative reviews below (among the many glowing ones), Creative Zen customer support is hard to get hold of, 9-6 pm only, not toll-free, very grudging with help, jargon-ridden (the talk of "registry issues" left me baffled---but that's me of course), and then---absolutely unwilling to "lead me through" any troubleshooting processes at all---they only reply by complex and multiple emailed links that did not help and certainly do not zero in on the problem.  Even the technical support agent suggested that the numerous shotgun instructions he would email me might take several hours to troubleshoot and "no guarantee" of course.  Many of the positive reviews here on Amazon may speak about initial positive impressions, but certainly when there is a problem, few companies can be less customer-supportive.  A decidedly unpleasant experience and, in a moment of trouble, perhaps the least professional treatment I can recall during the past decade.  I will now have to return my "opened" Vision M to the shipper, and pay a hefty "restocking fee," etc., although I believe that a legitimate customer service operation (with good and courteous training that genuinely aims to help)could easily have addressed my problems and have make me one of the many happy Creative customers.  Lots of good talk about this product, but get a "lemon" or have a problem and you are in a dark hole. With IPOD there is fine customer support, but here I have one of the most negative customer experiences I have had with any customer/technical service anywhere.  I bought Creative Zen with all the best expectations. The people in Malaysia (where the Vison M is produced) may make a generally quality MP3 device, but the operational ethos of the company in the United States could hardly be less satisfactory.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a first time MP3 player owner I did extensive online reading prior to my decision.  I purchased the Zen Vision M in January and it has proven to be an excellent decision.  I have had no problems as mentioned by other reviewers, such as initial charging issues or difficulty with navigation.  Granted, menu navigation does take a little practice but being a first time user it took very little time.  I also have not had the screen scratching problem complained about by many but don't know if that is due to a superior than average Zen or I am extra careful with its use.  I ordered the AC adapter and car charger and they work great.  It would have been nice if these were included but I'm not complaining.    I only have two minor gripes....The first being the manual.  It leaves much to be desired, particularly for a novice such as myself.  I have been unable to find a more complete online manual so it's mostly talking to others that are familiar with the basics or trial and error.  The second gripe is the price has dropped quite a bit since I purchased it.  Good for those of you considering the purchase but frustrating for those that paid the higher price just a few months ago.

<Title>Pleasant Player
<Date>Sat Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll make this short and sweet - the Zen Vision: M is terrific!   I'm techo challenged and resistent to newfangled gadgets but I enjoy this quality mp3 player. I did a good deal of info digging and comparrison shopping before settling on this 30GB audio and video player. I appreciate the easy to use and gigantic screen design. I love the terrific sound quality. The digital photo display is fantastic. This is an overall outstanding mp3 player.  I despise the iPod. I dislike the scroll wheel navigation especially. I also resent the overwhelming presence of iPod. It seems "popular" and I'm not into status symbols. Besides, the Creative Zen offers so much more. It's clunkier looking than the sleek iPod Nano and such but it packs a lot of good features.  As I said, I'm keeping this review brief. The botttom line is I really enjoy this fabulous player and think it's currently the best deal. It's worth a good look if you're looking around for a nice, multi-functioning player. I love it!

<Title>Not Good
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product December of 2006. I got it and was very very pleased with it. Video, Music, Pictures, FM radio, FM radio recording was all good, never used the microphone.   After about 4-5 months after purchasing this product, I went to charge and add music to the player and the USB cord could not be recognized by my computer. I have read reviews of this happening and still decided to purchase it anyway......WRONG MOVE.  Everything I tried that the tech support told me to do via email because your phone support help expires after 30 days I believe did not help.  Luckily I purchased from Amazon and was able to return it but with a 15% restocking fee deducted from my refund. I don't know if its just the Creative Zen Vision: M that has this problem but I suggest that you do not buy this product to find out. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Better than an Ipod
<Date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product because I wanted to be able to use the Napster unlimited service for music.  It works flawlessly.  Ipod lookout!  The screen is clear and bright.  Way more pixels than an Ipod (63k vs 250k colors) Clever and intuitive controls for Navigation work extemely well.   Reading the instructions is completely unnecessary. Copying items to the unit couldn't be easier because it acts as a USB mass storage device.  Just drag and drop. Fits easily in pocket and controls lock to keep from accidentally pushing the buttons.  Accessories are widely available and cheaper than Zune. Quality construction, great sound with lots of volume.  When plugged into the car radio auxillary input plug it automatically activates without pushing any buttons and INSTANTLY resumes play where you left off.  Videos resume where you left off also, like a DVR would for the TV.  Battery life is good.  More versatile than most others on the market as far as file formats are concerned.  Any video files you may have which are not usable can easily be converted using the included software. The screen is smaller than a Zune (same as Ipod), but it's way cheaper and the overall package is smaller (than Zune) meaning better portability. I love it and would quickly buy it again over either of the competitors, even if price wasn't an issue.

<Content>I bought the ZEN Vision M (30gb) a few months ago, and it has worked flawlessly.  Great interface, and sync software.  This is probably the easiest to set up and use that I have had.    This player is much superior to the IPOD video units.  It has never froze, unlike my wife's experience with her IPOD.

<Title>Harddrive Crash after 90 days, other reviews same problem
<Date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Player only Says "HARDDRIVE PROBLEM" Worked fine for 90 days then crashed, Now being charged $25.00 to have it looked at by Creative labs, since it is after 90 days. It's says 1 year warranty, but after 90 you have to pay $25.00 to get it fixed. Still cheap. Tech support took over 48hrs to reply, and when they did they try to sell you stuff for a broken player. This is in the tech email. "Please be patient and we'll figure this out. In the meantime, feel free to visit our website and see the entire line of accessories that we have for the Zen Vision:M. They will definitely help you get the most of your music experience. Here is the link"   The only thing the Zen has going for it and why 2 stars is the picture is nice and clear. Will not buy any creative labs again, this is the 3rd product, the others being speakers, all have broken or poorly manufactured. I have had better luck with lower end products.

<Title>My Zen Baby
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player so I don't have anything to compare it to but I love it.  The sound is unbelievable, the picture is gorgeous and the touchpad is exactly what I wanted.  It's sensitive but I use a touch mouse keyboard and have very light fingers so it's like it was made for me.  That's on the medium setting, the sensitivity can be adjusted.    There are a couple of things I'd suggest that would make it better but they're minor points.  One, the instruction manual is pathetic.  The only thing worse is the user guide on Creative's website.  It actually showed menu options for this model that weren't on the actual device.  But Googling Zen Vision M brought up a lot of discussion forums where all of my questions had already been answered.  The other thing I don't like is how it doesn't separate album artists from contributing artists, making the artist list three or four times as long as it needs to be.  A lot of the names I don't even recognize because they're from collections that Windows Media Player grouped under Various Artist.  I would have preferred that method of sorting but when weighed against the incredible sound and ease of use, it's a very small matter.  I bought the custom skin to protect the screen and case and it couldn't be better.  It was easy to put on and while you have to press the buttons through it, it's easy to do and the locations are clearly marked.  And while I haven't dropped it yet (fingers crossed), the rubber feels thick enough to provide some protection when I do.  Altogether, it's been a realy pleasure to use and I totally recommend it.

<Title>Took a while but it finally charged
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i am like almost everyone here, i was looking for a good mp3 player. i don't really like the ipods battery life so i was holding out until i could find something a little better. i came across the the Zen Vision numerous times but i was hesitant to purchase it. finally i did, when it arrived i followed the instructions and installed the program then i plugged it into the usb port on my desktop pc, nothing happened. i came online to see what the problem could be i saw that others experienced the same problem and said it may take an entire night or so to charge. so i left it to charge, i got up the next morning i found that nothing had happened. i got frustrated and tried it out on my laptop, the blue light came on and started blinking, so i thought it was finally working i left it to charge for some hours only to discover that the light was just blinking but the player wasn't charging. i gave up on it and said i was going to purchase a charger and forget about the usb charge. i left the unit connected to the computer and then i turned  on the computer and it recognised the player was conneted and Bam! it started charging and now it's working like a champ.   This is a great player, the immediate impressions was a very tiring and difficult one but it then showed it's true colours and boy was it beautiful.

Im glad that I did cause this thing has more features that I like than the iPod does and its like the iPod has a delay everytime you switch songs and what not. The only thing about it, its real thick but that aint a big deal to me. If you willing to spend a few more bucks to get your money$ worth, I recommend getting one of these. Setting pictures as your background, FM Radio, Bright Display Screen. Everything about it is great. I hope that I was a bit of help on this product.

<Title>Excellent!!
<Date>Sun Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my ZVN a couple of days ago, so I haven't had tons of time to explore everything it has to offer. But so far I love almost everything about it. The screen is very clear and displays colors sharply- great for watching videos! The custom button allows you to designate it for whatever command you want - I made mine "volume" so I could easily access it for adjustments. I'm very impressed with Creative Media Source (software that comes with it) - I own a Zen Touch and the version it came with several years wasn't nearly as easy to use as the current one. This one makes the transfer of all media very easy and user-friendly. However, I am having some trouble moving the picture and video files around.  Other reviews are right about the hypersensitivity of the vertical control strip. I had to turn it down to "low" so I could better navigate without accidently selecting menu items. So far this is the only inconvenience I've found.   Overall, this is an excellent product that easily rivals (and beats) any ipod.

<Title>Join the anti-ipod revolution!
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently had to make a long plane trip to Asia and i wanted something to keep me entertained.  In-flight entertainment gets very old very quickly.   A friend of mine showed me his 30gb Zen and I was really impressed especially with the video quality.  He had over 10000 songs, thousands of photos and over 30 full length movies - and he still had much space to spare! I paid less (through Amazon) for a 30 gb Zen than my daughter did for a 4 gb ipod!  Also I am so tired of i-this and i-that that wanted to break from the crowd and I'm glad that I did.  If you want a versatile and very functional mp4 player try the Zen - you won't be sorry.

<Content>I use my zen for everything, I strongly recommend this if you have a job that demands a lot of waiting, traveling, or in front of a computer. It's a little big for the purse, and a travel charger is needed. The screen resolution is great, the batteries last long enough (altough I don't really know exactly how long), it's good to see movies or tv shows when waiting, and the price it's lower than other brands.

<Content>Nice unit. Works seemlessly with Media Center. Plenty of capacity.  Nice, but easily scratched, screen.  However, the Zen just stopped working one day due to an apparent software issue.  No rhyme, no reason.  Creative wasn't much help.  They did suggest I contact Amazon.  Amazon did replace it 3 months after purchase,to my surprise, with absolutely no hassle.  I would have given this unit 5 stars had Creative been more responsive to the problem.  Knowing what I know now I doubt I would buy a Zen Vision M again.

<Content>I got this for my daughter after a few problems with an IPOD that she had for two years.  Well, the Zen here worked for about 10 minutes and we're two days and waiting for customer support at Creative.  When she received it for Christmas, she told me that it didn't work.   Thinking that she didn't have it set up correctly, I finally had some time to work with it this past weekend (April).  Well, she was right, it doesn't work.  Loaded everything, got it in sync and then it promptly froze in recovery mode with the computer software saying that it isn't plugged in since it's in recovery mode.  Catch 22!!!!  Find another brand, it can't be any worse.

<Title>Great on paper, but too frustrating in practice!
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered the Vision M because it had every feature I wanted in an MP3 player.  It sounded better than an Ipod because it had an FM radio, which was very important to me.  However, after owning the Vision M for about two weeks, I finally gave up on it and sent it back.  It is way too frustrating to deal with.  The thumb pad is much too sensitive- i had a very hard time going through the menus.  By default, the sensitivity is set to medium, so I thought that if I changed it to low, I would have better luck. But even set on low, it was still incredibly sensitive.  I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my boyfriend try to navigate through the menus.  He actually had an even harder time than I did and was ready to throw the thing out the window after about 5 minutes.  The other problem was that the case I ordered with it (I believe it's made by DLO?) which was supposedly made to fit the Vision M, did not work with it at all.  The case covers the power button, so you can't even turn the thing on and off when you have it in the case.  THat's completely impractical!

<Title>Great sound, but having difficulty with syncing
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I chose the Creative Zen Vision M based on about 10 hours of research. It came down to an iPod or the Vision M. iTunes was not what i wanted to rely on for future music purchases, so I chose the Vision M. I've had it for about a month now and use it many to deal with my 1-hour commutes. My ultimate goal was to download audio books and catch up on my reading. It's worked extremely well except for the syncing. I had Windows Media Player (WMP)version 11 loaded on my computer already, but also loaded the Creative software as instructed by the quickstart instructions. Seems like there's a conflict between the two media managers. Many times my computer will recognize the Vision M, but the WMP won't see any files on the Vision M, even when I can see the files using the Vision M screen. I had to constantly try different settings on WMP and try unplugging and plugging the Vision M player back into the computer's USB port. Nothing was consistent. So I deleted all the Creative software. The syncing works a little better but it's not as consistent as I would like. Seems it should be easier than this. Perhaps I am overlooking something, so if anyone has a solution, please let me know. Overall, I love my Vision M and may consider buying a better set of earphones, but I really enjoy it.

<Content>1.  when you're listening to shuffle dont you sometimes want to drop into the album and listen to it? can you do this easily w/an ipod? heck no.  w/a zen? of course! 2. when you load 1000's of songs at a time there is bound to be a song you really never want to hear again. you dont always have time to go back and at least find the thing you've marked as one star, and remove it later while you're running itunes, you want to delete it. can you do this w/an ipod? of couse not. w/a zen? of course! 3.has anyone actually been able to watch an entire movie on an ipod? not me! on a zen? of course!  4. can you leave your only copy of YOUR OWN MEDIA on this thing and copy it back to your computer w/o using itunes or any other silly software? of course!  can't do THAT w/a retardopod. 5. do you need any annoying software to manage your music? nope! just the zen explorer, which, by the way, integrates cleanly into windows explorer, nice! 6. do you want to jump to a artist beginning w/a certain letter? do you hate waiting for that stupid letter selector to pop up in the ipod after you're already on the letter S when you dont even need it anymore?   there are many, many other features to this superbly engineered product.  yes, it's slightly thicker than the ipod but who cares? it makes me feel like i have control over my expensive electronics. apple's oversimplification of things really bothers those of us who actually want to LEARN how the thing works and use it to it's full capabilities, not have our minds made up for us.  the only reason i dont give this product 5 stars is b/c the initial charge process is kinda wierd.  it doesn't even show you it's charging for hours. kinda kooky!

<Title>Great Quality, Also note about initial charge
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great media player, the video quality is excellent, battery life is great and the audio is good as well. Great for college students, can watch the videos on long bus rides home and listen to music walking to class, etc.  I mainly wrote this review to mention a note about the initial charge.  Initially, I thought I received a defective replacement from Amazon (first one didn't charge at all).  I plugged it into my laptop and it didn't charge, left it in for 48 hours and nothing. Tried plugging it into my friend's laptop and nothing. So I went to a computer lab on campus and I plugged it into a desktop PC and it started charging. This might be because laptops don't supply as much power on the USB ports as desktops, I'm not really sure, but I plugged it into 4 different laptops and it didn't charge on any of them.  So if you own a laptop and you notice it doesn't seem to be charging, try plugging it into a desktop PC if it is available, if not, you'll probably need to buy the AC adapter just for the initial charge.

<Content>Yes, this is a great player.  I can fit SO much onto it and it plays videos very clearly.  I ended up showing it to everyone at work.  I would show it to one, and another would see it.  I'm giving it love and so's the rest of the department.  I'm still getting used to the scroll thingie, but its getting better.  Of all the video I've dowloaded, some of the older ones won't play and I have to convert them from an old avi to a newer one.  It takes some time, but it's too be expected with older files.  Most of the video plays pretty quickly.  It doesn't take long to load stuff on and doesn't lose battery power too quickly.  I played video at 80% brightness for more than 3 hours and there's still plenty of battery bar left.  So, yes I like my new  toy ;)

<Title>Best MP3 player
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing mp3 player. Since many positive side of it has already been discussed here, I am not going into details of those. Just one thing about the video player... this player does a superb job playing a wide range of video file formats. However, when you want to upload a standard divx/xvid movie in Zen vision M and use the video file converter software that comes with it, sometime it says that the movie file is not compatible with Zen and its need to convert. I found out that all it does is to reduce the resolution and hence decrease the viewing area and reduce file size. And it takes almost two hours to convert a standard size (700 MB) movie. If you know it's a divx or xvid encoded video with AC3 or mp3 audio code, chances are Zen will almost always play the file without any conversion. It will take more space compared to the one you get using the converter, but you get better visual quality and much better TV output if you want to watch it on your TV. You also save the time and hassle of converting again an already converted DVD movie into avi format.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having owned a video iPod (30gb) for a brief amount of time, i can honestly say I prefer this player over the iPod - even if aesthetically there isn't much of a difference. Both play digitized compressed audio files and video files and both are a little bigger than a pack of cigs in a hardpack. The Creative 30gb has a bigger screen, displays more colors and will play more video formats (conversion may be necessary). Photos look great on the screen and can be zoomed in, although in a limited capacity. I'm not a fan of compressed digital music, so i compress my files at a higher bit rate (the lowest I go is 224). Music sounds good on the player - it is what it is.   One of the drawbacks is the lack of an AC adapter in the box. You can charge the player via the included USB cable - but it takes a while. Spend a couple of bucks and get an AC wall adapter (avoid the Creative brand - with a few mouse clicks you can find an affordable and high quality adapter here on Amazon at a fraction of the cost and it works). Using the AC adapter it will take about an hour or two to fully charge.   I haven't timed the battery - but it lasts a while (much longer than iPod's). Of course, if video files are watched, the battery will drain faster.

<Title>The best MP3 Player on the market. 
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best MP3 player i h ave ever used. Gorgeous video, easy to use user interface, and great sounding music. This product is better than all current iPods, in my opinion. However, it scratches easily, and BSE is available for purchase. It's the first thing you MUST get. This player certainly deserves the Best of Show award that it earned at CES.

<Title>Awesome Player
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen M is an awesome player. Music quality is great and what is even better is the video and picture quality. The screen on the ZVM is amazing. There are infinate ways to transfer files onto the zen m(unlike the ipod) and each of them is extremely easy. The Zen is compatible with pretty much any file which is a nice feature. I personally put a lot of videos onto the Zen and watch them on my TV using the AV cable(sold separately...10 bucks on ebay). Videos transfer in about a minute but rarely they will have to conver which takes between 30 and 90 minutes. I either way, it is always faster than burning a DVD and I dont have to worry about scratches or skipping. There is no quality loss when playing movies through the Zen.

<Title>Believe the hype
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After doing an exhaustive amount of research, I decided to buy a Creative Zen Vision:M over the 30 gig iPod video.  For the most part, everything I read about the Vision:M is dead on.  The player is very forgiving with regard to the number of different formats of music and video it will play and the screen is sharp and dynamic.  I haven't used most of the other features extensively, but I have played around with them.  The FM tuner might be useful, but I bought this to NOT have to listen to the radio, go figure.  The picture browser is a neat feature, too.    The one constant negative I read was about were the cumbersome player controls.  It takes a while to get used to navigating between functions and files.  I've had the player for more than a week, and I'm still constantly frustrated at how clumsy the touch pad can be.  Also, for those of you who love to make playlists, this player will be a real chore.  I previously had a 20 GB Dell Digital DJ.  That player let you import playlists directly onto the player.  I'm not saying that you CAN'T make playlists, but it is a pain as you have to do so on the actual player or using the program that comes with the gizmo.  Once again, navigating through your list of artists, albums or whatever can be a real chore, so creating a playlist on the actual player is a pain.  Also, I would suggest getting a BSE (Best Skin Ever) before you receive the player as you might have read, it (the black at least) scratches amazingly easy.  With all that said, I am still very happy with the player.  As you can see I have given it five stars in spite of it's minor shortcomings.

<Title>Creative Zen Vision: M review
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a previous owner of the 30GB 4th generation iPod. Since the player was no longer working (battery problems), I decided to shop around for a new player. I took everything into account.  The creative Zen won me over for three main reasons. 1) The FM radio option was built in to the player, along with recording ability. 2)Price was 15% cheaper then the iPod video. 3) Creative's existence is defined but sound technology. They make sounds cards, so I concluded they would build a superior mp3 player.  Overall. I'm satisfied. The quality of sound is superior. But disadvanges are evident. 1) the player is bigger and heavier then the ipod video 2)if you have everything organized on itunes dont even think your going to be able to sync with your zen, you have to use mediaplayer or there own bundled software which is frankly inferior to the itunes interface.   If you dont have an mp3 player buy this. If you had an ipod and are considering this, just know the transition may be a little difficult.

<Title>Way Better Than an Ipod Video
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had this mp3 player for about a month now and I am still love it. I recently took a road trip from Southern California to Vancouver Canada and it was a great item to have for it because the radio stations these days in my opinion are really bad and just play the same stupid songs over-and-over. Anyway, the battery life in the player lasted the whole time on a single charge (going there and coming back). Also this player came in handy when I go to the local driven-in movie theater, the radio feature on the player has a better reception than the one in my car. In my overall opinion this is probably the best mp3 player on the market right now.

<Title>An outstanding product, better than the iPod video
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've now owned 4 creative products....the very first Jukebox, then then Nomad Jukebox 3, the Zen Sleek, and now this.  I'm very very happy with the Zen Vision M.  The video display is MUCH brighter and crisper than the iPod video.  If you don't believe me, go to a local Best Buy and check both of them side-by-side.  Sound quality is great.  Though I still believe the best MP3 sound I've ever heard came from the iRiver, this one sounds very good.  I use Shure 4C earbuds to begin with, but the Vision M sounds good even with less expensive headphones/earbuds.  Battery life is better than the iPod video.  It's not quite as good as my previous player, the Zen Sleek, but  I'm also happy to see a good market for Zen Vision M accessories.  Some have mentioned that the Zen Sleek is bigger and heavier than the iPod video.  OK, technically that's true, but the difference (to me) is very very minor.   I've carried the Vision M in my pocket and hardly notice it.     FM tuner is nice, sound quality is good.    This product is very slick and sophisticated.  I've been using it heavily since I bought it in December, and am extremely happy with it.

<Content>My husband gave me a video ipod as a gift, but I gave it back because I already had all of my music loaded into my computer and I didn't want to have to re-load everything for the ipod.  I love the Creative Zen because it uses all my pre-existing music files, and has a converter built right into the program to easily let me load TV shows I record through my computer onto the Zen.  I couldn't easily do that with the ipod!  The sound on the Zen is great, and the battery life wonderful too.  I recently used it the entire flight from Paris to the states, and had plenty of battery left.  I highly recommend this product!

<Title>Great MP3 Player - Well worth it
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent a long time researching mp3 players, trying to decide which one I wanted. I knew I didn't want an iPod, and I knew the basics that I wanted. At first I didn't want one like the Vision:M - I just wanted your basic player that didn't have Videos or whatever added. The more I looked around, the more I kept coming back to this mp3 though - and now that I've bought it I'm very happy I did. The sound quality (granted I'm using different headphones than came with it) is wonderful, the screen is beautiful, and the interface is not only easy to use and easy to learn, but simple and quite easily done with one hand while doing other things that keep you from actually looking at it. Sure, it's a little bulky, but it still fits just fine in a jeans pocket, or purse. It's also very light. All in all, it's a great product, and well worth the money spent on it.

<Title>Great Player! 
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In a market filled with ipods, this mp3 player is the only other one that I have heard of. It has created a niche for itself by providing a player with great storage, great navigation and user-friendly software and a wide variety of video playback. The ease of loading the player with what you want and creation of playlists and everything is much better than the ipod which I used to have before. Thee battery is really good on par with the ipod and the screen with its brilliant display, easily surpasses the ipod. The only hitch that I've noticed is that sometimes the player tends to freeze and you can't do anything but wait until the power leaks on its own and then you should restart it and that can be really frustrating. This happens esp. when playing videos and if your impatient. On the positive side it helps you keep your patience at clicking and loading or you'll probably have to wait a whole day before you can use the player again. So folks great product, but a tiny, little bit slower software...

<Title>Better value buy than the ipod 
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We are all suckers for good marketing and that is exactly what Apple has taken advantage of. The ipod definitely looks and feels better than the creative players. But from a perspective of sound they are both the same. The features are better on the creative and the best feature is the dynamic building of a playlist on the creative player. For example you could play one song and then add another song from another artist and then finally save your selection as a playlist all directly on the player and without the computer. Ofcourse you also have the option of creating a playlist on the computer as well. On the ipod the only way you can build a playlist is on the computer through the software provided by Apple. This key and very important feature in my opinion gives the creative players a lot of flexibility, which is missing on the ipod. I am surprised that the Apple does not have this feature.   The one thing that is big drawback for the creative series is the accessories that one can buy for it. As for the ipod the entire industry revolves around apple hence there is a huge choice of accessories where as much smaller variety for the smaller brand mp3 players.

<Content>There is nothing I don't like about this thing! I've dropped it several times and carried it in my purse, (which gets beat up pretty good,) and it keeps going! The picture is perfect, the sound is perfect, all of my digital media fit and I still have more room! It records great, the Radio works great, I am so happy with this MP3/video player that I'm looking into one for my dad for father's day, I really believe in the Creative products now. And it's so easy to use! After I got used to the buttons I can now operate it while driving (an attachment to play this in the car is great). I have restarted it once but it was hooked up to a non-responsive/dying computer at the time and I think that caused the problem. Bottom line: if you are looking for a Video/MP3 player, this one is it!  I have been using this player for longer now and have learned something about charging it, if you let the battery die entirely, it can lock up the system. This is no big deal, eventually it did recharge but I thought I killed it there for a while. Also, I dropped it on the pavement the other day, hard enough to leave a few marks on the outside, and it turned on right then as if nothing happened. AMAZING!!

<Title>Freezes up on me
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The program they give you to manage files on the player is difficult to use.  I found that sync-ing the player often led to problems that weren't coming from Windows Media Player.  I was dissatisifed with the player from the beginning, but now it's unusable.  I've had it for four months and the player totally crashes constantly.  It won't respond to any possible permutation of pushing buttons (even the reset button).  The only way to get it to come up again is to let the battery run dead and recharge it again. Even then it freezes up within one or two uses.  I really regret this purchase. The player now resides in a landfill somewhere. Notice that the reviews for this product are either five stars or one or two.  It shows the unreliability of the product.

IMHO, Ipods are great for beginners, but once you become serious about digital music, you should "graduate" to this player.

The piece as a whole is beautiful in the sense that all of the buttons, screens, and interface of the player jive together well. It's Trustworthy in that it plays GREAT!

<Title>great upgrade from the iPod interface
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had a 4gb iPod Nano for a couple years now and have been very happy with it in every way but i finally have more than 4gb of music that i want to listen to all the time and thus the upgrade.  The one thing i hated about the nano was the iTunes interface.  I didn't buy their DRM'd content at all and found their method of syncing clumsy and poo-like.  So after much research i settled on the Zen Vision: M.  It's really quite beautiful and the .3" extra thickness from the apple 5g really isn't that big of a deal.  The color depth is 4x than that of the video ipod and takes xVid movies too.  I having syncing with the Windows MCE box and it as smooth as can be.. it even converts and downloads the last three episodes of every tv series i have on that box.  For those geeks out there.. it works really well with my linux box too.  My only complaints are that coming from a flash player, the extra 1/10 of a second to get between songs or rate them is noticeable and annoying and the necessity of the interface dongle.  Basically, to connect your player to anything other than headphones requires a little 1"x2.5" port converter (included).  Oh and the wall charger is not included any more (and charges in 2 hours as opposed to 5 via usb) and when i bought it at circuit city, it was $35.  That was a bit obnoxious.

<Title>Brilliant
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Generally, I don't write online reviews; the Zen Vision:M, however, is worth the few moments.  About six months ago I thought I might like to buy an MP3 player, not knowing whether or not I would ever use it. After a some basic, initial research, the Zen Nano seemed like a good bet. I bought it, used it, fell in love with it, used it constantly. When it was full, and as Christmas approached, I thought it might be time to upgrade.  More research. I decided on this product. When I went to the store to but it, I was distracted by the flashy packaging of the Zune - which I bought. That ended in frustration as, apparently, I needed to upgrade a recently upgraded version of Windows in order to install the Zune. I returned it, bought this - even though a salesman said to me "You like this over the iPod?" Apparently Apple is so good at marketing, they've hired store employees to push their product. I have no interest in iPods, other than the amazement that it has joined the ranks of Kleenex and Coke - those brands that become the name for an entire product.  Pros: It's wonderful - there isn't enough space to talk about it's pros. Here are a few:  It's holds a lot, and the screen is great.  You can download music from basically any site.  It comes with lots of software, all of it easy to use; great products, themselves.  Cons: If you like flashy packages, this isn't your item (but what can you say about an item that COSTS abot the same, but has a flashy pack?).  Be careful, the front scratches easily.  There aren't as many accessories available for the Zen as there are for the iPod in stores - HOWEVER, more are becoming available and a google search or a search on this site will yield new and exciting results. Read the reviews, though; I bought a clear "skin" for mine, and it might have looked nice on a white Zen - mine is black, and it looked horrible. It's also made of this sticky rubbery product that picked up every piece of stray lint. It then was horrible and horribly fuzzy. (I have recently located a new, improved version that has a "smooth" texture and comes in black; hopefully this will undo the major "con" of this item.)  I hear iPods freez a lot; this one freezes from time to time, too. Considering it's basically a mini-computer, I suppose that's warrented. Try to keep a paper clip aroud, just in case.  It charges slowly, as I suppose the all do, so - if you have the money - invest in the travel charger. Much better.  I list these faults in the interest of fairness; still, I can't reccomend this product enough. Creative/ZEN has won me over - I'm beyond loyal to this brand; they're just about as good as it gets.   Buy it, use it, tell your friends.

<Title>If quality or durabilty matters to you
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The most prominent features of the Vision M have already been commented. Also, if you are considering the advantages of this over the iPod what the reviewers here have said is true, you do get better battery life, a richer, larger display, the convenience of charging w/o a computer and faster with the INCLUDED A/C adapter, more video formats supported and other features that you may or may not need such as radio, recording (both radio and voice), equalizer, etc.  However, what has been most important to me is QUALITY. I should know, I was the proud owner of a nice but rapidly deteriorating iPod. The Zen Vision feels well built and solid in your hand. It is designed for real-life use, i.e: a player that can be put in a pocket, in your bag and even *gasp* occasionally dropped without sustaining serious damage, which is exactly what will happen to the iPod under similar conditions.

<Content>Hi all....  When I bought this I almost sent it back....  no ac adapter is included.....at first I didn't panic because I saw a USB cord is included and I assumed it would charge from that....  however, after 1 hour plugged in to thge USB port, no charge symbol appeared...no lights lit up - it seemed like a dead animal....  I went to the creative web site and their solution for a machine that will not come on is to install a firmware upgrade - HELLO CREATIVE!  IT WON'T FRICKED TURN ON!  Talk about a dumb knowledgebase article....  After 3 hours connected to the USB port, a light appeared by the power switch but still no charge symbol on the screen, one you're supposed to see....  I revisited the web site and deep down in an obscure area they say that when you charge via the USB cable it may take all night....geesh!  I went out to good old RadioShack and picked up a $28 5 volt positive tip ac adapter, plugged it in and BAM it came on immediately.  Why do these manufacturers not give us what we need - STOP BEING CHEAP CREATIVE!  Anyway, I now have it working and it is a very cool device.....the screen is high-res and the easy way it works with Amazon unbox makes me very happy....  I just wish my just-out-of-the-box experience was better....god only knows how mahny other people just sent it back...

Easy to use but some short cuts would be nice.  It still has same digital rights media limitations as all the other mp3 players.  I like the Ven Vision Series computer interface software.  The random play is as limited as all other players.  You have to select the starting song which means you will probabaly here the first song in your play list alot.  Still it sounds good and works well with my car radio 3mm plug in and my home stereo 3mm plug in.

<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wonderful user interface and dj mode makes this player a jewel to operate. Ripping dvds and compressing to an .avi file size is time-consuming, but within a few days you can store some of your fav. movies for replay anytime.  Only downside is the manual is underwhelming, but the online forums for the anti-ipod crowd are growing. You can quickly grab neat navigation tips by just searching the forums. The included software works well, and is fairly easy to use - still, it is not as user friendly as iTunes. The tradeoff is the open architecture.

<Title>Don't go ipod, go creative
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a new mp3 player since my old one was small and didn't play videos and I wanted a pink one and I did not want an ipod by any means. The Pros. -Color Choices -Good Price -Plays More File Formats -Everyone and their dog doesn't have one like ipod -Holds alot -Holds photos and video  The Cons -Senative tap pad even on lowest setting -Included softwear to convert files is useless and has yet to convert a file that wasn't compatatable. -Won't play some avi type files and will if they are converted to mpeg -Lack of accessories for this player, I want to be able to attatch it to a belt clip but it's difficult since more things are modeled for ipods. -Included headphones are too big   30gbs is still alot of space for me. I have 3movies, about 600songs and have hardly made a dent into it. The battery life is good,3-5hours on video.

<Title>Fantastic Media Player
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen Vision:M mostly as a music player, but when I got it and tried out the video I couldn't believe how gorgeous it played. The display on this device is truly beautiful and I have been looking for good video content to watch on it.   It's a bit thicker than a 30gig iPod Video, but I still prefer the drag and drop interface to being forced to use iTunes. It plays most video in the native format I have it on. I haven't tried watching an entire converted DVD on it yet, but I will be soon.  I was originally worried about being able to find accessories, but I found a fantastic deal on protective cases, car adapters, USB connections, AV cables...pretty much every accessory you can imagine.  The battery only lasts about a week for me, but it charges remarkably quickly when attached to my laptop.

<Title>Would be great...if it ever worked
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very excited when I recieved this product.  As someone who has a bias (admittedly sometimes illogical) against apple products I was thrilled that creative was offering this.  It cost less and had a higher rating from consumer reports then the ipod did, and could play more video formats. (Plus more battery and an FM radio to boot).  Now I must admit that I hate it (or more exactly, I DESPISE CREATIVE).  When it came the buttons on the front of the player did not work, so after much haggling (and shipping costs) I sent it back to creative for support.  This was a nightmare, everyone wrong with customer support must be concentrated in the creative customer support center.  Now, just yesterday (3.5 months after I bought this defective thing) I finally received a new player back, but guess what? The new one doesn't even power on, so I have to go through this again.  As I was complaining about this today, I also found out the guy down the hall from me had the same problem, after three returns he gave up....  My advice, buy another product.

<Title>Best of Breed. (IMO)
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>'Best of Breed'... it's a term you hear often in business when looking for a solution, and in commerical categories like mp3 players, it's very appropriate.   First I'll comment on the iPod and Zune. They're both decent players, and well designed. They CAN work, but the question is: 'Do their features outweigh their shortcomings?' The answer: 'In my opinion, no'. And I can sum it up for you in a sentance. Both the iPod and Zune require conversions for video, software specific to the player, and support drm/corporate goals more than the openness that an mp3 player should.   Now to the meat!  Pros: - Great color options - Ability to play divx and xvid movies very well (including via video out) - Fantastic sound - Open to other syncing software (I use Monkey Media) - Comes with an LCD protector already on it  Cons:  - Power/uplink/video out connection is all one connector at the bottom. I'm not sure how I would personally do this better, but I'm still not sure I like it.  - The buttons take a little getting used to - No brown option like the Zune (what can I say, Brown is classy! ;) )   There are a lot of options if you're looking for an mp3 player. If you're like me and want as much as you can get from the current gen, you'll choose the zen. (ugh, sorry for that rhyme ;) )

<Title>Good, I guess. 3 1/2 stars.
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative products (Zen Micro and Zen Vision) have both given me problems. I started out with a Micro and for a while, things were fine. But down the road, I started noticing things that weren't right: Once in a while when I would be listening to a song, it would start the track over right in the middle of the same song. And multiple times did it freeze on me.   After all of the problems, I decided it was time for a new player. I still tried to keep faith in Creative and bought my first Zen Vision at walmart.com for about 200 bucks. It too was nice for a while, but I'd notice it would freeze up on me. Thank goodness it never turned itself off on me like some have complained about. One day it froze and I put it in Recovery Mode and couldn't get out. I sent it back to walmart.com and they replaced it hassle free.   Fast forward nearly a month and a half. I am on my second Creative Vision. It has not frozen once (thank goodness) and the bar that steadily moves along as a song plays never acted up like with my first Vision. I was happy about all of that. And I believe it hasn't frozen on me once because I either got really lucky or it was because I installed the 1.61.01 version of the firmware for the player, unlike my first Zen Vision (I couldn't get it to update on that player). But there are still problems. The only main problem (and it's minor) about this player I can say is that when you add most songs, you look at the play count and even though you've never played that particular song before, it already has 3-5 plays on it already. Talk about glitchy.   My biggest problem is actually with using Creative Mediasource. I use it to put new songs and videos onto my player but sometimes when you're in the middle of using it, all of the data from your player that translates into Mediasource just up and disappears, leaving me no choice but to close Mediasource and open it back up again. Very annoying especially since when I open it, it doesn't got straight to Organizer view.  I wish I could say it's been a walk in the park with this player but it hasn't been. Maybe I should stop recommending this player to people when they ask what player to get...I mean I love the 30 gigs of space, I'm through a bit more than a third of it already and I got my player in mid-May. Overall, it's a decent player that plays videos crystal clear and has nice sound but I just can't look past all the faults.  I can't fully recommend it.  3.5 stars.

<Title>Fantastic! As close to perfection as any out there.
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To start, I LOVE THIS PLAYER! And I'll get into why later. I can't rate it a 5 though, as it's not perfect.  But it is as close as anyone has come in the portable media device business.   First, I'll start with the flaws that I've noticed, because I know people come here to look for issues with products.  However, I don't feel any of these are deal-killers.  First, the player scratches easily (I have the black one and it's only 3 months old and its finish is showing signs of wear...buy a skin to protect it! I've heard that the screens scratch easily, too, but I haven't removed the screen protector that was on it from the factory.  I suggest you leave it on.  If you remove it, I believe you can buy replacement screen protectors online.    The next issue is with the touchpad.  It's VERY SENSITIVE! However, you can adjust the sensitivity in the system menu.  I have it on "Low" and I still end up "clicking" when I meant to go up or down. It takes a bit of getting used to and is sometimes frustrating.    My last issue is with their video conversion software.  It's great that when sync'ing the player can automatically convert video on-the-fly to a supported format, however, I've found that videos captured on my camera in .mov format, don't convert properly.  The video converts and is loaded to the player, however, the file will not playback. I can FF and rewind through it, but it doesn't playback. All other videos and podcasts seem to work fine. I even reconverted the file after updating all my video codecs, but it still doesn't work, so I'm assuming it's a bug in their software.  Oh, there is one more thing: If you used to own a flash memory mp3 player, this one (or any player with a harddrive) will not give you the same battery life. For extended battery-life, make sure to run it in "Locked" mode.  If you leave the screen lit, you'll only get about 4-5 hours of playback. Even with the screen lit though, I can get through a day at the office on a full charge.  Other than that, this thing is FANTASTIC! The player integrates amazingly well with the new version of Windows Media Player.  I find that I don't use the Creative software for much of anything, except uploading pictures and sync'ing contact info. With this player, you're free to shop for music downloads just about anywhere, unlike the iPod. So far I've used it with Urge, eMusic, and Yahoo! Music without a hitch.   Stores and displays pictures! You can transfer pictures and play slideshows of them which is great for showing off the kids pictures to people. The 2.5" color screen is crisp and pretty bright. The screen brightness can be controlled in the system prefs in percentage increments of 10. I keep mine at 50% to save battery life and it's plenty bright enough.  The player will auto-dim after a few seconds as well in order to spare the battery. As mentioned above, though, running in Locked mode yields the longest playback.  Music playback is great, but you'll want to get new headphones, as ear-buds aren't great.  I rarely use headphones, so it's not an issue for me.  I have portable speakers I use in the office and an FM transmitter for the car (The iRiver AFT100 works great, and I live in the NY metro-area where there's no dead air.  It will overpower weak stations, I've had good luck with stations in the upper 80s-low 90s, but I digress.)  Music is listed in numerous ways; the various catagories are: Song, Artist, Album, Playlist, Genre, and Recordings (yes, you can do voice-records with the built-in mic and record from the FM radio, too).  The player also has Bass Boost, multiple preset EQ settings to choose from, and a feature called Smart Volume, whereby it regularizes the output of your mp3s.  Don't you just hate it when one mp3 is 10X louder than the one that just played, and you find yourself stunned by the sudden blast of noise in your ear? Not with this player. While there is still variation from track-to-track, it's relatively minor.  The built-in FM radio is a nice little extra.  You can set up to 32 preset stations. Reception is good outdoors, but not great within an office building. It uses the headphones/speaker wire as an antenna. When needed, I can usually get acceptable reception by creatively rigging the wire.  In addition, you can set up a portion of the drive to act as a portable storage device. And, it syncs with Outlook, you can store all of your contact info, appointments, and tasks. Justification for having it in the office. ;)  Anyhow, I hope this review helps you.  If you buy one, you won't be disappointed as they're more flexible and cheaper than the comparable 30G iPod. I just don't like being wedded to any one company for anything and the Zen affords me the freedom to load pretty-much whatever I want on it. Happy listening!

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  Amazon service is outstanding. I chose this product over the cowon iAudio and the Ipod equivalent because of fm radio, voice recording and video screen size and quality. It really is amazing in the quality of audio and video it produces. It's not hard to use at all and I used it all the time. One little thing is that the black version scratches very easily, people are not exaggerating about this.   The biggest problem for me was that after 2 weeks the screen suddenly started to flicker. Not during video playback or anything like that. It flickered as though it's brightness was pumped up too high. To reduce the flicker I had to lower the brightness to 30 percent from 50 percent. At that point it  was almost imperceptable. I tried resetting it formatting it, recharging it but nothing helped and the forums had no info. Final Solution. I returned it yesterday for a refund. I dont know about you but I am not going to keep it to see if it gets better or if I can start getting used to it. For the money I want a device that works flawlessly for at least 6 months. I will be trying the iaudio next let's see how that goes.

<Title>Love my Zen!
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Every one at work had Ipods and I didn't want to be like everyone else. Especially at the price Ipods go for. So I started doing some research and found this 30gb that Creative had and for the price I couldn't understand why I hadn't seen more people with these. I got mine for 200 bucks. What a deal! CNet had it rated high. The graphics are amazing and the sound is great! I'm kinda new to these things and after playing around with wma, mp3 and wav I have found there is not much loss with wma. I love the Creative explorer, it is easy to use. The only problem I had was converting my wavs to mp3's but on creative forum they gave me a great converter to download for free and it also has a nice id tag. If you don't id tag them correctly you have to redownload or do a lot of right clicking. The converter is by dbpoweramp and it is incorporated with Windows XP. It is great! The Creative windows downloads everything as a WMA. I ordered a silicon case right away so it won't get scratched. You can also use other software like Windows Media Player or whatever you like. I love the FM Radio since I go to the gym and they have special stations set up. It has an autoscan function. I haven't played with the microphone yet. I also ordered a car charger which is nice and it already comes with headphones and a/c adapter. The fuzzy things on the headphones keep falling off though. It also has a USB port and a DC in and AV out which is also nice. I compared the size of this to an 80gb ipod and it is the same except for the thickness, but that is not a big deal. If you need more space you probably will go with the 80gb Ipod but if not I think you will love this. It took awhile to get but was well worth it. jj

<Title>Not all that
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first started looking at the ZVM and reading the reviews I thought there was finally a competitor for the ipod.  The screen is better than the ipod but unfortunately that's where it ends.  The software is lousy, I bought this player around March of 06 and thought that there would be improvements.  There has been updates but no improvements.  First of all you would think that seeming this is a video player that getting video to it would be a snap.  Not so, I'm not sure what the convert video of the software is supposed to do but all I get, and many others get, is "unknown error".  Do some searching and you will find that others are equally frustrated that you have to go find a third party software to do what the supplied software should.  Secondly the sync to Outlook works halfa*s.  It worked somewhat before the last software update but now I get an error that something is trying to access my email addresses and do I want to allow it.  Your only option is to click no as yes just continually pops up the same error.  So for ~$250 you've got an MP3 player with a really nice screen.  I could have spent more than half that for the same thing.  I'm not sure who all the reviewers were that left such great reviews for this before I purchased it but they obviously didn't use it very much, maybe they were paid by Creative.

<Title>Their Customer Support Has Been Abysmal
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Zen Vision M locked up several times over several months.  The last time, it was permanent. I had to contact their customer support to begin the process of getting it fixed in the middle of January.  I received incorrect information regarding product availability, long waits for the sync adapter to come back into stock before I could attempt to reload firmware (I lost it; my mistake), and finally after getting an RMA approval have now been waiting 17 business days from their date of receiving it for them to get replacement stock. They quote an average of 10, but ask you to contact them if it is longer than 15 days.  I have been told that they are going to replace it once they get stock back in.  Although they have units to sell in stock, this does not mean that they use them to honor their warranty with.  They will not give any sort of estimate when they may have replacement stock.  Also, their web RMA status page may not get updated, or may post incorrect status. Oh, one other interesting feature of their support is that if you don't have a support contract and the unit is older than 3 months old, you have to pay another $25.00 for the testing.  In the almost 2 months of dealing with this, Creative Labs has lost me as a customer, which I have been for over 10 years.  Aside from the lockups, I liked the unit. I now have an iPod that I love and also had to use Apples' Customer Support services.  No problems.  They dealt with the problem in a professional and efficient manner.

<Title>Fantastic - so happy with this purchase!
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm loving this MP3 player!  It is very easy to use & has great software to transfer files easily.  I was also able to transfer music from Windows Media Player VERY fast (it also worked with HP Rhapsody).   I can see why some complain that the touchpad is too sensitive, but it really isn't bad once you play with it a bit, and if it really drives you nuts, there is a sensitivity setting - when I put it on Low, it wasn't bad at all!    My one complaint is that I had no idea only the faceplate of this unit was black (or whatever color you choose).  The back of it, as well as accessories, are all white.  I probably would've just chosen a white one had I known this, but oh well.  I prefer black in general, but don't care for the two-toned unit.  But this is minor compared to its quality and capabilities.    I can't offer opinions in comparison to the Ipod because I don't like Apple computers and therefore have avoided their other technologies despite its popularity.  Other reviewers have offered ample information regarding this, and I was pleased to find most found this to be the superior unit.

On the other hand, it's easy to use.  From what I've seen so far (1 month), a definite recommendation.  Oh yes, and a tip: buy the charger (only $20 extra) so you can charge it off the wall. It also works with the TravelSound speaker system - also recommended - so you don't have to use expensive batteries.

<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After weeks of research over the internet, I decided to buy the Zen Vision M over the Ipod. I bought this MP3 last week and I can only say that I am amazed!!! I am very delighted at the clear LCD display and the capabilities of this device, which I will not detail since many people has wrote about it. I can only say that if you are planning to buy a good MP3 player, this is your best choice, and don't forget to buy a good case and screen protector since it scratches easily.  Finally, a friend who works with me bought an 80 GB Ipod weeks ago, and was so happy with it until I suggested to compare it with my Zen Vision M, when he saw the two MP3 together both playing the same video he was dissapointed of the lower quality LCD and brightness of his ipod and as we explored other features he grew even more dissapointed, well to make a long story short, she told me yesterday that she was selling her ipod and planning to buy a Zen.

<Title>Best MP3 player I've had!
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You have seen many reviews below that speak better and in detail of how good this player is. I was one of the early adopters of the mp3 players, way before Steve Jobs introduced the ipod, way back when 16Megs of memory started to make them viable as portable music players.  This is the best I've had so far. The number of feaures is amazing and it still remains very portable. It is the first one I have had with video capability. I have sinc'd video podcasts and home movies with ease with the included software.  I can record important meetings that have many assignments handed out thanks to incorporated microphone. Now I can easily remember who is suppossed to do what. So if you see me in the office carrying one of these you dont know if I am goofing off or just using it as voice memo, hah.  I am glad they improved the 'I' touchpad excessive sensitivity of previous models. It was very difficult/frustrating to use back then. Now it makes navigation very easy and feels natural.   The con: it depends, if you have a large library of itunes music, then making the move to this player is going to be pain: you either abandon your library, or re-rip to mp3 via the cd burning route. If this is too painful and stick with your ipod, then just know that you are living the lesser of the two machines. Not to knock on the ipod, and sound unfair, the ipod is good, but it stopped being the best mp3 player by the second generation when other developers included more features into their products to separate themselves from the ipod. Unfortunately, this did not catch on thanks to itunes ease of integration with ipod.  the second con is that there are no many fancy accessories like the ipod has, just the basics stuff. This makes sense, since there are more ipods, unfortunately, to attract third party developers.  If you want to start fresh and are not polluted by the itune/ipod sheep mentality, get this one! not only you will be different when you pull it out, but when the curious ipod user checks your machine out, they will be jelous that you have the better player and probably paid less!

<Content>After my ipod broke, i was very hesitant to buy another so I decided that maybe it was time to change from apple to another manufacturer. I made an excellent choice! The Zen Vision has given me no problems so far. It's easy to transfer songs, make playlists, and organize your music.  I have not tried features such as photo or video yet so I can not speak for those features. I use it all the time and have no real complaints. The only thing I did notice is that the battery life is somewhat shorter than other mp3 players so it needs to be recharged often. Other than that, it's a great deal at a very reasonable price.

<Content>I am so madly in love with this product!  Just USB it into the computer and drag-n-drop what I want on it.  I did not install accompanying software as Windows Vista recognized it right away!  I mainly use it for songs only.  The touch pad is very sensitive and takes a bit to get used to.  Very easy to navigate!  Had no freeze ups as stated in other reviews.  It does however, get fingerprints easily...Problem solved by buying a cover!  Earphones are fine but purchased in-ear phone for the hell of it!  Purchased white because I wanted the entire player to be the same color.  Defiinately purchase an A/C adapter for this...USB takes 1000 years to charge!
