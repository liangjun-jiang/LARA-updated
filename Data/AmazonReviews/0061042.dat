<Title>Finally, the drag and drop MP3 player I have always wanted
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the Sony Network Walkman and the Apple Nano Ipod.  Both sucked with the proprietary software to get MP3s on to the device.  This is the best MP3 player out there right now.  The only reason why I gave it 4 starts was due to the USB cable which has a proprietary connector.  If you lose this cable, you are screwed and will have to try and buy a replacement from SanDisk.

<Title>By far the BEST flash mp3 player on the market
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the e270 about two weeks ago and really put it through it's paces.  I travel on a plane about 10 hours each week, so I've gotten some use out of it.  Oh, and I watch tv shows on it too, which is surprisingly tolerable given the small screen size.  Positives: -The screen is way bigger than a Nano, and it's really nice -Plays Video -User changeable battery (when they release it, which I'm sure will be soon) -Flash upgradable using MicroSD (also, there will be full albums coming out in MicroSD compatible "gruvi" cards) -Sound recorder, with easy to use record button -VERY VERY sturdy, with a metal back, that looks great and does not scratch easily (I don't even have a case) -Plays FM radio -6gb for the same price or less than a 4gb nano  Negatives: -The charger is USB only which for 98% of people is not an issue, but if you need one reportedly the Griffin Powerblock works fine, as I would suspect any charger that allows a usb cable to be plugged in -A bit thicker than the nano, but I actually prefer the e200 form factor

<Title>Love It
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a beautiful player, a little bit bigger than the IPOD nano but that doesn't bother me. The fact that it has FM, and can hold pics and video is enough that I can deal with it being a little bit bigger and maybe heavier, but it's negligible.  Good: I like the scroll whell on this. I don't like the IPOD scrolls because I always move past the selection that I want or tab it by accident and select something I didn't want. This, you feel the wheel click so that won't be a problem. The buttons around the wheel is a bit small but I have small fingers so it's not a big deal. The interface is easy, I just dragged my music over and it was fine. Battery life is great. I already watched one movie and listened to ~5 hours of music and I still have 3/4 of my battery.   Bad: You have to use a computer to charge it. When it plays movies, it pauses in between scenes for about 5-30 secs which can be annoying. The screen is a bit small that you can't see the pics too clearly but it's a small player with a flash drive, so that's unavoidable. You have to convert the movies/pictures using their converter, which freezes my computer sometimes and it takes a while for it to transfer movies (~20 min for a 650MB movie). Also, there aren't that many accessories you can buy for it. I've been trying to buy an adaptor so I can use it in my car but haven't been able to find anything. And when you plug it into the computer, you can't do anything to the player.   Overall, I think it's a great player. It's a flash drive, so you can take it running and not worrying about possibly damaging the harddrive inside. I originally had Creative Zen Sleek Photo but returned it and got this one and I'm VERY glad, not that Creative don't make great mp3 players but this one is much smaller and has video and I can exercise with it (assuming I get off my butt and actually go to the gym)

<Title>So far I love it!!
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this from Amazon a few weeks ago and so far I love it.   I had an iPod 30GB video player that died loading songs the first time.  Apple replaced it and then the replacement died the same way.   (Apple gave me a full refund to their credit!)   I'm not sure why my iPod didn't work and so I've been a little gun shy with the SanDisk, but I haven't broken it yet!   Turns out, when Windows Media Player tries to sync with the device - it get's screwed up.  (Hold down the power button for 20 seconds to reset.)  But - when I drag and drop files - it works perfectly.  The album art is not displayed on the SanDisk and the Windows help site has an item on their FAQ about this saying it is a SanDisk problem.  Also, the radio reception is not the greatest, wish it had a little antena or something.  Also, I'd really like a wall charger for it.   Other than that it's perfect!   I REALLY like it - and - I haven't broken it which is amazing considering my experience with iPods.   Update on 7/14/2006.   The Sansa did lock up when trying to load over 700 songs until I did the following: 1)  Changed the USB Mode Setting to MSC from MTP. 2)  Formatted the Sansa from Windows specifing "Fat-32" - You need to be in MSC mode to specify Fat-32 formatting. 3)  Then I changed back to MTP mode and haven't had it lock up anymore.     Maybe with a new firmware update this won't happen, but I read about this tip on the web and it helped me.    Also - the odd song doesn't show up on the player (but IS in the Sansa Music folder when you view it through Windows) and I have to copy it over again for it to show up to play the song.  Also, I wish there was a easy way to merge songs in WMP like there is in iTunes.  And I still am not getting the Album Art to show up.   However, I have to say I LOVE this thing and I've been very happy.

<Title>Do All The People Who Have Reviewed This Product Work for SanDisk??
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>They must b/c I don't know how they're all so happy with it.  I'm not going to write a long diatribe here, but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270.  For starters, it's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services. It is compatible with Rhapsody, but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer. The MTC protocol (see, I told you it is difficult. . . and I'm not that technologically savvy) only works with USB 2.0, not 1.1, which I have.  Also, it scratches way easily. If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it.   The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next, but the scroll wheel is pretty cool.   I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better. The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you're in the gym or on a plane, you can hear all sorts of backround noise b/c it isn't loud enough. (And yes, I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $150 and I'm still not pleased with the sound performance).  I can't totally trash the player, although I'm super dissapointed with it. . .especially in light of how much money I spent on it.  Customer Support has been great. Quick and responsive. The player design is cool. It's small, but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate. The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking.  Overall, if you're looking for a player that's compatible with all of the music to go, subscription-based services, look further than the e270. If you are cool with paying per song, go with the Nano and itunes. Oh, and who cares about the expansion slot. 6GBs are enough.

<Title>Good, Serviceable Player
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This marks my 3rd MP3 player and I have been quite happy with it.  It doesn't have the capacity of some of the larger hard drive based players, but I've discovered that I don't really miss the capacity.  I had a 20 GB  player that I was very happy with until I left it on a plane, but I'm not sure that the extra capacity was worth the extra size, it was over twice the size of my Sansa.   I also have a smaller 1 GB player that I'm giving to a friend now that I have this one, 1 GB just wasn't enough capacity and the player itself was also just too small. The biggest plus I see with this player is that they have FINALLY incorporated the feature I've been screaming for ever since these players first came out, a flash card slot.  With flash card capacities now getting into the multiple GB range, I've been after a player that accepted cards in essence giving you unlimited capacity, as long as you're willing to buy more flash cards.

<Title>Doesn't work
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful machine, and I was very excited to buy it. Unfortunately, it locked up twice, once while synchronizing, WMP 10, and once while listening. Both times I could not turn it off, and it was unresponsive. I did not call tech support, because I have little patience for products that don't work as they should.

<Title>Very, very Satisfied
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I narrowed my selection to the 4G Nano, and the Sansa e270.  I selected the Sansa due to 1)Larger memory, 2) Available expansion slot, 3) Larger screen, 4) More Durable, and 5) It was different from what everyone else had.  The unit worked perfectly right out of the box.  The large display was excellent (I can't read a damn thing without my glasses, ^$#& middle age), I don't need my reading glasses to navigate and make my choices.  Sound was just as good as my Discman (I picked up some higher quality earphones, the ones that are included are good, the ones I added were better).  The unit was extremely easy to use, and stored practically everything of interest I had, from Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears to Green Day and Velvet Revolver.  And still has room for more.  FM reception sucks, but be serious, if FM radio was any good after Clear Channel ruined the industry, why buy a MP3 player in the first place?  The only down side is item 5) in my criteria, since its not an I-pod like everyone else, there are very few accessories.  Other than that, I'm happy with my choice, and would make the same one again.

<Content>This is the one of the worst mp3 players because it's hard to have it connect to your computer and the software is terrible.  Also, it always freezes and the sound messes up on a regular basis.  Please do not buy this if you value your money at all.  I'm sorry I did.
