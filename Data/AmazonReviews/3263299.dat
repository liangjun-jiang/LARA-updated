<Title>REVISED: If you're not an iTunes kinda person...
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>... then this might intrigue you greatly.  The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  Then what?  What compels you to choose one over the other?  It has to be the UI and user experience.  The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.  This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  What device would I recommend?  Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  **** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

<Title>upcoming market killer
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this new product from creative i feel will be sure to take over the market. First lets name thr competitors. The rio carbon 5 gb. and the ipod mini 4 gb. Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

<Title>Come on Zip
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.

<Title>Zip it!
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

<Title>Good functions, but way too ugly
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.  But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

<Title>Interesting design
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

<Title>Lotta Bang for the Buck
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.

<Content>I am totally hot to buy this, based on the specs as outlined on Amazon's site. However, one thing I'd like to know before I buy - will Bose and other 3rd party vendors offer products to complement the new Zen system as offered for the Ipod? I'd like the flexibility afforded by the speaker docking station, and right now it seems as if Bose is offering such an option only to the Apple consumer.  Thoughts???

<Title>I'll never buy an iPod!
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First I'd like to make a clarification of Timothy Stoehr's review. He states, "One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable." Hey smart guy, they're not called "microdrives" for nothing. It's true that CF cards are used in iPod minis but they are CF Type II, which means that they are in fact hard drives and they DO have moving parts. Don't believe me? Go here: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/micro/soltns.htm  3600 RPM, 12ms avg. seek time  All microdrive players have moving parts, and all microdrive players utilize CF Type II.  I don't own a Zen Micro yet but I am waiting for reviews to come out. I don't know about you guys, but I refuse to buy an Apple iPod. I refuse to buy into the Apple image and support a company that still won't use the right-click on a mouse! Pathetic. I walk around and see all these people with white earbuds and I just shake my head.... If the Zen Micro were just 0.2 inches thinner I think I would be sold for sure.

<Title>Buy the Zen Micro and support the Ipod killer!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I'm a music technophile hailing from the tiny island of Singapore, the country that is offering the world the Zen Micro. Like many people, I have been sold on the idea of getting a hard-disk based portable MP3 player since mid-2004 and have been hunting around for a good one for the past 5 months.  When the mini-Ipod came out in Asia to buy in July 2004, I was pretty much interested in getting one. However, the high price for 4GB (S$458.00=US$275.00) and seriously, not too exciting colours, stopped me buying it immediately.  My attention turned to the then-competing product, the Creative MuVo2 4GB. Retailing at S$398.00 (US$240.00), the gadget looked pretty attractive, but I was still hedging for something better, as it was still larger than the mini and looked a bit plasticky.  So when I saw the Zen Micro on pre-launch in October 2004, and the blurb by the CEO of Creative Technologies in the local papers on its features and functions, I was very intrigued. The next 4 weeks was spent trawling the internet reading reviews on the pros and cons of the Ipod Mini vs. the Zen Micro. Very interesting.  Now, I'm pretty convinced that I shall get the Zen Micro, if only to march to the beat of a different drummer. Hearing friends extol the virtues of the Ipod and dissing everything else without empirical evidence just helped me make my mind up even more.   I'm sure that audio quality wise the ZM will beat the IM hands down. I don't know about the rest of the functions, but I am willing to place my faith in the hands of the underdog.  As for those writing about whether accessories companies (Bose, are you listening?) will support the ZM, I think that the market must be there first before these companies will create the supporting accessories. I for one would love to be able to plug the ZM into a good home stereo, either at my home or at my friend's place. Oh, and bluetooth capabilities would just be too cool.  So, all you people out there who's had enough of the hype of the Ipod Mini marketing machine, here's your chance to tell Apple who's really boss!

<Title>Cynical Reply
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow this player would be so great if it were only an Apple iPod. If it looked like an iPod, had less features like an iPod, only worked with an iMac and iTunes and were actually made by Apple and not Creative then I would love it.   I do so wish it had MIDI support however, because all my favorite songs are in MIDI. It would be really awesome also if it had something usefull like a text based role playing game instead of having a calendar and contacts.  Obviously I'm being facetious, but that's kinda the vibe I got off all the negative comments. There was no good argument against a device that for the same price has higher compatibility, better sound quality, more functionality, a removable battery and a radio and voice recorder thrown in just for giggles.   My only major complaint at this time is that I preordered this device on Oct. 17th and it still has not shipped, apparently due the overwhelming amount of orders placed for it.   I do wish that there were some hands on reviews out there (CNET has it, but has not posted their review yet) and I wish it came with the wired remote. I still plan to purchase that seperately but it would have been nice to have it included. If anyone has found any real hands-on review please let me know.   If you are a Windows user and do not use iTunes AND size matters (I had a 20 GB unit but it just big enough to be a problem when snowboarding and skateboarding) then this is the best option I've seen.

<Title>Very happy with the Zen Micro player
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is a great little player.  I have had the silver Zen Micro for almost 5 days.  Its a big step up from the flash player I was using before.  Its a nice small package and great design.  Its a little wider than the I-Pod and feels slightly heavier.  The case is very solid, and the front face is seamless.  Sound quality is excellent, although I did replace the earbuds with the Sony Ex71SL earbuds, which are really, really good and much more comfortable.  Navigation and controls work very well.  I still think the I-POD scroll wheel works a little better than the straight line slide control on the Zen, but the difference is not that great.  The volume was very easy to adjust, even during work-outs.  It took a little time to figure out how to create a playlist from the music library, but its easy once I figured out the sequence, and the menu lets you select songs by genre, artist or song name.  The Zen Micro also allows you to create and save on the fly playlists, or you can create them with the Media Source sfotware.  Its great that there are so many ways to download music vs. being tied to i-Tunes as with the i-POD.  The included software makes it very easy to transfer files to the player, and I was able to use either Windows Explorer, the Creative Media software or Musicmatch to transfer files (I was not able to synch with Napster).  I did find that about 4 to 6 out of the 200 songs I downloaded did not transfer for some reason when I used either the Creative Media Source software or MusicMatch.  So far the battery life is less than 12 hours, but the early editions of the Micro shipped with two batteries. It could be that by turning the backlight off or adjusting the controls less frequently the battery life will be much longer.   Overall this is a fantastic player so far.  I'm very impressed with the quality for something that was just launched last week.

<Title>Exceeds the Ipod
<Date>Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I compared the Zen Micro to the Ipod. It's plain out better than the Ipod in these areas:  - battery life and convenience - sound quality!!! - extra features (fm, voice recorder)  It's relatively the same in "user-friendlyness". For all those people debating about the better design, they are both well made and look nice ... it's up to personal preference. Just let each customer make up their own mind about the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the Ipod is a good player, but there's too much hype and overall, I believe the Zen Micro is better. Better sound, battery and more features, what more can you ask for?

<Date>Fri Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After researching mp3 players ad nauseum, I decided to buy the Zen Micro, and I'm glad I did. I have a flash player for the gym but wanted something with more storage for everyday listening. My music library is a little over 35 gig but I felt I didn't need that kind of capacity in an mp3 player. What drew me to the Zen Micro was the replaceable battery, the FM Tuner, the optional clip, and the ability to create playlists on the fly, not to mention that it has more storage than the iPod mini. I looked at the Rio Carbon, but it didn't have an FM tuner or playlists on the fly. I looked at the Archos Gmini XS200, but the battery is not replaceable and the initial software is reported to be clunky. So far, I have been very pleased with the Zen Micro. The touch pad seems to be a point of debate with everyone, and I agree it takes a little practice, unless you have a laptop with a touchpad in which case it is second nature. I was concerned that the touchpad would be so frustrating that I wouldn't enjoy the player, but that's not the case. The sound is excellent, the player is tiny, the software is easy to use, and the thin neon blue strip of lighting definitely adds to the cool factor. I am using Windows Media for syncing and haven't had any problems yet. This is definitely going to be an iPod mini assassin.

<Content>Like many other ppl, I was deciding between this player and the Ipod mini.  I chose this for the following reasons:  -1 gig extra -FM Tuner -Voice Recorder -Detacheable Battery -EXTRA FREE battery($40 value) -NON proprietary music file format(plays WMA, which is smaller than mp3 and quite popular, doesn't work w/ ipod :(  Have had it for a week now.  Took less than a minute to install.  Very intuitive interface.  The control takes a little getting used to but it's definitely manageable and oh for ppl worried 'bout the "touch sensitive" controls, there's a "lock" button, works great.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Good player but  very poor construction
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).    However, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.  My only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren't sexy but they're easy and work well).    I am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year!

<Content>This MP3 player is packed with features but all that means nothing if it doesn't work.  My headphone jack began to fail after just 3 months of ownership and wouldn't work without contant jiggling.  The hard drive failed just outside the warranty period.  I deposited the device in the trash and purchased a Sandisk Sansa player.  It's much nicer, slimmer, has no hard drives to fail and contains all the features you would need.

<Content>As many other reviews have agreed, I liked mine until it broke - in two ways.  Same headphone problem as others, but that was nothing compared to the total meltdown it then experienced.  Now I can't even turn it on, and I've only owned it 11 months.  I liked the space, features, setup, etc. but that makes me all the more sad that it's hopelessly broken.  Try another brand, because if you buy this one you will just end up buying the other brand in a few months anyway.

Yeah ight, for a major defect that was THEIR problem and if you weren't under warrent then too bad?!?! Not only that but the software wouldn't let me well do anything. I had to go install a new media center just to sync music. This would have been the Ipod killer if it didn't have crap service and hardware problems. Don't waste your money on Creative.

<Title>Good until...
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zen Micro about a year ago.  I loved it because it had great features at a great price.  The music is pretty good and it holds a lot.  The radio is good once you get it to tune.  The way it is designed is great and the voice recording is useful.  A few weeks ago though, my problems with it started.  If you charge the battery when it is half-way, it makes the battery last a LOT less.  It started dieing very soon.  I tried to charge it, but when you take out the battery and turn it on it goes to a recovery screen.  You can't get out of it easily.  It is helpful but never delete the firmware. It says you can reload it onto the player through a USB plug, but you can't easily at least.  Since it was more than 60 days old, they wouldn't let me talk to them over the phone.  Also, it was more than a year ago so they wouldn't even help me by e-mail.  They left me with a small "knoledge database" that didn't help at all.  They did say though that for $12.99 you could get a 30 minute session with a "Creative tutor."  I took a search to finally find the phone number.  Finally I got in contact with a person and told him my problem.  He told me that I could send it in and get it repaired for $60 to $100 plus $12.99 for shipping back and whatever I pay for shipping to get there.  Disgusted, I decided not to pay, and just got a new player.  So I am here to tell you that while the Zen Micro might be good, the service is absolutely terrible.  Even Apple which I heard doesn't have great service has better service than Creative.  [...]

<Title>Not that great...
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought one of these for my daughter and within a month the thing would freeze up. She sent it back for repairs and left the battery in. They fixed it and sent it back without the battery and told her it would cost $40 dollars for a new battery.  I was mad and wrote the head of their public relations department a letter and Creative called me the next morning and had a battery overnighted to my daughter. (hint: go to the public relations for fastest results). Then it happened again and they would send a new one (didn't have to call their PR after the first one). This happend 3 more times till my daughter quit using her sony sport headphones.  Then after about 3 months the headphone jack started having problems, so she brought it to me and I fixed it. And it has worked fine since then. The same thing happened to my video zen:m using the sony headphones. Evidently there something with sony headphones and creatives MP3 players. Now my daughter has a ipod nano and seems really happy with it.

<Title>Programs not clear
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had the unit only a day, and figured out how to load the mp3s after an hour or so of loading program and reading the manual. Although pretty much Windows drag and drop, there is some setup to do beforehand, so don't rush things and read the pdf manual. The paper manual has instructions for installing the drivers and playing the files. You'll have to go online or read the pdf manual to really work this thing.  I think I am pretty satisfied with the quality and oompf of the player itself, but Creative's "MediaSource Organzier" interface (along with the simpler "Media Explorer" and their capabilities--or not--caused many wasted hours here on Day Two. The Explorer offers a task list to easily rip audio CD to the device, with a box to check whether you wanted to also rip the mp3s to the Music Library on the C drive. I didn't want to waste my precious space on C drive, so unchecked the option. Later when I wanted to burn an MP3 CD (rather than an audio CD), I found could do this only with access to the harddrive's version of the Music Library. When I finally figured that out (and I reripped the album I was interested in),  then the mp3 burn list would import the tracks only in alphabetical order. I tried via a custom playlist and bringing over a clearly numbered Album, and they tracks jumped to the burnlist in alphabetical order. Through the forums on Creative's website, I discovered that is the only option. No way to have the mp3s be "tracked" on an mp3 CD burn. And that's it. Phooey.  And for some reason, I could not after the fact move my many ripped albums of mp3s from the Zen player to the c drive's Music Library. If this had been explained beforehand or at all somewhere, I would have saved hours of time. But their manuals and tutorials make it all seem so easy..select tracks, place them in order with my named playlist, click a few buttons...and presto, it's stalled or a mess with no means to figure what happened.  I eventually worked around the whole thing using other programs, and now have a cd that will play my tracks in order on a CD player. Now I'm just going to make straight copies of it. Too many hours where a few sentences in the manual would have helped.

<Title>Cool!
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received today an IPOD mini and a Zen micro, so had a great opportunity to compare them side by side.  The verdict?  Both are well built and beautiful gadgets but the Zen Micro is way cooler... The way its lights glow and pulsate during charging is especially mesmerizing.  I am totally in love with it.  To top it off, the sound quality of the Zen Micro is clearly the better of the two.   Some additional features on the Zen Micro that I particularly like -has an option to automatically normalize the sound volume of all my MP3 tracks, so I don't have to constantly adjust the volume when changing tracks.  This is so convenient as I have some tracks that play too loud and others that play too soft.  -built in FM radio with automatic preset -LONG battery life!  Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player at an Affordable Price
<Date>Fri Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? You ask, yup. That's it. I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  Not everything in this world is 100% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).  That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!

<Title>Serious iPod Mini competitor
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I would give this 4.75 stars if possible, but 5 was too much.  Overall, however, this is most likely going to be the next big iPod killer.   The pros for this product are many.  First, it has a removable battery.  The batteries are rechargeable, and it doesn't take a multitude of people to change the battery.  The back slides off of it, and there is a place for the battery.  Plain and simple, but much better than the iPod mini's battery, which has had records of bad battery life and expensive removals.    For another thing, another reivewer commented on the touch-screen buttons and how they are bad.  This is not necessarily true, however.  The older iPod 20/40 GB models also had touch screens, yet nobody complained.  Touch screens are not always completely sensitive to everything, as the person makes it sound.  When you touch the buttons it responds, and while sometimes it may respond to other items, its not very often.    Personally, I think that the Zen Micro looks nicer than the iPod mini.  The thickness was somewhat annoying, but its only something minor.  The Zen Micro has 10 different colors, and all look very sharp.  iPod mini's colors are limited, and the Micro's colors aren't only brighter, but the buttons light up nicely for a good touch.  I never liked the iPod's touch wheel, as it was used for too many things.  Volume, song scrolling, playlist selection, etc were all too much.  Many times I held the middle button down to get a song to a playlist, yet it instead misread the usage and played multiple songs. Little things such as this led me to the iPod's death in my heart.  The 5 GB storage is also nice.  It holds a good 1500+ more songs (as advertised), but is not too much.  I've had two iPod Mini's (one stolen, one just broken), and on each i was running out of storage space within a month or two.  Yes, you can delete songs from it, but it is not something they come out and tell you.  I could not even find it in the user's manual.  The Zen Micro is also much easier to use with Windows.  The format that everything is set up in was mostly designed for Windows users, as opposed to the masses of people with Windows and Apple-designed iPods.  Again, minor, but the small things make all the difference.   Creative Labs' Zen Micro is a great little mp3 player, and it could lead to the downfall of iPod Mini's.  Probably not, but I'll be hoping.

<Title>Zen Micro - New User:   Pluses and Minuses
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Owned 2 about 2 weeks. Bought at Fry's 1st wanted IPod mini but FM tuner, better sound specs, extra storage, free user changeable battery and better projected battery life convinced me to buy Zen. Wanted them to take to gym FM tuner was big plus bk the gym has tv's with assigned fm frequencies, nice to listen to/watch tv while on treadmill.  Turned out to be a dud.  FM reception, at least within the gym for frequencies assigned to TVs is marginal to unlistenable.  Better headphones help, but do not resolve this problem. Also, turns out deep in PDF manual (that you don't see till after you buy) says you shouldn't use these while jogging, it could damage the unit.  When we went to Fry's a Creativerep was there,we told him why we wanted these instead of the IPods, to listen to the fm for TV's while jogging and also asked if armband carriers were available for them.  He said the armbands were included in the box, and that the FM's were great and that was a good idea.  When we emailed Creative their response was:  Maybe he misunderstood you, and yeah, "other headphonse might help the fm reception, no apology, no suggestion as to where to get the armbands, no suggestions as to which "other" headphones.  Also, the touchscreens are kinda tricky and everytime you pick one up you change the station or restatrt the song. Pluses, so far no operations issues, at least for us, sound good and they do at least HAVE an FM tuner, software is good, and I"m getting better with the touchscreen. (also I found an armband carrier, got it at the Apple store, aftermarket model for IPod Mini)

<Title>Zen Micro Problems
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Everything was brilliant....playing media was fine, syncing was fine... (as there was about 2-3 hours of battery life in it when it came) However since I charged the battery up with the mains adapter provided (about an hour ago) it's been downhill from there! It worked fine to start with and then it started locking up. Now the PC won't even see it.  I've tried the Disk Cleanup and Reboot options on the special startup menu a couple of times (when you hold down power button in the on position when you reconnect the battery) but am still not having any luck. I don't want to format it or mess around with reflashing the firmware (even if there was a newer version!) if I can avoid it as at least I've got a couple of songs on it. The special start up menu says Creative Zen Micro v0.0.56 and the information says version 1.00.05.  I got the special edition version which came with the two batteries, the first battery I tried had enough juice in it for a 2-3 hours of play. Funny that I never saw Jimmy G's message until I started having problems with it.   Really sad and disappointed, it's great aside from this lockup bug, don't know whether it's the software on the PC or the Micro itself. Guess I'll have to wait and see if any updates come out.

<Title>It's turned into a love/hate thing.......review update
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. Then last week, my player just quit working, period. After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer service, they said I should send it in for repairs.  I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. They obviously have quality and reliability problems. They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! Yes, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  I threw it away.  Those are minor complaints though.  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  Amazing.

<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love this player. The sound is just fantastic. It is small and light.  My other player is a Zen Xtra - the menus are similar and it took no time at all to find my way around the Micro.  No problem between the player and my computer, not a single lockup.  There are loads of options in the menus to customize.  I like the equalizer.  The touchpad was easy to get used to.  I saw some people saying that the touchpad is too sensitive, but you can ajust that. I haven't needed to. I do use the hold button because I slip the player in my pocket.  I'm very happy with the battery life - though I've not timed it, I used the player for a few days before noticing it was on the last bar.  Not a single problem with it, I love it.

<Title>Not Recommended (POS)
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First review I gave it 4 stars  Second review of this thing after using it for a while 2 stars.   I grant good sound quality, and it looks nice.  BUT  It is not a well made unit.  First failure for me came after about 9 months of light use. It just stopped playing. Turns out the hard drive froze up. I did some drilling, and it seemed to be a common problem with the Seagate harddrive Creative was using (on the early models?) A LOT of people had it.  Now the on/off switch doesnt work.  The only way to use it is to yank the battery to turn it off, and plug it into the charging adapter or dock port to turn it on. Tech support wants $25 each time it looks at it, even if its still within the one year warranty. So Im up to $300 for a shoddy player which will no doubt fail again.  Take these reviews to heart, dear reader. You will see that bad ones are quite common. Save yourself time, money, and aggrevation.  Get something else.  Noel

<Content>Creative came out with a good Item but with a bad warranty which says that it doesn't believe in their product enough to warranty it for a full year.    After 6 months of normal use my Zen didn't work.  I contacted Creative and they said that I was out of the warranty period which is 90 days for this product.  They said that they will repair it for an additional cost of $25.00 + Shipping.   so Again READ THE WARRANTY WHEN BUYING.  For the price I paid I could have gotten an IPOD.

<Title>Zen Micro is the worst piece of junk I've owned!!
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WARNING!!!!!Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!!It's hard to believe Creative had the nerve to release this buggy piece of garbage.  The Zen Micro was recommended for its superior audio quality over the Ipod.  However, I could not put up with it's dismal performance.  I had to retire it and get an Ipod.  The software was slow, cumbersome, and crashed CONSTANTLY when I would try to upload songs.  With Itunes you can change songs using a batch method, but with Creative's software, you have to go through EVERY mp3 one at a time!  That's a lot of songs on a 5GB player!  What takes seconds with Itunes, takes hours and hours and hours with Creative.    The Micro would keep rebooting, and was very slow between songs.  Touch sensitivity was annoying, especially compared to the Ipod.  I tried updating to the new software, but that made the Zen Micro perform even worse! After rebooting, it "rebuilds" the library, which takes a couple of minutes. When it finally reboots, it takes so long to play a song you select, oftentimes you press play twice to make sure it registered, which of course pauses the mp3.  Very frustrating. Designwise, The Micro is far from "micro", especially compared to the 5GB Ipod.  The Zen Micro shouldn't even be considered to be in the same catagory as the Ipod.  If you're considering getting one, go with an 8-Track instead.  You'll be happier.

<Title>nice mp3 player...when it works
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this thing for christmas 05 and it started crashing around june (about 5 months later).  It was a bunch of things that messed it up.  It seemed to work fine but I couldn't hear anything from my headphones.  I had to wiggle the head phone thing for it to work and it sometimes only worked when i had force on it at a certain angle.  Another problem was then when I try to charge it..it just lights up and it wouldn't charge for some reason. After noticing that I unpluged it, and the light wouldn't go out.  So I took out the battery and put it back in and it would automaticly start itself up and would freeze at the greeting "Creative" screen.  It would do that for a couple days, works for a couple days, then stop...going on and off and deciding when it would and would not work.  It's very frustrating.  Other then all the bad stuff, there are some great features that it has.  built in FM radio, microphone, calender, adjust EQ settings, phone book, and date/time (which was always wrong no matter how many times I set it) you can adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad. and there are many different play modes (repeat, normal ect..) the blue lights and screen are bright and very noticable in the dark.   Overall...this is a good product...when it works.  and when it crashes for while...it is VERY frustrating to try to get it to work.

<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has really really really pissed me off.  I got it in about October and it worked great until about March.  All of a sudden the sound would be really horrible and I had to mess around with the headphone jack a little and hold it there so it would sound right.  (Very, very inconvenient even when it wasn't that bad.)  It just kept getting worse and worse.  I love music, so I just kind of dealt with it and had to always keep one hand fidgeting around with the headphone jack just to get some decent sound every once in a while.  Within the past month, about 5 time it has just not turned on at all.  What pissed me off the most is it decided to completely stop working about 2 hours into my 11 hour flight to Tokyo, and I still had a return flight to make about 10 days later.  Going through and tagging most of my mp3's was a real pain too and 5GB isn't nearly enough space.  I've had to delete songs many times just to get new ones on.  I really don't want to keep having to get the same product for my birthday every year because the one from the previous year has already stopped working.  Look into other mp3 players before purchasing this one.

<Title>Don't Do It!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is amazing - when it works. Which for me, was two months and why it gets two stars. I originally gave it one, but when it does work it really is awesome, absolutely no complaints. Mine froze and died two months after I opened the package. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it fixed because it was a gift from an ex who I was no longer in contact with by the time it broke. After it froze I frantically scoured the web trying to find a way to reset it. That didn't work. I changed the batteries, etc etc it was just dead. I thought about buying another one until I read all the reviews with similar complaints. I am not an Apple person, but since that is all there seems to be I finally gave in last night and bought one and so far I love it. I initially resisted because of the software (I thought I hated iTunes) but I am getting used to it and liking it! So this is probably not what you want to hear, but this is my advice - skip this and buy yourself an ipod just like everyone else. There is a reason it is so popular!!

<Title>disappointed

<Content>A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous.

<Title>Great Features, But Huge Flaws
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features.  However, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn't ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word "unknown". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked!  It was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it's consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I've tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product?   If you're going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON'T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless!  I'd give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook.

<Title>The MP3 Player for the Rest of Us
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro is no iPod killer. It is the iPod for the rest of us. Where Apple's product is stylish and fun to use, it has that unfortunate Apple characteristic of locking users into buying their music strictly from Apple. iTunes is a fine online music store, but there are many others and some (MSN and Musicmatch for example) are as deep in selection and easy to use. And the Creative Zen Micro gives us a player every bit as intuitive and stylish as the Apple product and the benefit of FM radio, Outlook synchronization and the use of every online music store other than iTunes.   Everyone knows that the Micro comes in an array of colors. Mine is silver. I like the blue glow and the shiny white case that compliment the silver face. Personally I think the black model looks best, but I didn't buy the unit for the color. I've seen a number of reviews of the Micro from people having trouble with the vertical touch pad. After two adjustments, I had no issues with that controller at all. It is more intuitive than running your finger in a circle. The touch pad and menus it opens are user adjustable. I was having trouble getting the Micro cursor to stop where I wanted when scrolling though the menu lists. I adjusted the touchpad sensitivity setting to low but that didn't help. I adjusted it to high and the problem was solved. It may seem counterintuitive to select high sensitivity to better control the touchpad. If you're having touchpad issues, try the high setting and see for yourself.  The Micro comes in with good quality ear buds, a hard shell case that accepts adapters to help it serve as a belt clip or a desk stand. There is also a carrying pouch, a USB 2.0 cord, universal AC adapter, and the removable, rechargeable battery. Other accessories are available from Creative. I am not a big fan of ear buds, but these are pretty good and the cord doubles as the FM radio antenna. I selected Auto Search and the Micro found strong signals for all of its 32 presets. I live in an area with lots of FM radio, so performance in other areas may vary.   Volume on the Micro is controlled by the touchpad, not a separate button. Some folks prefer a separate wheel for volume. It is more important to me that the volume reaches acceptable levels and is EQ adjustable. Both are true on the Micro. There are a number of EQ presets and a limited ability to customize adjustments.   You can create playlists on the fly which is a great feature of the Micro missing in many other MP3 players. It is also possible to create playlists on your computer using either the included Creative software or Windows Mediaplayer 10. I like the interface in WMP 10 better than the Creative software and the Micro syncs with WMP 10 flawlessly.  The Micro has a microphone for recording voice notes. Speak normally into this mic or you will get distorted sound. At normal speaking volumes, the quality was fine. You might be tempted to shout to such a tiny device, but don't.   Creative says the battery will play for 12 hours. Early buyers of the Micro are receiving an extra battery in the package, which is a great bonus. I charged the extra battery and keep it in the pouch to be handy when needed. I've not run a battery test where I drain the unit dry, but I probably won't get 12 hours anyway, because I set the backlight for bit longer than the default. I was pleased to learn that the Micro charges either from the AC adapter or via the USB cable when it is plugged in for syncing. That is a nice touch.  My unit is full with just over 1000 songs, far short of the 2500 claimed for the 5GB drive. This is my fault. The 2500 claim is based on using only WMA format songs recorded at 64kbps. I have a mix of WMA and MP3 files and I usually encode at a much higher rate. This is another reason the Zen Micro is the player for me. The original iPod and other devices are just too big. I don't have anywhere near 10,000 songs to carry around. I am pleased for those folks who do, but drives that big would be a waste of space for me. The 5GB units provide just enough room for me to carry around my digital collection. As the number of songs I own grows, I can always compress them to fit better on the Micro or become more selective about which tunes get synched.   Creative has a winner in the Zen Micro. I really believe this is the music player for the rest of us and, with some marketing behind it, it can do for the other online music stores what the iPod did for its brother iTunes. Thank goodness for choice.

<Title>Owned it less than an hour
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The touch pad sucks, and sinks this product COMPLETELY. I am an enthusiastic owner of a 30 gig Zen Extra, and I WANTED to like this product. Ordered one through Amazon/Office Depot, and it arrived in 48 hours. I set aside an entire afternoon to play with it. Accidentally set the language first to German, then Japanese trying to select english. Trying to do initial setup with this thing is a NIGHTMARE due to the touch pad. I stopped after getting into english. How in the hell do they expect me to operate this thing on my hip while I am mowing the lawn or working out, or in my car, where I have to do it without looking? Thanks a lot Creative, you really screwed this up.

<Title>Down With IPOD!
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I hate Apples, and i bought a crappy mp3 last year cause i didnt want an ipod.  Man was that dumb, i could have just bought one of creatives mp3s and listened to good music.    I hate ipods, they are evil ugly stupid devices that cost a fortune, and are actually not that cool.  Those things are like ten pounds.  And the minis, are only like and inch smaller.  So i said, screw apples, and ipods.  Then looking at pcmagazine the other day, i saw the most beautiful mp3 player i have ever seen.  The zen micre 5 gb mp3 player.  It is so cool.  Does everything an ipod can plus more.  :  It has radio.  It glowsin the dark with that line that goes all around it.  It has an extra battery that lasts 12 hours, unlike stupid lame ipods.  It has more than one color, and theres a black one, whichis awesome.  It carries a two and a half thousand 2500 songs!  ( and Who the hell has 10,000 songs to listen to???)  If i had ten thousand songs, at a dollar a song, id just buy a huge cd player and keep it in my personal jet all day, while on my way to my secret school in Antarctica.  But reallyl, i dont even have a thousand songs, so why pay a fortune for crap you dont need if this is better, smarter, and cheaper, and cooler!?!?!?   I dont know, but i do know is that ipods are evil and ugly and expensive.

<Title>Nearly Perfect ... 
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased a Creative Zen Micro at a local retailer recently and it easily deserves a five star rating.  The sound quality is excellent (much better than several iPods I've listened to), the battery life has been impressive and the (mostly) intuitive interface has been fairly easy to master.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, my experience with the Creative software and the connections to my computers was pretty positive.  The software loaded quickly on both my work (HP laptop, docked in port replicator) and home (Dell laptop) computers and within a few minutes I was loading songs.  Surprisingly, the Zen was also recognized by Musicmatch, my primary program for managing music files, so I was able to load songs directly onto it from Musicmatch as well. I'm now at a little over 1,000 songs, the unit is nearly full, and I've got enough music to last me for months.    The only criticism of the Zen Micro - and it is a small one that I'm sure will be improved upon soon enough by Creative once the technology permits it - is that 5G is a little on the small side. 5G isn't quite enough room for someone with a fairly extensive music collection, although it should be plenty for lots of people. I'm sure in another year or so, when Creative offers a Zen Micro with a 10G hard drive, I'll be tempted to upgrade and find a new home for my 5G version.    For now, however, it has been an extremely impressive purchase.

<Title>Not Audible Ready with update now that it is
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Update:  As of 2005 sometime this player became Audible compatible as I'm sure someone else has already stated. Be aware that the Photo version of this player is still not compatible. I ordered the player and have had it for over a year and really like it. The sound is better than that on my friends' iPods and now that Napster has ironed out the bugs in their software, it's a great player for the subscription services. I use this all of the time and would give it at least four stars at this point. I only wish it had a slightly larger hard drive and I miss the digital clock screen that some other Creative players have.  Previous review: Okay, I don't even have mine yet but will be returning it as soon as it arrives (okay, technically Santa will be making the return even if she doesn't know it yet) as it is NOT AudibleReady. I don't know why they are offering the price discount for this player. I just didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.   Someone on Creative's website claims to have a method for converting the files several times to something that the player can play but I don't want to bother with that since there are other players that are AudibleReady. Audible isn't much help in resolving this as their customer support just refers you to their list of AudibleReady devices and the Zen Xtra is on it (you must download extra software to make it compatible).

<Title>Beware before you buy it if you are runners!!!!
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got mine in the mail today, very excited about it.  I did a lot of research before I bought this unit, but I don't know how I missed this one.  I just found out on the website that they don't recommend you to run with this unit since you can damage the HD.  That is actually my main purpose of buying something small, so I can run with it.  Now I am stuck with this unit.  IPOD, on the other hand, has skip protection for both regular IPOD and mini IPOD.  They advertised that you can jog with it with no fear.  Don't take me wrong, after doing a lot of research about it, Zen Micro has a lot more features than any others in the market.  But if I can't jog with it, why do I need a small player for?  Another thing, I accidently chose the wrong language since the touch pad is extremely sensitive.  Now I am stuck with Japanese language.  The manual says I have to hold the menu/back botton to change the language.  I got the menu to come up, but it's in japanese, so I don't know which menu would let me change the language.  So, I reloaded my firmware according to the tech support, but there is no firmware available to download on the website yet.  They will e-mail it to me, so far I haven't got it yet.  It hasn't been a great experience for me yet so far.

<Title>Less Than What I Expected
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had a Zen 20 GB player for a couple of years and have no complaints with it. I thought a smaller lighter player might be a bit nicer. The sound quality is excellent.   I use my player through a cassette adaptor in the car alot, and I noticed that the volume on the micro had to be turned up louder than the old Zen Player in order to obtain a good linear volume control on the car stereo. This sucked the battery down in about 3-4 hours.   The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. However, the touch pad was not well designed. It's much too sensitive, even on the lowest setting. The real problem is the distance your thumb has to travel on the pad to move just one line is so short, that it sometime seems impossible to hit the function or album you want to select. Very frustrating when you keep going up and down, hoping to land on the selection you want eventually. And by all means, don't tap the pad by accident, you'll be looking at a menu you don't want at the moment too!   Overall, I was disapointed with it, and sold it after 1 week. I gave it 3 stars, based solely on the sound quality. I'll stick with the thumb wheel on the old Zen.   If you want a Hard Drive Player, get a Zen Xtra 30GB player for about the same money. If you want it for workouts or jogging, then get a 1 GB Flash Drive player.

<Title>This thing rocks!
<Date>Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  That was before the Zen Micro came along.  I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.  This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  The battery life doesn't appear to be anywhere close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  The extra Gb is just a bonus.  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.

<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift last July, and I didn't start using it until last winter. However, within the past few months a significant problem has occured with the headphone jack and the sound quality is terrible now. Apparently this is a widespread problem with this player, and all you have to do is Google "headphone jack Creative Zen Micro" and find the Creative discussion board to read hundreds of complaints about this one problem. To make matters worse, their customer service is practically non-responsive. Do the smart thing and purchase a different MP3 player.

<Title>worst of the worst 
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wouldn't recommend the zen micro to anyone, even my worst enemy. I had read some of the negative reviews before purchasing the unit, but discounted all of the critisms upon reading many positive statements written here on this website.  However, I have now owned the zen micro for about a year, and just about every problem highlighted by other reviewers has come true.   Here is a partial list: 1) Hardly ever boots up cleanly 2) Stops in the middle of a track for a few minutes, then miraculously starts up again. This happens about every 15 minutes 3) Battery life (even at low volume is at most 3 hours)  Here's the thing: For the first month or so, everything worked great, then it went downhill from there. I have downloaded new firmware several times, I'm constantly rebooting the unit to try and get it to work, and sometimes it won't boot up at all. Basically it's a time consuming and never ending struggle. In addition, Creative have not been helpful in trying to resolve all the issues. Sure it sounds great, when it works, but do you really want all the hassle? I don't...I'm getting an ipod.

<Title>From a kid's perspective
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a green zen micro with my babysitting money in September 2005.I had done my research and was either going to purchase this or an Ipod mini. I made a mistake by purchasing the zen micro.  At first it was great. The sound quality was good as well as the headphones. Then after a while the sound quality got poorer and the headphones broke. After 3 or 4 months the headphone jack got messed up and you have to keep adjusting the headphones to get any sound at all. One time I dropped the player off of the counter and thought I broke it but my dad figured out how to fix it. What you do is you take out the battery and thump the back of the player a couple times and then put the battery back in and try to turn it back on. If it doesnt work the first time then keep trying and eventually it will. Here are the pros and cons  Pros-  good accessories- wall charger FM radio  Playlist function Voice recorder   5 GB storage-plenty for my collection   Cons- bad headphone jack poor sound quality after a few months battery life not as long as they say  Overall I would say go with another player because this one doesnt last very long. I will probably end up buying an Ipod nano because from the reviews I have read the problems I have had with the zen micro don't seem to happen to Ipods.

<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got this as an xmas gift, as i was looking for a step up from what i had originally, which was a very small 30 song player. I wasnt completley sure of the Zen, but, after owning it for many months, this is definitley the right choice of a mp3 player. Its worked perfectly, the only fault that has happened for me, is that i broke the USB cable. Pros: 1. Same price as an Ipod Nano, but, more than double the space 2. Great construction 3. FM Radio and Voice Recorder 4. Plenty of Space for Music 5. Rechargeable 6. Excellent firmware with player, Itunes compatible  Cons: 1. Battery life is shortened if backlight is left on 2. Some people have had problems with the headphone jack, So far i havent. 3. Out of Package Battery can only be recharged through Computer connection. Creative does sell a hookup with the player and a wall outlet, as well as car outlets sepratley. 4. All of your friends with Ipods will be jealous that you got a better player for less.

<Title>Too fragile for a portable device
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the features of my Zen micro. But the product is VERY fragile. I won't buy another Creative product in the future because of my bad experience with this product.  First, let me say that I bought the Zen Micro because I wanted a full-featured MP3 player, but I didn't want to pay for the "coolness" factor of the Ipod.  I liked that the Micro had a replaceable battery, and an FM radio (although the radio doesn't pull in a good signal most of the time).  But I am on my 4th replacement Zen Micro. The first time was because of the loose headphone jack problem. The second was because my 2 yr old son got hold of it and dropped it 12 inches onto a hardwood floor. The third time is because I dropped it about 2 feet onto a hard carpet floor while taking it out of my pocket. It not like I was throwing it around. It's a portable device; it's gonna get dropped! Creative should make these more sturdy!  Hopefully I can keep my 4th Micro without breaking for a while.  If you insist on buying the Zen Micro, here are my suggestions.  BE SURE YOU BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM THE STORE when you buy this product. The BestBuy 2 year warranty was worth the 50 bucks it cost me.  Keep the player in the case provided, It's bulky, and makes it hard to keep in a pocket, but will provide a level of protection.  DON'T use the belt clip. The clip essentially slides into the case but does not latch or lock or anything. The clip comes loose VERY easily from the case and will cause you to drop your player.  To prevent the headphone jack from breaking, I rolled a strip of paper into a tube, and slipped it around the space between the jack and the case. This prevented the headphone jack from moving and breaking the solder connections. Creative may have fixed the headphone jack soldering on new models, but I'm not taking the chance.  Buyer Beware!

<Content>Unlike those who've experienced technical problems with jacks and being fragile, my zen micro has flown off the tread mill more than once...in fact, I'm needing to replace the belt clip, which did break....the player did not.  It took me a bit to figure out the menus, and I don't love the way (I think) that the playlists have to be created on the computer and synced...so I suppose the software could be easier.  I personally use the record feature with the built in mic, so I can get a song idea from my head into a digital format very quickly - like we used to do with hand held tape recorders..but this is so much better.   I haven't used or had an ipod, so I can't compare, but I sure wouldn't like to have to use itunes....and this has been a great little player for me for about a year!  Just wish accessories were cheaper and replacement parts easier to find!

<Title>Zen micro - poorly designed
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has a decent audio quality, but it has a lot of fatal flaws: 1)	Its headset socket is extremely poorly designed. It does not go through the PCB, so the factory soldering cannot keep it in place. I have re-soldered it once already and within 2-3 months it is back to the same problem. 2)	The radio is useless. I live in the Chicago metropolitan area and I cannot get any of the radio stations I normally listen to. Even in the gym where their transmitters are close enough I the FM tuner does not pick up the signal. 3)	It is extremely slow when booting up and navigating is slow. 4)	The keypad is a pain too, even though the sensitivity could be adjusted. I would not recommend this player to anyone.

<Content>I love my Zen Micro.   The sound quality is great and it gets a great signal on FM radio.  My favorite thing about it is the fact that I can add and delete songs individually or as a group using Windows Explorer.  I don't even bother with the software that came with it.  I just drag and drop the songs I want to add.

<Title>Love this player
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I've had mine for about 7 months now and still love it. I really like it's small size so I normally carry it in a cheap cell-phone holder on my belt. No real problems with battery life at this stage (and I shouldn't have either). The face plate control was a little fiddly, but no interface is going to be perfect so you just get on with it.   I REALLY like the fact it has a radio, it was a big selling point to me as I listen to a lot of talk-radio during the day. I was leary of the iPod because of it's battery changing problem (you have to send it back to Apple). Don't know if it is the same deal with the Zen Micro, but I hope not. Only gripe is I have to charge it via the USB cable, there is no seperate power adapter (that I can see). I tried to charge it with a lap-top that did not have the Zen software installed, and it did not charge! Even when I left it overnight. I don't understand why it didn't charge. Having the software installed shouldn't make a difference...   For my birthday I ditched the little white ear-buds that came with it and splurged on a set of Shure E2c noise insulating ear buds. Man what a difference! They are not noise-cancelling, but work like an ear-plug, blocking out external noise.  [...] Highly recommended.  There are plenty of in-depth, technical reviews out there already, so I will not bother repeating them here. Two thumbs up!

<Title>Creative Products:  Truly poor technical quality
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After several attempts to own a functional Zen Micro, I give up.  It should not be this hard; iPod, here I come.  My first Zen Micro broke within three months of opening the box.  I returned it (a small but manageable hassle).  I received an entirely new one about two weeks later, no charge.  Two months later, had power management issues with the new one; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware.  OK, fine.  Three months later, the thing completely crashes -- no music, no connectivity to my PC, nothing but a permanent splash screen.  I tried the restore mode, but none of the restore functions were working.  The thing was dead dead dead.  I called Creative to see what they could do.  For $25, they could tell me what I already knew:  it wasn't working and needed to be fixed.  Then, they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it.  All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year (read: still within warranty) since I had received it.  Great customer service, eh?  Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company.  Don't buy a Creative Product.

<Title>Great player!
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player, this is my second Mp3 player, first one being the Creative Nomad2. Firmware upgrade is a MUST for Zen micro. It was very tough to 'create' cons for this player.   Con: I am sort of jealous that 'click wheel' belongs to Ipod, the touch pad of Zen Micro is very good, but since its a vertical bar pad, as your thumb reaches the end, you have to lift the thumb for further browing. so much work! but this is an excuse only for extremely lazy guys like me.  Pro:  1.Good Battery life 2.Good Music Quality 2.Drag-and-drop feature doesnt require any 'seamless integration with a software' 3.Compatible to Subscription music(i use Yahoo unlimited)  Other: with Flash-based players catching up to 5Gb capacity, this might soon vanish.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok, I have had my Creative Zen Micro for about 1 year. It is definitely far and away then the Ipod. First of all, its not an Ipod like everyone has, its something different. No ITUNES to use, Mediasource and Explorer are so simple to use(drag and drop). Battery life is great, I get at least 9+ hours on a charge. Holdability and colors are nice! Next, USB 2.0 kills Firewire point blank! Transferring data is quick and easy. You can also use the player as a Removable HARD DRIVE!! That isn't true on the Ipod. Lastly the FM radio, recording off of the radio, and outlook sync is cool. Other reviewers don't seem to be careful with their player! Also sensitive can be controlled in the system settings!  Apple is far behind this player in most respects. All they really have is  a marketing campaign! What person that uses an Ipod has a Mac computer. I would say 1 in 20 or ever more! Get a windows based player for a windows system!    Keys: -Price I got mine on sale at the time for $179! -No Apple to deal with Itunes -Removable Battery -Great Layout, Menus, Buttons -Customer Service- Easy to connect to creative on the phone. Very helpful. Getting a hold of Apple is like pulling teeth. -Plays Many formats mp3, wav, etc and great software too! -Firmware updates are easy  Downfall: -Earbuds are not great. I Recommend a pair of Sennheiser headphones highly. -Need to buy a skin or case if using heavily -Creative Doesn't market their products Thanks!

<Title>It was pretty Iffy.
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am 14, and I recieved a Zen Mirco for christmas of 2005. I was thrilled to own it, and even more thrilled to have matching speakers. I quickly uplaoded dozens and dozens of songs, just jamming to my music. I enjoyed being able to shuffle my music. My mom knew how badly I wanted an mp3 player with a touchpad. The Zen is a thousand times better then an iPod, if you ask me. I was in love, but about a week later, when we went out to watch the fireworks for New years, I had a hard drive failure. I wasn't able to turn it back on. Devestated, I sent it back. It look a little longer then they said it would, but I was thrilled when i finally got it back 1 1/2 monthes later.  I still had a problem, though. My Zen would not shut down. I chould charge it completely, turn it on, immeadiatly shut it back down, and it would say "shutting down" for hours, until it finally ran out of batteries. There was no way to turn it off without removing the battery. Soon enough, my dad realized why Iw as taking the battery out, re-did the ahrddrive and firmware, and now, it takes a few seconds to turn it off, that's it.  I highly reccommend this item, but be prepared. There could be a time when it needs to be sent away and fixed. If you are willing to work with a problem, this item is for you. I still love my zen, and I bring it with my everywhere.  Being able to create playlists is totally awesome. I have a playlsit devoted to just gentle music to relax me before bed, and I have another list with vibrant, loud music to dance to. You can create doezens of playlists, for any type of music you are craving at that moment.  The fact that it's all in alphabetical order and is catogorized bo genre, album, song title, and/or artist makes it even better.

<Title>Great Player!!!
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had mine for a couple of days.  I bought it without the firmware and documentation.  I had to download the firmware and try to figure out how to get the music on the player using Creative Media and after a few hours went back to using Windows Media.  I wanted my gentle music on one playlist and the other music on another and to randomly play each.  You have to have some kind of knowledge on how to do this, although once you figure it out it's not that hard to do.  If you have your music on your computer and just want to download it and play it randomly, you can do that with little or no knowledge.  It takes some playing around with the unit to figure out how to do playlists etc.  My advice is to not buy it without the firmware and documentation no matter what kind of bargain you think your getting. The unit has great sound and plays "play for sure" songs.  If you download music from Wal Mart or any other "play for sure" site this is the player for you.

<Title>A good buy with a few glitches. 
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I must say I love my mp3 player. It really is great. this zen is one of the best alternatives to the ipod. It has everything you'd ever need to just listen to music. Also, it is compatible with the subscription survices such as napster-to-go and rhapsody. Over-all its one of the best mp3 players on the market. But, it does have glitches which seem to fairly common. sometimes the player will just freeze up, some problems where your computer will simply stop reading it, and it also has a tendency to duplicate songs in the playlist because of licenses but it can be fixed by reformatting. (which erases everything) Overall it is a great mp3 player with a few minor glitches. I would still take it over most of the competitors.

<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sound quality is superb and the interface is comparable to the simplicity of the mini ipod.  With extra 1GB, FM radio and built-in mic, extra accesories (pouch bag, battery charger, and USB cable, and belt clip) make it superior in value.  The minuses are the battery life, which does not seem to live to the claim made by Creative, by a longshot.  I got lucky because my unit was a limted edition, which came w/ two batteries.  The FM signal reach is only good for strong signals.  The headphones' sound quality is above average but the earpiece is a bit too large.  All in all, it is a gret device.

<Title>Better than an IPod!
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for a week now and I'm incredibly pleased.  I looked at quite a few players and it came down to this or an ipod mini.  I finally chose the Zen because it just seemed like more bang for my buck.  With the Zen you get an extra 1GB of memory for music or removable storage, FM radio, radio/voice recording, organizer features, removable battery, and some nice small touches like alarm clock with autoplay.  Aesthetics: 4.5/5  I would have preferred a single color for both the body and faceplate (silver in my case) but that's just a small quibble.  Overall it's small and just plain cool looking.  Furthermore it's already survived a fall to a hard surface.  So I'll conditionally call it sturdy as well.  Accessories: 4.5/5  Came with an extra battery and belt clip.  It also comes with a stand that I have not used. I would prefer a case that covered the faceplate but the belt-clip is fine and there are 3rd party cases that will fit.  USB connector and power cord are included as is a fairly useless drawstring cloth bag.  Functionality 5/5  MP3 player with partionable hard drive for file storage. The FM tuner is excellent.  Recording radio or via microphone is easy and useful.  I haven't fully explored the organizer features yet but I imagine the ability to sync addresses and appointments with Outlook will come in handy.  Battery life is spec'ed as 12 hrs; I'm getting around 8 hrs of MP3 play.   Sound Quality 5/5  The sound quality on both mp3 playback and radio play is fantastic and better than the ipod.  Ease of Use 4/5  The Zen Micro is ultimately very easy to use but I'm taking an extra half point off here because of poor documentation.  The printed booklet provides only minimal information and the PDF instruction book is not much better.     The touch pad takes a little bit of practice and is not for the arthritic but ultimately is easy to use. Touchpad has adjustable sensitivity and can be turned off to avoid accidental activation.  Navigation is fairly intuitive but the player would benefit from a "home" button to get you out of nested menus a little faster.       A note on installation:  When I initially connected it to my laptop, the Zen micro froze.  It turns out it is finicky about which USB port it syncs with and I've noted that others have had similar problems with USB connectivity ports/cords.  Other than this single incident, I have not had technical problems with it.  Also note that there is a firmware upgrade available on the Creative site.    Overall, I'm incredibly happy with this device and recommend it to others interested in a mini player with more than just mp3 playback.

<Title>for my first mp3 player i really like it
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have never had an mp3 and everywhere i look i see an ipod or something similar.  I have read many reviews here and in magazines and what not and talked my wife into getting me the zen micro for the holidays.  My original reasoning was for the battery life as i have heard bad things about the products without a removable battery and also i wanted to have a FM radio as i like to listen to that on my morning commute.   So now after using it for 2 weeks I have to say i love it, but i gave it a 4 and not a 5 because i think it needs improvement.  I think the improvement it needs is with the FM tuner for some reason mine doesn't seem to work everywhere.  It only works in 1 room in my house but to be honest I have no need for the fm tuner when i have this thing with me.  As i previous stated i listened to the fm radio on my morning commute but when you have over 100 of your favorite cds(with plenty of room to spare) in the palm of your hands why bother with the radio.  At first i admit i didn't know how to use the touchpad and i even switched it to some kind of asian language but I was able to figure out how to get it back to english and then it took me about 2 more uses to get it down pat and now i consider myself a pro at it so I think if someone took the time they would figure it out and be shocked as i am that there are so many compalints about it.     Also, I have to say that the battery lasts me 4 days of my commute which is about 2 1/2 hours a day which comes to about 10-11 hours, they advertise 12, to be honest i got an extra battery with my zen micro so this is not an issue for me.    I think the software is also very easy to use too. It has help right in front of you if u need it and answers pretty much any question u have. I know i needed it when i first started but again i was able to figure out everything i needed.   Now about my complaint, overall i don't think of it as such an issue to deter someone from buying it but i would have liked for the radio to work better.  My cell phone has an fm radio and it definitely works better than this one, but then again i can't listen to almost all my cds from my cell phone, until that comes out i will be proud to have this.

<Title>My first mp3...
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is my first mp3, and I am quite pleased.  Even the packaging gave the impression that this gizmo was top-notch.  So, without further ado:  ***Pros...The presentation is very cool.  I still smile whenever the neon outline comes on.  *The sound is excellent, now that I've rcvd my Sony EX51LP ear buds, (Amazon, $25.49 w/ free shipping).  *The re-chargeable, re-placeable battery is definately the way to go.  *The thing is so tiny and light, I don't even bother with the belt clip.  I just put in in a pocket, and always hit the lock.  *I do some pretty rough hiking with it, and it never skips.  It's only "glitched" on me while tracking once or twice, and I'm not sure that that wasn't the fault of the download.  But damn, this thing sounds good.  ***Reservations...So far, the battery life is nowhere near 12 hours. (maybe seven?)  But, I did get two batteries.  *The touch pad absolutely requires a deft touch, and I do mean deft.  Folks with ham hands should definately keep looking.  *The printed manual is not a manual at all, and the virtual manual is sketchy at best.  I'm still trying to figure out how to do some basic player functions, and can't find them listed anywhere in the "manual".  *I don't care for the music management software.  I already have my cds recorded to hard drive with Roxio, and there's a great deal of confusion in the transfer of files to the Micro.  I may have only two or three cuts per album from several albums in a single folder titled under the artists name.  But the player won't download them as folders.  It downloads them as all of the individual albums, meaning that many albums on the player only have the two or three cuts.  Also, I have quite a few jazz compilations.  The player lists each individual artist, from each cut of each compilation.  This makes the "artist" category on the player totally unwieldy.  And almost none of the albums are listed under genre, making that category useless.  Now, all of this may just be my inexperience, but it's not all as easy as the p.r. says it is.   All in all, though, I am very satisfied with the Zen Micro.

<Title>Had Potential
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The following describes my horrible experience with the Zen Micro and may not necessarily be indicative of all.  The Zen Micro's battery life is advertised to last up to 12 hours, but I was only getting 7.5 after installing the latest firmware upgrade and properly conditioning the batteries. For testing purposes I used 128kbps MP3 files, volume level 8, no EQ setting, no backlighting, and the headphones that came with the product. Given these non-demanding settings, the battery performance was truly disappointing.   I really wanted to give it another chance so I got a new replacement within a few days. My second Zen Micro completely locked up as soon as the USB cable was plugged in. Since I hadn't return my original unit yet, I was able to try the other known working cable but got the same results. I was not even able to upgrade the firmware, let alone transfer music, because of the lockup problem.    I really wanted to like this MP3 player (great style, sound, build quality, features) but two defective products in a row is totally unacceptable. I should have been more suspicious about Creative products since my Muvo TX FM player was buggy as well (i.e. player would immediately shut down when powering on).    REVIEW UPDATE I recently got the Rio Carbon and am much happier. I was able to get 19.5 hours of power immediately after the initial charge and can get 21 hours at times. Although the battery isn't replaceable, it should last two years and much better players would be out by then anyway. Thinking back, even if I hadn't experienced all the technical problems, the Zen Micro wasn't really suitable to my needs in the first place. The Zen's interface isn't tactile friendly at all and can be inconvenient to use during exercising or driving. For example, it's impossible to skip tracks or adjust the volume by simply reaching into my pocket (or the car's center console) feeling for the appropriate flat button to push. It's not even recommended to jog with it anyway. I guess I was initially attracted to the Zen due to its sleek design and coolness factor, but good usability is more important.

<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disgusted with apple's terrible customer service, I vowed never to buy anything apple again and jumped at the micro. For a while it worked very well. Yes, it would often start "rebuilding the library" for no good reason. And it often seemed twitchy - but I was willing to overlook these flaws. In fact, I bought one for my girlfriend's birthday. BUT, that one had to be returned to creative after less than 2 weeks, when it just froze. It was still within the 90 day window when creative will fix it no questions asked - which was great. Fastforward a few months and now mine is broken too!! What gives?? Obviously mine is well past the 90 day window and even though its still within the 1 year warranty period, Creative wants money to fix it. Thats rich. Save yourself the headache. The quality control on this thing is terrible. When it works it works well. But more often than not its acting up.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>after a couple months of use, the head phone jack broke and I could hardly hear any sound, i sent it in for repair. i was happy again, but just for 2 months because the darn thing broke again, but my warrenty was alredy over. I need a new mp3 player. Not sure if this is a common problem or just with creative products. I didn't want apple ipod players, but I think I might switch to the other side. UPDATE: I found a website explaining how you can fix it by using a soldering iron. I have never used a soldering iron before, but i went out and bought one and fixed it. If I was able to fix mine, I'm pretty sure you can fix yours too. I'm a girl.  Update September 4, 2006: After fixing it with the soldering iron, the problem came back about a month later. i probably didn't fix it that well and the headphone jack thing became loose. Heck, I don't know. I don't care. I need a new mp3 player for my bus ride to school. For sure it's not going to be a creative product.

<Content>I am trying to be a loyal fan of the Zen Micro but it is getting increasingly difficult.  I am having the same problem with the head phone jack.  I sent my original purchase back because it was within its warranty but then the replacement product began having the same problem.  I don't know, I may have to go over to iPod just to get a working product.  I was really in love with the Zen Micro (when it worked) because the features were awesome.  I don't think I will buy another Creative product because a functioning product is not too much to ask. Just recently I purchased the Zen Micro Photo.  Itis a great looking product.  After reading more than a few reviews, I am certain the ear jack problem will not be an issue with this one.  Wish me luck.

<Content>this mp3 player is good but not great. i've been having a few problems with it. and i've only had it for less than a year.  - it scratches really really easily - the head phone jack broke so the sound quality is really bad - the earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears and they broke easily  but i do think this player is a lot better than ipods! a few of my friends have ipods and they've had lots of problems with them. i'm not really an ipod type of person. i've never really liked apple products. and the ipods are a rip-off. a 4GB ipod nano is $249 and a 8GB ZEN MicroPhoto is only $229. it's probably because the nano is so thin and stylish. but you can get so many more accesories with the ipod.   the Creative MediaSource is realy easy to use. it works great! very easy to download from the instalation cd too.   so for my new mp3 player i want the Sony Walkman Bean but the blue one of has 512MB. not enough for me. and i've heard some bad things about it too.  so i'm not sure which mp3 player to get next.  and if you do deside to buy this mp3 player than a totally recommend buying the TravelDock ZEN Micro as well. its pretty cool! and works great! but for some reason the FFW button on my remote doesnt work. oh well. i still love it.   hope this helps!

I was so happy when i got it. It takes only 3 hrs to charge, when the ipod mini takes 4(guess it doesn't really make a difference)       also, the zen micro comes w/ a USB cable, carring pouch, belt attatchment, and a 12 hr battery, and in the MP3 is a microphone, to record things.       I hv read most of the peoples reviews, and it sounds like theirs broke really quickly but i hv had it 4 almost 5 months, and mine is in perfect condition!      Finally, the ipod doesn't hv FM radio, if u like to listen to radio and even record it, u should get the creative ZEN micro.

<Title>It's no I-Pod...
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>But it is still a good device. With 5 Gig for space you can fill this thing up! It's very sensitive when you get it so you may have to adjust the Touch Pad like I did.  *Pros  -Cheaper than an I-Pod and holds more (for the price, that is) -Nice, modern look -Add songs and delete them easily -FM Radio (I don't use it so it's just extra) -12 hours of playtime -Displays song name, album title and singer name -Has an alarm that automatically turns on device (I can't turn it off! [Not the device but the alarm!])  *Cons  -Way too sensitive on default Touch Pad settings  I own one of these but there isn't much else I can say about it. Oh yeah, it glows blue!!! Sweet!

<Title>it was my lover...
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved my little creative zen micro. i did a crapload of research about a year ago and decided on a dark blue one. then, i was comparing it to the ipod mini.   pros: >so cute =] >on-the-go playlists [i loved this feature] >gorgeous blue backlight >great sound quality >the interface >removable battery [yess...] >radio [reception wasnt that great though, could just be where i live] >microsoft outlook >loads of other stuff  cons: >program was slowww... >no gamess...=[ >[see below]  and i dont think the touchpad is THAT sensitive. i got used to it just fine =] and   unfortunately, after a year, my little zen micro died. recently it had gotta slower & startecd freezing up more often. i would always restart it or take the battery out and rebooot it. it would always say "reloading library" and have a little bar showing the progress. except NOW it says reloading library and the bar doesnt move at ALL. and then the battery dies. so i recharge it and it starts all over again.   but for the year it was with me, it was the best little mp3 player someone could have. it completely outperformed the ipod mini [EVERYONE has one, i swear. or everyone did. now everyone has the nano.]  now i just dont know what to do. the warranty was over months ago but i still might call tech support.  im considering getting a new mp3 player, since im anti-ipod [dont argue with me] and one thats small. and under two hundred bucks. and AT LEAST one gig, even  though thats so many steps down from my 5 gig =[. any suggestions? or else im going to cave and spend three hundred dollars on the creative vision:m. even though im a bit pissed at creative right now.

<Title>Broke@4 months, Creative wants money
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never recommend the Zen Micro to anyone.  My 16 yr-old has had one since late 11/05.  By 4-months, we are now unable to turn on the unit, & the headphone plug is loose in the unit(headphones are designed for use w/mp3 players). Since purchase, we have now discovered that after 90 days, Creative Labs wants approx.$25 to test the unit. If it is within the 1-year warranty, they will replace/repair the unit, but will not do so without $25. If anyone reads this, please "DON'T BUY ONE!!!" We spend enough money on an mp3 player & should not have to spend money so soon after purchase for repair.

<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2622009-2464039">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Micro for a little over a week now, and I'm very happy with it so far.  It's much smaller than I expected.  It's about the size of my Motorola flip phone.  It fits well into the hand and has a nice solid feel to it.  So far, I have a little over 1100 songs on it, and I have about a gig and a half left.  I've been ripping my music at 128 WMA, so I expected to get less than that advertised 2500 songs.  The radio is pretty good.  The reception isn't stellar, but I get a pretty good signal from most of my favorite stations. I'm also very happy with the way it syncs to Outlook.  It froze up on me when I first charged it up, but I simply took out the battery and restarted it and it hasn't happened again since.  I've loaded the software (not bad, not great, but very usable), upgraded the firmware, and loaded over 1k songs and I haven't had any problems at all.  The touch sensitive interface takes about a half hour to get used to, but it's a piece of cake after that.  A few nits:  1) The earbuds really are huge.  I read that on a few other reviews and it's true.  I have to wedge them into my ear and they fall out as soon as I move my head.  I'll definitely be changing those.  2) The battery life has been less than expected.  I'm getting about 7 hours per charge.  I've read some reviews that state that you need to cycle through a few charges first, so I'm hoping it will improve.  It's still better than the iPod.  Overall, I'm very happy with this player.  It looks very cool and performs nicely.  I thought seriously about an iPod, but was sold on the extra gig, FM radio, sync to Outlook, and longer battery life.  I would highly recommend this player.

Reasons why 4 stars and not 5: 1)  software interface (iTunes still superior to anything else out there) 2)  accessories (new product and not as widespread as iPods, hence very few accessories available)

<Title>Totally awsome music player, with a few flaws..
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i got my Zen micro for an early Christmas present.  and i must say THIS THING IS AWSOME!!! it is so easy to download music into it, it also has a FM tuner so i can listen to my favorite Radio.  when i got it i was amazed at its size! i never knew it would be so small.  however, there are also a few flaws of the Zen Micro.  1.The Touch Pad-  i totally like the touch pad, it is fast to scroll down to my favorite music.  however, i did have a hard time getting used to it.  Everytime i would try to scroll down, it would press enter instead, it is a little bit confusing to use it.  however I got used to it, and now i am a pro at using the pad.  2.Users Guide- The first time i got it, i was looking the the guide on tips.  the guide accually does not have anything very useful, it only has the basics.  And the way they show you how to download music doesnt explain it very lucidly.  Everytime i would put it in the USB, it would say that i do not have the Hi-Speed USB Bus Controller.  so i thought that i could not download music into it. however, i was determined to find a way, so i did.  it was very very easy to download music in to it.  it also doesnt show you ANYTHING about using the Zen.  but it is, afterall, very easy to use.  3.Battery Charge- The first time i charged it overnight, i woke up and it automaticly turned on.  i tried to turn it off, but no matter how hard i tried to turn it off, it didnt turn off.  worried i kept on trying to trun it off, so at last i took out the battery and put it back it. it didnt change how it worked, everything was normal.  i still, to this day, cannot find out what happened.  Besides these Cons, the Zen micro is ultimatley an awsome music player.  My friend who owns a Dell DJ and another friend who owns a mini IPOD, wants my Zen.

<Title>awesome little thing
<Date>Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received mine 2 days ago and luckily mine came with an extra battery. Overall I am amazed with this thing. It is a great by has many features and looks cool.  Design-4 1/2- well this player looks sweet. The backlight is great and the edge light is awesome. One thing I don't like is the battery is hard to get to. This is why it got four and a half. Also amazing is the size. This thing is small. It is also light. Compared to my Zen 40GB xtra it is a feather.  Touch pad- 4 1/2- well this little thing is really interesting. It does take some time to get used to though. It is very nice and is fast. I recommend you keep it on medium sensitivity because I find it works best.  Sound quality- 5 - amazing   Radio- 4 - what can you expect? The radio is pretty nice quality. It has presets and auto scan which detects radio stations. Good news-no antenna cause the headphone string doubles as one, radio recording is the same quality as you hear. The bad- it is hard to find good reception sometimes.  Mic- 5- great no complaints  Ease of use- 6- yeah it is amazingly user accessible. it has customizable menus, auto dj, id3 tagging so it sorts by albums, artists and stuff, has search , sleep timer , wake timer, clock, calendar, and if you use Microsoft outlook it syncs up contacts, calendars, phone #s, email.  Stuff- 5- battery life is okay. Im averaging about ten hours per charge. Lucky for me I got a free extra battery. Also available is a remote.  Overall it is awesome players go and get one today

<Content>Creative has hit a home run with this player! I received my Micro(White) yesterday and I couldn't be happier. This tiny little wonder is great. It is my first mp3 player and I had it up and running in minutes. The vertical scroll bar hasn't been a problem for me at all. Creating playlists is a snap and adds to the versatility of the player. I used Windows Media Player 10 to transfer my music. It worked without any glitches. I highly recommend the Creative Zen Micro to anyone who wants a fantastic player that works as good as it looks.  By the way, Amazon had this to me in three days with free shipping! They totally back up what they sell, so go ahead  and get off the fence and join the mp3 revolution.

<Title>Should I kick myself ?
<Date>Sat Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A lot of 'iPod killer' nonsense has been written about the Zen Micro. As an iPod Mini owner should I be kicking myself? I don't think so and here's why:   1. I am a programmer and I bought such a product for both business and pleasure. And for business, I'm sorry to say, the Zen just won't cut it because of the stupid software required to use it as a hard disk. With the iPod it's just plug and play, no drivers or software needed. And I'm using USB 1!!!!!  2. Buying an MP3 player is as much an emotional, impulsive decision as it is a logical one. So yes the Zen Micro might be a bit cheaper, have a better battery system, more features, but it's not enough to sway me. After Creative announced it I was wondering if my purchase was foolish, I'm now relieved to say no. And to my eyes, the Mini looks nicer, it has a purity of design that the Micro lacks.  In conclusion, I'll still give the Micro 4 stars as by all accounts it's an excellent product. But, contrary to popular belief, it ain't no Mini killer either.

<Content>After the first day of using this player, I have to say that I am very happy with it. The sound quality on this thing is absolutely amazing, which when you think about it, is not too surprising Creative makes excellent sound cards. The device is a little touchy as far as the touchpad goes, but any accidental pushes can easily be avoided by putting the lock function on the device, no biggie. The organization and import software is very straight forward, it installed just great on my laptop, and with little difficulty on my relic of a desktop.

<Title>I Just Can't Get Over the TouchPad
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>What's not to love about the Zen Micro?  It's everything you could want in a player and more.  In addition to standard music features, you get FM, FM recording, Voice recorder, and synchronization with MS Outlook.  The accompanying software worked well, too.  Hardware-wise the 12-hr battery is magnificent and the player can also act as a removable disk to take computer files with you on the go.  Why am I returning mine?  I just can't get over the over-sensitive touchpad.  It is just unbearable.  I've given it a lot of chances too.  I've tried the low, medium, and high sensitivity settings.  I'm fairly skilled with handheld devices, I've used a Palm Pilot, Blackberry, and cell phones for years.  I've played video games my whole life and am handy with many controllers.  I develop computer software for a living.  I am a customer who REALLY wanted this to work out.  I've been shopping for a portable audio device for a year and this was THE one, loaded with all the features I wanted and more.  I've read other reviews where people write they eventually become comfortable with the touchpad.  For your sake, I hope you can.  I just can't stand the frustration.  Apparently Creative is aware of this, too.  They even place a special "quick tips" flyer in the box detailing how to use the touchpad if "you are new to the vertical touchpad."  It didn't solve my issues.  Sadly, now I've been spoiled and expect all these features in a player.  Now I may be sitting on the sidelines for a while until Creative or another vendor come out with another feature-filled player AND one with reasonable navigation.

<Title>My Precious!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yeah, it's a LoTR qoute, but what other phrase describes it? I've been experiencing my "Moment of Zen" since Mid-Oct. and haven't looked back to the days of making a whole CD to add ONE song. I can only write of what I have seen and heard...and sadly, others may have found out otherwise...but I've really enjoyed this awesome little music player. It's never skipped once, I take it everywhere 'cept work (But it would work there, jsut not allowed by management)...jogging, riding my bike, driving, to class (where the integrated and ADJUSTABLE flash drive emulator has become a staple of my existence), or jsut relaxing after a hard day of work (like I've had one of those, lol).   I found the space to be a little low (6 or 7 gigs would've been perfect 4 me, but the price was too high). It works so well with my PC and putting music on and organizing it is a snap! My favorite is the ability to build playlists on my compputer and copy them onto the device. It's not a new thing I know...to be able to do that...but having been used to waiting 5 to 7 seconds for my old CD player to load up the next song, this seems instantaneus (which makes the playlist seem more fluid-straight from one song to the next). Surely no one really deserves to go to any album from anywhere in under 2 seconds, but this will do jsut that!      I would gladly recomend this to anyone, and the touchpad (which took me-a total klutz- only a few hours to get used to) that lights up in the dark makes it look so cool!

<Title>superb player: better than iPod mini
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Creative Zen Micro almost an year ago. I did extensive research before buying this product and I'm glad I made a good decision. The other contender was iPod Mini 4 GB Some of the cool features I liked about this player are:  Vertical scroll pad: this make it very easy to navigate through a long list of albums, titles and artists. I have heard people saying that it is a difficult to use, but if you use it for 10-15 minutes, you won't have any trouble with it. it's pretty much like a touchpad on a laptop.  Power adaptor: though you can charge it through a USB cable just like iPod mini, a universal power adaptor is also included with Zen Micro. You can us it when you are on the go or do not want to leave your computer on, just to charge your player. for iPod mini, you have to buy the adaptor separately thus requiring more investment. Besides, the adaptor can be used almost anywhere in the world (110-240V, 50-60 Hz)  User interface: Zen Micro's UI is pretty much similar to iPod mini. You can browse thru artist, album, genre or song title  WMP 10 integration: This player works superbly with Windows Media Player 10. Use the Sync freature on WMP to transfer files between your PC and Zen Micro. You can also use WMA files and digitally protected tracks purchased from websites like real, walmart and napster.  More Space: Zen Micro 5 GB has more space has 1 GB more space than iPod mini giving you more MB/Dollar value  Integrated FM radio: Though I'm not a big FM fan, I use it in the gym where they have set up FM transmitters with their TVs. iPod mini doesn't have this feature. Infact, out of the numerous accessories available for iPod, none of them enables you to listen to radio.  External disk: I can use my Zen Micro as an external Hard drive to transfer files upto 4 GB. No need to buy an extra flash drive. No need to install any extra software on other computers to transfer files.  Long Battery life: my Zen Micro works for upto 14-16 hrs on a single charge. I usually charge it once a week.  Removable Battery: You can remove and replace the rechargable battery when it wears out. Mine was a limited edition Zen Micro, in which they included an extra battery at no extra cost. for iPod min, you have to send it back to apple for a replacement which costs twice as much as the replacement battery of Zen Micro.  One and perhaps the only drawback is very few accessories available for Zen Micro, but I got a silicon case and an armband for it. besides, it comes with a Universal power adaptor so you save money there.  My Experience: In last one year, I had only one trouble with my Zen Micro. The power switch stopped working properly and Creative replaced my unit for free including free to and fro shipping.   CONCLUSION: If you are a sheep and want to follow the crowd, go for an iPod, if not Zen Micro is for you. I really don't like Apple's philosphy of squeezing money out of people by restricting people to buy music only from iTunes store, by requiring people to send iPods back to apple for battery replacement and by not including essentials like power adaptor with the player, but selling it as as an accessory. Zen Micro on the other hand, gives more features for the same price and more flexibility with regards to software and music purchase.

<Content>I got this thing and I loved it.  However, its built very poor.  Yeah, its got alot more features than the iPod and it costs way less, but the thing falls apart.  I went to Creative's website and it turns out that ALOT of users are having problems.  The display ceases to function, the player freezes... and this is from 100% standard/official usage of the player.  Great features but its built at a trash can quality levels.  I was shocked actually.  Creative/E-Mu have never let me down.  I've been buying their soundcards since like 1997 and have never had a problem with them.  They need to implement the same standards of quality control across their entire product line.

<Title>Terrible product. Not tested thoroughly enough
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Within about 2 months of purchasing this product, whenever I tried to turn it on, the machine would freeze up. I contacted customer support and they suggested that I clean up the drive and then reboot. That worked for 1 day, and then it reverted back to having the same old problem. The unit was under 1 year old, however after conversing with their poor customer service department, I came to the sad conclusion that although parts are under the warranty, shipping and labor is not. It doesn't take a math genius to realize this device is better off in the circular file cabinet, which is where subsequently I tossed mine.

<Title>A good little player
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this player.  I've had no hardware problems with (the headphones are awful though.)  Software's a bit of a pain, but no worse than the software for other players.  My one complaint would be that the menu's can be a little hard to navigate.  There are some cool options like DJ, but to find the music you want you have to go through 3 or 4 menus.  The little slider bar doesn't work as well as the wheel on the ipod either.

<Title>Do not buy this player!!!
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This has to be the most frustrating purchase I have ever made!  This player functions properly for about a month then completely locks up and is not functional.  I call Creative, pay $25 for service, and send it in.  They send it back, working ... but soon it freezes again.  I am now on my 3rd time sending the player back to Creative.  I've asked for a refund, but it is not an option.  I HATE this player and am temped to just purchase a new one.  If I have to pay $25 each time I send it in, that'll cover the cost of a new player.  Again, do not purchase this product!!!

<Title>Good when you handle it carefully
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using my Creative Zen Micro for nine months.I have no word to complain about it's sound quality.. it's perfect. You can enjoy even the minute background sounds from small music instruments. Rechargeable battery still works good (Even more than the time specified) You can use it as a 5GB Flash Drive.. The software comes with this is really usefull.. Has an Organizer.  Only thing, you should handle it carefully.. you may damage the head phone jack holder (I used to put this in my jeans pocket on my walk.. I think it might have caused the holder to damage). If it happens, then you will loose your sound quality, even no sound sometimes and time to time you should adjust the jack to get a propper connection (it'd damage your holder further).... I have two more months left in my warranty period, so I'm going to send it for repair.  If it doesn't have this fault I'd give 5/5 for Zen Micro.. I don't know about other players.. my advise.. on your walk, don't put this player ( may be, any player) inside your jeans pocket.. use proper belt clips or holders. GOOD LUCK

<Title>Great Value, Great Player
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This really is a great little player.  A lot of people have complained about the touch pad, but I think they have failed to find the sensitivity setting.  Mine is set to medium and works very well.  I have had no problems and enjoy using the touchpad.   Other people have complained about Creative's management software, but if you've used Itunes or Explorer on your computer, this program is a no brainer.  Just import your files and then upload them to your micro.  Extremely easy.  You can also set-up playlists and edit your ID3 tags.  I have had no problems with the software.  However, I have noticed problems with stability.  When I first installed the battery, the system locked up and I had to hard reboot it by removing the battery.  I then uploaded a number of songs and used the micro pretty much all day.  I plugged it in to charge overnight and when I woke up it wouldn't turn on.  I had to remove the battery again to restart it.  This is the only problem I have experienced.  I will see if these were just isolated incidences over the next few weeks.  I've tried to use the FM Tuner.  It works, but its definately like any other radio where you need to find the correct position to get good reception.  Don't expect to use this to listen to the radio while working out.  I have never used an Ipod so I won't make any comparisons.  I do think that this is a great little player and a good value.  Its also visually pleasing.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first MP3 player so I might be a little biased, but I will try to give a fair review.  The first thing I noticed about the player is its size, which is great.  The second thing I thought was really cool about the Zen Micro was its blue glow around its edges and controls, which makes it easy to use in the dark.  Next, when I first used the player, I thought that the touch pad was a little too touchy, but when I lowered its sensitivity and upgraded its firmware, it was near perfect.  The next thing I realized was how great the quality of the sound on the Zen Micro was. I could hear things in songs that I have never heard before.  Finally, one small problem that I have realized with the Zen Micro was how it sometimes freezed whenever I tried to shut it down. This usually happened whenever I stopped it abruptly, so this is more of a problem that I have caused. Also, it sometimes happens whenever I detatch it from a computer or its charger.  Whenver it freezed, all I did was took out the removable battery, a great feature.  All in all the Zen Micro is a great Windows based MP3 player that has many great features and a few minor problems that do not take away from its experience.

<Title>Love the Zen Micro -- I wish it just didn't freeze up !
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got the Creative Zen Micro for Christmas. I was looking around at the MP3 players and narrowed it down to basically the iPod Mini or the Zen Micro. I don't like the colors for the iPod. For the Zen Micro, I loved the colors, design, size, -- everything! But within a matter of an hour after downloading the software, that's when this started to go completely down hill.  My computer didn't reconize that it was plugged into the computer. I checked the USB port and everything and then all of a sudden it finally reconized it was there. I figured it was probably just a loose connection or somthing so I went on download my music on to it and setting everything up.   Everything was going smoothly and then after about 2 hours, it just frooze in the middle of a song. So, i took the battery out and expected for it to just go on. Just a little glitch or something. Of course not -- it completely froze after putting the battery back in and it just got worse and worse. I couldn't even get through turning it on without it freezing.   So, back to Amazon it goes. I'll try to get another one and give Creative another try, but my hopes are going to be up this time around.  Just a thought -- but I've been reading alot of the negative comments from people who have bought this product from Amazon and have gotten a "dud". Do you think there was just a bunch of "duds" sent to Amazon?

<Title>disappointed
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received my player from amazon on 12/24. I was looking forward to loading the music and starting to enjoy it. I spent 3 hours the first day. I started the 2nd day with problems-it kept locking up while trying to rip the cd to device. I called support 1st time-recording giving hours operation and then cut off. Called back zeroed out to operator who got me help. I then spent an hour with support and had to download a firmware upgrade. Device still locks up and I am forced to take the battery out while holding the "On" button to clear memory and reboot. Another lost hour trying to get the device to be recognized by the program. I cannot believe that they sent it out without the latest software upgrade and that its this difficult to get it to work properly. I should have gone with the IPOD. Shame because it comes with the FM built in and great sound. I want my money back and I wish I could get my time back.

<Title>Ipod Owner - Considering this player
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have a 2-year old Ipod and was pleased running it on a Windows XP  PC until about 1 month ago.  Ipod requires you to use their software (I Tunes) to transfer music to your Ipod and they have recently updated their service. My Ipod has not worked since their update.  If you look at their "discussion" pages - There are plenty of us PC users who are using are Ipods as paperweights.  I am considering just calling it a day and purchasing this player which seems like it is more compatible for PC users.  Apple support is TERRIBLE - you are allowed one free call to their support team - that's it.  Apple's response is that Windows XP (Service Pack 2) users probably will need to buy new computer cards to get their Ipods to work - yeah thanks Apple - I should spend yet another $50 for your Ipod.

<Title>I love it
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.  Why?  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.  I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player-- Be sure to UPGRADE FIRMWARE.
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Several reviewers have written comments about the sensitivity of the touchscreen on the Zen Micro, and I had the same feelings about it when I first used the player.  Then I read on either Gizmodo or Engadget about a firmware upgrade that addresses this issue. It is available on the Creative website, under "Support". This firmware upgrade (version 1.01.03)also helps with battery life when you plug the charger into the wall before you connect it to the player. Of course it would be nice if the player came preloaded with the best firmware, but at least Creative was quick in getting this update out, and it was very easy to download and install.   If you still have trouble with the touchpad after upgrading the firmware, try changing the touchpad sensitivity setting to low instead of medium (or try high...some people have said that they've had luck changing it to high, oddly enough)  I bought the Zen Micro for my wife, but then ended up "borrowing" it so much she bought one for me! Both of our's came with two batteries, which was a nice bonus, but I'm not sure if all of the packages that Amazon sells will be the "limited edition" ones that come with an extra battery.  UPDATE: Creative just added yet another firmware upgrade. This one adds Microsoft "PlaysForSure" support, which will be useful for subscription services like Napster, where instead of buying individual songs or albums, you pay a monthly fee in exchange for access to 700,000 songs. These services have previously been limited to the computer, but now with Microsoft's DRM (digital rights management) software, you'll actually be able to sync those songs onto your player and tote them along with you, so long as you continue to subscribe to the service. (I'm still not won over by this idea, which feels like just another way to cut a hole in my pockets so I drip money month after month, but if you are REALLY into music, and if the price is right, then it could be a very cool feature.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this player.

<Title>Better than iPod Mini by a landslide
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Firstly, when creative chose the name of "micro" for this player, they really did mean it.  This zen is EXTREMELY small.  Keep in mind, it holds more music or files than the iPod Mini by one G.  If you are concerned with the touch pad, do not worry, although a little touchy out of the box, sensitivity settings are easily accessible.  I was mastering high speed scrolling in about two hours, stopping right on what i wanted.  In adition to great styling and size, the software that comes with Micro is very easy to use.  After a simple installation, i had 400+ songs on it in about two hours.  In adition to being small, easy to use, and BEAUTIFUL, Micro has a supposed battery life of 12 hours, four less than the iPod.  And one of the greatest things about it, an EASILY removable battery, unlike iPod's.  You wont have to send this back and pay 90 dollars.  This player is well worth the $$$.

<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zen Micro for about four months and I love it! It has all of the features the ipod has plus more! You can listen to radio and do all kinds of other stuff. Also, it's so small and light!!!! I can fit it in my pocket!! It has great sound, it's simple to use, and the backlight is great! The battery life is not an issue and works for a very long time. One of the best features that the ipod does NOT have is the replaceable battery. If you have an ipod, and your battery dies, you have to send the whole thing back! If your zen micro battery dies or stops working,(mine still works perfectly) you can just simply replace the battery. It even comes with two batteries. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

<Title>nice mp3 player for the non-sheep in the world....
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK. If you want to have what everyone else has, buy an Ipod. They work just fine. However, if you want a user replaceable battery, a voice recorder, an fm radio....get a zen micro. Also, with the Zen you can utilize multiple download services (Yahoo, Napster, Real, etc.) You are not restricted to Itunes. The player works great, I really like the slider controls. I think if you have a laptop with a touchpad like I do, it's no transition at all. Those who have not used a touchpad may have a learning curve (once you set the pressure to the level that works best for you). Transferring music is not quite as easy as with an Ipod; it helps to have some computer skills. I junked the included software and use Audiograbber (FREE) to rip my cd's and purchased Notmad to transfer to the Zen. It works great. I highly recommend extended warranties on the Zen Micro (and any other mp3 player) because you are dealing with sensitive electronics which can give out without warning. Mine is nearly a year old and I have had no problems, but I baby it, use a Vaja case, right angle headphone jack. To summarize: it beats the Ipod if you have a little computer knowledge and you can use lots of different music sources.

<Title>Zen Micro Is Good When It Works
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a 2004 Christmas present.  I bought it because of the features and capacity it offered, and it had a good keypad design.  Initially the player worked fine and we were happy with the purchase, but by the summer of 2005 the left channel cut out so that music only came through the right channel.  I sent it back to Creative Labs and they sent me a new one in September.  Four months later the hard drive failed in the replacement unit, and now that it has been more than a year since the first unit was purchased, Creative Labs will not replace it unless I pay them $122 (a new one costs $180).  Rather than do that, I spent $135 for a Cowon iAudio G3 since it uses a Flash Drive and has no moving parts.  Hopefully the Cowon will be more dependable.

<Content>Zen Micro is a neat player with nice features. Problem is if you do have a problem you are sunk. E-mail support has a single canned response to wipe your disk, load new firmware and try again. I got the same response for my Zen when it was freezing up (solved the problem), when the battery would not charge, for a bad USB cable, for error message on player with licensing error (for properly licensed music). Support is terrible and the player is failure prone.

<Title>Love my Zen
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my 5MB Zen Micro for over 6 months and haven't had any real problems with it. I got different earbud phones from Sony that are more comfy, as the ones that come with this unit are too big for my ears (although I do think they sound good). The accompanying software is easy to use, although I've had some kinks to work through with my music downloading service.  The greatest part of having this unit for me is that I can subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited, which is only $6.99 a month to download whatever I want into my Zen Micro (I gave up on the free music programs since so many albums now can't be copied). This is where I've had some problems with the Creative Mediasource Organizer. Sometimes I transfer my Yahoo music into the device and the Organizer doesn't recognize it's there, even though it actually is. I guess it's a kink between the two software programs. But it's worth working through to avoid paying iTunes a buck a pop for songs, as is needed for iPod.  Of course, another nice thing is having the FM tuner included in the device rather than needing a special attachment. I also recently began syncing my Outlook items (Calendar, Contacts, Tasks) into my Zen Micro, making it a nice alternative to a PDA for these basic functions.  Overall the Zen Micro is a great little MP3 player with an attractive price.

<Title>SO much better than an ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After much consideration and research, I decided to buy this mp3 player instead of an ipod mini.  I've now had it since christmas, and I LOVE it!  The bonus points I've found so far (that so far I haven't found in my friends ipods and other mp3 players): you can use multiple computers and music libraries without any problems; you don't have to keep the music on your computer (I have absolutly no music on my home computer!);and you can make playlists right from the player, no computer needed.  The bad points I've found so far have really nothing to do with the player itself.  I'm not sure if it's the software that came with the player or just the computers, but sometimes when I plug in the player, the mediasource says my player isn't connected.  It will still charge, I just can't add any music.  And the only other problem is that it's hard to find any accesories.  The market is so ipod driven, that's all anyone carries.  So, if you're trying to decide what type of player to purchase, I definitly recommend the Creative Zen Micro.

<Title>Excellent performance for a Good price...
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I purchased an Mp3 player, I did my reviews on them and made sure I bought the best.  This one came out on top.  The other Zen's were better than this but they all held about 30,000 songs and I don't even know if I'd heard that many songs in my lifetime, so I stuck with my best choice.  Zen Micro holds 2500 songs (based on 4000 kb for each song) and delivers mind blowing crystal clear sound quality.  I listen to underground metal, and those bands can't usually afford top of the line producing equipment, but this device makes all their music sound crystal clear.  Along with top quality sound, the Micro has preset equalizers for different types of music and has a customizable equalizer for your preferred preferences.  The touch pad is also quite easy to use, but at the same time it is also........highly reactive to touch.  But no worries, the Micro has settings that enable you to adjust how much it reacts to the touch of your finger.  The screen isn't color, but when browsing through menus, it provides a bright light up screen and easy to read menu headings.  One problem though, this was probably my own fault, is that it breaks easily.  I dropped mine about 5 feet from the ground onto hard carpet and it broke.  Of course mine didn't have a case, but still.    Overall, the best PRO of this item is the superior sound quality, and be careful, because these headphones provided are loud as hell when turned up full blast.  The only CON is....well, nothing.  So with that said, GET THIS ITEM NOW!  John

<Title>Great little gadget
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After spending a month researching the various devices, I settled on the Zen Micro.  I've had it for about two weeks and love it.  I've got about 1100 songs on it so far (at 128/kbps MP3 or better, ranging from 1:30 Ramones songs to full-length  operas) and still have 1.2 GB left, which is exactly what I wanted.  The battery life is solid, and mine came with an extra battery as well, making it an even better deal.  As almost everyone here has noted, the sound quality it puts out is the best on the market- 98 dB signal/noise ratio as compared to Apple's 90- and investing in a pair of Koss Plugs or Sony EX-71SL's makes the experience great.  The curved back makes it fit very comfortably in a pants pocket as well.  As to the problems some others have noted, here's my experience on the matter:  - Touchpad sensitivity: Set it to high and it isn't a problem. This is certainly counterintuitive, but it's easy enough to do and solves any problems.  However, I'm also inclined to believe that maybe some of the people having problems with this have shaky hands or fat fingers; I've had no problems with this even on the factory default setting.  - Freezes: It has a hard drive, it freezes on occassion.  Popping out the battery fixes it.  New firmware probably fixes this, but I haven't gotten around to upgrading the firmware yet.  - Headphones: Lots of people have complained about their size.  They're right, they're sort of huge.  They won't provide a seal around the ear or dynamic bass.  That being said, despite having two pricey pairs I find myself using the stock ones frequently because they do allow me to hear things going on around me, which I find more useful when I'm trying to dart through traffic on my way to class than booming bass.  Those are all fairly minor issues in my opinion, and easily outweighed by the extras of the FM tuner, built-in microphone, user-replaceable batteries and extra 1 GB of storage to other microdrive models.  Overall, I've been extremely impressed with this model and would strongly recommend it to anyone considering a mid-capacity MP3 player.

<Title>Super iPod alternative
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Seeing iPod's and iPod mini's everywhere I looked, and not wanting to appear too much like everyone else, I love the fact that Creative came up with a player that matches or beats the iPod at its own game, and stands out from the crowd.  That said, this player does not need any contrast to be appreciated.  Tons of capacity, great looks, good, compact size, FM tuner, great sound reproduction  and the freedom to buy/download music from anywhere make this a really good investment.  My only negative experiences are a) battery life is not as good as advertized, b) accesories are as rare as hens teeth (good luck finding a carry case or pocuh - as far as I can tell, Creative does not even make one).  Overall, great player, 5 stars when the battery life lives up to expectations and case logic or belkin or someone comes up with some custom built accessories.

<Content>This is a great product and after doing a lot of research on the verious mp3 players i decided to buy it.  I recieved it a few days ago and i couldn't be more happy with it.  I was hesitant about buying it at first because of some of the negative reviews, but i'm glad i went ahead an purchased it.  The sound quality is superb and offers crystal clear sound and also looks very snazzy in the dark.  The Headphones it comes with are also quite decent.  The voice recorder works really well, but the quality is pretty fuzzy.  Also the replaceable battery is very nice!  After reading some of the negative statements about the touchpad i was afraid i would hate it.  However, i love the touchpad on the zen micro and it's easy to use.  The only negative aspects of the zen micro are the lack of a dedicated volume button and the reception on the FM radio.  These are just minor things though and i highly recommend the zen micro to anyone who is looking for small compact mp3 player that offers superb style and audio quality.

<Title>The best IPod alternative
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since the Ipods came along, I always wanted one just because everyone else was getting one. I loved the look, and the hype of it, it was amazing to me at that time.  Thanks god I didn't get one. The battery of the Ipod, once it dies, you have to pay money to replace the battery and it costs just the same as if you were buying a totally new Ipod all over again so that was the main factor why I didn/t get one.  Now that the Micro came along, i wanted it to give it a try and I did. I'm telling you guys, there is no comparison to how I feel about this mini Player. Its the best MP3 Player i've seen. The user interface its good, battery life, audio quality EVERYTHING. I love the FM Tuner, just in case I get bored of my music collection. The Sensitive path its a headache the first day you get it, but by putting in in LOW and in 2 days I was the master of this baby.  I recomend you all to buy it, MUCH BETTER THAN AN IPOD!!!

<Title>Better than ANY player
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best player I have ever had, having used the Mini too. The vertical touch pad is extremely easy to use, I cant believe some people are having trouble with it. I learned within 5 minutes of using it! It is better than a wheel. Smaller, better sound, more color variety, more space, it is just better in evert aspect. And if you order soon like I did, you get an extra free battery! The package also includes more things that you can really use, like a belt clip, stand, and pouch to protect it against scratches. And the blue light it gives out while charging just takes your breath away. This is truely value for the money.

<Title>Love the device
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago. This proprietory software to download. (That was a major turn off). I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. and supply those stupid white Headphones. I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. Let's face it. Apple is Apple. So Creative should be "Creative".

<Title>Wow! Much better than iPod mini!!
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the much coveted iPod mini for Christmas, but could not get it to work on my PC which run a 5 year old ME OS--yes the fine print on the box did indicate that it was incompatible. Short of an  expensive and possibly unsuccessful set of soft and hardware updates, I was out of luck! I ordered the Zen Micro and have had it now for 2 days. It is beautiful!! I am not a computer whiz, but I was up and running with only a few minor problems after about 4 hours. I have ripped my CDs onto it, bought and imported music from msn music, listened to the radio, recorded from the radio, etc. (the FM tuner and the recording mechanism, by the way is a great great feature, and missing on iPod mini). This is definitely a life-changing event--no more hunting for the cd, dusting it off, getting it in the stereo, taking it out, putting it way (or not).  Now we need more accessories for this gizmo, and we will be set. The apple is not the only choice! Give this little guy a chance!

<Title>Can't run with out it
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an awesome unit.  I had a pink one reserved, but couldn't wait till late November for release so changed and pre ordered the silver for it's first release date.  I did much research and had come close to purchasing the i-pod mini.  My Zen Micro beats it hands down.  The replaceable battery was one of the biggest draws for me.  To my surprise my silver zen mircro box said limited edition and came with an additional battery.  The head phones have great sound, but did not last long and I will replace, foam covers came off, and now one has fallen apart.  Touch pad is sensitive, but can be modified by switching sensitivity to high.  Would love a remote control for it, I'm not sure if one if available.  Software is great for transferring.  Like other MP3 players I have had, book that comes with is worthless and you have to figure out stuff for yourself - web site help was great.  If you like to run like I do, you have got to have it.

<Title>If only...
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is definately an iPod mini killer.  25% more storage, FM tuner, microphone, radio recording, and personally i like the look of the zen better.  I would give it a five but there is one MAJOR flaw.  The program bundled with the zen is very, VERY hard to use.  I do not understand half of the functions in the program.  Ripping cds into the player is a big pain in the but because half of the cds i have (i own aout 92 cds) wont even rip all the way, the program rips all of them fine except the last song (i.e. Hoobastank The Reason, Korn Untouchables, Blink-182 Enemia of the State, amongst many other cds).  This is very vey annoying.  If anyone knows of another program that can put music on the zen micro, a referal would be nice.  Also, I've tried putting music that i've ripped with iTunes onto it but the artist and album names are reversed.  Except for the program i would give the Zen Micro a 5.

<Title>nice player
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I puschased the Zen micro about a month ago, despite many negative reviews, and am glad I did. I've only had it freeze up on me once and this was easily fixed. The battery life seems to have been a little exagerated at 12hrs. I've run it dry at about six(with the backlight off and the contrast set to 20%). I hear there is a firmware upgrade that may help this out as well as some sensitivity issues others have complained about with the touchpad. I personally don't have any problem scrolling or selecting. My micro came with a remote. This is pretty handy for adjusting volume and skipping tracks when the micro is burried in a pocket or bag. Perfect for cycling. I've dropped my micro from about a meter onto a tiled floor and it hasn't seemed to have been effected. I dropped it yet again from a shorter height and still no problems. The earbuds aren't very good, I'd recomend something a little better. Mine is an international model. This is a big plus because the ac adapter can be used in many countries. It is good from 100V-240V. All that you need is an adapter for the actual shape of the outlet, and these are pretty cheap. No need for a step down transformer. The sound is great. The smart volume feature is really important for me. It automatically adjusts the volume of individual tracks so you don't have to fiddle with the volume when the player gets to a track that's louder than the others. I've got about a 1000 songs loaded up and everything is going smoothly. I recommend this product.

<Title>iPod for Window Users
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off if you are a Windows user and want an iPod like I did but were scared that it being Apple would be cause for concern, then by all means get the Zen Micro. I was worried that if I got an iPod somehow it wouldn't work right if I didn't have an Apple or iTunes. So with that in the back of my mind I went with the Creative Zen Micro. It does all that an iPod can do but it is just better equipped to handle Windows. I got the white one and it is very clean and sleek. The outer casing is white so everything is the same color. If you get a black or another color the casing will still be white. So I bet you are reading this to know what I don't like about so here it is:  -The instructions on how to actually use the Zen are lacking. It is basically figure it out on your own. Now the software is easy enough, but I had the hardest time trying to make playlists.  -The earphones are a little big. If you have small ears they definately will not fit. I always thought I had big ears until I put the earphones in. They barely stay in.  Those are the only complaints. The sound is great. The size is great. (about the size of a flip phone) And it comes with bonus stuff like extra battery, stand, charger, carrying case, belt clip. If you want an iPod but are worried about it being an Apple, get the Zen, no questions.

Do-over permitted Creative, because of your design, feature advances, and demonstrated sonic abilities.  But try to keep version 2.0 off the market until you include tested hard drives.

<Title>Absolutely Superb - Lightyears beyond the others
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently bought a Zen Micro mp3 player, being uneasy about not going for an iPod instead.  However, I could tell the minute I got it that it was the right choice.  There is nothing bad about it.  Many complain that the vertival touch pad is not easy to get used to.  No way.  It is completely natural.  It surpasses the iPod in every dimmension.  It's 12 hour battery life is not a lie.  The curved fit and blue glow is a nice effect.  It is also packed with a multitude of very hand features, such as its ability to sync with Outlook.  There are not many accessories because they are either all buit in or still to be put to market, such as its wireless headphones.  The Creative Zen Micro is the new iPod plus much more. It is smaller, holds more, has more features, has an acutal 12 hour battery life, and is compatable with non-apple software.

<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, i got my zen micro as a xmas present. i was waiting to have one. tons of my friends had mini ipods, but i didn't want to be like every one else, so i wanted to get a zen micro. So here's my list of pros and cons:  Pros:  - its small and can fit in my pocket, but remember to lock it :) - its easy to download music from the internet and from ur cds - great sound! its awesome - i love that u can c it in the dark, cause it lights up blue - FM radio is good..i can get all my channels to come in perfectly - u can pick out whatever color u want (ipod has fewer color choices)  Cons: - make sure u set the senstivity to low..its a bit hard to scroll and click on what u want with the higher senstivities - the included earphones aren't wonderful, mine crapped our on me 3 weeks later - battery life is okay, it CAN last a long time, but im jus always scaried its gonna go out on me (only takes 3 hours to charge) - its challenging to set up a playlist, but i finally got it  All in all, its a great product and im happy to support a Bay Area company. If you buy one u'll probably love it. The best part is while it recharges the lights go in and out so it looks like its breathing or something.

<Title>wait a few months for Creative to straighten out the bugs
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>* An update to my review: I ended up exchanging my Micro when, after one month of use, the headphone jack quit working, rendering it completely useless. And I never did get Outlook to synch with it. So we'll see if the second one holds up better than the first, but if it doesn't, I'm opting for the iPod. *sigh*   The Micro is beautiful, it's intuitive to use, and it fills me with happiness every time I use it. I love gadgets, I love things that glow blue, and I love being able to carry more music that I could possibly listen to in a week.  The battery lasts so long and recharges when I attached it to the USB port on my computer to tranfer music, I've never had to charge it yet. And I've partitioned 512MG as a removable hard drive that I can use everywhere. I am enraptured with this thing.  However, even the best relationship has its problems. These problems are pretty large, forgiven only because I'm so utterly charmed; it's exactly like having a new lover whose flaws you see as cute rather than irritating.  Out of the box, it didn't work. The touchpad didn't respond at all. Based on reviews I had read here, I went to the Creative website and downloaded firmware updates and that fixed the problem, but it was not an auspicious beginning. Then I had trouble getting the Media Explorer software to recognize the Micro. Download more firmware updates. I still haven't gotten the Calendar to synch with Outlook (which was a feature that swayed me to the Micro over the iPod mini) and I'm trading emails with the Creative tech support folks.   Basically the firmware is not what it should be, and if you're not willing to sort out the bugs yourself, I suggest you wait to buy the next generation of Micro, once Creative has a chance to sort this stuff out.  One other tiny thing: the earbuds are unacceptable to me. I immediately replaced them with Philips HS461 Lightweight Ear-Clip Headphones, which aren't perfect, but they're WAY WAY WAY better than the earbuds included with the Micro.  So charming. So much potential. It has it's problems, but I bet I can fix it. Yes, I have a codependent relationship with my Micro.

<Title>Clearly in front of the pack......
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned my black micro since Dec 23 and can honestly report a very satisfied experience using it.  OK--I'll go ahead and say it.....Apples use of DRM to lock its environment into I-tunes makes me run away as fast as I can.  But the fact that the micro is platform independent (although there is WMP-10 recognition) is only one of many reasons this is the best 5 gig hd player out there.  The integrated voice recorder, outlook interface and removable hd all work flawlessly.  Creatives software is a bit clunky but Zen explorer is really all anyone needs to import or manage files.....and it works great.  Yes, the totally touch sensitive face takes a bit of adjustment.  Yes, the pulsating blue facia line is beyond cool (and it puts out quite a bit of light in the dark). Yes, the headphones are junk.  But this product performs so well on so many levels its hard to criticize.  In my judgement the players output could be slightly more powerful and less bright in sound character....but with EQ is fine.  Great Job Creative.....now how about a 20 and 30 Gig model!

<Title>Not bad!
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to carrying around my CD collection all the time.  As a student, backpack space is necessary and shouldn't be wasted.    I bought the 5gb version in silver at the local Walmart, and I have no issues with the player, except that I had to buy a longer USB 2.0 cable so the player wouldn't have to sit on the top of the hard drive while docked.  I have an old computer though, and it's incredible that it actually worked on my system despite the requirements.  I am running under a 300mHz Pentium MMX processor which I've been working on for a few years.  The software works seamlessly with my PC, even better than WMP 10, which would corrupt my mp3s and wmas.  I do think ripping is kind of slow, but otherwise it's better than what I'm used to: burning CDs.   Quality's not compromised - I've had better luck encoding my ripped CDs at a lower bitrate.  I conducted an experiment based on quality by encoding the same song twice - one at 320kbps and the other at 64.  I had the song already encoded at default - 128.  I listened to them repeatedly and tested different EQs. I found the best sound with 112 kbps for that song, and it ended up working with other songs as well.    The earphones don't bother me; I've had issues with CD players losing their headphone connectivity after a while and I'd like to say that it has to do with putting pressure on that area.  Generally if you put the jack in gently you'd be okay.  The quality's pretty good and I'd probably invest in some high-end phones later on, but I like the versatility of earbuds.  Mine don't fall out at random.  Sometimes they feel like they do, but they don't fall out.  I guess it's a comfort issue since I prefer the ones that secure around the ear.  It is a fragile player, but the ipod also feels that way (possibly from worry).  I've had excellent experiences with leather cases for cellphones and bought a PHILIPS case for the player (Walmart standard).  It fits perfectly and adds grip to it.  It also keeps the player scratch-free.  A friend of mine likes to put plastic wrap around her mp3 player, and it's a cheap alternative, but I think a case is better.  I found the touch pad easy to navigate on medium.  There is one rule of thumb with the touchpad (and the player) in general: BE GENTLE.  VERY GENTLE.  If you do that, it works seamlessly.  I found it best NOT TO mess with the EQ if you have a huge variety of genres since the player doesn't let you assign different EQ settings to different genres.  I found that disco EQ works best, if you like deep technotronica music, industrial, or metal though since that's most of what I own.  Battery life also is extended if you turn the backlight off during the day when you can see the screen without help and generally not messing with the player too much since exploring databases and skipping tracks uses more power.  Yesterday I got 7 hours of straight music this way.  I'm used to the sound quality - before I got the Zen Micro I've been burning CDs of music I download.  Generally, if a file is of low quality, it will sound almost the same as it did through the PC speakers.   The FM radio is nice, but since I live in the middle of nowhere there isn't much to listen to.  Podcasts would be nice here, but I prefer listening to music I like instead of waiting... skipping... etc...  I also use it to record lectures and it does a good job at it.  In the long run, I don't recommend this player if you don't know that much about how the interface works.  Because the instructions don't tell that much, it leaves you to figure it out, but there's the help file and it tells you everything you need to know.    As for playlists, I'd say it's confusing at first but is easier after a while.  If you save the playlist as a playlist, name it something, you'll be able to listen to it later... not at the same time.  I'd say it's the same as the ipod mini, but if you have an old PC running on Windows and are technoligically inclined, you'll be okay.  I'd recommend the ipod for ease of use, though.  It's hard to use, but worth it.

<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player doesn't offer the usability that you'll get with an Ipod but then again it doesn't cost as much either.  I am not an Ipod owner but have used one before and the one thing I like better about an Ipod is the control.  The Zen Micro can be difficult to control for someone with large fingers, like myself.  I have to say that I am impressed with the audio quality that you get from the Zen micro.  I also like the fact that you don't have to use any software to operate or put songs on the Zen Micro, although software is included with the player.  The 12 hour battery life claim is bogus but you can expect 6 - 7 hours of playback on a single charge.  I have seen several reviews for this product that complain about the headphone jack going out so beware if you plan on purchasing this product.  I haven't had any difficulty with mine though.

<Content>I own an ipod (3G) and gave my wife an ipod mini.  I added the zen micro to my collection so that I could take advantage of Yahoo's subscription music service (which is great).  Overall, I'm satisfied with the zen micro but I have to admit that the ipod is a much better product.  Here are my thoughts about zen micro pros and cons:  Pros: Great sound, good battery life, works with Yahoo music, good integration with windows XP (some other players are more finicky), nice size, comes with good accessories, standard USB charger that allows me to carry one cable for my phone, camera, and mp3 player, comes with plenty of accessories.  Cons: interface is less intuitive than ipod, very very difficult to control while running (unlike ipod mini that you can control with your eyes closed), freezes occasionally (this happens to all mp3 players I've owned so it's not a big deal)  Overall, I am pleased with the product but wish that I could just use my ipod with my yahoo music subscription instead...

<Content>A 16 year's old review:  Over the summer, I had read tons of reviews about the zen micro. And some of them were really good and some of them wern't. I was worried that mine would be one of the ones that would get messed up. But I really thought to myself, if I just be careful maybe it won't happen to me. And plus, the price is good, it has a nice design, and cool features like the microphone. And I did't want to use itunes and pay 99 cents a song. So I settled for getting the zenmicro, and told my parents that's what I wanted for my 16th birthday which was in October. So that means I have had mine for about 2 months.  And I have had absolutely no problems with it. Even the vertical touch pad wasn't a problem for me, which was weird. And I didn't have trouble with the software because I didn't use it. Instead I used Windows Media Player 10...which I highly recommend, it works great. And a lot of people seem to have major problems with the creative media explorer or zen organizer thing.  I downloaded music from some place. And organized into my library and synced it to my player. And sooon i was listening to my music.  And i totally love it because, i finally have a mp3 player, and it looks kool, and ive had no problems with it..oh yeaa and it's very easy to hold in your hand...very comfortable fit, easy to switch songs or whatever...althought the only thing i dont like are the headphones which are really a ripoff..and i kinda wish it was a bit thinner like the ipod...but i dont really care that much  But I do have to admit, once my sister's boyfriend got the new ipod and i got to play around with it...i fell in love it....i mean it is truly gorgeous...and this one was black...and plus it was in color....and i happen to like the click wheel or whatever...and really just how it loooks is reallly nice...and the features...oh mannn....PICTURES,MUSIC, VIDEOS!!! how great is that.  but since im not a very picky person...im happy with my zen micro...it may not be as gorgeous as the new ipod...but it really is good enough...im just happy i have a way of carrying my music  i just hope NOTHING happens to it...*cross fingers*  so i hope this helps you in choosing if u would like to purchase a zen micro

<Title>Still a happy Zen Micro owner (edited 2-06)
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am happy with my Zen Micro. I have owned it for five months. I mainly use it for audio book listening when I drive and enjoy my morning walks. I download/transfer the books from the Massachusetts library on-line digital site. I only download/ transfer about 4 or 5 parts (hours) at a time (I have dial-up Internet service). Downloading takes hours/the transfer to the Zen takes mere minutes. I delete each one after I complete listening to it.  I have also transferred some of my favorite Smooth Jazz music from my Windows Media player to the Z/M.  My one major complaint has to be the battery-charge life.  It only seems to be about 4/5 hours long. The Zen Micro has a lot of great features (fast forwarding/holding/ etc.). Use of these features, however, 'eats' a great deal of battery power. I was able to stop using the 'hold' feature by switching to a hard plastic case which must be opened to use the touch pad.  I try not to use the 'fast forwarding' feature unless it is absolutely necessary.  The 'deleting' feature also uses a great deal of battery power. I have decided to turn off the backlight feature during the daytime to see if that improves the situation. (It didn't/I just keep it at 5 seconds)   Also, the plastic casing of the Z/M is extremely slippery. I used strips of clear duct tape along the sides and a square piece on the back to give it a texture that is easier to hold on to.  Early on, I did two firmware downloads without any problem. I have found that light taps and slow, deliberate moves eliminate 95% of my daily usage problems (freezing, etc.).  As far as the jack problem is concerned, I decided to try a preventive measure.  I used a toothpick to place some Hard As Nails clear nail polish in the area where the jack attaches to the casing. I hope this will help to keep it anchored. (This seems to be working!)  I finally got around to looking at the manual which was transferred to my computer from the formatting disk. It is a wealth of information (daily usage info/shut-off info/defragging info/etc.).   My love of audio books inspired me to create the following book blog http://audiobooksaredelightfulmindcandy.blogspot.com/  J.K.

<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Micro mainly because the iPod did not have a radio which was a must have on my list and the fact that I do not have enough music to justify the 30 gig iPod also helped in my decision. The iPod nano carried 4GB max and costs $250 (I bought my Micro at $170+tax) and without a radio was ridiculous and made it an easy decision to buy the Zen Micro.  I definitely would recommend the Zen Micro over the iPod Nano if that's what you were gunning for. Plus, there seems to be a lot of cases with iPods breaking down.  I've already dropped my Micro (with the plastic case) twice and so far no damage whatsover. If it freezes on you, just take out the battery. That's what I did and it worked fine after I put it back in. Remember it's a micro hard drive not flash-base.

<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought the Micro in Dec. 2004. Headphone jack conked out after 4 months. It took Creative 6 weeks to send me a new one. Now, 7 months later, headphone jack conked out again. I don't even use the thing a lot -- maybe a few hours a week. BUYER BEWARE.

<Title>good alternative to ipod mini
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The zen micro is a good alternative to the ipod mini.  What I like about the zen micro:  1) replaceable battery 2) bigger hard drive space 3) a little cheaper (better value) 4) has fm radio (though I have no use for it) 5) technically has better sound quality than ipod (though you probably won't be able to hear the actual difference).  what I don't like about the zen micro:  1) a lot less accessories than ipod-- e.g. no iTrip for zen, etc. 2) does not have a line out.  ipod requires an extra accessory for a line out, but it's there.  this is important if you're hooking it up to a headphone amp or a high quality receiver. 3) does not support mp4 (aac).  ipod supports both drm (m4p) and non-drm aac (m4a) files.   mp4 has a much better quality at the same bitrate. 4) doesn't support audiobooks. 5) interface is ok, but ipod is better.  I would've given the zen a 5 star if it had a line out and mp4 support.  Contrary to some user comments, you are not locked into drm when using ipod.  You can load and play non-drm files into ipod just fine.

<Title>Until...
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Until this thing I waisted 250 bucks on is compatible with Audible downloads, it is useless!  If your an audible subscriber DON'T bother.  Any firmware update to fix this in the future and make this a GREAT player is unknown, contacting Creative or Audible only gets you one line responses that they have NO plans to make it Audible ready.  Sorry to be so harsh but reading the threads on Creative's site you get the same thing.  The most unbelievable thing is that at one point they actually advertised this player (not on Amazon) with a discount if you sigined up for an Audible subscription!!!

<Title>Everything the ipod mini didnt do (except for a couple)
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are a PC user and are deciding whether to get an ipod mini or a zen micro your choice should be the zen micro.  There are some key things that Apple should have considered that was done on the zen micro.  One is battery life.  Why do you think the 3rd gen of the regular ipod quickly turned into 4th generation?  One reason was the buttons weren't very stylish and most importantly was the battery life.  They quickly jumped it from up to 8 hours to 12.  Creative made the right choice and made it have a 12 hour battery.  Another excellent addition was it having replaceable batteries.  It's so nice to have an extra battery (40$) on an airplane when your battery runs out. Also the Zen Micro is more worth your money then the Ipod mini is. What would you say is better?  250$ for 4 gigs or 5 gigs?  There are many reasons why Zen Micro is just better then the Ipod mini.  The only thing the Ipod mini has better is its click wheel.  You might need getting used to the Zen Micro's touch screen.  Also both don't have a dedicated volume control.

Save yourself some time and frustration and get the real deal. Take a look at the iPod Mini or the iPod. You can always go into your local Apple store and try them for yourself. Either buy it right there or come back to Amazon.

<Content>I have had the Zen Micro for about 3 weeks ago, and have been using it constantly. It is a great player with wonderful sound quality. The menus are logical and easy to navigate. I chose this player over an Ipod Mini, because:  * FM radio * 1 Gig more space * Much longer battery life * Plays MP3s and WMAs in native format * Records from FM * Can record with built-in microphone * Doesn't need to go to factory to replace battery * Seamless interface with Windows and Windows Media Player * Better sound * Better looks

<Title>Overall satisfaction, however....
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are a few complaints. The touchpad is a little tricky even after making the necessary adjustments, however, I think I'll get used to it after a while. My real complaint is the packaged software. Now, I'm a pretty experienced computer user, having been self-taught in a number of softwares from Photoshop to SPSS. At first it seemed like it would be pretty seemless because my first cd-ripping session easily put my cds directly onto the Micro with little effort. The problem is that I haven't been able to find that feature again! I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, I just expected the software for executing this basic task to be a little more intuitive.

<Title>Seriously in need of help!!
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really loved this mp3 player, it had great sound, useful features, and it held all the songs I wanted, but then, it started screwing up.  I was listening to it and it just froze.  It wouldn't turn off or respond to anything, so I took the battery out and put it back in.  When it turned on, it was on recovery mode, and I don't know how to get out of it!  I've tried letting the battery die and recharging it, rebooting, cleaning up, attaching it to the computer, reloading firmware, and pushing just about every button on there, but it still won't go away!  I can't listen to anything until I can find a way out of the recovery screen.  The exact same thing happened to my sister at about the same time.  If you know how to fix this, send me an email at qwerpi@kiwibox.com.  For anyone thinking of getting a zen micro,just pay for the ipod, it's worth it.

<Title>Some Tips Might Help~~~~~~~
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a zen Micro from Amazon about three weeks ago. I really like the amazing sound quality and everything goes fine execpt the annoying freezing problem. My computer sometimes could not recognize the unit then it froze and even could not be shut down. Fortunately after several times, I finally found out that if the unit is FULL CHARGE then the freezing problem would come up, but if not, everything will be fine. So DO NOT PLUG IN THE FULLY CHARGED UNIT TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!  Another thing that might help is when u try to connect the unit to the pc, please first plug the usb into the unit, then connect the other end to the pc.  Hope these can help some folks' problems.

<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i loooooveed this product. Many of my friends got it because they thought that the iPod Mini's wern't that great. And they are so happy that they waited because soon after, the Zen Micro came out! They are so tiny, that they are perfect to bring along with you when you travel. They are actually smaller than the iPod Mini.   If you are deciding between the Zen Micro and the iPod Mini, consider these facts first: 1) the Zen is about $10-$20 cheaper than the iPod Mini 2) the Zen is smaller and more convenient than the iPod Mini 3) the Zen can hold 1,500 MORE songs than the iPod Mini for less money 4) the Zen comes in many more colors than the iPod Mini 5) the Zen has an FM Radio 6) the Zen has a voice recorder 7) the Zen has twice as much battery life than the iPod Mini  considering these facts, what reason could you possibly have for buying a measily iPod Mini? that's a rip-off..  GET THE ZEN MICRO!! IT'S THE NEXT BIG THING - AND WAY BETTER FOR YOUR MONEY.

<Title>An Intelligent Consumer's Reward!!
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my Zen Micro to replace a Muvo 2 that was DOA when I bought it.  Prior to buying it, I read a product review that mentioned that the USB cable that comes with the Micro sometimes doesn't work.  So when mine didn't either, I substituted a cable from another device, and it worked perfectly.  In spite of this glitch, which one wonders how Creative could allow to happen, I have to give the Micro five stars.  Everything else about it is spectacular.  Although the earphones, juiced to 115db sensitivity, are good quality, I prefer to use my Shure E2C's with it.  The slightly lower sensitivity of the Shures means I have to crank the volume a notch higher, cutting down on battery life slightly; but the resulting sound quality is so phenomenal that I don't mind at all.   Once I installed the firmware update, the Micro's touch controls became a total pleasure to use.  The menu tree is well-conceived, versatile, and extremely logical.  A user who tags his or her song files in a uniform way will find his/her diligence rewarded by the Micro's file system.  For interfacing the Micro with my PC, I use the Zen Micro Explorer, a matter of personal preference.  Creative MediaSource and Windows Media Player can do the same things, but the Media Explorer's GUI is a bit more user-friendly.  I haven't tried ripping directly to the Micro, but I've never had a glitch transferring files from my hard drive using the Media Explorer, which has a convenient on-the-fly tag editor.  Although Creative advertises that the Micro can hold up to 2,500 songs at a low bitrate, sound-conscious users will likely find themselves ripping significantly fewer files for the Micro at 192kbps and higher.  Even in instrument-cluttered songs, individual musical voices are more clear on the Micro than on some audiophile-type home systems I've heard.  For users who like to tweak their sound, the Micro has a five-band equalizer.  Since about 1980 I've used the same audio program material--though in different formats--to sample various audio components and systems. The Micro reproduces this material as well as any audio system I've ever heard.   Almost a couple of decades ago, Creative boss Sim Wong Hoo was the definitive pioneer in bringing sound to personal computers, an innovation that enabled people to see the PC as an entertainment device, rather than just a work tool.  For years, the Creative name was synonymous with a visually unappealing PCI card that did almost magical things when it was connected to a PC's motherboard.    Over the years, Creative has continued to set the standard in PC audio, but without quite being able to find the right form factor to do justice to its superb products.  With the Creative Zen Micro, Mr. Sim and company have finally created a device with enough aesthetic appeal on the exterior to do justice to the incredible sound quality that comes from its interior.

<Title>Loves It, then again maybe not...
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Update:  My player died after 9 months and it cost $40 to get a refurbished replacement, which also died a few months later.  It was great when it worked, but the reliability has really been disappointing over time.    I just got my Zen Micro yesterday and I'm very impressed.  Inserted the battery and plugged in the charger and I was listening to the FM tuner within minutes.    When I got home from work I went through the installation process which was trouble free.  Installed the software and upgraded the firmware from the Creative site, which I have read is a must if you want to use Windows Media Player 10 to synch instead of using the Creative software.    This is my first MP3 player, so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of uploading files.  I uploaded almost 1,500 songs in a little over an hour which I thought was pretty fast.  I have a fairly new computer (P4 2.3GHz with USB 2), so I'm guessing that's why it was faster than I expected.    The only hitch was that some of the songs didn't make it to the player and it did hang up 2x during the upload process.  When that happened I had to disconnect the player, close WMP and start again.  Still I was able to synch all but about 12 of the songs I have ripped to my computer.    I can understand how some Ipod enthusiasts wouldn't like the Zen Micro because it's UI is different.  I have friends who own Ipods and the wheel is very cool on them.  I think that unless you are really attached to that interface you will not have a problem with navigation on the Micro.    As for the vertical touch pad which I know some people have had complaints about, I have mine still set on the medium setting.  I think it's a matter of preference and just takes a little getting used to.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Strengths:    Sound quality, attractive design, FM radio, vertical touchpad, size, storage capacity, start-up time, included accessories, navigation, use of ID3 tags, removable battery, organizer + transfer speed.   Weaknesses:    Ran slow the first few minutes, but I think that was because of the cold temperature when it arrived. (below zero F)  Summary:   I've spent at least a month researching different mp3 players and, without any regrets, chose the Zen Micro. It's easy to use and the only thing it lacks from the iPod is the games and I would have liked if it supported the OGG Vorbis file format--hopefully it will soon with a firmware upgrade. I prefer the vertical touch pad that is on the micro.

<Title>Zen Micro got it right...
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my iPod mini for christmas for myself, and had it for 2 weeks. Prior buying iPod, I looked only at iPod reviews, and most of my friends had one, that I wanted to get one. THe only choice I made was to prefer mini over to the 20GB, 'coz I use it a lot at the gym and during running.   I loved my iPod, it was good looking, cool, could stock up to 1000 songs, amazingn clcick wheel...   But when I looked at Zen Micro on an ad, read the review and spec. I was totally moved wheh I read, Zen Micro had an embedded FM radio, with recording capability.... That was more than good enough to have me buy it. I listen to my MP3 collection most of the time, But there were times, I wanted to be able to carry my tiny little FM tuner I got 'coz they would be givingi away some stuffs on Radio, or I was wanting to hear my name called on KZLA's, double your salary. It made perfect sense for me to carry both my FM tuner and my MP3 player...  And often, I hear a song on Radio, and then go download it from iTune or any yother music store. And here I am , able to record it right there to my player... How cool is that!:)  I love it so far. THe touch pad isn't what u would feel in iPod, but iPod to me is like a closed system, and put ur songs period,nothing more nothing less. Where as Zen Micro, have ur music, if u want nlisten to all the radio stationis u want, and record songs if u like...(think of all the top10s that you can add to ur collection every day...)  I like the player so far.  THe player didn't look that cool on the pictures, but it felt really nice and perfect when I got it and hold it on my hand. Except for the Black ones the other Zen Micro's are not photogenic, but trust me they look cool... in real!  My over all experience with Zen Micro is that, they got it right... a music player ought to be able to play radio stations... There are people out there that likes radio once in a while, andn don't have to sit in their car to listen or carry around an another radio tuner for listening to radio!   These guys got it right... and I am sure the software would come with more powerful choices in the upgrades that would integrate radio and the player's ability to record them. Like now, By the time I hear a song, and seem like I like it, I already lost little of the song before I start recording... THere must be someway these guys can buffer like few seconds of radio at any given time to catch up on recordinig... I haven't read the manuals, so do not know if its already there... What to say, I am just being a naive user with more expectations...  Its a good one, and they got it right!

<Title>Compares well against the the IPod Mini
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an IPod 20GB for my son this Christmas and decided to get the Zen Micro at the same time for myself. So I've become familiar with both products. Both my son and I am happy with our MP3 players.   The advantages of the IPod is the 20GB of hard drive space compared to 5GB over the Zen Micro. However, compared to the IPod Mini (a more fair comparison), the Mini only has 4GB.  The two biggest advantages of the IPod are the Click Wheel and the overall design. The design of the IPod is pure "zen." It is a perfect balance between design and technology.  The interface for the Zen Micro is very good, but the IPod is just pure perfection.  The killer problem with the IPod is that it is very proprietary. Apple slams Microsoft for its monopolistic practices, but IPod and ITunes are very proprietary. You basically better forget managing your collection of music on more than one computer. With IPod/ITunes you are pretty-much restricted to one PC to purchase and manage songs. The IPod also locks you down to ITunes, whereas the Creative Zen Micro lets you use just about anything you want to manage your songs.  I chose to use Windows Media Player 10 to manage and Sync songs to my Zen Micro instead of Creative's own software (which is actually pretty good).  Another problem with the IPod is the non-removable battery. The Zen Micro came with two removable/rechargeable batteries.   A few tips: upgrade to the latest 1.x firmware as soon as you get the Zen Micro. It is very stable compared to the 2.x firmware (that allows you to be compatible with the Plays For Sure Media Transfer Protocol). The MTP will be an important standard but the 2.x firmware from Creative is still a little too buggy.  Using the 1.01.03 firmware is ROCK solid with WMP 10 and USB 2.0 transfers.  I've had my Zen Micro for a month now and it has never locked-up on me.  All told, the Zen Micro has many more features compared to the IPod Mini: FM Radio, Recorder (off of radio or live), Calendar and Task List sync with Microsoft Outlook.  To me, the sound quality is better than the IPod. The included ear buds are very good, surprisingly so. They are a little big and those with smaller ears may have some difficulty in keeping them in. I bought a pair of Sony 51 ear buds for $40 and they are terrific.    You cannot go wrong with the Zen Micro. It is a great little device. Just make sure you have a working USB 2.0 connection in your computer and you update the firmware.

So, sadly I just shipped it back to Amazon today. I was really excited about the fm recorder and the small design.

Ear phones take a little getting use to and I even may get something else, as they are popping out of my ear once in a while.  You will not be sorry that you purchased this machine.

<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great MP3 player. There is more space, a FM radio, FM radio recorder, and a voice recorder, along with many various features. But none of that matters if your batttery dies within 4 hours (when it takes ~3hrs to fully charge in the first place).   I contacted the Creative labs for help and they replied with a LONG list of things that I coulda, shoulda done. For one thing, you're supposed to charge it for 8-10hrs before first time usage...now...that was not written ANYWHERE in the box that was delivered to me. In fact, the user manual hardly contained any information.  So if you're willing to go through a lot of trouble in exchanging your player, getting it fixed, and messing with the many other glitches of this Creative player, you should try buying it.  Last thought...they don't sell any skins for the player, so trying to protect it from everyday usage is almost impossible (unless you want to use the cheap pouch they give you...)

<Title>All I could ask for..............
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this item for a good price after doing weeks of research on my best deal.  Alot of my friends have iPods, and I loved the apple interface.  For this reason, I was reluctant to steer away from Apple because of the fear that another company would not be able to meet my same expectations.  However, I discovered the Zen Micro and decided it was worth the risk due to the extra features it offered over the mini.    After 2 weeks of use, I am glad to report the Zen Micro is a dream.  It holds everything I need, sounds beautiful, and holds its charge for a surprisingly long period of time.  Also, its incredibly small, and it easily fits in my pocket.  People tend to complain about the touch pad, but I could work my way around easily in a day's time.  As far as the ease of the interface, it is not as good as Apple's.  However, it allows you to customize your menus and place them in whatever order you prefer.  This allows you to only see what you want to see in your menus.  The only bad thing I see about this product are the horrible headphones it comes with.  However, I simply have some Shure E2c's on the way.  Other than that, I am 100% satisfied.  If you are seriously considering an iPod mini, do the smart thing and order the Zen Micro!

<Title>Not as good as the ipod mini
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. This is by far my biggest complaint.  Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.

<Title>An outstanding MP3 player!
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. (The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'. However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.  I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase. An Apple Ipod Mini was considered. However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'. This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.  By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.

<Content>I got this for Christmas last year. One day, I took it to day care. All of my IPod-wielding friends with 10,000 songs were jealous!! However, there are 2 problems.   1) At first, the touchpad was quite hard to use.  2) Besides my CDs, I CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE TO GET MP3S CHEAP!!!!!!

<Title>Completely unusable
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The touch pad control for the Zen Micro is completely unusable. I tried the various sensitivity settings and it didn't make any difference. Creative's support line people suggested firmware upgrades but that didn't make any difference. I'm sending it back! I've used touch pads before on laptop computers without any problem.

<Title>An excellent product despite a few minor flaws
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned a Zen Micro for about a week and absolutely love it. I used to own a 20GB Zen before this and bought this 'cause my wife began to use my player. When i bought it, i did not have high expectations of it but now that i'm using it, i realize how its much better than my previous player. Why ?  Size : The tiny size is perfect for just keeping it in your pocket whether you're listening to music or not. Anything bigger and you'll want to carry it around only when you plan to listen to music. This one, just have it on your person at all times. You won't even feel it User interface : Using it is a joy. The touch pad interface is really cool and has just the right amount of senstivity Sound Quality : The sound quality of this device is amazing. I have listened to the iPod in the Apple store (with their Bose headphones) and the sound of the Zen Micro is noticeably much better. I have a bunch of classical music in MP3 format that i never really appreciated before 'cause it sounded pretty flat in my previous MP3 player. Now i'm listening to it with a new-found enjoyment Volume : You can really crank this thing up. The volume increments are from 1 to 25 and 16 is pretty loud. Go figure... FM Radio : Its nice to have an FM radio in the player. I use it rarely but every once in a while when you want to hear the news or want to tune in to that TV program in your gym, this comes in handy Recording :  The idea of being able to record FM radio is pretty cool. Also having a microphone in the player for you to record memos makes it much more useful. Haven't used this stuff but i'm glad its there Removable battery :  Such a basic, necessary feature. Don't know why anyone would buy another product which forces them to pay big bucks after the battery stops holding charge like it used to in a year or two. Software :  When it comes to installing software on my computer i'm a minimalist. So i was happy to learn that all i had to do for the Zen Micro, is install the USB driver and then when you connect it, i was able to use Windows Media Player 10 to transfer MP3s and view the files on my Micro. The Micro also has a feature where you can reserve some of the 5 GB space to show up as a removable drive when you plug it into a computer. That does not require any drivers. However that space cannot be used to play music.  Now for the flaws (I found i can live with them without loving my player any less) FM Radio reception :  Not so good. Will only catch stations with a strong signal Battery life :  This one is tricky. Apparently you can drain your battery pretty quickly if you do some things wrong. For example if you shutdown the player without pausing the currently playing song, it saps a lot of battery. Also if you spend a lot of time fooling around in the menus (which you will the first few days you have your new toy), the battery will only last 3 hours. But once you get past the 'new toy' phase and remember to pause before shutdown you can get respectable life out of it - at least 7 hours. For iPod users maybe this is not a flaw, but my older 20GB Zen gives me at least 15 to 16 hours.

<Title>Great player, loaded with features
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Initial impressions were good, the packaging was very nice, improved from Creatives previous packaging on the Zen Xtra and Zen Touch. The box contents included the main unit, a wall charger, a usb cable, a software CD, and a quick start guide. Installation of the software went smoothly, I inserted the battery and charged the player up via USB. The wall charger had an american plug but this was detachable so you can change if you go overseas, ingenius. It's also an international charger supporting 110-240v so you don't need to worry about step down transformers or anything like that.  One thing I have to comment on is the size of the unit itself, its TINY. The pictures don't do it any justice, this thing is very small. If you've held an iPod Mini, you'll know how small it is, this is actually smaller, but a bit wider (because of the removable battery).  After charging, I uploaded 4.5Gb of music onto the player using Creative Media Source with no problems at all. I edited the Custom EQ settings to suit my preference and tested a few songs using my Sony MDR-EX71's. The sound coming out of this tiny little player was amazing. It was as good as my Zen Touch, which as you know has excellent sound quality. Sound was extremely clean, the bass is very nice as well as the treble and mid sections. So soundwise, this player is an absolute winner, but what about interface? I can safely say that they've improved the interface over the Zen Touch's. The Zen Touch had an easy interface but this is even easier, finding albums, queuing music, creating playlists is a breeze. Everything is laid out nicely in the menu's so it wont become a chore to find something.  The touch pad on the Zen Micro is similar to that of the Zen Touch's, but it still took me about 2 minutes to get used to it (even after mastering the Zen Touch's touchpad). In fact, all the touch buttons are extremely nice and respond well to your finger movements.  Customising the main menu is a great little touch, lets you personalise it to suit yourself. I find it extremely handy to have a shortcut to the Date/Time and all my contacts at a click. Syncing with the PC couldn't be easier, especially contacts, to-do and calender. You create all your tasks, contacts, etc in Outlook and use the Sync manager to sync it to the player and it's extremely easy.  The DJ mode is kinda cool, it has a play count of each track played and then has options to play the most played or least played songs. There are more options in this mode like playing the "Album of the Day", which I haven't quite figured out what it is, but seems like a random album out of the playlist, but very well could be the most played (I'm not sure, haven't used it enough to know).  The Removable Disk option is great for those who want to store data on the player but do not want to carry around a driver disk. You can set up a partition on the player to act as this and set the size, then when you connect it to Windows, it will detect as a removable disk. Extremely handy for people who want to carry data around.  FM Radio isnt bad, it uses the headphones as the aerial. It highly depends on the area you live in but the reception was fairly good here. Voice recording is nice too with the built in microphone, and a nice little option is there to record from the FM Radio :)  I can't comment on battery life because the battery still has 3 bars and I've used it for about 3 hours using 192-320Kbit VBR files. Seems like it will live upto it's 10-12Hr claim.  The LCD screen is extremely clear, the resolution is about twice as high as on the iPod Mini so the text is very easy to read and very clear.  Now for the bling bling factor, this player looks amazing. The blue glow surrounding the player and the white backlight on the LCD look great against the black surface, this is the best looking player I have seen yet. A nice touch is that the player pulsates while its charging, it looks awesome.  Coming to the end of the review so I'll comment on accessories. It comes with a cradle which you can use to have the player sit upright on the desk but this cradle can also be a pouch too if you use the other attachment with it. The supplied earphones are good for stock earphones, but if you're an audiophile then you'll be after something better. There is an option to buy the wired remote, but it isn't for sale yet, I'll probably get it when it is, shouldnt cost more than $40. It also came with a little cloth pouch, a bit like the ones that come with Sony earphones and minidisc players, its not bad but I can't see myself using it.  I think that just about covers it all, the player is so rich with features its amazing how it can be so cheap compared to the competition. If you're after a small, portable player, then I highly recommend the Zen Micro.

<Title>It's awesome
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player that was reasonably priced and offered the most features.  I did a bit of internet research and saw that this one was rated highly on several sites.  The 5gbs and the FM radio were the key sellers on this one....besides the price that is.  It's smaller than I thought it would be.  It looks like a 5th of the size of Sony Discman.  It's easy to set up, install.  I do agree that the instruction booklet could be more detailed.  Oh, and it's true the touch pad is a bit annoying at first.  Other than those two minor things.  I'm extremely pleased with my purchase so far and amazon definitely had the best deal online. So if you're looking for a nice pc friendly mp3 player at a reasonable price...get this one.

<Title>Your earphones will break
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll start by saying i love this little ****er like it was my own flesh and blood.  Sound, looks, ease of use (despite touch controls being a bit eager), all near-perfection.  Storage vs Size excellent - plus, its so effortlessly quick and easy to whizz whole albums on and off from your PC (literally 2/3 seconds per song) that its all the storage space you realistically need (unless you're off travelling for a year or something, but even then your talking more than the average CD collection worth of songs)  However the earphones are appallingly tacky for such a pricy bit of kit.   A slight knock put the jack housing askew, leaving the sound crackling and missing out whole frequecy ranges. I pushed it back straight to try correct it and the plug fell out revealing the pathetic cotton width cables expected to secure it in place.  Thers no glue or anything holding it in place - the cables that carry the sound and a drop of solder are all that hold the wire to the jack, so give it a week or give it 6 months, but they will break.  That said, although im annoyed as i can't use it until i get my new 'phones, you can pick up a pair of far superior to these for around a tenner (i hate in-ear plugs anyway) so its no biggy.  PLus, having a pair of sony earphones rather than with 'Creative' blazened over them stops nerdish MP3 afficionados started conversations with you on buses.  Its the coolest, sexiest kid on the block, bit nobodies perfect (get decent earphones however, and this little sex-pot is close!)

<Title>Do NOT buy!!!! This $#*@ing thing doesn't work!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this product, followed the sparse directions, first charging for three hours until fully charged, then loading the software, then loading my music.  The first thing I noticed was that the belt clip broke INSTANTLY. I mean instantly. I put it on my belt, took it off, and the EXTREMELY cheap plastic was broken.  Then, after about 30 minutes of play, the device stopped working entirely. Completely. Nothing. In the middle of playing a song, it simply cut off. The thing wouldn't even shut down any more. Tried taking out the battery and putting it back. It didn't even show the normal start up screen with the droplets of water. Just straight to a screen reading CREATIVE, and is now COMPLETELY unresponsive. I cannot believe I spent my money on this. What a complete and total ripoff. Buyers BEWARE. This is a TOTAL piece of you know what. I am going to get my money back and buy an IPOD.

<Title>Worth it
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for a couple of days now, and I love it. I know a couple people with iPods, and I've played with them a little bit, but I like this so much more, especially since you're not stuck using iTunes. Mine came with the new firmware so battery life and the touchpad sensativity wasn't an issue for me. The included headphones were actually decent, but I have a pair of Plugs and they work really well with this. The FM tuner isn't that great, but this is an MP3 player, which is why I wanted it. The Micro also feels great when holding it. The only thing that was a little quirky was using the included software, it just takes a few minutes to learn it. I'd really like the wired remote to come to the U.S., I hate importing things then it comes out a couple weeks later.

<Title>Zen Micro Rocks with NAPSTER
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The best reason to own a Zen Micro is because it can be integrated directly with NAPSTER's online music service.  In other words, NAPSTER's service for something like $15/month allows you to move an unlimited amount of music to the ZEN.  That way you don't have to pay .99/song.  It opens up a world of more music selection.

<Title>Good product, Great service
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think that the zen micro is probaly the best jukebox you can get If you are not a DJ. It only holds 2500 songs however I have about 400 on mine and can't think of anyother song that I like. It looks great, the scroll bar makes a lot more sense logicaly than the Ipod's circle. The battery is said to have 12 hours but I think its only about 8. Then again I dont really go anywhere for that long that i can't bring my charger. Aestheticaly, I love it, but thats only an opinion.      Where the product really shines however is the customer service. After about a week, the headphone jack became loose and the sound quality became horrible. I sent an email to amazon at 6:00pm (im not sure if its amzon who did this or zen but) then 21 hours later ups picked up the old one and delivered the new one. i couldnt believe it! Over all this is a great product and dont be deterred by the technical problem I had because all jukebox's are touchy like that.

<Title>Excellent, but....
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a relative newcomer to the portable audio game, and therefore I  have yet to develop any biases or swear allegiance to any brand.  I did do a lot of research before buying a player, and most of my friends have iPods so I know all about them.  I decided that something in the micro drive category would suit me best at this point in time.  I went with the Zen Micro because it seemed to be the best alternative to the iPod Mini and also had a little more of what I was looking for.    For the first month I had it, I loved the thing.  First of all, anyone who complains about the "over-sensitivity" of the Micro's scrolling features obviously hasn't spent more then ten minutes with it.  After a day or so, I had no problems with overshooting or accidental selections or anything else.  If you have opposable thumbs and a more deft touch than, say, your average gorilla, you should be fine.  Although it is much easier to scroll through a large library of songs with the iPod's wheel, the Micro makes it easy to find that certain song with a pop-up menu that lets you skip through your library alphabetically.    Most of the other features are more than adequate.  The sound quality is top-notch.  The display is crystal-clear.  The standard earbud headphones are every bit as good as iPods, although I only used those for a few days before switching to a higher quality pair.  The Micro is small enough to fit easily in any pocket but designed so that it doesn't fall out of your hand all the time.  It's extremely easy to operate with just your thumb.  The FM Tuner is choppy at best; it would work great while I was at work but horribly at home (about one mile separates the two).  And I was disappointed with the battery life.  At best, it got half the life that Creative advertised.  I could live with this, though, because I generally just charged the thing overnight while I slept, and also the one I ordered came with a free extra battery just in case.    But after about a month I encountered a major problem.  All of a sudden, for no apparent reason (I hadn't dropped or damaged the thing) my Micro just crashed.  One day I hit the power switch, and it froze on the home screen and made a repititive clicking noise.  Nothing I did, and for that matter nothing Creative support told me to do, would fix the problem.  Creative offered to replace it for me for free, but I asked them to just refund my money instead.  I loved the Micro, but should I hope that this was just an anomaly and get a new one, or go with something comparable but hopefully more reliable?  (I refuse to buy an iPod, by the way).  It seems other customers have had this problem before.  I may try something in the 20-40GB market, but there doesn't seem to be a solid alternative to the iPod.  If it doesn't crash, the Micro is an amazing product.  That's a big "if" though.  I don't know where to go now.  I may even hold off buying anything for a few months, as this seems to be a big year for the market, with lots of new products coming out to try and bag some of Apple's gold.  Potential buyers might want to consider that option as well.

<Content>The zen micro is a great product, and extremely easy to use. Although Some of the other reviews have said that the vertical touch pad to impossible to use, but unless you have had your hands amputated and are trying to navigate it with stumps, it works really well. Also, the software that came with the Zen micro is really simple to use, and pretty much straight forward. The sound quality is great and it can hold more than double the songs of the ipod mini. Basically anyone that is wondering if this is right for you, it is.

<Title>not as good as expected
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i bought zen micro last week. My overall satisfaction is "so-so". I wanted an mp3 player with radio capabilities, thus i stayed away from ipod. Replaceable battery was another advantage over the ipod. The truth is that i read reviews which indicated that radio reception can be weak. I work in NYC, so with the radio antennas everywhere i figured that it should not be a problem. Well... it is. I can not get clear radio reception anywhere for any station. Also, battery does not last 12 hours - 4 maybe 5 hours the max ( kbps 128, kh 44 mp3s). No accessories are available either (such as arm band holsters, etc)

<Title>Awesome mp3 player!
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Zen Micro white about 3 weeks ago and I love it. In fact, I loved it so much that my mom took it away from me for like a week lol. However, that's not the point. I will highlight the pros and cons of the awesome Zen Micro.  Pros:  1. Sound - great crystal clear sound, very clean at low volumes. Hizzes are present in high volumes but it's not very comfortable to listen to anyways when your eardrums are about to blow.  2. Size - VERY small - at least smaller than what you would expect.  3. FM Radio - Convenient when you want to listen to something else besides your songs for the change (I don't use it that much,  however).  4. Touch Pad - OK in the first ten minutes of usage, you will scream like a little girl about the zen touch pad. However, after you get used to it (took me like 30 min lol), the touch pad works like a charm. The key here is: when you want to click, touch it lightly and don't hold the key at all. When you want to scroll, touch it hard at first and keep your finger there. Then move your  finger up and down WITHOUT LETTING GO OF PAD.  5. Custom EQ settings - need I explain here? However, eq settings might chew up the battery a little faster than no eq settings. I'm not 100% sure on this though.  6. Menu - customizable is always good. Nice and easy.  7. Built-in recorder - not the greatest but it doesn't hurt to have this function, does it?  8. Interface - very clear, no clutter. Font is good.   9. Case - awesome little protective case w/ stand that comes with the zen micro. Remarkably simple, works like a charm. Protect your investments!   Cons:  1. Battery life - I was a little disappointed at the battery life on my zen micro because it only lasted 6:30 as opposed to 12:00 that creative claims. I think that it will help to not use an eq setting and pause the player before turning it off.  2. Earphones - I don't know but I didn't really like the stock earbuds that came with my zen micro. They seemed too big and the sound seemed a little distorted. I find that sennheiser mx-500 works very well on the go with the zen micro (nice inexpensive earphones that give very clear sound).   Notes:  1. My zen micro hasn't frozen yet in 3 weeks. I hope it doesn't lol after reading all the reviews. I'm sure if you take good care of IT, it will take good care of YOU.  2. Static produced when you plug your earphones in isn't a defect. It's the zen micro's sleep mode that allows it to start up much quicker. A little battery is wasted when you let the zen micro "sleep" (turning it off for less than a day or so).  3. Music transfer is VERY easy imo. I just drag and drop :P. Works like a charm.  4. Another problem some users may have is the headphone jack problem. I'm not sure about this but it has something to do with creative's loose construction of the headphone jack. I have had my zen micro for 3 weeks and have not noticed ANY problems with it. I am a satisfied customer indeed.  Enjoy the music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Good but you'll know why Apple is not afraid
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was excited to receive this player. Everyday I would track its progress from KY to my house.   Why I bought this player:  * Owner exchangeable battery with a longer life than the iPod.  Read that as I don't void the warrantee by pulling out a defective batter or get charged 90 bucks to not.  * Radio tuner. I like Morning Edition on NPR.  * More storage than a Mini. I'm American, bigger is better.  * Can also be used as a removable hard drive.   * Less expensive than a Mini (in most cases)   Finally, it arrived yesterday. And now, the preliminary verdict...  * My system configuration is Pro SP2, have Macafee anti-virus, Windows firewall enabled and Office 2003 Pro.  * The Creative software is buggy. The reason why I say this is because the software when syncing the Zen to Outlook not only caused Macafee to alert me but also MS Office itself alerted me about this activity (who says that Microsoft is completely vulnerable?). After allowing the sync manager to connect to my Outlook contacts etc. in both Macafee and MS Office, illegal operation error in an MFC class; translation, the coders more than likely didn't sign their application so it looked more like Melissa or code red than an acceptable application. I'm sure they will update the software since my system is not an unusual system configuration.  * This morning, arrived at the office pulled out the player and found the stock left ear bud had come apart. This really didn't surprise me since the price you pay is for the player and not the ear buds. I had planned on buying a nicer pair of headphones anyway so, not a big deal to me.  * The radio works really well. I'm able to pick up a rather stubbornly weak NPR station.  * The transfers are pretty good, it takes less time to rip the CDs than to transfer them to the player.  * iTunes is a MUCH better interface to transfer files.  It's also much more solid a program than Creative's music manager.  But hey, Windows Media Player can work as the music manager for the Zen.  Am I still excited?  Yes, it is a nice sounding product.  The touch pad isn't as bad as many claim. No worse than getting used to a new laptop and the settings do help a lot.  I set mine to low and don't seem to fumble much at all.  The reason for three stars is because the "package"; the software, player, and included accessories, aren't of the quality I would expect from an iPod killer. If creative polishes up their music manager or just lets Windows Media Player do it all and adds better quality earbuds, there would have been four or five stars to the rating.

<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Zen Micro is awesome...the sound is far superior to any ipod, and its much smaller than even the ipod mini.  Additionally, the ipod mini is really for girls...i work out in manhattan and i can't tell you how feminine the ipod mini looks on the guys who work out there...a major plus for the Zen Micro is the cell phone-like battery: pop the battery out of the back and pop in a fully charged one when you're on the go and need power...I did own an ipod a while back and it was ok but in general the ipod battery life is terrible and it stops playing every now and then just for the hell of it...the Zen Micro has it all right now...FM radio, voice recorder (ok, i have no idea who will ever use this, but it sounds like a good feature)...plus the sound is amazing.  And it looks cool...but this and you won't be disappointed...

<Title>iPod's biggest threat
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this Zen Micro for my wife since she wanted to experience digital music.  I picked up the package for her at UPS and was quite impressed by the packaging of the device.  Even in its packaging they are trying to compete against the all powerful iPod.  The result is a very well packaged and impressive product.  When I first laid eyes on this device it was love at first sight.  Yes, even if the device itself is a pink colored one.  Its small, well built, easy on the eyes, yet its beauty captivates you from every angle.  After my wife charged it for three hours, I took the pleasure of holding it and playing with a gadget that doesn't even belong to me.  I was impressed with the powerful, beutiful light that both, surrounds the device and lights up the screen.  Its a nice blueish relaxing color.  Nothing too loud to distract you.  This is definately the device that many will see and approach you in the subway and ask: "what is that?" then you can show it and say: "is my Zen Micro", and leave people going home searching on google for the device.  I love iPods, but I was very impressed and captured by the beautiful toy.  Now, don't let its beauty fool you. This is one powerful device. 5G, 2,500 songs, FM Radio, voice recorder, calendar, to-do list and wonderful sound.  It is enough to hold up its own and I dare say stomp on the competition.  The only reason why I don't see it beating the iPod in terms of sales is that I don't believe it to be marketed effectively.  If they spend some millions on commercials (never seen one), printed ads and even those big billboards, then, you can really say they have a chance.  I do hope that word of mouth is enough to give this small, wonderful device the credit it deserves.  Zen, you won my heart.  Now, if you excuse me, my wife might be home soon and find me playing with her Zen... a big no, no.

<Title>Creative Zen Micro - Way to confusing/touchy key pad
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered my Zen Micro and was excited when it came by FedEx.  I opened up the box and was sure I would be listening to music soon.  Unfortunately, you get about 3 pages of instructions, none of which tell you how to transfer music, very annoying, my music would transfer into the PC library on the software, but I couldn't get it to transfer to the Micro, support center closed at 6pm, and you only get 1 free call, so I was SOL.  Also, the touch pad on this thing is waaaay to sensitive even at a low setting, it was ridiculous, I wanted to throw this thing out of the window.  I sent it back for a refund and ordered an iPod, which all of my friends said I should have done in the first place, the few dollars you save on this is NOT worth it!!

<Title>Easily beats Ipod
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the zen micro.  I got one for Christmas and I instantly liked it more then my brother's Ipod.  It has a removable battery which ipod doesn't and it supports mp3 and wma.  The biggest upside to this player is creative recently released a firmware upgrade that makes this player napster to go compatible.  If you don't know what napster to go is it's a subscription based music service.  For fifteen dollars a month you can download almost any song or album from napster and transer it to your player without paying .99.  Some songs on napster are still buy only but most aren't.  I signed up for napster to go a week ago and already I have put 1000 songs on my player for just 14.99.  You have to keep paying 14.99 a month or the songs quit working if you cancel your account but its worth it to me.  You get to download albums or artists you don't know anything about and give them a shot for the fun of it.  I love my zen micro and I wouldn't trade it for an ipod ever.

<Title>Very Cool MP3 Player - Highly recommended!!
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding. I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings. When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro. The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.  Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player. After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened. I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'. One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly. A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device. However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already. After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation. I say get one today!!

<Title>I wanted to give it a try...
<Date>Mon Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchases by first Zen Micro in January and within a week the hard drive died.  Creative told me it was a firmware problem and I should send it in for repairs or better yet bypass them and get a replacement from Amazon.  Amazon had a replacement send out in 2 days (faster than my own shipping) with not a penny charged to me.        I charged, loaded, and synced my new Micro.  I decided not to upgrade the firmware cause Creative stated that the previous version (without Media Player 10 support) was more stable.  And I was on my way....so I thought.  I was using some of my own headphones when I noticed the sound would cut out on the left side when ever I moved the player.  I knew this wasn't right so I tried the creative headphone and that limited the problem but it still persisted.  After paying $225 dollars I wasn't about to have an MP3 player that only played out of one headphone.       So again I called Creative and they said they could repair it but I would have to pay shipping and it would take 3-6 weeks...riiight.  I asked the guy if there were any problems I should be aware of with the Micro and of course he said no....that kind of information wasn't on his sheet of solutions to tell the customers.  Amazon was very nice and understood my situation but couldn't grant me a 2nd replacement due to policy.  I sent back my second Micro and am reluctant to order a third.  I've experienced the two most common faults with the player...now that's just not luck.  There has got to be something wrong with production...I guess I'll be holding off on having a soundtrack to life.

<Title>I Am Very Impressed 
<Date>Tue Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I first signed up for Napster on line.  Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.  They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.  So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.  To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.   The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.  This player is not compatible with Napster To Go. The player was large and bulky.  The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.  The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.  I also hated the packaging, with a passion.  It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.  Accessories were cheap looking.  The player was not very appealing either.  All this before I found out the bad news.  Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.  Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go. It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.  Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.  This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.  To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.  Its my first purchase choice.  Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go. Don't worry this player rocks.  It was also the most appealing.   Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.  For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.  It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.  Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.  A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  It has Apple insipid written all over it.  I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  Everything shines of quality.  I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.  I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go. I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.  My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast. So the download was much slower.   The interface works great.  I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  What impressed me most was the sound.  At 128 the songs sound very good.  My hobby is home audio and home theater.  The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.  I believe them.  Overall this play is my introduction into the market.  The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.

<Title>Happy With This Player  Until...
<Date>Tue Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Additional Comments:  Now that I've had my Zen for a little over three months, I'm still very happy with it.    However, I would recommend that a new owner go ahead and download the firmware right away and use Windows Media Player 10 instead of the Creative Labs software that comes with the unit.  I made the mistake of loading all my CD's onto the Creative software and using the unit for a while.  At one point I had to reset it and then decided to download the firmware.  After that, I could no longer sync with the Creative software.  So I had to re-rip all my music onto Windows Media.  Pretty aggravating.  But now that I have the firmware installed the touch pad responds better and I like Windows Media better than creative's own software.  So it's a wash.  ******************** I've had my Zen Micro for a little over a month now and I have been very pleased with it.  Having an FM receiver, an extra GB of memory, and a replaceable battery were the things that persuaded me to get this over an ipod mini.  I'm not the sort of tech person who will ditch this in a year for the next newest thing, so the replaceable battery was important for me.  I have had no troubles with the software.  I have a desktop and laptop and I use both to move music and other mp3 files back and forth.  I've been able to rip most of my CD's on to the player without a hitch.    I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it isn't perfect.  The touch pad remains a bit more sensitive than I would like.  However, it isn't so bad to be all that frustrating.    While I haven't had any trouble with the software, it did take me a little bit of time to "figure it out."  Creative could have done a better job with providing better print information with its product.    I had itunes on my computor before I purchased this player and I have to admit that the itunes software was much easier to understand and navigate.  But again, speaking as a novice with this sort of stuff, I was able to get it to work after sitting down with it for a while.   So even though I'm giving it 4 of 5 stars, I wouldn't hesitate to get this over any of its competitors.     **********  Update:  Now that I've had it for nearly a year and a half, it no longer works.  I won't be buying this one again.

<Title>The power of music..in the palm of your hand
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now. With so many choices it was a tough decision. My first instinct was to go with an iPod. I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.  I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try. All I can say is what a wonderful choice! I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!  Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up. The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in. Pressed play and I was off. The touch pad does take a little getting used to. I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.  The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player. Enjoy!

<Title>In spite of IPod Indoctrinization, Creative holds its own
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.  Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.  Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod". �_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.  By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.  The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.  About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.

<Content>I have had my micro for a week now and its great.  It did take a little while to get used to the touch pad but after you play with it for a little while you will be ok at it.  The best thing about this player is the sound quality.  I was amazed at the sound.  I'm not an audiophile or anything but I can definately tell the difference between the micro and the ipod.  The micro sounds great.  I would definately recomend this to anyone looking for an mp3 player.

<Title>Solid, classy product. Great choice for subscription model.
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The coolest thing about this product is that it works with Napster's subscription model (Napster To Go). This was one of the first music only players to support Janus, which is why I purchased it (the first Janus players were music and video players, which I didn't want.)  You have to do a beta firmware update for the player to play your subscription music, but the firmware flash was relatively painless and I've had no problems with it.   I think this player looks really slick. Looking at the pictures online I thought it looked kind of clunky but when I got the unit it looked better than in the pics.  I can see why some people dislike the touch-pad control, but I've had no problems with it.  The only complaint I have is that when changing the currently playing track there's a bit of a lag while the player locates the new song, but that's a pretty minor gripe.  Overall the UI is intuitive and works well. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a Janus/WMA10 player.

<Title>(Physically very nice, but don't use it...) UPDATED REVIEW!
<Date>Sun Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>*** UPDATED ON 03-22-05  I just want you all to know that if you have any problem, the Amazon people are great. My first Zen Micro was just a big ol' mess.  It eventually froze up on me, and no amount of Creative tech support could help. I contacted Amazon, and they had me send it back and replaced it at no charge. The new unit is perfect. It worked flawlessly and the songs downloaded perfectly. It's a whole new ballgame.  This thing is so very cool. I LOVE using Napster To Go with this MP3.  Also... check out Creative's site for the COOLEST matching speakers! They're called the Creative SBS Vivid 60. They come in 10 different colors to match your Micro. I don't see them on Amazon yet, but now that I have a working player, I'm ordering mine right away. And don't be put off about the lack of armband (it frustrated me that Apple had them everywhere for the iPod). I found one at Best Buy that worked just fine with it. I'm sure Creative will be coming out with accessories soon.  Oh, by the way... I've never used an iPod, but a friend of mine has the mini. And when she saw that I could delete a song from my player (or from a playlist) without hooking up to the computer, she was jealous. Apparently you can't do that with an iPod.  Kudos to Creative! I would now give it 4 stars, and that is only because I still think the product is kind of buggy, and it seems as if a lot of people have had problems. But again, order through Amazon and all will be fine. Believe me, the product is so cool that it will be worth it.   (original review, posted in February) I purposely purchased this product to work with Napster-to-Go.  I've never been an Apple/iTunes fan, and I liked a lot of the listed features of this MP3.  (Such as: removable battery, extra GB, ability to play WMA files, etc.) When I received the player, I charged it and fiddled around with the settings.  The touch pad WAS a pain for the first few hours, but as everyone else mentioned, it gets easier and it doesn't take long to feel comfortable with it.  After much fiddling around with the software install (which I found to be very cumbersome and time consuming), I then downloaded the Beta firmware to enable this player to work with Napster 2 Go. After more fiddling around, trying to figure out exactly how to proceed without any particular set of directions, I finally managed to transfer about 250 Napster-to-Go songs right from Napster. I have never had a problem with the hard drive crashing or freezing or anything like that.  They played beautifully.  I honestly love the looks, design, UI, etc. of this MP3.  It would have been so perfect...  Then three days later I sat down to download more songs. This time when I tried to transfer/sync them, Napster didn't recognize my player. So I tried to transfer them via Windows Media Player 10.  That, too, didn't recognize my player.  I called Creative tech support, and was run through a battery of uninstalls, reinstalls, restarts to the hard drive, etc.  Still ended up in the same place.  My Micro knows that it's docked, and it pulses to a charge, but nothing can transfer. I have spent hours fiddling around with it, even trying to use the Creative Systems software that came with it.  Even THAT didn't recognize that the player was plugged in. I also went out and bought a new USB 2 cord - yet nothing.  If I hadn't have done it just fine the first time, I'd just assume it was a faulty player. Since my errors that I'm getting are generic ("Windows Media has encountered an unknown error), no one seems to be able to help me.  So end result? It's been a week and although it plays the files that are on there wonderfully, I haven't done anymore downloading or transferring. There is still PLENTY of space on my hard drive. Everyone told me to go with an iPod, and you know what? I should have. It may not have the removable battery or a multitude of media options, but at least it's reliable.  Caveat emptor - this thing still has a lot of bugs to work out... good luck if you still decide to buy it! I'm sending mine back!

<Content>This player works great with Napster To Go, at least for me. I've had no problems at all and updating the firmware was an automatic procedure initiated by Napster to Go. About the Creative software not working after the firmware upgrade; It is supposed to be that way. Only Napster to Go and WMP 10 should recognize the player. The computer should also recognize it as a MTP device while connected to the USB. So far I am having a blast using this device with Napster to Go.

<Title>AWESOME Product!
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Here's the story: I just bought this player tonight and can't really vouch for battery life, but based on everything else in the player I assume it is great. At first, I was frustrated with the touch pad, but now I LOVE IT! It makes browsing through the music feel so smooth. I love the way the player looks, the rechargeable battery was a really great idea (I would get tired of going through throw-away batteries). I love the ability to sort through the songs by play list, randomly, by artist, genre, or by album. Brilliant little (and I do mean LITTLE as the size of this thing is also amazing) all-round music player. And sound quality is excellent. And if all that isn't enough, it serves as a voice recorder, fm radio, and FM RADIO RECORDER! Add Napster's "To-go" service and download all the music you want, to listen to on this player, on your computer, or just stream it over the internet -- only $14.95 and you are completely set to go... EXCELLENT product.

<Title>Mini IPOD move aside!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this little wonder and it's a incredible well built device.  Desing. Surprise by it sized. I have seen the MiniIpod and is similar in isze. The diference is in the casing. The MiniI has a aluminum casing, and the micro is a sturdy plastic. It's very well built, (drop it 3 times already from a 3 feet high and still working flawlesslly. It's time and feel good on your hand.  Buttons. A little too sensitive in medium. I could change it to low sensitivity but I got used to the medium setting. Very well distributed easy access.  Interface. MICRO - Easy to used. I didn't read the manual and figure it out how to use it in less than an hour. Still have some things to learn and I will need to read the manual afterall.  PC - I use WMP 10 to sincronized the device and it does it without problems. Transfer more than 2.5GB in 30 minutes, better than my older device (Sony NETMD 600 MB in 20 min). Haven't use the creative software yet. The additional hard drive is good. Let you choose how much memory are you going to sacrifice for usb Space (128MB-2GB).  Battery Life. It last a long weekend. I used for more than 8 hours and I used it for 2 more hours after the last bar of the battery disappear.  Buy iy, Is a little bit cheaper than the MiniIpod and is a well buit device. A true competitor. I didn't give it 5 because of the sensitiveness of the touchpad, But I'm 95% out of 100% satisfied.

<Title>Was Great Until 4 months later :(
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>---February 2005 I like my Zen Micro.  I got it because someone I knew recommended I try it.  It's small, cute, and really convenient for me.  The blue backlight glow makes everything look pretty nice.  I've had it for a little less than a month, so far so good.    I read some of the reviews of how it does lock up sometimes and you can't shut it down.  It's happened to me a few times so I just took out the battery and pushed it back in, and everything was back to normal.  I didn't update any firmware though.  I'll only do it if absolutely neccessary.  It definitely takes you a few minutes to get adjusted to the touch screen functions and menus, but it's not rocket science so don't worry!  I got pretty comfy zipping through them in about a half hour.   I find that if I set the touchpad sensitivity to "high" it works best for me.  I like the touch screen a lot :)  It's tricky though when you have gloves on, so working it outdoors in the cold can get frustrating, unless you plan on cutting a whole in the glove hehe.   The sound quality output and display of this little electronic is nice.  If you set the EQ functions right you have some nice bass pumping into your ears :) (battery usage goes up though).  My gripe with the headphones is that after an hour or so they begin to hurt your ears.  I just switched them with my panasonic earbuds and I was good to go though.  The battery life isn't super long but it'll last me about 2 days or more.  It varies depending how long I use it.  I definitely don't have the time to listen to it 24 hours a day.  But over two days I guess I listen to it approximately 6-7 hours (as opposed to 12 hours) before the battery dies.  I tend to fool around with the menus and switch songs often, instead of letting it play straight through, so that might be eating up some battery juice as well.  It's also good that you can replace the battery.  The software it came with is okay.  It took a few minutes to figure out how to transfer songs from the pc to the mp3 player but I got it.  Not the greatest but a regular run of the mill software to get you from point A to point B (if your usb port isn't being tempermental hehe).  There are a lot of functions/accessories it comes with that I don't really use too much, but can come in handy one day maybe, like the radio recorder, radio (fm is pretty weak in buildings), DJ-functions, time/date displays, data storage, player stand, and belt clip holder.  I give it 4 stars, isn't horrible, but some bugs need to be worked out, but I still love it and it's currently happily snug in it's own matching silicone case (not included in package).  ---Update 4 months later (june 2005)  It's been 4 months and now I have a major problem with the headphone jack.  The music comes out warped as if it's playing underwater.  I dont' know if it's a wear and tear issue but I've read on other forums where a couple of pple have experienced the same problem.  I thought maybe it was just the headphones but I've tried several other ones and the sound quality is the same.  The only way I've been able to successfully have music coming out normally is to either push the headphone plug slightly to the right or left of the headphone jack (which is very annoying because you can't put the player down and have to constantly hold it, unless you tape it (?)).  I guess it's a contact problem.    I'm thinking of getting another one and hoping it won't have that same issue, but who knows.  Hopefully Creative can solve this problem very soon if they can. I rated it 4 stars in february, still debating 3 stars heh.

<Title>The best MP3 player out there!!
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player is the best music player available for such a low price. It is much smaller than it seems to be in their pictures. It fits comfortably in your pocket. 5gb harddrive is a lot of space-almost 1250 songs. The removeable disk feature seems nice. It is worth the cost-every penny! It is easy to rip your CD's with the software they give you. Enjoy your Zen Micro! It is a great value.

<Title>REVISED: good and bad, but mostly good
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>got mine last year when it was a lot more expensive but I still love my Zen Micro. I recently discovered something though, that a lot of people don't seem to recognize. One of the things that happened to me was a firmware problem that was actually my PC's fault. A part of my registry had been deleted by another program which made certain plug and play features not work correctly. So if your Zen isn't recognized by Windows Media Player 10....If it beeps when connected but then disappears the problem is with your registry, not the zen micro. People assume the new product is always a fault, when often it is the machine it is being attached to that has the problem.  I wanted to point that out because this truly is a very good piece of equipment, it's just some elements of the PlaysForSure setup in XP and WMP10 have glitches. [...] An outstanding little player.  I was using my Dell Pocket PC as an mp3 player, did a good job, but just didn't have the storage capacity, the FM tuner, or the small size, here are my cons and pros:  Cons:   -FIRMWARE:  DO NOT UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.  I made the mistake of updating to version 2.10.05 when my player was working just fine.  What suddenly happened is the player worked, but my Dell Inspirion had problems.  The computer could find the Micro, but NONE of the programs, including Windows Media Player 10 could detect it.  I couldn't even downgrade the firmware.  I ended up having to load WMP 10 onto my roommate's computer (without any of the accompanying software) and voila, it found the Micro, so I downgraded the firmware to version 1.01.03.  Now everything is peachy. I know we all want the latest and greatest downloads for our equipment but in this case if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  MS OUTLOOK:  It syncs with my contact list fine, but the calendar leaves something to be desired, mainly half my appointments don't show up.  I figured out that for some reason if you have a recurring event, like a weekly meeting, it registers the first instance, but none of the others.  There does not appear to be a way to fix this in the software, so my guess is the bugs need to be worked out.  PROS: Software: The software it comes with is EASY to use.  MUCH easier than Windows Media Player 10.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to use Windows Media Player to sync anything.  It's got far too many confusing features.  Like I thought I was creating a playlist for my micro, but it turns out the "playlist" was actually just the songs I was transferring, and since I had already loaded them into the Micro, it didn't work. I'm an ubergeek, so I'm surprised a simple program is baffling me.  The creative software works just fine by itself.  Customization:  You can create whatever main menu you want.  If you want the time and date to be on the main menu, you can add it.  Sound Quality:  10 times better than with my pocket pc.  The sound  has more depth to it, and with all the built in EQ sets, and room for a custom made one, you can have the sound you want.  MS OUTLOOK:  While the calendar syncs badly, the contacts don't.  It's nice to be able to have this information on me should I need it.  FM Radio:  With all radios, it really depends on where you are.  But I got crystal clear reception for local chicago stations,  no problem.  TOUCHPAD:  I know some people hate this feature, but I think it rocks.  If you can easily use the touchpad on a laptop computer with rare problems, then the Zen Micro will be a breeze.  I haven't needed to adjust the sensitivity, although it did take me about an hour or so of fiddling with it to realize how easy and simple it is to use.  If you're having problems, just remember that less is more.  You're not pushing buttons, you're gently rubbing a touchpad.  I thought about getting the remote, but really I think the player itself is easy.  All in all I'd say future versions should be even better, but this one isn't a bad start.

<Title>BEWARE!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really wanted to like this thing.  Bought it despite all the bad reviews.  The big thing was the FM radio,  for use in the Gym which broadcast the TV on FM and also to listen to Jim Rome. Got it,  charged it,  and downloaded my songs onto it.  Sounded awesome the first day.  Next day still sounded great.  Charged it again,  then tried to download more songs onto it.  My computer won't even see it.  Plug it in,  it lights up,  but no joy.  Don't get the docking symbol,  Windows media doesn't see it,  nothing.  Can't even load the firmware onto it because the comnputer won't link to it to do it.  Tried startin it in recovery mode,  no joy. This thing is seriously flawed in the software.  Great design,  smaller than it looks in pictures,  and great sound.  but poor execution.  Sending it back for something else.

<Title>Creative Outdoes Apple
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite earlier misstpes in their mp3 players, Creative has outdone themselves with the Zen Micro. It's size amazes me, the sound is incredible, and its support for Microsoft's PlaysForSure techonology (and therefore it's support of Napster's new NapsterToGo service) is indispenisble.  Inside the box is everything you need: a charger, a USB 2.0 sync cable, a slip case, a hard case, and a pair of decent ear buds. The player is very stylish (at least the black model); even more so than its main competition, the iPod mini (which, I might add, costs $25 more and has a gig less.) My player was in perfect condition when I unpacked it. The thing that struck me immediately was just how small this device is. It fits perfectly in my hand, and while solid-feeling, it is not too heavy.  I still cannot believe that sound quality. The Zen Micro has five equalizer presets, as well as a manual equilizer, a neccesary feature for audiophiles. While the included ear buds are not great, they are decent for normal listening.  With a patch (which was not painless, but I did get it working) the player supports Windows Media Player 10, and Microsoft's Janus DRM. This allows it to interface with such services as Napster's NapsterToGo. For $14.99 a month you get unlimited listening and unlimited transfers of songs to your player, which is incredible.  And play music is not all the Zen Micro does. It also has a full pim (no idea why one would want a full pim in their music player, but obviously Creative thought there would be some use for it), a FM radio, a recording utility, and an alarm clock. While the FM radio gets a lot of static for stations which home radios pick up easily, it is a useful feature, especially since the radio can be recorded to the hard drive. Similarly, the recorder is not of the highest quality, but I imagine it will still come in handy.  The Zen Micro is not perfect (my main anoyance with it is the five second delay between playing songs), but it comes pretty close. If you want to have no part in iPod mania, this is a great player. More features, space, and for a better price than the comparable apple player.

<Title>Stopped working after one day
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking forward to the Zen Micro as I was going to use it with Napster To Go.  I have Napster on two computers at home.  When I set up the Micro, the first computer would not allow me to transfer any songs that I had not purchased.  Sort of ANTI-Napster To Go.  But the other computer did recognize the Zen Micro and would let me transfer all the tracks without buying them (as advertised).  Being an easy-going guy, I thought, what the hell, it works on one, I can live with that.  I transferred the tracks, maybe sixty at first and started to use the player.  The touch screen is everything you've read about: Terrible!  Even set on low, you can't operate it.  Just a light touch takes you to some menu you didn't want to visit.  It's maddening!  But still I thought I'm a techy, I can deal with it.  Maybe I just have to learn its quirks.  After another half hour, I took a rest.  Too many quirks.  I'll come back and resume training tomorrow.  Tomorrow comes and I turn on the Zen Micro (cute as a button, by the way) and it's frozen.  It won't play or even show me the songs that I had already transferred.  I figured I'd hook it up to Napster again, maybe shock it back to reality, but Napster didn't recognize it anymore, on any computer.  So now I look into the future and realize the next week of my life (at least) will be spent with tech support from both Napster and Creative.  Each will blame the other, obviously.  Life's too short.  I just want to listen to a few tunes, hum along, play a little air guitar.  I have an older Samsung model which has always worked beautifully.  Why did I listen to the hype.  Read the other reviews.  I'm not alone in these complaints.  After I send this one back, I'll probably just try another Samsung.

<Title>Good player with small issues
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well..I received my player about 14 days ago and love it, except for one thing- The headphone jack is malfunctioning, it was shorting out. At first I thought it was my headphones, but after trying several pairs, the problem persisted. When researching this issue, it turns out that most of Creative's mp3 players have this same problem, and the only way to fix it is to return it for repair or exchange. That sucks. Also, the touch pad is really sensitive at times and at others, it won't respond at all. Other than that, it is a great little player, very easy to use.

<Title>Great Player for Car & Exercise... Love Napster-To-Go
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok... I think I've owned and returned about every MP3 player on the market (ok, slight exaggeration).  I had the iLo (a Walmart brand of Go Video's Rave MP3 player... Great screen but only 256MB and serious firmware issues when using an expansion card over 512 MB), Creative Zen Xtra (unaccessable controls that are on the side of the unit and the hardest screen to read, especially in the car), a Philips MP3 player I got at Walmart (doesn't support downloaded music...why bother???) and the Rio Carbon.  I really fell in love with the Rio Carbon, since the screen was soo legible in the car (white background with black letters), the key pad on the front lit up to be able to see where the keys are in the car, and the sound was great.  But since Rio dropped the ball on releasing a firmware update to use Napster-To-Go (subscription-based music service, where you "rent" songs for an extra $5 a month on top of the $9.99 normal Napster service), and the problems with some headphones "buzzing", a week ago I decided to try the Creative Zen Micro...  THANK GOODNESS I DID!!!!  This is a great little MP3 player.  Many others have listed the usual features of this player, so I won't bore you with those.  I will, however, tell you the pros and cons of why I'm goning to keep this player over the others...  PROS: 1. ALL OF THE CONTROLS ARE ON THE FRONT OF THE PLAYER, AND THEY ALL LIGHT UP--- may not seem like something important, but I use my MP3 player mostly in the car, and having the menu, play/pause, forward, back, and volume controls on the front of the player, and having them all be backlit, makes it sooo easy navigate while in the car. Try using the scroll wheel on the top right-hand corner on the Rio Carbon to scroll down to "Van Halen" while going 70 mph on the highway...you might not make it past "Journey" before wrecking.  Since the Creative Zen Micro uses the Vertical Scroll Bar, you can use one finger to scroll up and down... very nice touch!  2. REMOVEABLE BATTERY THAT CHARGES USING USB MICRO PLUG--- since the battery life on these things is, in reality, about 6 hrs, having a removeable battery is nice to have.  And it charges using the USB connection, but would be better if it had a wall/car charger that you plug the USB cable into, like on the Rio Carbon.  3.  ACTUALLY WORKS WITH NAPSTER-TO-GO!!!!--- I had read horror stories about getting the firmware to upgrade properly, but I've had absolutely no problems with mine (my Mom got one too and she had no problems either).  Its great having 1100 songs on my MP3 player.  I only own 400 of them, but i get to rent essentially $700-worth of songs for an extra $5 a month.  This is an Ipod-killer feature!  4.  GREAT WEIGHT & CONTROLS FOR EXERCISING--- I've been walking with my Zen Micro, and it's nice to be able to control everything with my thumb.  Also, the DJ feature is great for keeping the music fresh as you're working out/exercising, and so you dont have to keep finding the next song or album to play.  5.  EASY TO READ SCREEN--- when in the car, it's imperative to be able to easily see the screen in a quick glance.  This screen is essentially a very light blue backlight with dark, dark blue lettering, compared to earlier Creative screens that have dark blue backlight with a slightly darker blue lettering.  Still not as nice as Rio Carbon's or Rave/iLo screens, but its vastly improved and easy to read.  Too bad you can't set the backlight to stay on all the time (30 sec max).  Oh, well, I can't have everything.  6.  THE SOUND IS FANTASTIC--- it can get nice and loud, unlike some other players, and the sound quality is about the best I heard (could use a little more bass).  7.  NEAT GLOWING FEATURE WHEN RECHARGING--- this was an unexpected feature that has no real usefulness, but it's quite cool.  as it's charging the light behind the controls glows brighter, then dimmer...as if it's breathing. useless, but a neat surprise.  CONS: 1.  HEADPHONE JACK IS THE MOST FRAGILE COMPONENT EVER MADE!!!--- as soon as I got my Zen Micro from Amazon.com, I downloaded a few songs and started playing it... stuck the headphones in the jack and.... no sound out of the right earpiece.  Boy was I mad!!!  Felt really screwed over by this product, but I informed Amazon.com and they sent me a new one overnite... THANKS AMAZON.COM!!! (Guess that's why you should buy from a reputable seller!!!) The new one has performed flawlessly, and my mom's has also.  Be careful using a large-rimmed 1/8" plug while the player is in the plastic case... the rim hits the top part of the plastic case and torques the headphone jack, thus causing the solder connection to break.  Use small plugs and don't put ANY force on the headphone plug/jack!!!!  (I use a short headphone extension cable that has a small, 90-degree plug from Radio Shack that is taped to the side of my plastic protective case so it has no stress on the jack, can't be jerked (the tape takes the shock instead of the jack) and so I don't have to remove the plug from the jack, since I frequently change from headphones to FM transmitter in the car.  It's worked great and hopefully this will prevent any future jack problems, but it's still rediculous that this is even a problem in the year 2005... How long has the headphone jack been in existence??? NO EXCUSE, CREATIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  For full disclosure, I am in NO way affiliated with any MP3 manufacturer, Amazon.com, nor Napster.  Also, I have no ill will against Ipods, I just think being able to "rent" and try music is a great idea after years of having to buy $18 CDs for one or two good songs.  I'm just a guy trying to find the "BEST" MP3 player out there that does what I want, and think, it should do.  I hope you enjoy whatever MP3 player you purchase.  They all have their own great features and headaches, but the Creative Zen Micro satisfies what I want in a mini-jukebox style MP3 player.  I hope my "real world" critique is helpful to you.  Good luck!

<Title>Average reviewer says Dissapointing.........................
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm no techno-whiz- this is my first mp3 player- so keep that in mind when I write. Still though, I'm a bright, educated person with what I think are realistic expectations.  I got the Creative Zen Micro specifically to go with Napster-To-Go. I chose this one because it sounded to be the most reliable of the three mp3 players Napster advertises. You can expect I was dissapointed when I hooked it into Napster for the first time, only to see "Device is not Napster compatible". No advice, no anything.   OK, I know enough to know that one often has to download drivers & firmware, so I go to the Creative website. There are a handful of different programs which can be downloaded, but no advice on which is needed. After a long wait, a technician advises me on the firmware I needed to be Napster compatible (it's the 2.10.05 firmware release, fyi).  So then I go to Napster & it works fine- I figure I'm home free. But what I notice right off the bat is that the touch pad is terribly over-sensitive, even on the lowest settings. Simply changing the volume would usually take me a minute, & typically result in losing the song I was playing.  Did I mention the number of songs one can download? I know that companies exaggerate, so I didn't expect to get a full "2500 songs" onto this device. Using Napster-To-Go, however, I can't even get half of that (I maxed out at a little over 1100), & that is with 4 minute long songs- no operas here.  And the "12 hour" battery. Uh-uh. Try 8 hours.  OK, so it was a pain to set up & the company was misleading- what's new? I figured I still had an attractive player with good sound & alot of features.  At least until Napster quit recognizing it again. I re-installed the firmware mentioned above, but to no effect. I played around for an hour trying different downloads & finally found a combination that worked (God forbid the site provide instructions).   So now Napster recognizes my device. Cool, right? Wrong. Now my "licenses are not valid", so I can't use the mp3 at all for now. And God forbid the the company that charges you > $200 for this thing has customer support on the weekend, when a working person has the time to call.  And did I mention that the bundled Jukebox software fails to recognize my mp3? Or that the software wouldn't install at all on my second computer?  I can't say I have any better advice for anyone reading this, but at least know what an average guy goes through dealing with this crap. I wish I had gotten a different machine. I don't have unlimited time "9-6, Monday-Friday" to wait an hour on some undertrained 20 year old to pass my problem along to a "senior technician" who then never calls back. Bleh~

<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all I was very pleased with the imprssion i got when it came out of the box. I think it looks much cooler than the ipod with the glowing lights. I have owned the ipod mini and i would say the zen is slightly better. Good: 1. Removable battery makes listening time greatly increase. 2. Fm radio and recording is useful. 3. Calendar and contacts are a nice feature. 4. Sound quality much improved. Bad: 1. The software is much worse than itunes. 2. Scroll wheel on ipod much easier to use. 3. Not as many accessories as ipod that you can buy.

<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.   Space : 5GB =2500 songs. If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection. Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs. I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user). PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   Battery : A Big Big plus. Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. Zen micro does. I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each). Remember this is a huge plus when travelling. Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness. Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.   FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.  Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.    Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones. The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones). The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. Its compact and has rounded edges. Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine. You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).  Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative. This is a must have. Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging. FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking

<Content>This product is amazing!!! I got it 3 days ago and I am in love with it. Before buying it I had had a lot of worries about the Zen Micro because it wasn't as well known as an IPOD and I wasn't sure if it would work very well, but it works great! It's easy to use, the sound is great, downloading songs is fast and once you know how to do ti, it is very simple, it not only stores 2,500 songs but it has radio with great reception as well, and it is really cute and stylish. I would recommend this player strongly especially if you are deciding between an IPOD and a Zen Micro because it works just as well and I like it and almost everyone I have shown it to likes it MUCH more. It's smaller and lighter than an IPOD and I think it looks much cuter. I have had no problems with it at all and can't even find the smallest complaint.   You should buy it!!!

<Title>great mp3 player!!!
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my zen micro yesterday and I've been fiddling with it for hours and its great!! I was a little hesitant to buy it because of all the bad reviews it got, but i thought hey its cute and if it doesn't work i'll just send it back! So i got it yesterday and i opened it up and i was amazed at how small and tiny it is...it is soooo small and i have small hands so i didn't want something huge that i couldn't carry.  It will fit perfectly in your pocket! I think it's even smaller than the mini ipod so take that apple!!! Alright so i opened it up was in awe of how cute it was and then i thought ok so is it going to work? I plugged it in and it lit up in this blue glow and it just made it 8 times cooler.  I plugged in the headphones oh so carefully because a lot of ppl said they break, but they both worked and still are working.  It never crashed, but it did go into sleep mode very quickly, but i just fixed it so it goes to sleep in 30 minutes.  So I listened to the little demo they have on it and i thought the sound was very good.  I just really don't like the little headphones they give you...very ipodesque...they always fall out of my ears, but thats just a personal preference or just an inability to deal with a simple headphone design whatever you want to call it!! So i plugged it in and let it charge and then i went to work with it.  I installed it in my computer and had a little trouble with the program to import songs and i still don't know what "rip a cd" means, but i'm guessing it's burning a cd...okkkkkk. So i did have a little trouble and i thought well i'll just leave it alone let it fully charge and wait until the help line is open.  I waited till this morning and I called just now and i was expecting to wait for half an hour like i had to with my music dowloading program, but it was so speedy!! it rang it asked me to punch in a few numbers and then a person picked up!! i was stunned.  So i was having some problems and the guy on the line helped me out.  He really knew what he was doing and it was fixed immediately.  So people that are a little wary about the reviews that say it has hard software don't worry you non-computer geeks, they're helpline will sort everything out!!!   So in short a great mp3 player.  Cute stylish and works great.  Now i've only had it for 1 day granted, but people who said they had problems had them from the moment they turned it on, so i'm expecting everything to turn out great.  Had a little trouble at first with the software, but called the help line (very speedy and helpful) and they sorted everything out.  It plays great and no crashing at all!! So if you want to avoid the whole ipod craze i highly recommend this mp3 player.  It's smaller than the ipod and cuter and comes in more colors (mines black which i think is cool, but i kind of wish i'd gotten the silver).  Oh and you can replace the battery which you can't do with the ipod and it has a radio and a voice recorder which the ipod doesn't have!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Buyer Beware, Decent MP3 Player, with One Major Flaw
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The major flaw exist, namely, the headphone jack which fails sooner or later on many Creative Zen Micro.  [...]  Now it is useless to have all those great feature if you are getting only audio channel or no sound.  Some poor souls on the forum are on the 3 or 4th replacement, and has yet find one without the dreaded headphone  jack problem.  The audio on my unit started fading on the first day, after a week, the left channel (audio) is totally no matter how much I wiggle the headphone connection.  It cost me $39 to courier it back to Creative Labs for repair or replacement, as soon as I receive the new unit, I will be sure to sell it  off right away.  Until Creative Labs fix this problem, I would recommend that you save yourself the future headache and buy an Ipod Mini or Iriver H10 instead.

<Title>Nice little Player
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I picked up my Zen Micro yesterday and after I recovered from spending $240, I began to fall in love with this little player.  My reason for buying the player was so I could record the lectures in my Seminary classes.  When I opened the box I was a little surprised that it didn't have more of a manual, but after a few minutes of tinkering with it I found all the features that I was planning to use the most.  There are just a couple things that keep me from giving the Micro a 5th star. 1. Some of the features that you are looking for are buried in menus, however once you find them their no trouble. 2. The touch pad is almost too sensitive.  I immediately adjusted mine to "heavy" touch and at times I inadvertantly hit one of the buttons.   3. Fast forwarding through a song can be difficult, but this is mostly due to the touch sensitivity.  You have to press and hold the fast forward button to skim through a song, but if you lift just a little bit more than you think is fine you'll skip to the next audio clip. 4. The software is not that intuitive, it takes some fumbling around to find stuff.  On the other hand I did give it 4 stars because 1. It is very small, and when you're lugging a 8lbs laptop to class the last thing you want is more weight. 2. The audio quality is superb. 3. The screen is backlit-unlike the iPod  4. The buttons are pretty clear-unlike the iPod 5a. It has a wonderful microphone that records at 64kbps (unlike the iPod mini) which is really good for recording notes or lectures. 5b. The microphone is really sensitive, but doesn't get cluttered up with background noise.  I recorded today's lecture and the playback is excellent, very clear and crisp. 6. The battery life is really good, fully charged I used my Micro today off and on for about 9 hours, and it still didn't die on me.  The Micro is a nice little MP3 player, another nice thing is that I didn't have to buy a seperate microphone adapter.  So far I am very pleased with my Micro, and I can rest easy knowing that this thing that is smaller than my wallet is worth what I paid.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had several MP3 products over the last few years, including the Apple Ipod. I've found it so hard to fill so many Gigs with music, so I was excited when Napster came out with their music rental service. A lot of people have criticized such a service, but I don't see how it is any different from using something like Netflix or XM radio. I will now get to try a much larger variety of music. Besides, how many people really listen to 5GB of music more than a couple times?   Anyways, I originally purchased an iRiver H10, but had a hell of a time getting it to sync properly with Napster music. Sometimes it would work, but other times, I would have "license management" problems. The battery life was also about 7 hours, instead of 12.   The Zen Micro feels very comfortable in my hand. It feels very well built; better built than the Ipod Mini. Several people have already commented on its looks. The touchpad does take time to get used to, but after you do, I don't think it is any better or worse than the Apple touchwheel. The sound quality is superb; my classical music tracks are clear and very musical.   The included headphones are nice and look quite similar to Apple headphones, but with much better bass response.

<Date>Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I tried to use this with napster to go and it didnt work. I had to return it after pulling my hair out and trying every fix. Buyer beware. Also, make sure you double check your player at the store as mine was literally falling apart at the seems.  The battery life was also shameful. Even though napster to go doesnt work with iPod, I would still recommend an iPod over the zen micro for napster-- folks, thats how bad this thing is

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It was easy to load songs onto this player.  However, I had to return for refund within two weeks because the inner display screen cracked, making it impossible to see what was playing.  Amazon replaced it, and two weeks later, I had a new problem--the headphone jack stopped working.  This is not a well made item and I would recommend ipod or another player which has a better quality. The only good thing to come out of this was that Amazon proved to provide excellent customer service.

<Title>Creative Zen VS. Ipod Mini
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own both the Apple Ipod Mini Second Generation and the Creative Zen Micro. I just recently purchased both of these, just to test them out and see which I like better. Here is what I found:  SIZE: The Creative Zen Micro is smaller, height-wise, but thicker than the Ipod. The Zen is probably easier to carry around because it's about the size of a flip phone. The Ipod Mini however is thin and can easily fit in any pocket. Both are relatively small and portable.   USER-INTERFACE: Both players have "touch" buttons making it easy to scroll through songs. The Zen is all touch, every control button is touch. That is different from the Ipod, which only the navigation click wheel is touch. I, personally, have found that the Mini is easier to control and has a better user-interface. The Zen is hard to control and you will find that when you scroll through 1000+ songs, the design of the touchpad makes it difficult. The Ipod on the other hand has a clever and slick wheel, so it is much easier to scroll through a library of songs. The "clicking" instead of touch on the Ipod also makes it easier to control. I found that with the Zen, just to change to the next song I would have to press the arrow button multiple times before it changes. So Apple gets kudos for their user-interface, Creative needs work.  PROBLEMS: I've had both players now for about a month, and already the Zen is giving me problems. First, after the first night I purchased it the headphone jack stopped working. I could only hear through one ear for a while until I readjusted the slot and then I could hear through both. I've read other reviews from different sites, and I have learned that I am not the only one who has had problems with this. It is a common problem. Just recently, my LCD screen stopped working. The player was on and running and the screen just blacked out. The backlight was still on and the buttons were still working, I could still control what song I was playing, I just couldn't see it. I turned it off and took out the battery, put it back in, turned it on and then it worked. Then it blacked out again, I did this about 5 times and then it started to work again. Since then, I havn't had any problems yet. If it continues to have problems, I will contact Creative myself.  The Ipod, however, has not given me any problems to this date. It is contructed very solid, I can't say the same about the Zen.  BATTERY: Battery life for both players is great. The Zen has about 12 hours when fully charged, and the Mini has a whopping 18 hours. It seems like a big difference, but it really isn't. 12 hours is enough to listen for an entire day, then you can just charge it again. Each player takes about 3 hours to charge.   ACCESSORIES: The only thing that dissapointed me with the Mini is the lack of accessories. The Zen is an entirely different story and comes with an AC adapter, a very nice pouch for protection, and a USB cable. The Mini, however, only comes with a USB cable. So charging? Well, while transferring music or whenever the Mini is connected to your computer via USB it is charging. This has it's advantages and disadvantages. There are many situations where it would be more convenient to hook up the Mini into a power outlet, well to do that you would need to purchase an extra adapter. The Zen will come with all accessories needed for any user.   DESIGN: I have to give it up to Creative for coming up with this very slick design. Apple has kept with it's very simple, not too much detail for their Ipods for a while now. Some like it that way. I like it also, it's very easy to see how to use it because there aren't that many buttons to toy with. It's all right there, what you see is what you get. The Zen has all the buttons colllided, going sideways, up and down. It's all over the place, but it looks really nice. Also, on the Zen there is a backlight, just like the Ipod. But the backlight is not just on the screen. On the Zen, the light goes through the buttons and has an outline around it. This makes it look very cool in the dark. And makes it easy to see everything. The Mini's backlight is just on the screen but it's very bright.   CONCLUSION: Overall, I am happier with the Mini, even though the Zen gave it some competition. The new Mini is now only $199, and the Zen is $229. There is a difference because the Zen has 5GB instead of the 4GB the Mini carries. I picked the Mini because it's just easier to use. I love the click wheel, I think it is extremely clever. Creative gave a tremendous effort to try to put something out there that would give Apple a run for it's money. I think it did just that, the Zen is probably the highest competitor for Apple, and if they just worked on improving certain areas, it could be huge.

<Title>Mixed feelings: small, stylish, but unreliable.
<Date>Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player for several reasons. I wanted something small and portable, which would support lossless file formats, include customizable EQ, and have good sound quality throughout. I am an audiophile, and I was going to use it in conjuntion with the Etymotic Research ER-4P and the Stax SR-001 Mk II canalphones, which are of the highest quality. I searched around, got a pretty good price, and decided to pull the trigger.  I honestly cannot say that it lived up to my expectations. It's not a bad player, but it's a very new one, and like most new products, it still has issues that have to be worked out. I've decided to go ahead and write this review to tell others about them. Please do keep in mind that this is from an audiophile's perspective, and I am substantially more demanding than the average user.  The good:  - The player itself is very small and very stylish. I didn't buy it for style, since I don't care what something that will never leave my pocket will look like, but whenever I do take it out, I often get commens like: "Wow, what's that! It looks so cool!" Yes, it does. The blue backlighting is very neat, and overall the fit and finish is of the highest quality. On looks alone, this player is a winner.  - I've heard complaints about the touchpad, but I haven't experienced any difficulties. I'm pretty dextrous, so if you've got clumsy fingers you might have a problem. I suggest that you set the keypad sensitivity to the highest setting. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the touchpad becomes much more responsive and easier to operate. The menu system is logical, and pretty much everything is within easy reach. I never had to refer to the manual once to find out how something worked.  - The sound quality isn't bad, though it isn't very good either. Of course, in an mp3 player, the quality will depend most on the quality of the files you're playing and the quality of the headphones that you use with it. There's very little difference in the playback quality among the players themselves. In this particular case, though, the sound is pretty clean and fairly neutral. It won't compete against a good portable CD player, much less a full-size player, but it will hold it's own against other mp3 players. Of course, the included earphones are utter garbage, but I wasn't going to use them anyway.  The bad:  - The player supports only a few formats - mp3 up to 320kbps, wma up to 320kbps, and wave. Unfortunately, wave is the only lossless format that it will play. Now, as far as quality goes, wave is very nice, much better than 320k wma or mp3, but a whole album encoded in wave takes, on average, 750 megabytes of disk space. Since the Micro only has 5 gigabytes, you can only fit 6 or so albums before you run out of room. In other lossless formats, such as wma lossless or flacks, an album takes up 250 megabytes on average, which will let you fit much more high-quality music. I had expected that a firmware upgrade would expand support for these file formats, but this hasn't happened so far. Compressed music, such as 320kbps mp3's, doesn't sound nearly as good as lossless music, especially on hi-fi earphones such as the Etymotic ER-4P.  The ugly:  - The included software did not recognize my player when it was attached to my PC, and nothing that I tried ever changed that. In the end, I used Windows Explorer to upload music. Now, my PC is top of the line, so it's not a backwards compatibility issue. I would have expected a large company such as Creative Labs to put more effort into their software.  - There is an EQ unbalance between the two channels. The left channel has slightly more bass. It's not a major issue for most users, but when you're using hi-fi gear, flaws such as this become very apparent. I will have to contact Creative's customer support and try to get them to send me another player.  - The EQ is unusable. Pushing the bass frequencies into gain results in massive distortion. Using the EQ subtractively (i.e. dropping output across channels rather than raising them) results in less distortion, but it is nevertheless present. I have to keep EQ off in order to maintain any semblance of quality.  - The included earphone cord doubles as the radio antenna, and if you want to use the radio receiver function, you have to use the stock earphones. This is a major design oversight in my opinion, since the radio function is one the main advantages this player has over the competition.  The verdict:  3 stars. Would I buy it again, given the choice? No. I would get the iPod mini instead, or perhaps a full-size iPod. This is a very pretty player, to be sure, and it is very well built. However, many features are poorly implemented, and others just plain don't work. It gets the job done, but for more demanding customers, I would recommend something else instead.  Lastly, if you already own this player, or any other mp3 player for that matter, here are a few suggestions to get the most practicality out of it:  1) Replace the earphones that came with it. Their quality is terrible, and the player is capable of much better sound than these earphones allow you to achieve. If you have the money, the Etymotic Research ER-4P and ER-6i are very good, as are the Shure e3c, e5c, and Westone UM2. The best sounding portable you can get, other than ultra-high-end custom-molded canalphones is the Stax SR-001 Mk II. For a cheaper alternative, the Sharp MD-33 canalphones and the Koss KSC-35/75 clip-ons are very highly recommended. Stay away from anything Bose, and the Bang & Olufsen A8! They're very overpriced for the sound quality they provide! It is truly unfortunate that Apple has decided to use the Bose Triports as their demo headphone of choice. The Triports are very, very subpar, and do not competently demonstrate the sound quality that the iPod can achieve! They should have gone with the Sennheiser HD595 instead, or maybe the Grado SR-60.  2) Disable EQ, or use EQ subtractively. Don't push frequencies into gain. For example, if you want to increase the bass, then decrease all frequencies other than the bass - i.e. mids and treble - and raise the volume. This is one of the basics in hi-fi, and it will improve your sould quality significantly.  3) Don't use low-bitrate encoding. 128k mp3's are very poor in quality. 192k is better, but you need at least 240k and above in order to preserve the soundstage and microdetail of the original recording. Try encoding your CD's in lossless formats such as wave. You will be amazed at the difference in sound!  I hope this helps. I apologize for the length, but there were some things that I just had to say.

<Title>COOL MP3 PLAYER and MORE!
<Date>Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is just about the coolest thing out there! The touch-pad is a little sensitive, but you get used to it pretty quickly. And, the advertised '2500 song capacity' is only realistic if you are loading at 56. You will more likely be loading songs at 128 or better for the sound quality, so expect a capacity more like 1200 songs. The radio is a little weak, but a great feature if you are relatively near a good station. The size and looks are, however, PERFECT - especially the way cool blue backlight when you engage the touchpad or while it is charging! All in all, this is simply a terrific little player.

<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Really love this thing. It is the IPOD plus a radio and voice recorder so I couldn't resist. Very well made. The software is very easy to use also. 2500 songs is incorrect if you are uploading MP3's - more like 1000. Very small and easily rechargable - battery is removable also, so you can buy more then one. Instead of a "clickwheel" you use a touchpad - if you have ever used a laptop with a touchpad it is the same deal. Very big fan!!  Update: just wanted to let you know the player is still kicking and I am loving it more and more as time goes on. So easy to use, quality is just great. Couldn't be happier.

<Content>Who can say, what I will say is this is one superb sexy looking gadget.  The touch pad gets a little bit of getting used to, but once you know what you're doing accessing tracks, albums or bands is a doddle.  The headphones supplied I threw straight in the bin and bought some Sennheiser MX500's for 5. Sound quality is excellent, I've uploaded 1500 tracks @98kps and I've still got 573Mb of memory.  The DJ feature is a nice touch with Album Of The day, Random Play All etc..  The Creative software is top notch too, allowing you to compile playlists, delete and rename tracks, and most importantly, upload music to the device. (you can also use Windows Media Player)  I've had my player since Christmas and I've been nothing but delighted with it, currently I have 1,505 tracks uploaded with 139mb free.

<Title>Not a 'sport model'? I beg to differ. 
<Date>Sun Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Zen Micro after carefully reviewing players through all my geek magazines and passed on the Carbon for the Zen Micro. I've never looked back. Value for the buck right now compared to the iPod mini, Rio Carbon...well, there is no comparison. At 5GB I'm still trying to see if I can fill it up. Plus you get the hard case, usb cable, recharger and if the battery does die, you can just buy another one and put it in yourself.   All the magazine reviews rated the Zen Micro mid to low on the sports scale. I have to disagree. I cycle and carry the Zen in the pocket of my shirt. I've yet to experience a single skip after about 600 road miles. Also, I did a header over the handle bars. My ear buds came out and when I put them back in the player was still going.   The touchpad does take some getting used too. I recommend playing with the settings and finding your comfort level.   I can't really come up with anything negative to say about the Zen Micro, except, what happened to yellow?

I love the touchpade controls. They're easy to use.The radio and voice recording are nice. The earbud headphones are really nice. The battery has a long life. It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. It's faster than WMP. So far I have no complaints with this player. If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.

<Title>Nice Player, Lousy Software
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been working with computers since the Altair 8800 (around 1975).  I'm currently a senior Information Systems Manager with a major Federal Government agency.  I received my Zen Micro about two weeks ago (of course, I ordered it about two days before its price dropped $40 or so).  It comes nicely packaged and did not include an extra battery (of course, I ordered it about two days after that promotional offer ended...).  In the two weeks I have had my Zen Micro, I have yet to be able to get the software that came with its included CD-ROM to work properly.  The first time I installed it, Mediasource (the very klunky interface program for the Zen) told me several times my Zen was not connected to the PC (even thought my PC had detected it and loaded the device driver).  After six or eight attempts to connect the Zen and to get Mediasource to either recognize it or not shut down due to some error, it finally worked...ONCE!  Only one time was I able to transfer a batch of MP3s over to the Zen.  In the past two weeks, after removing/reinstalling all the software that came with the Zen (no fewer than 10 times), about 18 e-mails from Creative with troubleshooting ideas (most of their troubleshooting ideas have been repetitive, but I will give them credit, they are VERY responsive), along with attempts to get the software to work on three PCs in my house with different OS's (Windows ME, XP, and 2000), I have no choice but to give up on this player.  Too bad, it does seem like the player itself is quite nice, but the software that comes with it just refuses to work on any of my computers.  Not only that, but since the first installation of the software that came with the Zen Micro, the sound and the USB mouse no longer work on one of my PCs.  I'm continually getting random errors and freeze ups as well (even after uninstalling everything in Safe Mode).  To add insult to injury, I can't even add a sound device to the computer in Device Manager any more, and my USB port won't "auto-detect" the mouse when I connect it--I have to manually reinstall the mouse every time I boot the computer.  The player itself gets four stars, but the software package that accompanies it gets ZERO.

<Title>NOT NAPSTER TO GO FRIENDLY
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My girlfriend purchased the Creative Zen Micro for one purpose...to use the Napster To Go feature where you pay a monthly fee for unlimited downloads onto your portable player.  Both Napster and Creative claim that the Zen Micro is compatible with this service.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!  I repeat....GOOD LUCK!!!!  I spent countless hours trying to get Napster To Go to work with the Zen Micro with no luck whatsoever.  This was a few weeks ago and I have waited to write this review until my anger subsided enough so that I could type without shaking!  The details have faded, but the feeling has not.    Basically the player will not be recognized by Napster to Go as a valid player for that service and will not download songs to the device.  The next step I followed ended up being the demise of the Creative Zen Micro.  I downloaded the latest firmware that was supposed to be a fix of the "Napster To Go Compatibility Issue" and installed it in the Zen Micro.  What happened next was devastating....THE COMPUTER WOULD NO LONGER RECOGNIZE THE ZEN MICRO!!!!!!!!!  We had to send the player back and my girlfriend was charged shipping and handling by Amazon.  Both for the original shipping of the Zen Micro to her house and for the return shipping.  Summary....My girlfriend spent $11 for me to spend hours of hell trying to get the Creative Zen Micro to work with Napster to Go.

<Title>Great little toy
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My 2 choices were this and the iRiver H320 (wanted Napster to go compatibility) Chose this because of the replaceable battery. The unit is very small, a little bit bigger than a closed flip phone.  You'll hardly notice it in your pocket.  The controls are easy to use and nicely arranged.   If you download the firmware updates so you can use it with Napster, you'll also need to download another version of the Zen Micro Media Explorer update (the cd that comes with it isn't compatible with the new firmware) and there's no way to organize your files without it: Napster and Media player stink for that purpose.  All in all, its a great unit.  Don't buy all the iPod hype and pay 99 cents per song.  Buy the Zen Micro and pay $15 per month for unlimited music.

<Title>Better than an IPOD!
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Smaller and louder than an IPOD! Nice touch feel and a lot cheaper! This is the one Creative has been trying to make to beat an IPOD and in my opinion they have! The ability to change your own battery was one of the key points for me, FM radio {not a feature I'll ever use}, Voice recording, sync to Outlook, all nice touches. The ability to drag-n-drop from Windows {which other Creative players had lacked},  I really like using MusicMatch Plus and it works great with it, I was unsure because I could not find any information anywhere before buying if it would work with this particular player and it does very nicely, and without a Plug-In. I highly recommend this MP3 player to anybody! Great job Creative, finally some competition for Apple!

<Content>This middle aged woman is love, love, loving this new toy.  It's now my favorite battery operated thing in my house! %-)  This baby is so intuitive to use.  I already have 80+ cds in it and just love the easy use.  I have sub lists set up for songs that lift my spirit, cardio lists for the bike at the gym, a list of love songs about my partner, and my very own ultimate recovery list.  I love that I can have it randomly play music by category too.  It's like my own personal radio without ads.  BTW I chose pink because I just knew my 15 year old son wouldn't be caught dead carrying a pink mp3 player.    I have already used it while cleaning the house, running errands, shopping, working in the yard, at the gym, traveling.  I'm just waiting to see the tv ads of the middle agers embracing this technology.  I could write the ads for them.  Thanks Creative!

<Title>A nice Musical Experience.... 
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.  Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.  However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.  In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.    So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.  I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.  I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  I have a lot of songs that I need to download.    I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could pick it up from the store.   So I decided on the black one.  And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.  It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   There were two downloads I had to complete.  One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.  I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.  And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.  Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists.   The sound is very nice.  I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.  It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.  So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.  I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.  Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.    Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    PS.  I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN. :-)  www.zetazen.com

<Title>the troubles i went through...
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I got my Zen, I was excited because not only was it small and aesthetic, the sound was great. I installed the software into my computer, and put the songs onto my zen, however the second time I tried to transfer the songs, it didn't work. The computer didn't pick up that I plugged my zen in, and the "creative zen micro" icon on the Organizer didn't show up. I was really frustrated and called the Creative help line, (who were by the way helpful, polite and I didn't have to wait to long for the line to connect). The guy told me to do all these weird things with my computer, but the main thing was to uninstall the software. It took more than three hours to uninstall and reinstall it, and I knew i can't POSSIBLY do this EVERY time I want to transfer songs on it...I was about to return the mp3, thinking of getting an ipod.  However, I tried to use to Zen on my mother's laptop, and it worked perfectly! The computer was able to pick up mp3 player every time I plugged it into the USB cable!  Maybe of you may experience the same problem I did, and it's not the zen, its the computer that you are using. I suggest try to install the software on a computer that isn't loaded with junk and it more recent.  By the way, the clip-on holder sucks, I used my old Nextel cell phone holder as a case, and it works excellently. (Its the case that has a "leather" back and a clear front--you can slip the zen into it, and the clear front lets you navigate the touch-pad) I hope I helped!

<Title>VERY DISAPPOINTING!!
<Date>Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my brand new Zen Micro on Friday. A beautiful red one. I plugged it in, got it charged, put my songs on it, and listened to it for about 15 minutes. It had great sound! I didn't listen to it for the rest of the weekend. Monday morning, I am on my way to the train, I go to turn it on, and it is dead. COMPLETELY DEAD! I tried everything to make it work. I looked on the Creative message boards, wrote to people, called Customer Service, did what they said....nothing. I am now in the process of sending it back for an exchange. I would like to give it one more chance before asking for my money back. I am so disappointed that it's so buggy. While looking on the Creative site, I saw that there were many other people having this problem. What can I say? I didn't think it would happen to me so soon!! I thought I would be able to get more than 15 minutes use out of this product. Well, it sounded good for the short time it worked, but I would suggest waiting for the next better version or buying another brand completely. I wish I would have heeded the few negative reviews I saw here on Amazon....

<Title>Zen Mastery 
<Date>Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Zen Micro to use with "Napster To Go" based on my positive experience with the 60GB  "Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra". After using the Micro only occasionally over a 17 days period the machine's hard drive turned out to be defective (confirmed by a call to Creative's tech support). I called Amazon and they overnighted me a new unit and I returned the defective unit. I have now given the second unit very heavy use for about two weeks with only one minor problem that was easily resolved (unit froze up while shutting down - removed and reinserted the battery and everything was fine).   All in all the Zen Micro works well with "Napster To Go" (you have to upgrade to the latest firmware version which was straight forward, and if you want to continue to use the accompanying software applications: Zen Explorer and Media Source in addition to Napster you need to upgrade them too - again a straight forward procedure - download the file from Creative's site and run it.) Works well with non-Napster To Go files too and both peacefully coexist on the player.  The sound is terrific and I actually love the headphones that came with the Zen. I am partial to this type of headphones though. The volume seems fine to me I play it on 16 on the subway and 10 in the office. At late night it can even go down to a 4. In a car using an FM transmitter I pump up the volume to about 20 and the car stereo volume to about 2/3 of the way. The smart volume setting is really useful and works well.   As others have pointed out the belt clip that comes with the Micro is really very flimsy. I treated it gently and never actually used it to clip to my belt just my shirt pocket and some external speakers (see below) but after a week when I went to unclip it the clip went flying off and the small plastic hinge that holds the spring to the clip had broken. It is not common knowledge (at least I couldn't find it on their website) but if you call Creative Sales you can purchase replacement clips for $4.95 each if you want to continue to replace them.     The touch pad control works great after adjusting the sensitivity setting. Originally I set it to light but it was still too sensitive, someone suggested setting it to heavy and that worked great now after a couple weeks use I find that I had to set it back to medium because I've acclimated to a lighter touch.   No one has mentioned that you have the ability to personalize your Micro with your name on the "Player Settings" screen, so I'll point that out. Also I don't think it's been mentioned that Vajacases makes great custom-built leather cases for the Micro in solid or mix and match colors of your choice with optional (sturdy) belt clip and the option to have your name embossed on the case.  A remote available separately at Creative comes in a choice of black or white works well (on/off, pause/play, forward/backward, volume up/down, lock, radio toggle). The faceplate is only loosely attached however and fell off of mine, again with gentle treatment, I superglued it back on and now it is quite sturdily attached.   The unit can be easily clipped on to a pair of Altec Lansing inMotion external speakers made for the iPod. Just clip it to the bar between the two speakers and use the plastic cover that comes with the speakers to cover the connector underneath the player. This allows you to see the face of the Zen should you want to look to see what song is playing. A word of caution though as mentioned above the clip is flimsy and could conceivably break and release the Zen.   Battery life seems good, I played it for 9 hours on volumes ranging between 10 and 16, occasionally accessing the menus to change playlists and songs and still had one of the three bars showing on the battery life indicator, so it appears it would have reached the 12 hours of usage time had I continued to use it without recharging.  While the Creative Sales seems to be run off-shore the tech support line is operated out of Oklahoma. The unit comes with 60 day of telephone support but it is not toll free. Still I've called 3 times (twice for my Xtra once for the Micro the time the hard drive was defective on the first unit) and have never had to wait for more than a minute or two to speak to a tech person. The tech staff are very knowledgeable, courtesy, and helpful.  The rest has been covered by other reviews. Had I not experience the problem with the defective hard drive I would have rated this 5 stars.

<Title>Lots of problems
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had a great first three weeks with this product and then out of nowhere...it failed.  And failed.  And failed.  And then failed some more.  Every time I tried to restore the firmware something else would go wrong.  Waiting for Creative to ship a new one.  If that one doesn't work, I'll try another brand or wait for something better.   Beware of the new Napster.  I talked to a service rep from Creative and he said there had been quite a few problems with Napster to Go, because it was rushed to the market.  If you don't update your songs daily or at least plug into Napster with your Zen then you risk your songs being erased because of the firmware that is installed.  Be very wary of this product.

<Content>This is the perfect MP3 player if you are looking for a pocketsize.  memory (5) gigs and good market value.    PROS -  very small, very stylish - the blue light on the borders illuminate and "breathe" when charging  unbreakeable - I've dropped mine so many times  Easy to use in the car - lightly touch the pad, it lights up in the dark, easy to feel out while driving  Headphones with the set are actually good quality  Touch sensitivity can be adjusted so you can browse with efficiency  CONS -  Battery life is more like 4 hours  Freezes in weather under 40F, but I just pop out the battery and pop it back in and it works fine  Software not the easiest to use, good if you don't transfer much

<Title>Info especially if you want to use "Napster to go"
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just purchased the Creative Zen Micro from Amazon and received it yesterday (4/5/05)My purpose for choosing this product is to use with the new "Napster-to-go" subscription service.  I followed the manual...installed per each instruction!  But upon attempting to transfer files under the terms of this new Napster plan (unlimited transfer of tracks without paying .99 cents/track) I got a pop up window from Napster telling me I'd connected a device that does NOT work with the "Napster to go" service plan.  That's impossible, I tell myself.....I *selected* this product from the Napster list of MP3 devices compatible with the new service!  So....I make the (long distance) call to Creative tech support (no hourly fees for 1st 60 days but NO 800#) and the consultant was courteous, knowledgable, helpful...and I wasn't on hold for 12 years!!  This is the bottom line:  you MUST install a FIRMWARE upgrade in order to make this device compatible!  This can be done on Creative's website.  My tech guy gave me step by step details on navigating to the upgrade.    The one thing that gives cause for some caution...the firmware upgrade is a beta version.  They've posted this disclaimer:  *********************************************  IMPORTANT: This is a beta (unfinished) version of this update. Before installing beta firmware, you should understand that a beta release does not have the stability of released Creative firmware. You could experience problems while using it.  Beta releases are meant for testing and validation, so you may encounter problems with a beta release that could possibly result in loss or corruption of data, require a reformat of the device, or, in extremely rare cases, may render the device inoperable. ********************************************** Inoperable??  YIKES!  BUT...without the firmware upgrade, you can't use "Napster to go"  Otherwise...I love the size of the Zen micro and the features I've read about in the manual.  (I'm just up/running w/ mine so haven't tried all the bells/whistles).    The touchpad will take some getting used to....I especially find I must "tap" (pound?)very hard to select options w/ the touchpad (guys may not have this problem; being female, I guess I have a light touch!)  Oh... a couple of important tips:  Do NOT connect this device to your PC before installing the (incl'd) software! After installing Creative's firmware upgrade, you MUST reboot the PC for the upgrade to be active! The firmware upgrade, *required* for "Napster to go" can ONLY be used with Windows XP!  Hope this helps.... I'm off now to transfer my 1000 most favorite songs from Napster!

<Title>My First MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a new to mp3 players.  For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.  After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.  It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.  You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.  Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.  I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.  The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.  On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software is not as intuitive as I would like.  Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).  You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.  Overall, I am very pleased with it.  The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.

<Title>Excellent Piece of Equipment
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off I will preface this review by saying that I prefer the WMA codec to both the MP3 or AAC methods.  I think that Windows Media is an excellent program and version 10 is excellent.  That being said I found it was a pain for me to find a good mid-capacity WMA player (4-6 Gb) that could match the style and simplicity of the iPod Mini.  The Micro Zen fits the bill and exceeds the iPod in some respects.    Pros: 1.  Compact, shorter than the iPod Mini (though a hair thicker) 2.  Removable battery, how hard is it for the rest of the companies to figure this out... I mean, my PDA and Phone both have removable batteries, shouldn't my WMA player. 3.  Excellent playback, I keep most of my files between 96 and 128 kps variable rate and they sound great through the headphones or attached speakers. 4.  Great battery life, around 12 hours. 5.  Easy navigation, the UI is excellent with a very shallow learning curve. 6.  Good WMP10 integration, plug and play at its best 7.  FM radio 8.  Voice Recorder  Cons 1.  No included armstrap, you do get a belt clip but I would of liked an armstrap included for those workouts. 2.  Playlists, I wish I could figure out how to easily import all of my WMP playlists into the thing.  It is easy to make new playlists in the included software, but I would like to just import all my old ones. 3.  I would have liked to be able to encode recordings in something other than WAV format.  All in all this is an excellent player that matches the iPod Mini point for point in every aspect but allows the WMA crowd to get into the game.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Zen Micro is Awesome; Not So for Creative Explorer 
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro is an excellent piece of machinery.  I love the cool color and the bright lighting.  The menus are easy to navigate and the touchpad feature is fantastic (especially when you use the "clicker" feature that allows you to hear a click upon touching the pad).  My only complaint about the "hardware" is the FM feature.  The headphone cord doubles as an antenna. As of yet, the antenna has only picked up one station (and even then it was not clear reception).  Overall, the hardware is great.  HOWEVER!!!  The Creative Organizer software is not so hot.  It is virtually impossible to decipher any rhyme or reason with respect to its set-up.  The Creative Organizer is not intuitive and it feels like you are endlessly wandering through a maze when trying to find albums, playlists, etc.  While the Zen plays Windows Media Audio files, the Zen does not appear to very compatible with Windows Media Player.  Specifically, I have not yet been able (after playing around with this for WEEKS) to get my playlists to show up on the Zen from Windows Media Player.  I have to manually recreate everything in the Creative Organizer.    I highly recommend the Zen Micro--however, the Zen Organizer software is very poorly designed and not-user friendly.

<Title>MOVE OVER IPOD MINI!!!
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The reason I bought a Zen Micro is because my previous mp3 could only hold 60 songs(much to my frustration) and was, basically, rubbish. So, I thought about other mp3`s, mainly the ipod or ipod mini. That is, until I laid my eyes on this beauty....the Zen Micro. Stylish with a glowing screen that shines the moment you press a button and a lighting effect around it. Easy to use (the touch-sensitive controls can be annoying at first, but you get used to them quickly and their sensitivity can be altered). You can organise your songs, i.e. by genre, artist, album, etc. The DJ mode is not bad, as it tells you stuff like most popular songs, least popular songs, etc. The rechargeable battery life is not long though, but neither is it very short and I did not mind it. The only point of concern would be that the back of the mp3 can get scratched VERY EASILY, but that should not put you off buying a Zen Micro. It is small, not at all large and bulky like the previous Zen mp3`s, and is simply brilliant. A GOOD CHOICE TO TAKE!!

<Content>This was the first MP3 player I ever bought and after doing considerable research I chose this over the mini IPOD mainly because of the FM radio and the extra storage capacity.  I just received and I am really glad I chose it!!  It is actually smaller than the IPOD and I love the looks of it.  I chose the black but the other colors are great too!  I had a little trouble figuring out how to navigate but thats because I have fat fingers.  But you can lower the sensitivity! Also the Creative Labs website has a much more detailed downloadable manual.  I would highly recommend this player!!

<Title>Quite happy, if not amazed
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro; these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.   On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.  I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."  Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.  Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  To use a baseball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.

<Title>Good, but not GREAT
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for several months now, and although I like it, I wish I had gone with an iPod instead.  Everyone else thinks it's so much better than an iPod, but I disagree.  I've had a lot of trouble with my Zen freezing up randomly, so I have to take the battery out to turn it off.  My brother bought one as well and his stopped working entirely.  There also aren't as many accessories for it as there are for iPods.  With iPods you can get speakers, FM transmitters, and other accessories that the iPod docks into quite nicely because the power/USB ports are on the bottom.  The Zen's are all on the top, which means there is no nice little dock. And I hate how all the free music out there is only on iTunes.  iTunes songs can ONLY be played on iPods.   If you're an absolute hater of iPods and anything Apple, then this is your MP3 player.  If not, I suggest going with an iPod or iPod mini.  Same price (or cheaper) and you'll probably be happier.

<Date>Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was debating between the iPod mini and Zen Micro. Bought the Zen micro primarily 'coz of the removable rechargeable battery and WMA format support. I've been a Windows person for a long time and WMA format works for me especially since the songs take 1/2 the space compared to a mp3. I've ripped all my CDs in WMA and the quality is same as a CD. Have used this player for 2 weeks and am very happy. The sound quality is excellent and so are the headphones. I like the belt clip better than an armband since armbands can be obtrusive during workout such as arm curls. Overall I love this player. Creative has a great product at an appropriate price. The Creative Mediasource Organizer software that came with it is not very intuitive and took a while to figure out. I'm still giving this 5 stars 'coz I love this product.

<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before I bought this.  Unfortunately, all of the glitches that people had been experiencing happened to me also.   The device kept freezing up, could not get it to sync with its own software,   then, in the middle of installing the firmware update (that  everyone recommends you do, including Creative),  the player crashed and I could not get it to reboot. Used the support web site to troubleshoot,  but nothing  recommended there would help.  I am not a "techie", but I am pretty savvy about computers and  software and own 2 other mp3 players (Rio, Lyra) that I have never had any problems with.    Never even got to hear any music coming out of it.......

<Title>needs better controls.
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After researching exactly what I wanted in an mp3 player, I was excited about the Zen Micro. I wanted it so badly... I was totally and completely sold on all of its features and convinced it was the perfect player for me.  But when I finally got it, I found that the touch controls-- especially the "intuitive" click-wheel-- were horrendous. I hated them. As you are trying to scroll down the list, the machine thinks you're clicking and opens items you don't want. Many times I found myself having inane brain conversations with it that sounded like, "Back, back, back. Aw crud-- back, back, back. DOWN. No, DOWN. DOWN! Enter."   Hrgh. I tried to change the sensitivity settings on it but I noticed no difference no matter how lightly I used the buttons. It was stressful and frustrating to use. I'm checking out the Dell DJ now.  On a side note, I felt like the colors looked more classy on the box graphics than they actually did in person. The box tries to make it look like there's a nice brushed texture to it. When you get it in person, it's just cheap-looking plastic sticker look. I know that's not a big deal, but I wasn't pleased with the look of it in person. I liked the light, though.

<Title>Great product!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sat Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>OK, Lets start from the begining, I wanted to buy an MP3 player so I reviewd every available gadget on the market...as many people, I finally had to choose between a 4GB mini-Ipod and the zen micro. Although I am an Apple fan it just didn't seem right to pay the same price for less space, and in adittion to that the battery of the mini I-pod is not user replacable. So I took the risk of trying the ZEN MICRO...It was worth it...It IS an excelente device, I can store almost all of my music and still have space for my data, I think I have never heard the same song 2 times in shuffle mode!!!  The only little problem is that the battery doesn't last as long as I expected....(at least not the 12 hours advertised)....but well....10 hours or so is a lot of time and you can always have a second battery available.....

<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro looks cool when you buy it, but don't be deceived by looks. This stupid piece of crap doesn't even work. It crashes any time you touch it and you can't even get muic on it because it crashes every time you download a song.

<Title>IPod sucks
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this item for a few months and it is the best MP3 player I've had. I had a Rio, which continually crashed, and an IPod, which needed to be replaced twice in the first month, so I bought this. It has 1 GB more than IPod mini, and hasn't crashed. Also has much easier software to use than IPod. It also is compatible for Napster to Go, where I've paid 15$ for a month and gotten over 800 songs.

<Content>I just recieved my Zen Micro a couple days ago! I was sooo excited! I told my parents I needed it because it had a built in voice recorder, so I could tape my lectures at college next fall. Of course I really wanted it to listen to my music while walking to classes! I did 2 weeks worth of research and finally decided on this one. Its great! The software is pretty easy to use. The touchpad isn't too hard to learn. Overall it has great sound! I had to buy new earphones though, bc the ones they sent were way too big. So far I haven't had any problems! I am very glad I made this purchase!!

<Title>.....AWESOME PRODUCT.....
<Date>Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been behind the times using the same portable CD player for the last 6 or 7 years... so this was really a BIG step up for me. Hopefully this review will be helpful if you have never owned an mp3 player before.... I have no idea how this compares to the ipod, but here is a list of the lesser known features of the zen micro:  PROS  +++ It tells you the number of tracks, albums & playlists uploaded. Total Mb & Mb remaining. +++ FM radio. +++ Removable battery & micro hard disc. +++ If you're halfway through a song (or paused) & you shut it down (or it shuts down after being inactive for a while, IT RESUMES WHERE IT LEFT OFF in the middle of a song when your turn it back on again!! :-) +++ You can change the idle shutdown time, backlight time, contrast, touchpad sensitivity, language (there are 15 languages installed!!) +++ sleep timer +++ You can personalise (configure) menus, much like with mobile phones. +++ PLAY MODES: normal, repeat track, repeat all, shuffle, shuffle repeat & track once. +++ You can find songs by albums, artists, genre, playlist +++ DJ menu: album of the day, random play all, most popular & rarely heard tracks. +++ There are 10 bookmarks, which I have absolutely no idea how to use, but it must be put onto this list anyway. ;-) +++ 12/24hr time, alarm, calendar, date (several date formats and you can even choose between the following separators: space, dot, dash, slash) +++ Variable microphone sensitivity. +++ Organiser; tasks + contact lists. (synchronised with creative sync manager) +++ Smart volume + Equaliser (numerous modes: Off, custom, acoustic, classical, disco, jazz, new age, pop, rock, or vocal) +++ master reset.    :-0 +++ track name, title & artist on LCD display.+ battery indication, and various other on-screen icons while a song is playing, such as EQ & repeat modes. +++ Gives the length of a song as a bar graph so you can tell the progress of the song... +++ A lot of stuff in the box: remote control, belt clip & cradle, pouch, usb cable, charger, earphones, software (easy enough to figure out)..... +++ Last but not least: a cool blue glow + white backlit screen!!! +++ There ISN'T a one second delay between playing each song. +++ My zen micro hasn't crashed on me yet (and I have been sucessful in crashing every computer product known to man, eg: my Ericsson T39m phone several times!)  CONS: --- The touch pad can be annoying sometimes. So you either have to hold it by the edges when playing a song or put it on hold mode, otherwise your palm will set off a whole bunch of menus.  It's okay when you're using it though.   --- You can't hear any music while fast-forwarding through a song. I am used to being able to go by ear while doing this, but you can't do that with this thing. Maybe a future firmware upgrade will fix this issue? Please??! Creative???!!  --- I walked all around sydney and couldn't find this in *ANY* shop. So I had to buy it online. All the photos of the zen on the 'net are front on.... and I didn't realise until I opened the box that the back & sides of the zen micro were coloured WHITE!!! ARRRRGHHHH! I hate white! Aaaahhh well, I suppose I'll get used to it soon enough.  --- I find the lowest volume setting isn't all that low. I can still hear songs well in a fairly quiet room during the daytime. At 3:00am I think this might be just a tad louder than I would have liked. [This is with panasonic earbuds though]  --- You have to first aportion (partition) the HDD to be used as an extrenal flash drive. Available sizes are: 128, 256, 512Mb, 1, 2Gb. You should be able to just use whatever is available. This isn't a big problem though.  --- Earbuds are too thick for my ears. Wearing them is like stuffing a peanut lengthwise in your ear. It pulls your earlobes out.  --- There is sod all information (on how to use the menus) in the instruction manual.

<Title>Something other reviews did not mention...
<Date>Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me preface my remarks by saying that I've only had the product for 24 hours, so I haven't experienced issues that others seem to be having.  On the other hand, I have experienced one thing that I have not seen mentioned.  So let me explain my initial impressions and issues:  I purchased this device despite the myriad of negative reviews. I figured I could return the device if it acted up within 30 days. This is my first mp3 player so I have little to compare it to.    Out of the box, it was missing a neck strap. The manual says some countries won't have it included.  Is the USA part of that?  The software is marginal. I can't fully review it until I've played with it some more. I can say that the VERY FIRST thing I did after charging the battery was to download ALL updates (including firmware) from the creative website.  This might be why I haven't encountered some of the problems others see. Always download the latest. The reason for updates is usually because they have found bugs in previous versions.  You are asking for trouble if you don't do this.  I also adjusted the touchpad to HIGH as others have recommended and have had no problems with it. It did take me a few seconds to figure out that you need to slide your finger on the up/down cursors to scroll.  The controls are very sensitive. I just took it out of my shirt pocket while touching only the top and the selection stopped playing. Be sure to lock the controls with the lock switch.   NOW for the one issue I have that I have not seen mentioned.  My device emits a very high pitch sound OCCASIONALLY.  It comes and goes. I'm an electrical engineer and have been tempted to hook up a scope or spectrum analyzer to see what frequency it is...perhaps based on some internal oscillator.  I'm going to experiment a little more with it. Anyway, if you don't have good high frequency hearing, this shouldn't be a problem.  And maybe it is only my device that has this problem.  The FM tuner is marginal. It is true that only stations in your back yard can be picked up.  Stations that come in strong in your car or at home are no guarantee.  I can usually only get one or maybe two stations.  Right now, I can get a local college alternative noise (I mean music) station and a country western station.  Not a good choice in New England.  The belt clip really is cheap.  I am going to look for some alternative method.  An iPod holder or cell phone holder.  Something to provide protection and stability.  Battery life?  Don't know yet. I've been playing it about 4 hours and it is about half drained according to the charge indicator.  I suspect it won't go 12 hours but probably will hit 8 hours.  Still, not bad.  I have not played with the recorder or the calendar/contacts/task stuff.  My recommendation if you buy this is just to make sure that you upgrade the firmware immediately.  I'll follow up this initial review in about 4 weeks after more use.

Besides that its good.  Small and I love the controls also the battery is really good you can remove it and stuff. Plus it has over 2 million songs to chose from on MSN and Creative.  Ipod doesnt even come close.

<Title>nice and bad experience
<Date>Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was very excited when i first got my zen micro, but as soon as I got it my disappointmetn grew more and more.  The color didn't look as I had imagined, and after updating the software ( the clearly states that is not guaranteed to work  in big red letters, coincidentially the same color as my player)I wanted to get as many songs as I could, after spending 3 or 4 hour a day trying to make it work, including intalling and reintalling the software several times. I finally managed to get music on it, the playlist that I had created were gone, and no matter what I did, I couldnt make the player to play my playlists, and it is very anoying to have music and be in the middle of a set of exercises and stop and deal with the anoying touch pad to choose something else to listen to.  Something good that I have to say is that it looks really nice, and is a great conversation started with strangers specially hot chicks, I have scored some digits thanks to my zen micro.  One day it just decided to dont' work any more, as I had feared one day after many, many, headaches and bad mood because the player, i just froze showing the legeng FIRMWARE ERROR it didn't  wor any more, I tried everything, ( of course I remove the battery to reset it, it just died in my little brown hands, taking 700 hundred of my favorite tracks). I returned the player and got my refund.  I also bough the H-10 and since I opened the box I just didn't work, I returned the player after some hours.  I'm starting to think that getting a mp3 player that works the way it should be, its just as difficult as finding your soulmate.

<Title>My Zen vs My Wifes Ipod Mini
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal. They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price. Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like. You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library. Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen. However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook. I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. Its also smaller, and gets more looks. People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions. An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. This is really a no brainer. BUY THE ZEN!"

<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I'm not a kid, but all that "enter your e-mail address" stuff is annoying, so I thought this was easier.  Anyways...  I have been thinking of buying a mp3 player for a while and I have been thinking of which one to get for a long time because of what reviewers say about them.  My opinion is that all mp3 player have problems (yes, even iPods) so get one that is not that expensive and doesn't have a very bad history of problems.  If you buy this get the 2 year warranty.  I'm sure it will be worth it in the end, especially if something weird happens like one day it just dies for no reason.  I bought the Creative Zen Micro because I own some speakers by Creative and I have been very happy with them.  Creative has very good quality products.  Problems:  I have only owned it for a couple of days and so far I have not experienced HORRIBLE problems.  Once when I looked down at the screen I saw a message that said "Playback Error", but it was only for a second and it didn't seem to do anything bad.  The first night I wanted to put some more songs on the player so I hooked it up to my computer and it wouldn't detect it.  I shut down my computer and the next day I started it up and tried again and it worked, so... whatever.  The software could be a little better, but it gets the job done.  *Note: when transfering songs make sure you are tranferring them to the player and not the library... I learned that they are different things.  Overview:  This player has amazing quality.  You can change the EQ on the player itself (a nice thing to have).  The recorder is very good.  You can record things fairly far away.  The FM radio is pretty cool.  This is an awesome feature: you can record the radio!  You can change the language of the menus... pretty cool.  The menus are fairly easy to navigate.  Overall, this player is really good.

<Title>Creative Zen is wonderful
<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my creative Zen mp3 player for about 2 weeks now and i love it.  It's 'control pad' is so much easier and user friendly then the i-pod mini's circle thing.  The major reason for why i bought this product over the i-pod mini is that the battery in the Zen player is replacable, where when the i-pod battery dies, you must either pay A LOT of money to get it repaired or buy a whole new i-pod.  Another reason that i bought the Zen was that it has much more memory space compared to the i-pod mini 4GB, for just a few more dollars.  Another reason that i purchased the Zen over the i-pod mini was the fact that I could go anywhere on the net to download music, and not just through i-tunes. I use napster-to-go, and it is amazing (plus you get a month free with the creative zen player).  With napster it's $14.95 a month for unlimited downloads, i-tunes is $.99 a song.  My last reason was for the design, the i-pod mini looks very cheap compared to the zen.  The Zen has curved edges and the i-pod hes sharp edges, and the i-pod mini just looks like it will break very easily. The only bad thing about the Zen that I can think of is the radio that the Zen comes with (the i-pod mini doesn't). The reception is fine one moment and the next it's totatlly horrible.  I have to hold the headphone wires way above my head to get a signal. All in all, this is an amazing player, and i would recomend it to anyone. It has many advantages over the i-pod. An amazing design and great sound quality.

<Title>Just something to keep in mind
<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this item 3 months ago and have had nothing but trouble. I use the item when I run or work out, having assumed by lack of information, that this was an item with the ability to be used for that. I was wrong, it freezes after running with it for more than 5 minutes along with freezing on its own on several occassions. I find myself staring at the "shutting down..." screen for the entire minute in fear of it freezing and swalloing the entire battery life. It is good for listening in the car when you are not driving and walking is fine, but the cronic freezing really gets the best of me. A friend of mine purchased the red one, not that color alters quality, and she has the very same problem. So if your intent is to acutally utilize the Zen for what it is made of than dont buy it. The plat screen is an almost identical copy of the iPod, although I am an avid fan of teh underdog, reasoning my purchase of this over the iPod, i dont seem to hear people complaining about that. In addition to that, as many others have noted, no it does not hold 2500 songs its more like 1500, give or take 100.

<Title>Way better than the iPod
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Creative Zen Micro about 3 months ago in pink and love it. I used to have an iPod and hated it. This is much better. The FM radio is an added bonus. And its tiny and the blacklight is amazing. I currently have 1,152 songs on it. I would suggest downloading Napster To-Go for new songs, its less than $15 a month for unlimited downloads (much better than $1 for a song at itunes), and once you download the song it automatically transfers to the mp3 player. I esp love the fact you can make a playlist as you go so you dont have to keep chaning to the song you want.  The only things i dont love are: the earbuds (quite uncomfortable, i bought a new pair), dies a bit quickly, it takes forever to scroll (sometimes i get it to go if i hold it, other times i have to keep scrolling), and maybe its just mine with alot of songs, but it takes awhile when you click to go to the next song, go back, or for the song to start playing.  Overall i love this product and highly recommend it!

While the battery life is definatly not 12 hours, the backlight is mezmerizing and the capacity and extra features of the mp3 player are outstanding. Infact the backlight is so bright I could use it as a flashlight at night. While I hear all these bad reveiws about the Creative Zen Micro I have expireinced none of the problems everyone else is talking about. The touchpad is extremely simple after getting use to and you can get a new battery that lasts longer. I've never used an Ipod but I can't imagine a device any better.

<Title>Love it, but had a firmward problem...
<Date>Mon May 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Zen Micro, but after having it for a month, I starting having trouble getting it to dock properly, had to restart it a bunch of times, and finally got a firmware error before it really died on me.  When I went to the creative.com website to check out firmware upgrades (click on Support link, then Downloads), the Enhancements and Fixes offered (see info below) sound pretty essential to everyone...so I'd suggest upgrading your firmware before you start having problems.  Also, the message on the site says you'll lose all your content if you upgrade the firmware, but this didn't happen to me.  Hopefully Creative will get it together on this stuff, since it could be a great little product!  I love the colors, and the software for downloading songs is very intuitive.  From the creative.com site:  For firmware version 1.02.05:  "It has been reported by some of our customers that they have experienced reduced battery life after charging their Zen Micro. Our product development team has researched these reports and determined that the users may have experienced this after they plugged their Zen Micro into the AC adapter that was already inserted into a wall socket with the AC power on."  Enhancements  Improves the look of the volume control bar  Improves the appearance of the Lock icon  Adds a 4GB option in Removable Disk Mode (for 5 or 6GB players only)  Fixes  Prevents battery drain when the player is charged with an AC adapter already plugged into a live power outlet Restores proper functionality after disconnecting the power adaptor or transferring content using Zen Media Explorer  Redirects playback properly when skipping to the beginning of a WMA track

<Title>awesome player with extrodinary features
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player back in november 2004, when it just came out. I used to own an iPod mini, but wasn't very satisfied with it; the Zen Micro exceeds it in many areas. I use the Zen Micro primarily for commuting to/from school. So far it has been durable and fairly resistant to scratching.   To see the basic specs, visit www.Creative.com  - SIZE & APPEARANCE The whole player fits comfortably and securely in my palm, and is very light. It is shorter than the ipod mini but thicker. Headphone jack, lock button, and USB/Charger are all on the top. The secreen and font are extremely easy to see. When backlight comes on, the buttons and a cool decorative outer frame on the front lights up in blue. I just love the way this looks, especially at night.  - FEATURES 5 GB of space, and can also be used as a removable storage drive; but it only lets you store a max of 2 GB of removable storage for some reason. Built in FM radio. But has bad reception. It's good to have incase you wanna listen to the radio for news or something, but there's a lotta static. Could be because I live in NYC. Built in voice recorder is decent. I tried recording my professor's lecture once and it came out pretty well. You can upload recordings to your PC. Removable battery is an excellent feature and one that I cannot live without.   - BATTERY POWER One of the Zen Micro's finest features is the removable/replacable battery. When I bought mine it came with 1 extra battery, but I don't think they have that promotion anymore. (A battery is around I think 30 U.S. dollars). A battery can be fully charged in less than 4 hours. I've noticed that leaving the battery in the player during non usage sucks up power, so I just remove it at night and put it back in the morning when I need it; the small battery can be conveniently slided in/out.  This way, the battery, when fully charged, runs ~9 hours at ~80% volume with no backlight (the backlight is pretty but I don't need it when I commute during daytime). With backlight turned on, battery life is reduced by 10-30% depending on how many seconds you set it to stay on and how often you make it light up.  - INTERFACE The menus are easy to get into; and you can customize the functions that are displayed on the main menu for easy access. For example, I have "Randomly Play All" and "Removable Storage Mode" on the main menu because I use those frequently. On the other hand, I took off "Planner" from the main menu because I don't have a need for that. There are no buttons - all the play controls are on a touch sensitive pad. Therefore when you put it into your pocket or bag, it's important to switch on the lock; but it's a very convenient button to flip. When I first bought it it was very annoying because I was constantly pressing the wrong buttons; but now I've gotten better at using it and it's not a problem anymore.  The various preset EQ's and playlist options are typical of most mp3 players so I'm not gonna go into that. The software for managing songs or transferring files is quite easy to use.  - SOUND QUALITY A++. Very sharp and clear and deep. I've never used the earphones that came in the box because I already had very good 40 dollar earphones, so I don't know how good the stock ones are; I've heard they're so-so. One of the reasons I got rid of my old ipod mini is because I wasn't satisfied with the sould quality; the Zen Micro in my opinion is a little better.  As is the case with all mp3 players including the iPod Mini, the bass is not strong enough. I think this is because good bass needs a powerful battery - something these kinds of players don't have. However, the quality is superb so the bass factor can be overlooked.    The Zen Micro is a counter-part to the iPod Mini. I don't think Creative is doing a good enough job of marketing their little product. Maybe 1% of my friends has ever heard of it. The Zen Micro can definitely steal lots of market shares from Apple if people knew how good it is. Unfortunately, today's society is full of trend-whores who value hipness above all else. Consider the comparison between Zen Micro and iPod Mini: -Zen has longer batter life -Zen has replacable battery, the Mini does not -Zen has 1 more GB than Mini -Zen looks cooler -Zen is smaller -Mini gets jacked a lot, especially here in NYC -Prices are nearly identical.  I wholeheartedly recommend the Creative Zen Micro to anyone who's looking to buy a mp3 player in the ~5 GB range.

<Title>Amazing little player-  KO  ipod  mini
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). It feels tiny in the hand without it. The stand that comes with it is very usefult to prop it up on the desk. The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. The hardcase they give with it must work well.  It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.

<Title>Ipod Please give me a break
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Only have had this player for about 24 hours and am very pleased.  Very easy set up, controls are a little touchy but after fiddling with it becomes better.  Sound and every thing is great.  THe best however is having access to Napster to go.  For 14.95 a month all the songs you want.  I already transfered around 20 songs so lets see, if i had an I pod that would have been $20.00 not counting the amount im gonna transfer, ipod is a rip, if your looking for more bang for your buck get this.  Or if you want an ipod because advertising says its cool then more power to ya, give apple all your money.

<Title>Zen Micro vs IPOD
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Rather than simply repeat what others have said, I prefer to list the areas in which the Zen Micro, in my opinion, surpasses its chief competitor the IPOD...(I own both), and the areas in which I give the edge to the IPOD.  First, let me say that, in general, I (very slighly) prefer the Zen Micro.  Areas in which the Zen Micro outclasses the IPOD:  User replaceable battery Battery Life..realistically about 8-9 hours compared to about 5 with the IPOD Sound is somewhat better..definitely more bass The Zen, in addition to having configurations for Classical, Jazz, etc, also has a five frequency graphic equalizer that can be customized, i.e. each frequency range can be strengthened or weakened as necessary. This is important to me because to simply  set the music for jazz, classical, etc., there is no provision (on the IPOD) to properly set frequency boosts for the HEADPHONE that you are using.....yes, every set of headphones has its own frequency response and being able to customize the player to this response makes for much more pleasurable listening....and if, you are an audiophile, you will soon grow tired of the in-the-ear headphones that come with both of these units.....I use the Sennheiser PX-100's exclusively with both units...BTW the Koss Porta Pros also sound very good, but are less comfortable..but I digress.... If you purchase music from Itunes, it is in a proprietary format, which cannot be converted to MP3 files and thus not usable in any other player, whereas if you purchase tunes from another source, you can use these tunes in virtually any MP3 player. Drag and Drop capability...very simply: you can drag and drop music files from your computer to the Zen.(it is simply seen as a drive in "My Computer)..OR you can simply copy and paste..this is particularly handy if you want to copy several files at a time; simply hold down the Shift key while selecting the files that you want to copy...then paste them onto the Zen.  Areas in which the IPOD wins: Seems a bit more solid Sounds slighly better with classical music..(smoother highs) Controls are definitely smoother...It can be difficult to hone in on a setting using the slider(on the Zen)...usually you tend to overshoot your mark the first time and need to back up. The IPOD's controls are very smooth.  MusicSource and Itunes....I find this is a toss-up. The only disadvantage of Itunes is that you do not want to touch it if you own any other MP3 players..It is really proprietary in nature...Music Source is much more flexible with other equipment (such as pocket MP3 players of other maufacturers)  Why do I then slightly prefer the ZEN....Sound, sound, sound....

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After much dithering and research at epinions, consumer's report, and amazon, and after reading countless reviews of the Zen Micro I decided to go ahead and get one. After making that decision, I then ended up fussing over which color to get -- ORANGE! I noticed that there was a lot of criticism of things like the headphone jack; it being that I tend to handle my electronics like a crate of eggs, I figured that if I were really careful, I'd be okay. So far I haven't had any trouble with the headphone jack at all, but maybe it's just because I'm careful? My only complaint, and it's fairly minor, is that the battery doesn't actually last 12 hours; otherwise I'm really pleased with the sound quality, portability, and performance, and how well it works with my little FM transmitter. The touchpad is easy to use -- you can set the sensitivity from low to high depending on your preference; the backlight makes things easier to see if you're in dim light. The menus are also fairly straightforward, and you can pick and choose which components to display in the main menu, and uploading music from your computer to the Micro is quick and simple if you do it through the software that comes with it -- I use a combination of the Windows Media thing to set up my playlists and then move them to the Micro media program.   If you're considering getting an MP3 player, do plenty of research before you get it, just to familiarize yourself with the pros and cons!

<Title>Forget about this product
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Please, don't buy this piece of crab. It broke down twice in less than 3 months period. It broke down first within less than 2 weeks. I had to spend hours and hours before I receive the replacement unit. Then the replacement unit broke down again after about 2 months. I swear I never used it rough, or anything. In fact, I used it very cautiously.    I contacted customer Service for refund, but they don't even reply my questions. I am so angry with this piece of junk. It's not worth you are paying. I guarantee you have high probability that this product will break within two months.  Also, I have to tell you followings before you want to buy this product. Don't trust what other say about this product. - They might be hired by the Creative Labs.  1.	Forget about the radio. The reception is horrible. I like listening to classic music. But, it can't catch the signal.  2.	Battery is useless. It won't last even for a day. I had to carry adapter everyday. Don't trust their ads. 3.	Sound quality is not good as you think. Take my word for it. I am a semi-expert about it. 4.	I think there is a problem software. First, I had to spend about 1 week to make my Toshiba notebook to recognize this unit. Then, second, my notebook stated having problem recognizing other USB devices after that. (Why did I buy this product...)   5.	I promise you will get annoyed by the touchpad-type interface.  If you want to buy MP3 player, iPod is still a better choice. If you want a good sound, Gowon Audio-i is also nice (but, a little bit overpriced.) Just avoid buying this one. I am warning you.

<Title>Worst electronic experience ever.
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved the Zen Micro as a present and although I had never heard of it, I was excited to get a new MP player, and even more excited to get one that played 2,500 songs.   After recieving it, it took about an hour to download the software onto my computer and then 7 hours to fill my player with songs and create albulm for them.  With the Creative media player that installs on your computer and takes over as the primary media player wether you want it to or not, the process of uploading music involves moving track by track and about a minute per song.    After getting about 800 songs on the player it was full, what Zen only writes in very fine print is that the player holds 2,500 WMPAs, which I had none of.  Still excited to have a small player to put in my pocket on the treadmill, I headed out to the gym.  After less than two minutes the player was broken. I tried rebooting it acording to the intructions, this involved awkwardly pulling out the battery and hitting some buttons, nothing happened. Also some of the aptions in the rebooting menu that pops up an not only wipe out your music, but wipe out all the firmware on the player, and because of the desighn of the virticle touch pad, accidently hitting on of these options is all too easy.  On the phone with Creative, they said they would replace it.  Since my player was bought off of Amazon during the holiday season and I did not get it until two months later it was too late to return it to Amazon.    A month later I recieved my replacement.  Again after spending the good part of the morning and early afternoon uploading my music, I headed off to work with my new player in hand.  Then it happened again, this time I was running to catch the city bus when the player froze.  Again nothing happened when I tried to reboot it.  Creative replaced it again becuase that was all they could do, they refuse to give me any type of refund. I just recieved my third Zen micro yesterday, oddly enough it arrived on the same day as my new IPod mini.  The ipod took less than an hour to download the software (itunes)which had a much better interface even on my PC. Another hour later, itunes had uploaded 1,000 songs as promised to my IPod, which has proven to work wonderfully walking around, riding the subway, catching the bus, and yes working out at the gym.  Also the circular pad is much easier to use tha the vertical pad of the Zen.  The rebooting process also only involves hitting one button as opposed to opening up the player and giving yourself the oppertunity to wreck the whole thing.  Six months after first using the Zen Micro I am now happily part of the MP player carrying community with my new IPod mini.  All I can say is that it's on top for a reason.

<Title>Works with Yahoo Music Unlimited
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my Zen Micro about a month or so ago and I love it.  I recently tried the Napster subscription service and it was cool because I could fill my MP3 player with music without having to pay for it, but my trial period just ran out.  Luckily I read an article today about yahoo music unlimited, which is like napster, but even cheaper.  I just paid $60 for an annual subscription, and my Zen works without having to update the firmaware.  This is going to make the train ride to work much easier.  Be sure to buy the Zen and fill it with music from yahoo.

<Title>this is a joke
<Date>Thu May 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I can't believe I bought this... It all started last year right before summer break.  My "mp3 player" was the biggest joke ever.  So i decided to buy a new one.  The store i went to only had these zen micros (i wanted an ipod mini) so i bought the micro.  I thought it looked just OK.  and i got home and ran to my computer to load the software (which took forever) after a long wait i uplodaded a couple hundred songs (also, took forever).  The next day i headed to school, with a new zen micro in hand.  I was ready to show all my ipod loving classmates my new player.  When i showed up everyone was listening to their ipods or ipod minis.  They asked me what i had.  I showed them the zen and they started talking about what a waste of money it was.  Embarrased, i pocketed it until we got in the building.  Once in the building, i shut it off and placed it neatly in my locker.  After school i got it and started to listen.  Only 2 songs later it shut down.  I couldn't get it started.  After a week of trying to fix it, i sent it to the company for a replacement.  When it came, it was just in time for my class trip to wisconsin.  I packed my things and brought the zen.  When we got there, we took a hike.  I brought my zen along but one hour later... It crashed again!!!  I was fed up with the poor quality.  When the trip was over, i ordered a new iPod mini and it has worked flawlessly over this past year.  It is beter then the CRAP zen in everyway. NEVER BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP! stick with apple, a company that actually knows Mp3 players.

<Title>too many problems
<Date>Fri May 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered my zen quite a while ago expecting an awesoem alternative to an ipod. When it arrived i found that the middle scrolling button wasnt working right. It was not sensitive to any touch. I sent it back to amazon and got a new one a week later. This one worked fine for a while then problems started arising. When i would turn it on, connect it to my computer, charge it or even shut it off it would freeze and make an annoying beeping sound. It would even do this when i would try to play some songs. It got so annoying that i sent it back and ordered an Iriver H320. Its worked flawless. Get the Zen micro if you want to take the chance of getting a working one but dont be surprised when it  doesnt work right.

<Title>Sound alone gets the 2 stars
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities. SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me. Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing. I don't care what ELSE it can do. I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want. All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.

<Title>Looks Cool, Good for music, Bad for Audio Books
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I listen to books on tape.  So each MP3 that I've recorded from a tape is 30 to 45 minutes in length.  MAJOR PROBLEM The Zen Micro will only show a 7 minute bar graph.  You can only FF and Rew within that 7 minutes.  If you have something at the 25 minute mark then you are out of luck.  You can FF to the 7 minute mark and then wait until you get to the 25 minute mark.  ANOTHER PROBLEM You also cannot rewind continuously past the start of a files (like going back to the end of the previous file and continue to Rewind).  I'm sure this could be fixed with a firmware upgrade; but, I'm not willing to wait around for them to decide if this is a bug or not.  AN IRRITATION Unlike the Rio software, once you've started transferring files you cannot browse, delete, add more files to copy to/from your device until the transfer is complete.  I could deal with this but it just takes more time and attention.   On a lighter note... I like touch pad and the blue light.  They look cool.  The one year warrentee is good.  Rio usually only does 3 months these days.  The FM transmitter is nice too.  Voice recorder, FM recorder (No AM).  I didn't use the sync with Outlook.  Speedy too!  Turn it on and it starts playing right away.  No waiting for 10 seconds (Like Rio).

<Title>Don't even THINK about an iPod!
<Date>Mon May 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.  I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here. I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price. Tall order, eh? Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  Sound quality? Phenomenal. Unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  Looks? Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there. Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  Capacity? Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most. Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. (Like I really wanted "Hotel California" anyway.)  Construction? Tough as nails. No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.)  Compatibility? Flawless. They've partnered with Napster to give you a free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. Gets nice sound too. The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  And the price? A bargain $200. Do NOT buy Apple. Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.  In conclusion, this player is beautiful. Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. But it; you won't regret it.

<Title>Headphone jack problems
<Date>Mon May 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As soon as the player came, I carefully opened it up, loaded the battery and it came on.  Then, after about a minute, it froze on the demo.  The touchpad wouldn't work so I removed the battery & reinserted it to reset everything.  That seemed to work but after the battery charged for 3 hours, I found I had lost the left audio channel.  I thought it might be the player's earbuds but it didn't work with any headphones.  After some internet research, I now find that the headphone jack is a real problem with these players so I am sending it back. Aside from the  audio issue, I found the intro book included in the package to be adequate for a starter but the online manual is not at all helpful with any troubleshooting, nor was the Creative website.  This was a very disappointing experience.  I don't think I've ever had anything break so quickly or with so little use.

<Title>The non Ipod
<Date>Tue May 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>May 15: Neither a technogeek nor a music fiend, I'm delighted with my choice of the Zen Micro. I was determined to have a radio and didn't want to be locked in to the iTunes store. The Zen Micro delivers on both these counts, the price is reasonable for 5 Gig and the Outlook integration is a pleasant bonus. I've even had the odd IPod owner look and say "That's cool".  Getting used to the Touchpad takes a moment or two. I've tried  High and Low and settled back on the factory default of Medium. As a novice downloader, I agree with others' comments that the 'mini manual' could offer a little more help. Experimented with both the Creative software and Windows Media Player. The latter with which many of us are already familiar seems to do the job well enough. I may experiment with ITunes software at some point.  Postscript: June 15 Creative's customer service both telephonically and via e-mail is good. You get free phone support for the first 60 days. However, I've discovered that audio voice (not music) mp3s are generally encoded at 24 kbps. The Zen Micro supports 32 kbps and above. So you have to convert the file to a wma file at a higher bit rate. If not, the audio sounds as though it's underwater. As podcasting takes off, I think this will be a problem that Creative are going to have to address. Overall, still very happy with the Micro.

<Title>Yea...about that 'ipod' thing...
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So a friend of mine got an ipod and it convinced me that I do infact need/want an HD mp3 player.  Well, her ipod was nice, but I wanted something small and compact.    * ZM offered a gig more storage than Apple's mini * Removable battery was a big plus * a 20gb player is not practical for me - I don't need my entire collection in my pocket. * The blue glow is cool - yes it was a selling point :-P * I've been a follower of Creative since the first days of the sound card :). * I can use yahoo's new music service (woo!) * I can record the radio...which isn't really important ATM * the bundled acc. are nice :). * price was great - considering all you get  Complaints... I hate the earbuds - but this is common for nearly all earbuds I have tried.  I recently ordered some nice Sony 'phones which are supposed to be very comfortable.    More bands on the EQ would rock - my old iRiver cd/mp3 had a good amount of bands.    That's about it as far as complaints.  Love this player :)  I realize this isn't the greatest review, but I am really enjoying this player.  If you want an ipod mini, go get one.  This player offers more - plain and simple.  It is definately worth a look.

<Title>SOME PROBLEMS BUT GOOD SUPPORT
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.  HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.  The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.  i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.  and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.  the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  you just get used to it after a while.  i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.

<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>*UPDATE* I've seen many people with the bad FM Radio reception issue. Try using the earbuds as an antenna and that should solve the issue.  *UPDATE* 6/21/2005 I've own the zen micro for 1 month now, and no problems. Im very pleased with this MP3 player.  *UPDATE* 6/24/2005 I read on another site that the Smart Volume reduces battery life by 50%. So make sure to turn off this option if you want extended battery life.   I just got the Zen Micro on 20th May 2005 and its working flawless.   PROS  - 5 GB is enough for me, also 1 GB plus the iPod mini. - It has awesome colors to choose from. - FM Radio and Recorder. I really like to listen to FM Radio. - FM Radio signal is really good here. Performance in other areas may vary. - Vertical Touch Pad gets a moment to get used to it, but its incredible. - Extremely easy instructions and buttons. - The Blue light is just awesome! - LCD screen is easy to read. - Its really tiny, really different from pictures. - You can customize many features! - Microphone included. (A really nice touch.) - Awesome quality sound. - The battery recharges when its connected via USB. - Comes with some useful accesories, like the USB cable, AC adapter and the hard case. - You can create playlists on the fly! You can delete tracks or playlists as well. - User replaceable battery. - Nice Look  CONS - Earbuds have really good sound quality, but theyre too big(at least for me) - Battery isnt 12 hours. With a full charge, mine lasted only like 6 hours, but I can deal with it. - Seems sort of fragile, so handle it with care. - It doesn't have iron parts. - The belt clip is from really bad quality, although I cant find a really good use for it.   I think that this isn't the player for you if you have a crappy computer.(not to be offensive, but I havent had any trouble with the PC recognizing my device lately, and this computer rocks! :-P) I love this mp3 player, and so far I havent had any problems, and I hope not to have them

<Title>Don't buy an iPod!
<Date>Sat May 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was researching MP3 players for 2 weeks.  I previewed lots of MP3 Players and I also went to Best Buy to try them out and decided on this product.  Pros .Blacklight is cool .Price is great .Nice design .Easy to use software .Has FM Radio .A built-in alarm .Can have calandar on it .Able to have a customized EQ .Small .Works with Napster To GO and Yahoo Unlimited  Cons .FM Radio reception is not that good .Bad battery life (however Creative is releasing a new firmware for this later this month) .Navigation takes a little time to get used to  Don't get an iPod because its more expensive and you have to pay $.99 for EACH song. For the Zen Micro you just pay 12.95 a month for Napster To Go for UNLIMITED songs.

<Title>What you need to know if you want to use subscription music.
<Date>Sat May 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1. To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player. At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release." I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  2. Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly. It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1. This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. The solution? Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring. The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  3. Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts. However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs. The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song. Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  These issues knock a single star off the review. Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.

<Title>Great idea, terrible battery life
<Date>Wed May 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>While I love the fact that this player works with Napster to GO and Yahoo Unlimited, where I can get music 4.99 a month. The battery life on this thing is a joke, it is rated at 12 hours, but in actual use, I get about 2 hours from it. If I don't charge it for 2 days, the battery would automatically lose all charge and the unit won't even turn on. Hardware needs improvement too. After I used the unit for about 2 weeks, the plastic panel on top fall off, turns out it is only secured by glue, not screws. Now I get why Ipod Mini uses the metal finish. Next time, I think I will look toward I-River for a window compatible player. Creative really need to upgrade their quality before I ever buy any hardware from them again.

<Title>*** UPDATE ***  No USB, no charging
<Date>Wed May 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>*** UPDATE   **** In the US, ZEN Micro's are now shipped without AC adapters. Previuously shipped units may have them. This is from the Creative Labs customer service department on 5/25/05.    I was quite surprised to learn that this unit ships without an AC adapter. The only way to charge it is via the USB port. What if you are travelling without access to a USB port? Creative warns against using a 3rd party adapter but yet has none available for sale at its web site. Does anyone have any experience with a third party adapter?

<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What are you talking about, all you need is your charger to plug into the USB connection of your ZEN.  I have certainly had no problems, there is no need for a USB port.  I have had one of these since Christmas, and my only problem is that it isn't big enough, that's my fault

<Title>FM Quality Overrated
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is much generally accurate info to glean from the many reviews that are posted here. Among the less developed aspects however is the Zen's FM. Often listed as an asset that sets it apart from Ipod and some others, the Zen FM has such a poor quality tuner that it produces a signal often so week that it cannot be used without great distraction and annoyance. I bought it to replace my old Sony FM walkman and add mp3 for the morning train commute. Not a chance. The FM does not pull in any but the strongest FM stations and even with these it cuts in and out regularly with movement. In several side by sides with the Sony the Zen was not even in the running (and the Sony is only about $30). Its simply not usable for most practical applications. Its a pitty. The Zen still has the best and brightest mp3 audio , something that Creative has yet to figure out how to really exploit over Apple in the marketplace, and it is not locked into Apple's overly-controlling propritary software, but between it's more challenging interface and poor FM quality its not a good alternative.

<Title>Overall a good value
<Date>Fri May 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The first Creative Zen Micro I bought was defective.  This tells me that the quality control at Creative is probably not as thorough as it should be.  The problem I was having is that after I turned it off it would sometimes lock up during the booting process when I turned it back on.  I would then have to do a hard reset by going through a process that involves removing the battery.  Needless to say, that was unacceptable.  I liked the unit enough (when it worked) to exchange it for another one.  After about 12 hours of total use the new unit has worked fine.  I like the black faceplate I have on mine.  The touch sensitive controls work well enough.  You do have to go through menus to adjust the volume, which is a bit of a pain in the rear end.  They should have included a dedicated volume control.  One thing I do like about the unit is the feature called something like smart volume or auto volume (sorry I don't have the player with me right now) which adjusts the volumes of your music so that tracks where the volume gain might be different from other tracks don't cause you to keep having to go through the menus to have to adjust the volume again.  This is the first player I have had from the current generation of players so I can't really compare it to anything else out there.  One thing I really have to take issue with is the claimed battery life of the unit.  Creative's web site says 12 hours.  I think you might be able to get 6 hours on a charge if you were lucky.  Perhaps you could do it if you turned the volume all the way down.  I did like the fact that the battery is replaceable.  As I mentioned earlier, this is my second one so I know it isn't a problem with my unit or my battery.  FM reception is terrible, but I did not buy the unit to listen to the radio with.  The Creative Software is not really the best I have seen, but it does the job once you get used to it.  Having said that, I would say this player is a good value overall, but with a couple of minor changes (bigger battery and dedicated volume controls) I would probably give it a 4.5 out of 5.

<Content>Although great sound quality up until that point.  This is a fragile item and not made for daily wear and tear most of us put on an our players.  Cost of repair is half cost of new one.  Ridiculous.  Will switch to Ipod like everyone else.

<Title>Zen mirco a keeper..
<Date>Sun May 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for a couple of weeks and I am overall pleased. I bought it based on reading other peoples reviews of this and other brands. The other reviews basically nailed the pros and cons of the Zen micro. Part of the decision over it's competitors is the fact that I could buy it at a particular local brick and mortar in town that has a great return policy and costs the same as online carriers. The guy in elecronics dept told me they never get returns on the zen micro.  First the bad, for the life of me I'd like to know why Creative did not perfect the sensativity of the touch pad before releasing these units. It's trial and error (mostly error) to navigate, the sensativity adustment does little  hi, med or low. Also the software is super slow to install and has somewhat of a learning curve, I'm gonna try the Windows Media 10 next. At first I was disappointed at the manual or lack thereof, but quickly discovered the true manual is on a Pdf file on the installation disk, a good manual. On the positive is the sound! This thing exceeded my expectation, it sounds better than my walkmans. It also goes super-loud (I cut grass on my rider using it) and has eq adjustments. Once it is in the play mode, it is easy to ffw during a song or skip to another. Controls volume from touch pad not too bad. I like being able to lock the On/Off button. I am an adult male so the earbuds fit perfect (sounds better than my new sony headphones), too big for my wife's ear canals. Good battery life, the battery can be removed simuliar to changing a cell phone battery, easy. If it were not for the over-sensative touch pad, it would be the perfect machine. BTW I can run and jump, ride bike etc. and mine will not skip. It did freeze up a twice, happens when I hit too many buttons without giving it time to think. I took the battery out and back in (which reboots it) and it resumed normal operation. Note that you cannot do that with the Ipods if the freezes you would have to send it in. So far it's a keeper and if it holds up I'll buy the kids some for Christmas.

<Title>Pretty Good... but not perfect... close though
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I would love to give this a 4.6 or something... but I had to round up. 4/5 for shuffle... it likes to go +/- about 20 tracks on the playlist, so might play 2 songs of same artist in a row... but is usually good.  5/5 for menu... very easy to navigate, nice conrols and features.  5/5 extras... has replaceable battery... organizer, phone book, bookmarks and more... and it is easy to sync with pc.  Only con is... 3.5/5 Battery... it lasts like... 10 hours... but if you dont use it, the battery still gets drained very fast. Like... 2 days for all of battery, very very annoying.  also, there is a firmware update online for it, and I heard it is supposed to make battery better.  We will see...  I recommend this or ipod.  I kinda wish I had an ipod so it worked better with iTunes... but it still kinda does... but not as well as I would like.

<Title>very nice
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I made sure to read the reviews before I bought an mp3 player (this is my first). I looked at an ipod mini and the zen micro. There were people who said that the ipod was really cool and there were those who said the zen micro was cool. People who had problems with their ipod mini suggested the zen micro and people who had problems with their zen micro suggested the ipod mini. But i noticed that the problem I saw the most was a busted headphone jack, but both the ipod and zen had this problem according to the reviews. So far, my zen micro has been doing fine. I have a 2 year replacement plan with the store I bought it from so I don't have much to worry about.  What i like...  I like the audio quality. It sounds like I'm listening to the songs right off my computer. This mp3 player also stores regular files, like powerpoint presentations and such. Very useful! It also has a radio, but the quality varies on each station (for me, anyway), but I like listening to the music I have stored on the player rather than the radion. It has a feature that lets you store contacts and organize special events on its calander, but you need to sync it with microsoft outlook to do that, which I don't use. The player is nice and small. The backlight is cool. The vertical scroll takes a little bit to get used to, but it's a breeze once you get used to it.  What I don't like...  There isn't much in the intruction booklet. It doesn't quite explain how to use the included programs, but I figured it out. I don't know about what creative offers online, but the ones that are sold for retail at electronic stores don't have any carrying case (which is very useful) or a power adapter, so you have to charge it through your computer. This is ok, but my computer is loud, so I can't charge the player overnight like I would like. Also, the included usb cable is a bit to short for my taste (a little more than a foot long). Also, it would have been nice to have it be compatable with firewire. The included headphones are kinda big, but I don't like ear-bud headphones anyway. I prefer behind-the-neck kinds.  Because of the small length of the usb cable, it's sometimes a pain to transfer files and charge it. The instructions aren't very explanatory, so that's why I only gave the zen micro a 4 out of 5. Maybe creative can revise their instruction booklet and include a few better accessories with the zen micro in the future.
