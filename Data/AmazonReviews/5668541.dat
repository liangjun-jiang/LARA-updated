<Content>Love the product.  Easy to use and the radio is excellent.  We had another brand a couple of years ago that was almost impossible to use.  The USB makes so easy to down load music.

<Title>worth its low price

<Content>I would say this is an example of 'you get what you pay for'. On the plus side, 2 gigs, mp3 player, FM radio, voice recorder all for $40. On the minus side - it is very difficult to figure out how to use the voice recorder, very complicated to access voice notes, the FM radio is average and the battery life is dismally brief. I don't feel ripped off, but I would probably be happier with something that cost more.

<Title>Survived the WASHING Machine!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>WOW. I bought this for my 8 year old son who likes to listen to music and "wanted an ipod" ("No.") He left it in his jeans pocket and it went through the washing machine. I was very upset at both of us for not checking his pockets before the wash - was sure the thing was a goner! But he plugged in his headphones and powered it up and... Oh my goodness! The thing worked!!! (The headphones were not as lucky as they went though the wash as well). I am amazed. He feels very cool listening to his own music and I didn't spend $$$ for something else that may not have survived the wash.

<Content>I wanted an MP3 player, but didn't want to spend that much since I really only wanted to use it in my car. The Coby MP-C895 is perfect for that. I love how small it is, and that it plays FM radio and records (either voice or from the radio) as well. It runs on a AAA battery and I've had the same one in there for a couple of weeks (light use) and it's still at full strength. I only have two complaints: despite there being a folder for it, I can't seem to get playlists to go on the player. I can transfer a whole playlist, and the songs will play in that order, except that they're grouped by artist and the playlist file never shows up in the player. In other words, if you have two songs by the same artist in your playlist, it will play them back to back.  My second problem is with tech support, they never responded to THREE emails, and when I finally got through on the phone, the person that I spoke to sounded barely knowledgeable and basically told me it was a problem with the player that there was a playlist folder and no way to use it.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great value and pretty much exactly what I was looking for - at any price.  I did not care for the IPOD like screen and wanted something physically very small.  This fit the bill.  My only complaint is that when you load a single file with music rights protection you can't see or play any of the files on the system.  The only way I got around that was to tediously examine all my music files on my PC, make sure I only listed non WMA files for loading onto the MP3 player, reformat the MP3 player and then completely reload all the files.

<Title>So.................easy!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I wanted something basic, no bells and whistles or camera. I have a digital camera that I'm happy with so kept looking until I found a MP3 plaer that didn't include one. It was extremely easy to figure out. I downloaded the songs I wanted for my exercise playlist. The music is clear with no distortion. I'm very pleased with it.

<Title>Perfect!!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted something to play my music and podcasts but didn't want to shell out the cash for an iPod. Then I found this little MP3 Player. It easily connects to my computer (Mac and PC) via my USB port, I drag my music/podcasts to it, eject it, and I'm ready. When I want to catch the latest news or traffic updates I switch to the FM Player and don't miss a beat. Some people have said it doesn't allow to save files but that's a matter of changing a simple option. ;) It's worth much more than what I paid for it. I'm very happy.

<Title>Great for the price
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was looking at this or one with a micro SD (this one was also battery powered instead of having to us a USB to power it up between uses) and I'm glad I got this one.  The direct USB is huge and the 2GB gives plenty of room for files and music.  The stock headphones are horrible, but a quick swap out fixes that.  I like the buttons more on the Creative style MP3s, as these are small and in a row, which makes you have to look at them to see what you are doing.  The Creative variety let's you flick the stick to go to the next one without looking.  Again not a big deal and overall it's a great little gadget for the price.
