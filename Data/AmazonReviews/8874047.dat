<Title>Aw, come on
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Look, this thing isn't perfect but there is absolutely nothing else like it out there. Yes, I had to call customer service but they were exceedingly helpful and got me up and running tout suite. Space is limited but fine for typical uses. Sound quality is very good and portability is terrific. I have an iPod but there are times when I just don't want to wear the earpods. And you can plug your iPod into this thing for mini-boombox sound. Give it a try.

<Title>Oh My Gosh! 
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing got sooooo annoying. It took literally hours to figure out the stupid thing even with reading and rereading the instructions included with each one. It doesn't help if you have done it before or not. I got mine months ago and wanted to update to newer songs and everytime I tried I just get frustrated and want to throw it out the window. It will not download different songs or let me even get to the step that you can actually manage what songs are on it and which ones aren't. The library is hard to figure out and it doesn't work at all with window media player, making it very difficult to get the songs I want on the device. I am usally farely patient and I just cannot stand this thing!!!The alarm clock freezes up a lot and I have almost been late for school. How it functions really has no rhyme or reason. One day it works and the next, it just doesn't. It doesn't hold enough songs, the radio doesn't come in clear, you can't just slip it into your pocket, the alarm doesn't always work, it takes for ever to get to your music once you actually get the thing turned on, you can't rewind or fastforward songs, and I've spent hours upon hours trying to get the songs I want on it. I think tha tI'm just going to get a small cheaper mp3 player with more space for songs and one that works better with windows software. Anymore it just sits on my dresser and does nothing because it's all old songs and the alarm isn't reliable.~~~It is not worth it!

<Title>PLEASE DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT!
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player and I couldn't get it to work. The battery would not charge up.I called Phillips and the representative said I should push the reset button. I did and it still didn't work. I called Phillips five times for the same problem over a four week period. Finally the representative said they would give me a refurbished player. Of course, I am upset because I have never used the item and I don't believe I should have to received a refurished one. If you are thinking about purchasing this item, please think twice. If you have a problem, Phillips WILL NOT help you. I read the negative feedback and I didn't believe them. If you have bought one and it is working, you are very lucky. I would hate to see someone go through what I have been through. They do not care about their consumers. I would give this item 0 stars

<Title>A unique product
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for a memory based sound system for long time and really glad to have found this product. I don't mind paying more for larger storage size (like 1 or 2 G), but 512MB is what Philips' offering.  I had no problem getting started, music was up and playing within  1 hour of opening the box. (I had previous experience with other philips MP3 so that helped)  The main use of this player is to play lullabies and other children songs for my 15 months old and it works really well. My kid loves the unit, pointing at it when she wants music, and often just carries it around happily when the music plays. I couldn't have done it with other mp3 players (needs headphones) or an Ipod with a dock.(not protable) The unit did lock up once (blank and no signs of life even plugged in) that resulted in a customer service call, reseting the box resovled the issue.  All in all, I am very pleased this product exist. I just can't find another product like this - portable MP3 player with speakers  Even this product works well in my case, it's not perfect and here is why it only gets 3 stars: - USB 1.1 is slow, takes a long time to load music - Must use music match to synch music, not very easy to use - Sound quality is similar to alarm clock radio, no mid-range and bass, and treble isn't particularly clear either. But then, what can you expect from these tiny speakers.

<Title>Great Covenient Player
<Date>Tue Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a mom ... that being said I do not need to hear every instrument during my very hetic day.  This provides the music I (& the kids) love to get us moving.  The first one I purchased, which was a 250 MB, did not power up at all. One call to Philips to trouble shoot, no luck, so they had me send it back, on my dime.  However, they replaced it, about 6 weeks later, with an upgraded 512 MB unit.  No trouble whatsoever with the 512.  I did reset it once with ease, did not loose anything.  Battery life is quite long, and built-in rechargeable.  Downloading is so simple, or transfer your CD music, easy enough, I am not one to fiddle with instructions.  The volume is loud enough, can also use with headphones.  No need to carry CD's for the car now.  Have used as portable speakers for the kids DVD player, as an alarm clock, auto shut-down, etc. Play music by artist, type, shuffle, repeat.  Holds plenty of music.  Built in radio.  Very portable, took on vacation for the cabin.  Obviously not for the pocket.  Wonderful idea, very satisfied.

<Title>Nightmare -- Don't Buy This Thing
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a really cute looking device -- too bad it doesn't work at all.  The firmware and software combo is horrible.  You cannot simply drag and drop songs to the device.  You MUST use their Philips branded version of MusicMatch Jukebox to transfer songs and it DOES NOT work.  Two phone calls to Philips didn't help either.  They were polite and all but otherwise useless.  I've owned and used MP3 players since they were first introduced and this is by far the most time I have wasted trying to get something to work.  I never did succeed.

<Title>Love the Shoqbox
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Revolutionary product - The only negative is the software.  Although you won't use Windows Media Player to install the music, you must not have WMP version 11 (you can have v.10) on your computer to download music into the Shoqbox.  Versatility and sound is 5 star.

<Title>Cannot load songs
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent 3 days trying to get some songs into this MP3 player and I finally gave up. Every time MusicMatch Jukebox starts coming up, it will give an error "MusicMatch Jukebox has experienced an error and must close". I can see the PSS120 as a USB hard drive and can copy files to it using Windows Explorer, but I cannot listen to them on the device. Unless you get the songs downloaded thru MusicMatch, the PSS120 serves only as a storage device. I emailed Philips customer service and described the issue in detail. Their email answer was to read the FAQ. What kind of answer is that? I then called Philips. The customer service rep asked me to uninstall everything and reinstall it. She would not stay on the phone. She said to call back when I have done that and still have a problem. I told her that I have already done that several times on multiple computers and still get the same problem. She said to "try it again".  Needless to say, I got the same error and decided not to call Philips again.  I am very dissappointed in the product and even more dissappointed in Philips customer service. I was considering buying a Philips large screen TV, but after this experience I will not consider a Philips product again.

<Title>This is a great little gaget
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two of these the first I bought for $150 more than two years ago and the most recent I got for $60. I have had very little trouble with using the features or transfering files. Don't use Music match though.   With XP windows, media player works fine for tranfers.   But there is a neat piece of free software called Shoqbox Buddy which is excellent - for transfers and creating playlists.  Shoqbox Buddy works fine with Vista.  Cons:  There is no way to expand memory - wish it had a SD card slot.   Also I occasionally have to reset the unit to get it to start - using a pencil to press on the reset button at the back of the player.

<Title>Very annoying! Don't buy it!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll keep it short.  (The review is for the 256MB version).  One word - Annoying.  The fact that Philips FORCED you to use the musicmatch software to load songs is very very annoying.  Difficult to use.  And as another reviewed said, it doesn't resume.  Once stopped, it goes back to the first song.  That't annoying too.  You'll be better off with just buying a cheap MP3 player and a separate powered mini speaker.  Doesn't look as nice but at least it works fine! Really regret buying the Philips!!
