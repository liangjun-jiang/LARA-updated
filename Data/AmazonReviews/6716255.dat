<Title>Even more than it claims to be
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently bought one of these for my wife. I am no audiophile, but I find the sound excellent. It looks pretty sharp and appears durable too. I chose it because Amazon and others advertise it as an ogg vorbis compatible player. If you are looking for an ogg player too, you should know that Samsung does not support ogg files and says so on its website. But that's OK. Whether the company officially supports ogg or not, the engineers do, and the YP-Z5 plays them perfectly. And ogg compatability has been improved with successive firmware releases. You can get ogg files onto the player through Windows Media Player as described in the manual if you download a third party ogg plug-in for WMP first. But better yet, you can drag-n-drop them as long as you don't try putting them in the "Music" directory (put them in "Other" and the player will still play them). But wait, it gets even better! Get the latest firmware from the Samsung website and you can turn off the WMP-based interface entirely and your PC will treat the player the same as any flash drive (no file restrictions for the "Music" folder). Organize your music with Windows Explorer just as you would any set of files. I at least find that a lot simpler. The best result of this is that it becomes cross-platform compatible. I can manage the music on my Linux machine by mounting the player as a USB flash drive. It should work on a Mac too. I can also create playlists in XMMS (a Linux media player) and tweak them to be saved and used on the YP-Z5. This should work with Winamp as well.  Wow.  All in all, much more than I expected. I wish I had one of my own, since once I have loaded it with her music, I will need to give it back to my wife. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish all this stuff should be described in the manual and officially supported. If you're like me, this is how you think a music player should work.

<Title>Disappointing service, battery life
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I originally bought this because of the styling and the price difference between this model and other companies' MP3 players. It has been nothing but a waste of time and money. The battery life was fine during the first cycle and after four subsequent recharges ended up lasting no more than a few minutes. I sent it in for service. They charged it and sent it back to me. The same problem started happening again. The company refused to send me a new model or give me a refund. Instead, I had to ship it back to Samsung for yet another go at fixing it. Like the first time, they charged the battery and sent it back to me (after six weeks!). I received it yesterday, and only half of the battery is left after turning it on for the first time. The company also erased ALL of my music and picture files. I just called customer service, and the office is closed. What company does not offer 24 hour customer assistance? Overall, I do not recommend the YP-Z5 model, and I don't think I will buy Samsung products again.

<Title>Excellent choice for digital audio
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Zen Micro 5GB which ceased to function at the end of the warranty period (almost to the day.)  In my search for an affordable replacement with good consumer reviews and at least a few gigs worth of storage, I found the YP-Z5QB.  The Samsung is more reliable in its operations and a better unit overall.  The option to store images (especially CD-related pics like sleeve artwork) is a nice bonus.  The fact that one USB cable (provided) covers your upload and battery charging needs is wonderful.  Works through Windows Media Player, and if you have WMP 10, no re-install from the provided disc is necessary.  Very pleased with this purchase.

<Title>Great for those new to the MP3 arena.
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I knew nothing except that I wanted to be able to listen to music.  I love gadets but hate trying to figure them out.  This one is so simple to use.  I signed up for [...] to get my song choices from and it was a piece of cake to load them into the player, just click and drag.  The screen is wonderful with great color.  The size is comfortable to handle and I love the volume control on the side.  The earbuds have a wonderful sound.  It is easy to charge.  All you do is hook it into your computer overnight and it's ready to go.  The battery life is truly amazing.  You can easily get 35 hours+ of listening time each cycle.  I'm now buying my two daughters this player for Christmas.

<Title>Disappointed 
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Update as of April 14, 2007.  I recently bought Zune and Zune just like IPod does act as a hardrive (You have to use through proprietary software).  Since Samsung does, I would change the two stars to three stars.  The screen in Zune is nice but there are no movies in the Zune Marketplace which seem like a waste.     Overall, if this little player could do video and had better navigation buttons I would give it five stars.  Original review: This is my second Samsung (I had two ipods before Samsung).  I loved the the first Samsung.  Why did they have to change good things about it such as the software or navigation controls?   The nice screen is a waste since you can't use it for video.  The controls for scrolling up and down are frustrating since you have to press them very lightly.  The only reason why I am not giving it one star is that the external design is beatiful.

<Title>failed to work out of the box
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Did my research and read many good reviews. Had good experience with Samsung  products before and decided to buy this one. It is probably a good MP3 player in principle, but I never had a chance to enjoy it - its touchpad controls were so miscallibrated that I couldn't even play a song or enter any of the menus. Called up Samsung support and found out that there's no way to re-calibrate the controls, and the player had to be replaced. Decided to return it, as I no longer had any confidence in the product. But it looks cool. Will get a SANDISK Sansa now.

<Title>Review after 2 days --- good so far
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hi,  This thing works fine with Windows Media Player 11.  (most of the reviews below call out Windows Media Player 10 ).    I moved some ripped files over and album art moved over automatically.  When the song plays the album cover appear.  Very nice.  Manual is unreadable.  Litteraly.  The install disk detected Windows Media Player 11 instead of 10 and aborted.  I needed to get into the install disk directory to find a WORD 9 player then naviagte to the manual before I could read how the controls worked.  Good thing no drivers needed -- media player recognized the device, downloaded something, then played just fine.    I still haven't found out how to move photos over for the screenshow.  Looks like a nive feature though.  The screen is very nice.  BIG for tired eyes.  Sound quality is excellent through high end headphones.  I haven't tried the ear buds yet.
