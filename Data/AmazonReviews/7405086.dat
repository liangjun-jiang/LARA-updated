<Title>Not a Breeze to Set Up, But Well Worth It
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When Apple finally enabled lossless format files to be ripped and managed through iTunes, I thought it was time to finally transfer and store all the CD music. I had experimented with playing MP3s on the home system (plugging in the iPod, burning MP3 CDs--even wirelessly through TiVo), but I was always thoroughly underwhelmed by the playback quality; no matter how much 'fixing' you could manage by way of EQ, etc., there was a distinct lack of "presence" in the music. On a decent home system, playback is only ever going to be as good as the source, so lossless became the way to go. But how to port the playback??  Enter Squeezebox.  First let me say that this marvelous device (or, more specifically, the SlimServer software that powers the thing) is not really ready for the masses. Although I am no IT wizard, I am fairly adept at common computer technology issues (at least on the Mac platform), and this was definitely a bit of a challenge for me. In fairness, I have always found that any new new technology worth having somehow seems to come with its share of hair-pulling; I can't really think of any sophisticated device or application that was actually a breeze to set up and learn. My situation was also not the most common: I have two iTunes music libraries, one filled with low-quality files (MP3s, AACs) for sync with the iPod, and one on an external, 320GB hard drive exclusively for home playback. SlimServer does not handle this circumstance partcularly well. When you first set it up (which I did twice, because I acquired a new Airport), SlimServer will automatically find and scan your "most local" iTunes library REGARDLESS of how you have set the preferences. Twice I needed to "clear library and rescan everything" in order to get access to the right library. Plus, the scan can take a long time, and there is no scan progress indicator (this definitely needs to be added in a future release).   For those familiar with the ease and intuitiveness of the iTunes interface, SlimServer will be a bit of come down (and you DO manage playback through SlimServer--not iTunes; I wasn't at all sure of this when I purchased or set up the system, for it is not explicitly stated anywhere; what you can continue to use iTunes for is MANAGING the library and the playlists). SlimServer has all the features you want, including album cover art, and it works, but it is considerably more cumbersome than iTunes.  All that said, however, the technology is, in a word, breathtaking. CD quality sound, and your entire music archive managed from your desktop. Plus, an absolutely elegant readout device (the Squeezebox itself) that not only displays the currently-playing song data, but facilitates library and playlist browsing via the remote. Sweet. I've only had the set up for a couple of weeks, so I'll have to see if I run into problems down the road (I note several comments here about issues emerging later on), but as long as it continues to perform as it does now, it has been more than worth the temporary frustrations in set up.

<Title>Clear, crisp quality
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own both this and a Roku Soundbridge M500.  The Squeezebox is FAR superior although marginally more expensive.  Why?...   - Sound quality is excellent  - Wireless connection never drops  - Navigation is fast  - Screen is easily visible across the room (font size can be increased)  A few gimicky features:   - SqueezeNetwork, I've played with it a little (podcasts and international radio) but I just don't use it.  All I really use it for is to play purchased music.  - Synchronizing multiple devices (PC server, Soundbridge and Squeezebox) to play the same music has some lag between players.  This may work better with multiple Squeezeboxes but I doubt it.  - Alarm, screensavers, visualizations.  If you want to play music over a wireless network this is a great solution.

<Content>The Squeezebox payoff is that you get your whole music collection in the living room with a pleasant looking and easy-to-use interface. The job requires you to pay $300, install an application, neatly organize your music collection, and keep your computer running. Don't apply for this job if you don't know what DHCP, Server, IP-Address, mp3, and 804.11g are. The audio quality is very good.

<Title>stunning display & very flexible codecs
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the wired version. I love the product because you can play just about any format. The display is stunning. Squeeze did an outstanding job on the hardware. However, a year ago I boxed up my family room stereo along with this device. The Apple Nano has spoiled me for life. I may eventually hook my Squeeze & stereo back up, but I'm not holding my breath.  PS: Many hours went into developing the software for this product. The developers put a lot of sweat equity into it and made the playable formats very flexible (mp3, ape, flac, wma, wav, etc...). But it is browser based and a bit quirky. I would have preferred an exe, just a preference.

<Title>A good addition to my A/V system
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a dual-purpose device for my living room: 1) access my MP3 collection on my computer and 2) access Internet radio.  I needed 802.11g since running wires just didn't appeal to me.  I would have liked it to have a built-in hard drive to store my music files in order to be able to leave my computers off, but that wasn't necessary.  I did not want to have to have my high-def TV on just to listen to audio, so it needed a display of its own.  The SqueezeBox came as close as I could find within the price I thought the budget committee would approve (I got it recently direct from SlimDevices at $249).  I considered AppleTV and Roku and a couple of others.  AppleTV doesn't do Internet radio as of yet; it does have a hard drive; no display.  Roku is 802.11b only, which would drag down my D-Link router, and many people have been less complimentary about its sound quality.  One nice feature of the SqueezeBox is the inclusion of digital audio out.  1)  I installed SlimServer on both a PC and a Mac iBook with little difficulty.  ITunes is not needed, but if iTunes is your thing, it integrates well.  I have my files organized by boys/girls/bys&girls/classical and so forth directories, and then by artist within those, and the SqueezeBox lets me browse within those directories quite easily.  You can choose a directory and push Play, and all files within are played, shuffled if you so desire.  (Note, the "Favorites" playlist here is best ignored.)  2)  The Internet radio feature (SqueezeNetwork) has been very good.  I listen to Pandora a fair amount, and this device is good for that, though it will cost $3.95/month.  I also listen to a station my wife and I did a weekly show at (KXCI, Tucson, AZ) many years ago--you can add most any streaming site to your own "Favorites" within SqueezeNetwork.  In addition to Pandora, RadioIO, RadioTime, Rhapsody, and Live365 all integrate into the interface without any cost (unless you want the premium services).  Altogether, the SqueezeBox gives me access to a lot of services in my living room and without having to sit at a computer.  So why not five stars?  Well, because I can't choose 4 1/2 stars.  You see, the form factor doesn't quite fit in with other A/V gear.  Given the large front panel it would be nice to have used more of that acreage for three lines of display.  The set-up was initially frustrating, but I got over that, and so I do suggest this for someone with technical familiarity.  Others have mentioned some reliability problems, but maybe those were early production runs.  I will certainly keep in mind those experiences in a year when the warranty is nearing its end.

<Title>I wanted it to work, but...
<Date>Mon Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already use Roku Soundbridge M500 / M1001s to stream music around the house, using iTunes as the server. More recently, I bought a Squeezebox v3 based on the online reviews, which spoke highly of the audio quality. After 3 months' I gave up and it now languishes in a drawer - one of my Soundbridges has taken its place.   The problems with the Squeezebox were several: 1) Sound quality - the wifi connection just kept dropping out all the time (i.e. every few minutes). This never happens with my Soundbridge and my router/access point is only 3m across the living room. Sure, I could run cables round, but they would be unsightly and I live in rented accomodation, so channelling the cables into the walls is not an option.  2) The slimserver software was more sophisticated than iTunes, but the flip side is that I found it to be much less user-friendly. I prefer the simplicity of the iTunes / Roku Soundbridge combination, without the need to run a separate server. 3) Navigation at the device (as opposed to at the PC) is (IMHO) a lot weaker than Roku's. On the Squeezebox, I had to scroll through all album (or artist) names, whereas on the Soundbridge I can scroll by letter and then drill down to the names - much faster. I accept that the PC interface is much better for the Squeezebox, but I wanted it to use in the living room i.e. away from my fileserver, so ease of navigation at the device is key to me. Font size is comparable on the Soundbridge M1001, so that is not an issue for me.    In the end, the Squeezebox's lack of reliability rendered it useless; I could not get it to play a single track without it cutting out. I replaced it with one of my Soundbridges and since then have not looked back. As for audio quality? I never got far enough to find out. Shame.

<Title>Not ready for prime time, but getting there
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like other reviewers, setup was relatively painless and I got it working on day one (familiarity with wireless networking needed).  After a week's time, with new songs and playlists added to my library, the bugs started to appear, and now I can't get it to play anything (though it does receive the data with no problems over my network).  Numerous rescans, software re-loads, and interaction with the help desk couldn't get humpty-dumpty back together again. I am hoping that the open software has some good engineers behind it so that the bugs will be worked out and I can use it.  Great concept and great while it worked. Sitting broken on my shelf - not so good.    September 2007 - since a recent software update, the device is back up an running (so far without flaws).  If you are willing to go through some computer-related stress to get results, it's a solid product that makes your library of music sound great on any decent hi-fi setup.   If I could update my star rating, I'd bump it up to 4 stars, since I've been 3 months without problems and I'm pleased with the performance.

<Title>I also have nothing but silence
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I too can relate to all of the reviewers who can not get sound.  Slim Devices drops my wireless signal about every three minutes.  It is very rare that it will play a whole song.  I have tried a linksys G router, a US Robotics router, and now a D Link router.  I am not using other wireless resource while it is playing besides my latop.  All of my other wireless devices show "excellent" signal strength while this thing can not seem to locate a network.  Customer support said it was my router's power settings.  I am on my third router from three different manufactures and I think it is the sqeezebox.  I would recommend passing on this product as I am sitting here playing MP3s on my laptop speakers looking at my Squeexebox screen stating its usual "Problem, can't find a wireless network" message.

<Title>Amazing! Even I can do it!
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have recently decided to enter the 20th century and made my computer/printer wireless. Then, what the heck, how about the stereo too. This is new and daunting stuff for me (I'm much older than 14). Once I got the coumputer wireless to satellite (LinkSys), then came the print server (NetGear)--no problem with either. The stereo connection was simplest of all. In less than 20' (including reading the instructions) I was streaming my CD collection to my stereo. Only one glitch. After about 1/2 hour, the computer-squeezebox interface (Web) failed to find the Squeezebox. What fixed it was going through the Squeezebox setup again. (It had everyting I had previously entered so I just stepped through.) I has worked for the last 2 hrs. w/o problems. If you don't hear from me again on this, assume that it is still working well. Frankly, I'm amazed that this suite of mixed-maker products work together. I know, they should, but realistically, how often do electronics interface as they advertise? ADDITION: After a month or so, I still greatly enjoy this product, but there are glitches. When my network goes down, sometimes the Squeezebox does not come back up with the rest. I found that unplugging it then going through the setup menu (accepting everyting as it is presented) brings it back up. Simple unplugging and powering up does not work. Also, I have Panasonic home theater with wireless back speakers. I had to move the WiFi to channel 11 to prevent interference and buy new wireless phones too (Panasonic DIRECT 6.0). It's a learning experience! Not hopelessl, though!

<Title>Siimply the best purchase for my home audio system I've ever made
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to do an in-depth review of because so many other folks have, but I'll give my two cents.  I've owned a Squeezebox for over 2 years now and it has worked flawlessly the entire time. Setup was easy from what I remember (it's been a while), sound quality is fantastic (especially when using FLAC files), and it looks so good sitting on my shelf with my Onkyo TX-NR901. In fact frustration with Onkyo's built in music server is what prompted me to buy the Squeezebox. This is one gadget I have never had one iota of buyers remorse for... ever.

<Title>This is the future of music. Insanely cool.
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a gadget freak and this is without a doubt the COOLEST toy I own. After ripping my entire CD collection to WMA lossless and later converting to FLAC to get the advantage of replaygain volume leveling, I can now instantly play any song or playlist from over 400 CDs, quickly searching via artist name, album, genre, or a custom playlist. The networking setup is not quite as easy or simple as it should be, especially if you are using wireless or multiple PCs running multiple servers. But it's not that hard, either, and I was able to figure it out and once I did, it works consistently and very, very well. The sound quality is absolutely as good as from the original CDs. The remote is not bad, but it could be even better, but it's just as easy to run the interface from a laptop using wi-fi, even if your music library is on another network computer or hard drive. The support on the slim devices forums and knowledgebase are very good, and if you really need some hand-holding you can call them and talk to a live person for help. Seriously, you set this up and you will start feeling like a pro DJ-  all you need is a VIP guest list...

<Title>Amazing device...it will change how you experience music
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Why are audiophiles buzzing about this inexpensive product? It is the first mass consumer unit to sound as good as much more expensive audio products. I had it up and running with my wireless network in 15 minutes, and was simply stunned by how good it sounded playing my music on computer. Even the internet radio playing through this unit sounded better than any standard radio tuner. Read my experience at musicserver.blogspot.com   I have a huge investment in my current audio system (more than $20k). I read about the Squeezebox on one of the audiophile websites, and was intrigued by having all my music accessible on a computer, but with sound quality to match my high end CD player. After a month of living with the Squeezebox, I can confirm how good it sounds, how simple it is to set up, and how versatile it is. I have not turned on my $3000 CD transport in 2 weeks, and plan on selling it shortly.  I encourage anyone ready to set up a computer system to visit my blog at musicserver.blogspot.com to see how easy it was to set up your music collection on a computer.   For the 95% of people out there who don't understand or care about audiophile quality sound, don't worry. A stock Squeezebox playing your music stored on your computer will sound better than anything you can buy for any reasonable amount of money.   For the uninitiated, a Squeezebox is part of a system of storing your CD collection on computer, and you use the Squeezebox to access/browse your computerized music collection. You need a computer, of course, and to get the best sound quality, you need to rip your music using a high quality format, like WAV or Apple Lossless or FLAC. It works with computers running Windows, Linux or Apple operating systems, and it does not require an expensive computer. Many users are running it with a laptop! It connects to your computer either wirelessly (using built in wifi connection) or via an ethernet cable.  After a month of playing with this unit, I cannot see how I could ever go back to using a CD player.   For audiophiles who are dubious about how an inexpensive box can compete with separates, read my blog. This box is the real deal, and when upgraded using a few simple tweaks (and when used with an external DAC), it is awesome!!! If you don't have or don't want a external DAC, the Squeezebox can be modified by a number of companies to upgrade the existing DAC and produce great quality sound.  The audiophile press and internet gurus are abuzz about this product for good reason. I was pretty skeptical, but it was so cheap I figured I had little to lose. I am not one to gush about gear, but this box is just phenomenal!!!

<Title>Making my iPod Jealous
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just picked up the Squeezebox over the holidays and it has quickly become one of my favorite toys. I mostly listen to music in my car and living room and was transporting my iPod between both places and to the computer to add new files. This arrangement caused several inconveniences. I always had to update the iPod playlists before I could listen to new/seasonal music. I was limited to listening to what my iPod could hold. My wife had no music at the house while I was in the car and I had to shuttle the docking station between my stereo and PC.  The Squeezebox has resolved all these issues and more. Now I have access to my entire collection from the living room. All my iTunes playlists and artist/album/genre/song/etc information is available and searchable. The remote control is constantly being passed around when I have friends over, the intuitiveness of the product means that everyone finds their favorite songs in seconds.  While I didn't buy the Squeezebox for internet radio I find myself regularly using it. It gives you easy access to thousands of stations, many commercial free with no fees like satellite radio. Since the signal is digital each radio track displays artist and song info. Whatever you listen to, you will find several stations that beat the ClearChannel garbage on traditional radio. For some reason I get a kick out of having a choice of 5 Russian stations.  Setup is a cinch, and I have not experienced any technical difficulties that were caused by the squeezebox. The Squeezebox is a fraction of the price of Sonos and technologically superior to the Roku Soundbridge. Definitely a worthwhile purchase, highly recommended.

<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm another giddy owner of the SB3.  My CDs now live in a box in the basement.  When I buy a CD, I rip it to FLAC or WMA, and play it via the SB3.  Sounds better than my $400+ player... but why shouldn't it?  No carriage, no moving parts, just an error-free digital stream going thru the BurrBrown DAC every time.    But aside from the listening advantages, the player displays all track info, and it's easy to surf your collection. The pre-set radio stations are good fun to stumble upon.  Every other option looks anachronistic compared to this machine. Buy it. JL

<Title>Suits My Need
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Kensington A/V dock for iPod for my wife and while it works well for a small setup, no one can expect hi-fi sound quality from a small setup and it holds true for that dock despite it is a good little gadget.  I listen to classical music and even though I am not a hi-fi fanatic, I care about the sound quality a lot for my classical music collection.  After weeks of research, I found the solution from the Squeezebox (v.3).  I almost went to the Soundbridge but the 802.11b wireless connection is not desirable for my network.  Some people does not like the web-based control (SlimServer) but that is an additional control method.  The remote could do everything for navigation but I like the ease of using SlimServer to create playlists and typing internet radio url.  Although the device does not work directly with iTunes, SlimServer does a seamless job.  It imported all my album arts and information correctly.  It really isn't an issue.  The sound quality is excellent, there are many other technical reviews on the web about how they achieve this.  The display is large and displays all information of my collection.  The remote does not appear to be as well built as the device but it works very well and easy to operate.  Another big feature I like is the stand-alone internet radio function.  It has thousands of stations and I can type in any other with their url's.  The only complaint I have is the stand, it has a fix tilt angle.  It works fine for my setup but an adjustable tile would accommodate more different setup (such as up high on a shelf).  I highly recommended this and it would even be better if it has a LCD remote control like the Sono but for a small fraction of the Sono price and performs so well, I can live without the remote with a screen.  I highly recommend this device.

<Title>Not ready for prime time
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here's my experience with a Squeezebox:  You might question my condemning  the Squeezebox while much of the below discusses the Slimserver software.  However, to use the SB you will need Slimserver.  Our setup is SB3 connected via ethernet, G4/933/1.5 gig RAM, dedicated 125 gig drive for music, remote control via Palm TX (which, since 6.3, it can no longer do and we're too unimpressed to spend the time getting it to connect again) or thru the laptops with various bits of software.  1) The installation and maintenance is not for the faint of heart.  We have 3 Mac's and a Windows box in this household.  With the frequent releases of SlimServer software (which you need), frequent OS updates (at least for OS X - we don't bother updating XP unless there's a very compelling reason to mess with it), SB firmware updates and the occasional changes one makes to a router, stability and consistency of performance is poor.  We were on SlimServer 6.2.x and our SB3 ran well for about a year.  The set-up was not a cinch and there were occasional irritations between releases.  Since v6.3 our life has been nothing but a hassle.  Volume jumps all over the place, ethernet wake-on-sleep does not work (you can't set your music server to sleep automatically).  There are truly mindless parts of the code (if you have a playlist that contains 100 tracks but you set your menu view to 10 then that's all you get).  For whatever reason, Slimserver does not play a playlist, only that portion of it that appears on your screen.  So, set menu view to 10,000 and it works.  However, it makes using a pda remote useless as they simply can't deal with that much display and scrolling through it on a pda is truly ugly.  2) Sound quality:  This is based on listening through Swan M-200's or $10,000 worth of amp/passive pre/cd player and speakers.  Much has been written about the great sonic qualities of the SB.  Perhaps.  Versus the Mac's simple headphone jack - better midrange definition and better low-end depth.  Versus an M-Audio Revolution card we threw away - better definition but, for mp3 and internet radio, more tiring to listen to.  Versus an AirPort Express, its pretty much a draw for mp3 or internet radio.  If you're listening to mp3, a great dac will do nothing to help make it sound remotely close to the source cd (we encode at 320 or 192 kbps).  3) Support:  There's a very dedicated group of people behind this product.  Read the forums.  However, our assessment is there are a whole lot of tinkerers and there is such a mismatch of OS's/Slimserver versions/SB player preference configurations/Slimserver preference configurations/firmware versions/router configurations and people's usage and expectations that the forums are of dubious value.  There are frequent posts about the same problem popping up with no real solutions provided or admission that there is in fact a problem.  "I think this is how it works" is a common response.  4) Overall:  If you want to listen to music use iTunes (or whatever) and get a simple Airport Express at less than 1/2 the price (configuring an Airport Express on a non-Apple router is a bit of a pain (we use a DI-624) but once its done its stable).  That's what we've done after living with a Squeezebox SB3 for 2 years and taking a very close look at the Sonos (sounds nice but the SB3 did as well).  For remote control we use Palm VNC, netTunes on the Powerbooks and PlayerPal on a Fujitsu tablet.  Its rock solid (other than the Windows component) and we're now back to listening to music.  We can also now sleep our G4.

It worked great for about a week. Since then its been nothing but a source of aggravation. It's either randomly turning off, or it "can't connect to squeezenetwork." And when it is conected half the time the connection is weak and fades in and out. I think Id be better off with a coat hanger. And I have absolutely NO problem with my mac connecting to the wireless network. Ever. It's back to itunes for me. wouldnt recommend you buy this piece of crap in case I didnt make it clear.

<Title>Very, very good
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to admit that I'm totally taken with this product. Over the past years I have purchased well over 5 of these devices (starting with the original 'SliMP3'), in their various incarnations.   The squeezebox is a mature product, having aged *very* well both in hardware design and software.  The software part is open-source (and so good that at some time even competitors like Roku used it to base their product on), and has more features that I can remember. Setting up the server is a two-step process:  First you set up your PC as music server. This means that you need to have a PC that is always turned on (at first I used an old Windows 2000 based laptop, but have since exchanged that with a Mac mini that does nothing else but serve up media content). Installing and starting the server is very simple for anyone but the most basic users (it requires your PC to enable web serving, and you must configure your firewall accordingly). The server starts up, and immediately begins scanning your music library. It integrates very nicely with both Windows Media Player and (particularly well) iTunes.   Configuring the server is done using a web interface, and can be done from anywhere in your home LAN where you can reach the server. This is especially nice if you have more than one PC in your home. You can remotely control any Squeezebox that is connected to the server (more than one can connect to a server and play independently from each other), and even build playlists on the fly.  The Squeezebox itself you set up next. Basically, installing it involves connecting it to a stereo or active speakers, connecting power, and turning it on (the wired variant requires you to connect an ethernet cable as well). The 'box starts up, and guides you through the setup process. You control all aspects of setting up the box with it's remote. Set-up is quick, but I highly recommend you use your wireless security features (in this case, setting it up takes an additional but painless step). After roughly a minute, your Squeesebox is connected to your LAN, and has access to all the music that is stored on your PC. The more recent squeezeboxes also now have access to Internet streams, making it possible to listen to Internet radio even without your local server being on.  You can remotely control the Squeezebox either via Web interface, or a (rather cheaply made) IR remote control unit. This remote control is actually the low-point of the device, and I have replaced it on most devices with a much better-feeling remote from Logitech (who, ironically, have now acquired SlimDevices, SqueezeBoxe's manufacturer).   Sound quality is good in my opinion - but then I'm definitely not an audiophile. Some albums that are meant to be played gapless (e.g. Rush's 'Hemispheres' or Pavarotti's interpretation of Verdi's 'La Traviata') have noticeable short gaps between songs as the server switches beetwen songs. This can be annoying, but are no show-stop for me (it *is* a bit jarring in Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' and 'Wish you where here')  Since the Squeezebox is actually 'just' a smart frontend to your fully fledged computer, it can do a *lot* more than just play music. You can easily configure it to be an alarm clock (with different alarm times for each day of the week, alternating play lists etc), an internet stock/news ticker, weather forecast etc. I really love the versatility of this thing.   An annoying shortcoming (hardly a fault of the manufacturer) is the fact that it currently can't play protected (DRM's) songs (at least neither iTunes nor Zune). I'm still hoping that this changes in the future. On the other hand, it also plays some of the more obscure music formats available (some natively, other using a technique called transcoding).  The SqueezeBox uses only a tiny fraction of your LAN's available bandwidth, so you can use it without problems on low-bandwidth networks such as Ethernet-over-Powerline or 802.11b wireless.  Unexpected benefits - Squeezebox also acts as wireless bridge - Mini-Games available - Internet radio available even if server off-line  Room for improvements: - Synchronous play for multiple Squeezeboxes - Playback of DRM'd songs   All in all I can heartily recommend this device to anyone who looks for a painless method to play their computer-bound music library on the stereo (which traditionally is not connected to the LAN - this is where the wireless connection comes in handy).

<Title>Better than I expected! Works with or without computer on!

<Content>I bought this item primarily to listen to [...]custom radio stations.  For Pandora and a bunch of other internet radios you don't need to have your computer on to listen. Only your internet connection and router have to be on.  If you would like to listen to music from your computer, squeezebox wakes your computer up from a "stand by" mode. For me this was fantastic ! The menu structure and interface are very good, but of course it takes time to scroll and find your music, unless you use the numberpad or arrows to "type" in your search. However this can be easily circumvented by creating playlists on your computer.  The device also accepts your itunes playlists, which can save you a lot of time. I haven't tested the "smart playlists" of itunes to see if they are compatible. Also, you can operate the device (or devices - you can have multiple squeezeboxes synchronized or playing independently), from your computer. On your computer you can turn on, pause, select music to play, playlists, synchronize the players, etc... AGAIN, MUCH BETTER THAN I ANTICIPATED. You can also have a daily alarm and another for each day of the week with a different tune everyday. The alarm plays a whole bunch of nice sounds, but according to the manual you can also wake up to a particular playlist that you create (I have not tested this yet). STRONGLY RECOMMEND !! Much better than D-Link 520 for music. However the D-Link 520 also plays video... I have both!

<Title>Worst $300 I've Ever Spent, and I've Done Coke!!!,

<Content>To the reviewer below who gave this one star:  I'm feelin' ya, brother.  This unit is easy to set up and get running initially; it's the perpetual irritation and disfunctionality that occur afterwards that make this such a useless piece of dooky.  I bought this upon the recommendation of a friend. He warned me, however, to have a backup (like a CD player) because "this thing was irritating".   I had mine hooked up to my wireless network for about a week before I finally took it for a very rough (but overdue) trip to the trash. I'm still wondering why my friend (a notably intelligent Mechanical Engineer) feels that this irritation is worthwhile.   During the aforementioned Week of Audiophilic Agony, I can honestly say that this device functioned (on demand) less than 30% of the time. I can't even begin to desribe all of the irritating episodes that occurred--bizarre, inexplicable conflicts with other (previously installed) devices on my network; saying it's doing one thing (like playing a song)--while actually doing another (...not playing a song); etc., etc., etc...   This gadget will surely put your Wireless Network Engineering skills to the test. Don't really have any? Uh-oh.   I could easily waste the next hour describing the litany of problems I experienced with this device during that week, but that's exactly why I'm writing this--to keep you from wasting your valuable time (and money).   If your thinking of buying this because you think reloading a CD player is a pain, just try to remember the good 'ole days, when you'd glady flip and dust that scratchy LP every 18-25 minutes just to enjoy the other side.   I personally listen to music for relaxation, not irritation. I've not tried other wireless music streaming devices, but do yourself a favor--if you must go the streaming/wireless route, skip this one and find an alternative. It's hard to imagine one doesn't exist.
