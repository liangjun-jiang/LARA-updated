<Title>REVISED: If you're not an iTunes kinda person...
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>... then this might intrigue you greatly.  The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  Then what?  What compels you to choose one over the other?  It has to be the UI and user experience.  The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.  This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  What device would I recommend?  Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  **** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

<Title>upcoming market killer
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this new product from creative i feel will be sure to take over the market. First lets name thr competitors. The rio carbon 5 gb. and the ipod mini 4 gb. Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

<Title>Come on Zip
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.

<Title>Zip it!
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

<Title>Good functions, but way too ugly
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.  But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

<Title>Interesting design
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

<Title>Lotta Bang for the Buck
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.

<Content>I am totally hot to buy this, based on the specs as outlined on Amazon's site. However, one thing I'd like to know before I buy - will Bose and other 3rd party vendors offer products to complement the new Zen system as offered for the Ipod? I'd like the flexibility afforded by the speaker docking station, and right now it seems as if Bose is offering such an option only to the Apple consumer.  Thoughts???

<Title>I'll never buy an iPod!
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First I'd like to make a clarification of Timothy Stoehr's review. He states, "One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable." Hey smart guy, they're not called "microdrives" for nothing. It's true that CF cards are used in iPod minis but they are CF Type II, which means that they are in fact hard drives and they DO have moving parts. Don't believe me? Go here: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/micro/soltns.htm  3600 RPM, 12ms avg. seek time  All microdrive players have moving parts, and all microdrive players utilize CF Type II.  I don't own a Zen Micro yet but I am waiting for reviews to come out. I don't know about you guys, but I refuse to buy an Apple iPod. I refuse to buy into the Apple image and support a company that still won't use the right-click on a mouse! Pathetic. I walk around and see all these people with white earbuds and I just shake my head.... If the Zen Micro were just 0.2 inches thinner I think I would be sold for sure.

<Title>Buy the Zen Micro and support the Ipod killer!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I'm a music technophile hailing from the tiny island of Singapore, the country that is offering the world the Zen Micro. Like many people, I have been sold on the idea of getting a hard-disk based portable MP3 player since mid-2004 and have been hunting around for a good one for the past 5 months.  When the mini-Ipod came out in Asia to buy in July 2004, I was pretty much interested in getting one. However, the high price for 4GB (S$458.00=US$275.00) and seriously, not too exciting colours, stopped me buying it immediately.  My attention turned to the then-competing product, the Creative MuVo2 4GB. Retailing at S$398.00 (US$240.00), the gadget looked pretty attractive, but I was still hedging for something better, as it was still larger than the mini and looked a bit plasticky.  So when I saw the Zen Micro on pre-launch in October 2004, and the blurb by the CEO of Creative Technologies in the local papers on its features and functions, I was very intrigued. The next 4 weeks was spent trawling the internet reading reviews on the pros and cons of the Ipod Mini vs. the Zen Micro. Very interesting.  Now, I'm pretty convinced that I shall get the Zen Micro, if only to march to the beat of a different drummer. Hearing friends extol the virtues of the Ipod and dissing everything else without empirical evidence just helped me make my mind up even more.   I'm sure that audio quality wise the ZM will beat the IM hands down. I don't know about the rest of the functions, but I am willing to place my faith in the hands of the underdog.  As for those writing about whether accessories companies (Bose, are you listening?) will support the ZM, I think that the market must be there first before these companies will create the supporting accessories. I for one would love to be able to plug the ZM into a good home stereo, either at my home or at my friend's place. Oh, and bluetooth capabilities would just be too cool.  So, all you people out there who's had enough of the hype of the Ipod Mini marketing machine, here's your chance to tell Apple who's really boss!

<Title>Cynical Reply
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow this player would be so great if it were only an Apple iPod. If it looked like an iPod, had less features like an iPod, only worked with an iMac and iTunes and were actually made by Apple and not Creative then I would love it.   I do so wish it had MIDI support however, because all my favorite songs are in MIDI. It would be really awesome also if it had something usefull like a text based role playing game instead of having a calendar and contacts.  Obviously I'm being facetious, but that's kinda the vibe I got off all the negative comments. There was no good argument against a device that for the same price has higher compatibility, better sound quality, more functionality, a removable battery and a radio and voice recorder thrown in just for giggles.   My only major complaint at this time is that I preordered this device on Oct. 17th and it still has not shipped, apparently due the overwhelming amount of orders placed for it.   I do wish that there were some hands on reviews out there (CNET has it, but has not posted their review yet) and I wish it came with the wired remote. I still plan to purchase that seperately but it would have been nice to have it included. If anyone has found any real hands-on review please let me know.   If you are a Windows user and do not use iTunes AND size matters (I had a 20 GB unit but it just big enough to be a problem when snowboarding and skateboarding) then this is the best option I've seen.

<Title>Very happy with the Zen Micro player
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is a great little player.  I have had the silver Zen Micro for almost 5 days.  Its a big step up from the flash player I was using before.  Its a nice small package and great design.  Its a little wider than the I-Pod and feels slightly heavier.  The case is very solid, and the front face is seamless.  Sound quality is excellent, although I did replace the earbuds with the Sony Ex71SL earbuds, which are really, really good and much more comfortable.  Navigation and controls work very well.  I still think the I-POD scroll wheel works a little better than the straight line slide control on the Zen, but the difference is not that great.  The volume was very easy to adjust, even during work-outs.  It took a little time to figure out how to create a playlist from the music library, but its easy once I figured out the sequence, and the menu lets you select songs by genre, artist or song name.  The Zen Micro also allows you to create and save on the fly playlists, or you can create them with the Media Source sfotware.  Its great that there are so many ways to download music vs. being tied to i-Tunes as with the i-POD.  The included software makes it very easy to transfer files to the player, and I was able to use either Windows Explorer, the Creative Media software or Musicmatch to transfer files (I was not able to synch with Napster).  I did find that about 4 to 6 out of the 200 songs I downloaded did not transfer for some reason when I used either the Creative Media Source software or MusicMatch.  So far the battery life is less than 12 hours, but the early editions of the Micro shipped with two batteries. It could be that by turning the backlight off or adjusting the controls less frequently the battery life will be much longer.   Overall this is a fantastic player so far.  I'm very impressed with the quality for something that was just launched last week.

<Title>Exceeds the Ipod
<Date>Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I compared the Zen Micro to the Ipod. It's plain out better than the Ipod in these areas:  - battery life and convenience - sound quality!!! - extra features (fm, voice recorder)  It's relatively the same in "user-friendlyness". For all those people debating about the better design, they are both well made and look nice ... it's up to personal preference. Just let each customer make up their own mind about the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the Ipod is a good player, but there's too much hype and overall, I believe the Zen Micro is better. Better sound, battery and more features, what more can you ask for?

<Date>Fri Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After researching mp3 players ad nauseum, I decided to buy the Zen Micro, and I'm glad I did. I have a flash player for the gym but wanted something with more storage for everyday listening. My music library is a little over 35 gig but I felt I didn't need that kind of capacity in an mp3 player. What drew me to the Zen Micro was the replaceable battery, the FM Tuner, the optional clip, and the ability to create playlists on the fly, not to mention that it has more storage than the iPod mini. I looked at the Rio Carbon, but it didn't have an FM tuner or playlists on the fly. I looked at the Archos Gmini XS200, but the battery is not replaceable and the initial software is reported to be clunky. So far, I have been very pleased with the Zen Micro. The touch pad seems to be a point of debate with everyone, and I agree it takes a little practice, unless you have a laptop with a touchpad in which case it is second nature. I was concerned that the touchpad would be so frustrating that I wouldn't enjoy the player, but that's not the case. The sound is excellent, the player is tiny, the software is easy to use, and the thin neon blue strip of lighting definitely adds to the cool factor. I am using Windows Media for syncing and haven't had any problems yet. This is definitely going to be an iPod mini assassin.

<Content>Like many other ppl, I was deciding between this player and the Ipod mini.  I chose this for the following reasons:  -1 gig extra -FM Tuner -Voice Recorder -Detacheable Battery -EXTRA FREE battery($40 value) -NON proprietary music file format(plays WMA, which is smaller than mp3 and quite popular, doesn't work w/ ipod :(  Have had it for a week now.  Took less than a minute to install.  Very intuitive interface.  The control takes a little getting used to but it's definitely manageable and oh for ppl worried 'bout the "touch sensitive" controls, there's a "lock" button, works great.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Good player but  very poor construction
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).    However, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.  My only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren't sexy but they're easy and work well).    I am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year!

<Content>This MP3 player is packed with features but all that means nothing if it doesn't work.  My headphone jack began to fail after just 3 months of ownership and wouldn't work without contant jiggling.  The hard drive failed just outside the warranty period.  I deposited the device in the trash and purchased a Sandisk Sansa player.  It's much nicer, slimmer, has no hard drives to fail and contains all the features you would need.

<Content>As many other reviews have agreed, I liked mine until it broke - in two ways.  Same headphone problem as others, but that was nothing compared to the total meltdown it then experienced.  Now I can't even turn it on, and I've only owned it 11 months.  I liked the space, features, setup, etc. but that makes me all the more sad that it's hopelessly broken.  Try another brand, because if you buy this one you will just end up buying the other brand in a few months anyway.

Yeah ight, for a major defect that was THEIR problem and if you weren't under warrent then too bad?!?! Not only that but the software wouldn't let me well do anything. I had to go install a new media center just to sync music. This would have been the Ipod killer if it didn't have crap service and hardware problems. Don't waste your money on Creative.

<Title>Good until...
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zen Micro about a year ago.  I loved it because it had great features at a great price.  The music is pretty good and it holds a lot.  The radio is good once you get it to tune.  The way it is designed is great and the voice recording is useful.  A few weeks ago though, my problems with it started.  If you charge the battery when it is half-way, it makes the battery last a LOT less.  It started dieing very soon.  I tried to charge it, but when you take out the battery and turn it on it goes to a recovery screen.  You can't get out of it easily.  It is helpful but never delete the firmware. It says you can reload it onto the player through a USB plug, but you can't easily at least.  Since it was more than 60 days old, they wouldn't let me talk to them over the phone.  Also, it was more than a year ago so they wouldn't even help me by e-mail.  They left me with a small "knoledge database" that didn't help at all.  They did say though that for $12.99 you could get a 30 minute session with a "Creative tutor."  I took a search to finally find the phone number.  Finally I got in contact with a person and told him my problem.  He told me that I could send it in and get it repaired for $60 to $100 plus $12.99 for shipping back and whatever I pay for shipping to get there.  Disgusted, I decided not to pay, and just got a new player.  So I am here to tell you that while the Zen Micro might be good, the service is absolutely terrible.  Even Apple which I heard doesn't have great service has better service than Creative.  [...]

<Title>Not that great...

<Content>We bought one of these for my daughter and within a month the thing would freeze up. She sent it back for repairs and left the battery in. They fixed it and sent it back without the battery and told her it would cost $40 dollars for a new battery.  I was mad and wrote the head of their public relations department a letter and Creative called me the next morning and had a battery overnighted to my daughter. (hint: go to the public relations for fastest results). Then it happened again and they would send a new one (didn't have to call their PR after the first one). This happend 3 more times till my daughter quit using her sony sport headphones.  Then after about 3 months the headphone jack started having problems, so she brought it to me and I fixed it. And it has worked fine since then. The same thing happened to my video zen:m using the sony headphones. Evidently there something with sony headphones and creatives MP3 players. Now my daughter has a ipod nano and seems really happy with it.

<Title>Programs not clear
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had the unit only a day, and figured out how to load the mp3s after an hour or so of loading program and reading the manual. Although pretty much Windows drag and drop, there is some setup to do beforehand, so don't rush things and read the pdf manual. The paper manual has instructions for installing the drivers and playing the files. You'll have to go online or read the pdf manual to really work this thing.  I think I am pretty satisfied with the quality and oompf of the player itself, but Creative's "MediaSource Organzier" interface (along with the simpler "Media Explorer" and their capabilities--or not--caused many wasted hours here on Day Two. The Explorer offers a task list to easily rip audio CD to the device, with a box to check whether you wanted to also rip the mp3s to the Music Library on the C drive. I didn't want to waste my precious space on C drive, so unchecked the option. Later when I wanted to burn an MP3 CD (rather than an audio CD), I found could do this only with access to the harddrive's version of the Music Library. When I finally figured that out (and I reripped the album I was interested in),  then the mp3 burn list would import the tracks only in alphabetical order. I tried via a custom playlist and bringing over a clearly numbered Album, and they tracks jumped to the burnlist in alphabetical order. Through the forums on Creative's website, I discovered that is the only option. No way to have the mp3s be "tracked" on an mp3 CD burn. And that's it. Phooey.  And for some reason, I could not after the fact move my many ripped albums of mp3s from the Zen player to the c drive's Music Library. If this had been explained beforehand or at all somewhere, I would have saved hours of time. But their manuals and tutorials make it all seem so easy..select tracks, place them in order with my named playlist, click a few buttons...and presto, it's stalled or a mess with no means to figure what happened.  I eventually worked around the whole thing using other programs, and now have a cd that will play my tracks in order on a CD player. Now I'm just going to make straight copies of it. Too many hours where a few sentences in the manual would have helped.
