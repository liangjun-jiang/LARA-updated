<Title>A fantastic Player - 1 year ago
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I purchased my zen over a year ago I thought it was the greatest thing out there. It had so much potential and the abilities is had were up there with the best.... and then Creative pretty much abandoned the product. There hasn't been a firmware upgrade in over a year, all the accessories that were supposed to come out never did. (No Docking station, no case, etc.) The problems with the interface that were promised to be fixed weren't and the product has just slowly become obsolete.  I would look at some of the other players out there before purchasing this player and at least look to a product that is being supported and not just being sold.

<Title>THE BEST MULTIMEDIA PLAYER SO FAR!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this product for a year now and I have to say I am extremely satisfied.  It performed all the features flawlessly and then some.  I even dropped this player couple of time but had no malfunction or problem.  This is even better than iPod when it comes to ease of use and features.  I'm glad I chose this instead of iCrap.  The best feature about this product is when I get tired of looking at small screen I could hook it up to TV & watch how cool is that.  Hopefully creative will come up with thinner version of this in future.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHBZHC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6838194-5494265">Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Will never own an Apple product again, EVER!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Until you try a player like the Zen Vision W, you don't really realize how much of a garbage product the Ipod is. OMG! The only thing that the iPod has going for it is design and size, that's it!  About the Zen - I discovered on my own that you don't need Windows Media Player, Winamp or the included software to sort out your music. You open it as a hard drive, all your folders are listed in there, just drop your MP3s in there and start listening. There's no renaming like in the Ipod, no moving, scrambling, no third party software, nothing. It is a portable hard drive, so you use it as one. No, I tunes, no account set up, no restrictions on how many computers you can hook up your device to, full freedom to use it as you please. You take out and you ad music when you want and share it with whoever you want. As simple as it gets. Video? Awesome. Had some movies on my hard drive sitting around, just opened the movie folder in the Vision W and pasted them in there, all play perfect. Didn't have to resize, compress, nothing. Everything about this player is well though out. You can tell that they put some effort into it to make it easy to use. The battery? Detachable! When it wears out, you take it out and put a new one in. No need to send it in to Apple to have them open your device to change it for you and charge you an arm and a leg for it. Another thing about the battery is that it lasts. I charged it last night, started using it this morning at 7:30Am It is 2 pm right now and the battery is full!!! If this was an Ipod, it'd be at 50% if that. It has a speaker so you don't HAVE to have earphones to listen to it, it has radio as well. You have a Digital SLR camera with a CF card? Use it to back up your pictures with the CF slot built into the Vision W. What more can I say. It is large compared to the iPod, yes but so is the screen. I just can't believe I ever purchased an iPod when there are devices available out there that make so much more sense. Never an Apple product AGAIN!

<Title>We Love Them!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband and I bought each other these for Christmas...They are great!  Lots of storage (I've got ALL of our digital pics on mine), plus we've moved various tv shows we've recorded to them to have them portable for viewing (either in bed, in the car, etc.).  The jack it comes with knows if it's connecting to a tv (and therefore sends video) or a stereo (and therefore just sends audio), and the sound through real speakers is awesome.  (The sound through the built in speaker leaves something to be desired, but even computer speakers work well.)  Friends of ours have already said that when the next version comes out, they are sure we will get new ones and our boys will get these...  Louise

<Title>Beats IPOD Hands Down!
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own an IPOD and it is a good unit once you get by the ACC file conversions. However, if you are looking for great video and music with a picture that you don't have to magnify to watch then the Zen is for you. It will do just about any thing you want to. The size of the unit is a little big but then I am not running with the unit. It has a removable battery which is great too. If you have a really good ear I would recommend a BOSE headset instead of the ear buds.

<Title>Excellent fix for the media addict
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, why don't places like Best Buy and Circuit City sell more goodies like this?.. This product is superb... excellent compatability as media player, or as removable hard drive, and the OS is set up quite nicely. Great battery life, and I truly was impressed with the clarity of the screen when watching higher-resolution videos.   The size may deter some folks away, but this thing fits in my inner jacket pocket, so there shouldn't be any troubles keeping comfortably at-hand while flying, etc.   One last thing that impressed me is Creative's extra effort to increase compatibility... When you upload a non-compatible video to your ipod, you are out of luck. Buy the software for conversions, and you might get lucky. With Creative, however, any incompatible format will be converted automatically when you try to upload it to the Zen W.   I have a total of 7 mp3 players and/or media players, and I couldn't have asked for anything more in my newest toy, the Creative Zen W. Thanks for such an excellent product!

<Content>The Zen Vision W fulfills every need for a portable entertainment device.  If battery life was just a little longer it would be perfect. I know others might criticize the size and weight,but how else are you going to have decent sized wide screen?  The device has to be at least as big as the screen.  If you want small then buy a smaller device.  Beautiful!

<Title>A Zen a day keeps the Apple away ! ! !
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well our household purchased 2 Zen Vision W's for Christmas 2006. To date we have been extremely happy with this multi media machine. The screen, colour, clarity has NO equal. The storage of musical tracks is awesome and so many playback features that are really, really cool. The computer software interface is very user friendly and ables you to set up everything within minutes, easy editing makes this a ongoing delight to work with. The only negatives would be the lack of accessories currently available but some research at creative, ebay and other sites things slowly coming on strong. I read hundreds of reviews before purchasing this product, I sampled and looked at the competition  - Hmmm there is none that packs so much into one extremely versatile machine. Top marks Creative, thank-you for an awesome Christmas and beyond!

<Title>The Creative Zen Vision W  Is Incredible!
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me first say that I am so glad that I did not go the IPOD route because of it's MANY limitations.  This player is amazing.  It will take SO many different types of music or video files which makes it far superior to IPOD.   Screen clarity is great for videos, love the EQ options and the ability to customize your own.  I have the 60GB Zen W model(it's been out about 3 months now) which has currently about 2000 songs and close to 125 hrs of vidoe on it, and I still have 20 gigs to go.  Have fun filling it up, it's taken me almost 3 weeks of nonstop work.  Rips a song in about 20 secs from CD, and a 2 hr video in 90 secs (using Video Vault after conversion for Vids).   I bought the wireless remote, and the buttons vs. touch pad is no big deal.  Earbuds are good but I upgraded to Creative's $99 in ear phones which are AWESOME (I also have Shure's comparible in ear model and Creative's is far superior).  I also purchased a spare battery which is easily interchangeable and relatively cheap. Avg batt life so far is about 2 1/2 hrs for video, and who knows for audio b/c I've let it play all day on audio w/ a full charge and it didn't die, however that is with the switch in lock mode which turns off the screen. Player charges with USB cable (included) or AC adapter (included).   The out options are incredible, I can hook it to any TV or projector and surprisingly the picture is pretty good using full screen mode. (3 way Cable is included)  It also has an external speaker which works pretty good.  When it comes to you it has a protective plastic over the screen DO NOT THROW IT AWAY it keeps your screen from scratching and works well. (A replacement costs about 14 bucks)  So what are the cons?    1.  It doesn't handle static well and rebuilds the drive every time you pop it so I recommend purchasing the SKIN which is made of silicone from Creative it totally eliminates static and is great for protecting your player from accidental drops.    2.  It is pretty big so don't look to use it on your person while aggressively excercising (just for walking)  It does however fit in a suit coat inner pocket with SKIN on and in it's velvet pouch (included).  3.  It doesn't have all of the IPOD gimmick options yet (it's not been out long and Creative assures that more options are coming)but for around $25 you can purchase a Belkin FM digital transmitter which will allow you to listen to it anywhere that has FM. (GREAT OPTION)  So far that's all I find, mabye because I'm very pleased.  Overall, it's durable, well made, and very easy to use even if you are somewhat computer illiterate.  Again let me stress that IPODS confine you to Itunes or Ivideo.  If you want freedom buy this player, you won't be sorry! And if a larger video screen is important to you the Zen Vision W is the player for you.  It is worth every dime I paid for it, and more!!

<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first portable media techno gadget. My spouse offered to buy me an ipod for Christmas, but after reading the review of this in Wired and the on-line reviews of the Vision W, I begged for this instead.  So glad I did.  It is as nice as the reviews state it is. It is easy to use if you have basic knowledge of file transfer and the picture clarity is unbelievable.  I purchased the max. memory storage with visions of using it for movie watching, listening to audio books and music during travel. I certainly would recommend this product if you want to go beyond just MP3 files without taking more equipment with you!

<Title>Zen Vision W 60
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Zen Vision W 60 a little over a month ago.  It took me awhile to figure out how to download music (the best format) and movies because I am not savvy in this area.  Trying to find and download movies in a safe manner was especially challenging for me.  But once I figured everything out, I downloaded music, pictures and movies like crazy.  The Creative Media Source Organizer and Zen Vision W Media Explorer made ripping and organizing easy.  Creative also provides hundreds of free Zen Cast (pod cast) downloads.  The picture quality is fantastic.  The navigation buttons situated on the right side of the unit were easier to use than I anticipated.  Although, I think I still like iPOD's navigation method better.  It is loaded with features and came supplied with almost everything I need.  I appreciate that the battery is replaceable and that the unit supports downloads in several formats.  I did experience static in the earphones supplied with the unit so I contacted Creative and they quickly sent me a new pair.  I also found the unit to be a bit large to carry but I manage to fit it in the glove/mp3 pocket of my fleece jacket.  I would not recommend it for use during vigorous activity.  If you want a unit loaded with features and a large, sharp picture, I would not let the size turn you away.  Overall, I recommend this product.

<Content>What an excellent device.  I can't believe I have waited this long to purchase this media player.  I have been using a 60 GB video iPod for the past year and this thing blows it out of the water.  The screen is crisp, bright and gorgeous.    Pros: Screen Sound Screen Ease of use Screen Ease of loading music and videos Battery Life Standard USB 2.0 cable to sync CF Card reader  Cons: Size, but it's understandable....The screen makes up for the size. Very little accessories (Hard to find a good case)   I will never go back to Apple.  Unless they have a touchscreen 16:9 80gb with a CF reader.

<Content>This player is a great player. It plays most formats that are common available and has a large memory so you can store all your music and pictures  and some video. The software is pretty good too. Great color screen and compatible with your TiVoToGo feature. It's screen is so good looking it shows the lack of compression in certain video features (like TiVo). Bulky to use as just an MP3 player but fantastic sounding too with my Sennheiser PX-100. Try higher compression for best sound. Don't worry you have the memory room for it.

<Title>Love the big screen & features!
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player for about a month, and am really enjoying it. I was in a store recently looking at other brands, and after seeing the tiny screens on other brands, I was so glad I'd splurged & bought the widescreen Creative--players with smaller screens look puny in comparison. Yes, it's expensive & bigger in size, but it is still very portable. My previous MP3 players have all been Creative brand, and I'm also very happy with this one. Software is easy to use and I've easily transferred my music files onto it. It's also easy to transfer home videos taken with a digital camera onto the player, since the player accepts many formats. My only suggestion for improvement would be bigger selection buttons on the player, nevertheless I prefer the buttons to the hypersensitive touch pad on Creative's previous MP3 player. Battery life is great, but I'm still keeping my old Creative MP3 player for playing music (it has a very long battery life for music). I'm using this one just to play video. Please be aware that you may need some sort of video conversion software if your home movies aren't in a format the player accepts.

<Title>Great Digital Media Player, but need improvement
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great digital media player, particularly if you connect it with your home entertainment center.  The big hard-drive makes it possible to keep all your music and picture on this device.  Also love the screen: high quality.  If you are like me, who hates anything proprietary, like Apple's family of media players, i.e., the iPod, then Zen is a great alternative.  Some shortcomings: 1) Once you connect to A/V out, the screen blanks out.  This means you have to connect this to a TV/Monitor, to navigate the menu.  If you only want to connect to your stereo, you can only use the headphone jack.  The output from this jack noticeably produce an inferior sound, probably because the headphone jack is subject to the volume control--I am not an electronics expert, so I don't know if this is the cause.  But it seems that this problem can easily be resolved if the screen stays on when you connect through A/V output.  2) Infra-red remote does not work on power on when the player has been turned off for overnight.  This seems silly, as you wouldn't expect to have to walk over to push the power button on your TV the next day, so why shouldn't I be able to turn on the Zen using the remote control.  3) The video format support is very limitted.  It does not support the latest DivX format.  I e-mailed Zen.  They have no plan to release a firmware to support DivX 6.0.  Also, even a lot of windows media video files have to go through lengthy conversion (longer than the video itself) before they can be synced to the player.

<Title>Great product, just hate wasting time converting.
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved using this product, especially the fact that I can plug this into the TV and watch movies, listen to music, and view photos. I just hate the fact that not all video files are acceptable and need to be converted.  AVI files are said to be supported, but I had to convert most of my AVI files via Creative Zen converter. It took me at least 8hrs per file because I wanted the files converted to the best possible quality. Thats about 3 files a day! After a week and a half of conversion, I had 15 gigs of space left.  So WARNING to all you people who are looking at multimedia players, if you dont mind waiting for your files to be converted, this is a Great media Player.  Battery life is good, video quality is great, and its definately portable and could be plugged into TV whereever you want to take your media.

<Title>Complete music and photo library to go
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Zen to carry my entire music library so I wouldn't have to decide what to put on a smaller mp3 player. It also has every photo I've ever taken and the hard drive is only half full. Of course, I can't put the video library on there. That would take terabytes. It's nice to be able to show photos to the grandparents and they can pick and choose what to copy onto their computer. The compact flash slot is great for dumping camera cards when they are full, and the screen is big enough to actually see which photos are worth keeping and which to delete. I also bought the CF adaptor to plug in the XD cards from my Fuji camera. Works great. The FM radio was also a deciding factor in this purchase, although 32 presets is overkill. I haven't tried syncing the organizer with Outlook yet.

<Title>not happy
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>sure this product is great for storing tons of music files plus photos and even a few video files and when it is working it really works well.  However, this product is not everyday life friendly.  I droped this thing once and the screen broke which of course it to be expected (that can be fixed) but the short fall also totally killed the hard drive and now I have 400 bucks worth of junk.  My next thought was well I have a 1 year warranty so lets contact creative. Not so easy, it took me quite some to to find a number for customer service and when I did they basically told me that my 1 year warranty was worth as much as my 400 dollar piece of junk.  I would have to pay another 266 bucks to get a referbished one.  My opinion would be to consider all other models before settling with this one. and if you are a busy mom, dad or normal human being this product is not for you it does not hold up to ware and tear.  I have had several other mp3 players that have gone through a lot worse and are still ticking.

<Title>Great video capability, but not as good as the Nomad for Music
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use this player for my Jazzercise class. It sits on a table, connected to a PA system. I bought it, because my Nomad was stolen.  There are virtually no instructions with this player on how to use the software. If you've used Creative Mediasource Organizer before, you will have come to appreciate the ease of just dragging and dropping songs from your library to your player and/or into playlists. The new version of CMO that comes with this player won't let you do that. You have to slowly transfer everything. It didn't work for me until I contacted customer support several times. The program response is annoyingly slow, and it freezes up a lot. My computer is not the problem, since all other programs run fine. All in all I would say that once you know how to use the software this player works fine. I like that it has a speaker and the sound is very good. My daughter enjoys watching movies on it, which has been a life saver a few times already. Don't expect convenience and ease as with a Nomad, though. If it had that, this would be the most awesome MP3 player around. Maybe it is anyway, but the software to run it lacks, and that's why it only got 4 stars.

<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used this player for 6 months now, mainly for commuting on the bus but I've also used it to output to a TV and also on flights.  It's a pretty player, and fits my needs perfectly.  I mostly use it to watch videos, but also listen to podcasts.  The video playback is great, I have no complaints about the picture.  I can't speak to the FM tuner or picture gallery because I don't use those.  Pros: -Big hard drive, I haven't had any space issues, I got the 60 GB version -Plays a large number of formats flawlessly -Intuitive user interface, I never read the directions and haven't had any problems. -Output to TV works very well -Good battery life  Cons: -Kinda heavy, doesn't bother wme but my wife can't/won't hold it up for very long -Can't bookmark video, it keeps the place of the last video you watched, but can be annoying if you watch many videos not in succession.  You can bookmark audio though. -No remote -Software can't convert all formats, and doesn't provide helpful error messages  All in all, I'd definitely recomend it if you don't mind the heavier unit.  Fits well in my shirt pockets while walking to/from the bus stop.  Pick up an extra battery for long flights, I get around 5 hours of video playback if I turn the lock on while watching.   
<Overall>5
