<Product Name>Visual Land 1 GB MP3 WMA FM DVR Player VL-540A Silver
<Title>broke after 6 months
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The menus were always hard to navigate, but at least I could use it as a USB storage device.  Now, the player will not turn on at all.   I've contacted the company, so hopefully I'll get a response.    
<Overall>1
