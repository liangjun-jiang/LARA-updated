<Title>Now a part of the iPod craze!
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Trust me, I was the LAST person to buy an iPod. I was perfectly happy with my iRiver H140 (which I still love), and was sick to death of seeing those white headphones everywhere! But then I decided to get a tinier player for my walks to class and such. I tried out different smaller players and they all had some type of defect. An iPod Shuffle wasn't an option as the thing doesn't even have a screen. When these second-generation minis came out, I was blown away by the specs: supposedly 18 hours of battery life, price cut down fifty dollars, etc. So I went ahead and bought the blue version and yet to have any regrets. My review:  PROS:  // I did a battery test on this the afternoon I bought it. It wasn't even charged to full capacity, and on top of that, I played with it a lot, and it still ran continuously for about 23 hours. Amazing. One of the reasons I was hesitant about getting a first-generation mini was its battery life (about eight hours, I believe). Apple has definitely improved on this feature.  // iTunes, the software that you use to put music on your iPod, is great. You can make it automatically sync to your iPod or manually update. I choose the latter option as I have more music on my computer than will fit on a 4GB player. I thought having to use software would be annoying in comparison to hooking a player up like a regular hard drive and using the file tree method, but iTunes is simple and gets the job done. There are other programs you can use to manage your iPod, like MusicMatch, but iTunes seems to be the least clunky to me. Also, you DO NOT have to buy from the iTunes music store to work your iPod. You can even hide this option on the sidebar if you wish and make iTunes solely a music manager.  // So tiny! I have to admit that when I opened the box, I exclaimed, "It's SO cute!" It's basically the size of a credit card. A little slimmer, a little longer, but you get the idea. Even the package it comes in is very compact!  // Sound quality is absolutely superb. You'll listen to songs that you've heard on your computer or other MP3 player or whatever and hear nuances that you haven't heard before. Like I said, I have an iRiver, and while that has amazing quality too, you'll be surprised how crisp this little device sounds.  // Plenty of features. Notes, contacts, games (Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute), clock, alarm... I have yet to use any of these extras but I guess it's nice to know that they're there in case you do. I think more efficient features would be voice recording, FM tuner, etc.  // Scratch-resistant. All of my friends' iPods are scratched up like you wouldn't believe. The mini has a lot more resistance to scratches as it has an anodized aluminum case.  // Inuitive design. Everyone knows about the click wheel. I've handled lots of different players and Apple really wins in this area. The controls are underneath the wheel, so you don't have to worry about buttons bulging out on the exterior.  // Colors-- this is a pretty trivial point, but I was initially disappointed when these "new" colors came out. I thought the earlier model pastels were much prettier. However, now that I actually have one (photos don't do justice), I think my blue one has a gorgeous, rich hue, and I imagine this is the same for the green and pink. No complaints in the aesthetics department from my end.  CONS:  // No support for WMAs. iTunes will import these as their own format, which might result in a sound degradation. I had to rip a bunch of my CDs as MP3s just to retain original audio quality.  // Apple really skimped out on the accessories. I'm used to getting a bunch of add-ons with my player for free, like a case and adapter. The mini includes a clip-on holder, headphones, and your charging cord, but that's pretty much it. HOWEVER, to Apple's credit, you can charge your iPod without an adapter (right from USB, or Firewire). Plus, to get these 4GB models down cheaper than they were before, it makes sense that they cut out the superfluous items.  // This will be a minor issue for most people, but when you're in your menus (like listings under Songs or Albums or wherever), the titles don't scroll. So if you have a lot of songs that start with the same string of words, you're going to have try them all to see which one you're looking for. On the actual now-playing screen, they DO scroll, it's just that in the menus they don't. Like I said, this won't affect most people, but it did kind of annoy me when I first saw it as all other players I've worked with scroll titles in menus.  SOME THINGS TO KNOW:  // The iPod never actually shuts off. I know that when I first got this, I was like, "Where's the stop button?!" You can put it to sleep by holding the play/pause button down for a few seconds, but it will never actually be turned off. This is a smart move made by Apple because if you were to continually shut off and restart everytime you wanted to use it, not only would it take a long time to boot up, but it would wear down its interior.  // iPod doesn't give you a straightforward way to copy your music back onto your computer after putting it on, but there's a way to do so without using external programs if it's enabled to disk usage. 1) Click on the iPod icon in My Computer. 3) Click Tools > Folder Options > View > Show Hidden Files and Folders. 3) A folder called "iPod Control" should appear. Navigate into that folder and all your music should be in several different folders within. If you don't want to do it this way, there are also third-party programs like CopyPod.  // For iPod support, Google "iPodLounge." Their forums are really helpful, too.  // Ordering from Amazon is probably your best bet. I ordered this on March 17 and received it the very next day on March 18. That was with Super Saver Shipping deal where it's actually supposed to take up to two weeks to get to you! This could just be in my lucky case, but even so, you can also always return your iPod if something is wrong with it with zero hassle and for free. Like with those other players that gave me issues? Amazon sent a UPS guy to my house to pick it up, returned it, and I got ALL of my money back. Just my two cents on that.  ---  Overall, a great player. Besides a few flaws, Apple has found a new iPod-lover in me which I thought NEVER would happen! Sorry for the length of this review but I hope it helped potential buyers. Happy iPodding. :)

<Title>Incredibly Fast Shipping!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cheers to Amazon! I bought this IPod as a gift for my fiancs burf-day, so I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, but I had to write a quick note singing their praises. Amazon's logistics and delivery network is unbelievable.  I opted for the free shipping offer (Super Saver Discount), which Amazon claims will ship in two to three days.  I placed the order around 2:00 PM CST, yesterday (3/21/05), only to have it show-up on my desk at work at 10:30 AM CST, today (3/22/05). That's a total of 20.5 hours for Super Saver Delivery.  I will say that my home in St. Louis, MO isn't extremely far from Amazon's distribution center in Lexington, KY, where this package was shipped from - about 350 miles.  But still, I've ordered pizza's that have taken longer to get here.  Way to go Amazon!

<Content>I love the ipod mini it holds so much music and is so small. Also the 18 hour battery life is great. This is perfect for holding my hip hop music collection. If you dont have alot of music I would also recomend the ipod shuffle. But my ipod mini has been great so far. Go Ipods!

<Title>If It's Too Loud, You're Too Old...
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned a number of other MP3 players and have made a concerted effort to avoid "iPod madness."  But with the recent price drop and upgrade of the battery life, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought mine through the Apple store and got free engraving as well as free shipping.  All-in-all, I LOVE my new 4gb iPod mini.  I also like that I can import my MusicMatch Jukebox playlists into iTunes rather easily.  There are really, in my opinion, only a few negatives:  ~ Dock is no longer included.  However, the included USB cable works fine IF you have a powered USB port on your PC. ~ The included ear-buds are AWFUL!  Fortunately I had several pairs of good headphones floating around, so that was not a big issue for me.  I would recommend picking up the USB power adapter and the Insten iPod Sync & Charging cradle.  I would also recommend checking out the iLounge web site for lots of good information on the care and feeding of your iPod.  Oh!  One other negative is that these things ARE addictive. And I'm kinda thinkin' now that should have gone for the 20gb version.

<Title>"the next big" bogus offer
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!  The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for "iPod not really free David Lazarus" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.  In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information.

<Title>Very disappointing battery life
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I received my Ipod Mini last week (good job Amazon for the free shipping....which arrived very promptly) and I had a lot of trouble with iTunes. I had a 256 mb mp3 player before I bought my iPod and transferring music to that one was so much easier. With iTunes, you have to make sure every song you want on your iPod is in the library. Thus if you add songs from a different computer, the songs that are not in this new library will be deleted! I guess this protects illegal music sharing, but for something this expensive this is a very inconvenient feature. Basically I think iTunes is an inferior program for transferring music; on my old mp3 player you could just drag and drop music files into the player.  Most importantly, the battery life of my iPod is absolutely disappointing. I've had to charge it every 2 days since the day I received it, and it's not like I keep it on all the time. I just use it when I walk to class, and in a span of 2 days it is actually on for about no more than 6 hours. I don't even have the backlight setting on at all. I am extremely upset with this because the 18 hour battery life is what initially hooked me into buying this second generation version.  Apple is lucky the iPod has such a good interface. The scroll wheel I must admit is a very intelligent tool and the ability to make playlists is something flash drive based mp3 players can't do. For 190 dollars I got a second generation iPod that has EXTREMELY poor battery life and that's why I am so upset with this. If anyone else has had problems with their battery, please share. It's better to know I'm not the only one who got gypped!

<Title>What is Wrong With iTunes?
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my iPod and iTunes, and simply can not see why people dislike iTunes.  A previous reviewer said that they couldn't transfer songs from another computer.  BULL.  Just right click on the iPod, and change it to manual synchronization.  Even if you don't like iTunes, there are many other applications, such as iPod Agent, that can transfer music (and more) to your iPod that are available online for free.  Especially with the new price, IPODS ROCK!

<Title>Wonderful.
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a tremendous amount of music - too much for an iPod of any current size - and so I knew that I would be moving music on and off of the device no matter what.  I chose the smallest iPod Mini because of its good price and physical dimensions (it's a lot smaller than most people think), and have been very, very happy with my purchase.  I am something of an audiophile, and yet have been very pleased with the Mini's impressive sound quality, its ease of use, the incredible battery life (18 hours is not much of an exageration) and the flexibility that the Mini provides me.  To be only slightly critical (and not to discourage anyone from enjoying an awesome device), I am not especially fond of Apple's ear-buds (and a bit uncomfortable, too), but they were easily replaced for even better sound.  Also, I do wish that I could turn off the "auto-pause" feature (the unit pauses automatically when the earphones are removed, but is so sensitive as to occasionally pause when the plug is inadvertently rotated).  These are minor criticisms, and I hope that everyone gets an iPod!

<Title>Great, but bruises as easily as an apple....  Poor for audio books (no bookmarks)
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first Ipod and I love it.  The functionality is excellent and I've found that it lives up to nearly all of the positive notes that others here and elsewhere have written.  However, I have two complaints: One that would not have changed my purchase decision, and another that would have made me buy an accessory earlier.  First, the battery life is nowhere near 18 hours.  I do not use the backlight, nor do I play it very loud.  Perhaps the best I have done with battery life is 7-10 hours.  I was so surprised at first that I thought I had accidentally purchased the fist generation Mini.  I confirmed that I had the second one. But again, I would still purchase this, regardless.  Second, get a case or some other protective cover!  I dropped mine twice outside.  Both times were from only a foot or two but were on pavement or asphalt.  The Ipod worked flawlessly without any problems at all. But, drops that may have only slightly scratched a plastic case resulted in several small but very noticeable dings and even an actual dent on the corner.  The metal used for these cases must be pretty soft or pretty cheap! If you want to keep your Mini looking clean and new over time, and you occasionally have two left hands, you will definitely want to get some type of case or cover for it.  8/31/05:   After using the iPod for months, I realized that it missed a great feature I had on my old Rio 500: the ability to bookmark!  I listen to audio books a little more than I listen to music.  Though I understand there is an ability to bookmark Audible books and that there are various hacks and tricks out there, there is NO way to easily bookmark an audio book that you may have imported from CD or elsewhere.  I cannot change my original rating, but: For music, I would keep it at 4 stars.  For Audio books, the iPod deserves 1 star!  If you listen primarily to audio books, look elsewhere for a player that allows you to easily bookmark your spot.  12/22/05:  Battery life stinks!  I use this mostly for audio books and podcasts, and the best I can get is 2-3 hours before the battery dies.  Apple support is the worst!  I sent it back to them for repair: they received it on a Thursday or Friday, and sent it back on a Monday, stating that it was up to their standards.  If I was not now "captive" by having converted many CDs to Apple format, I would dump the Ipod altogether.

<Content>Besides the owners manual, and the few problems you might encouter, the mini is great. Despite what other reviewers have said, I have had my mini for about two years, and the battery still seams perfect(I've never done a full battery life check) As for finding out how to upload, download, and use the mini at first,it's a little more tuff. I STILL LOVE THE MINI.

<Content>I paid $250 for this i pod. After about 6 months the battery went dead slowly and even stopped charging altogether. I could only use it if it were hooked up to a charger. I replaced the battery myself(it CAN be done, people) and it worked fine for about a month before it started freezing up. Now my computer doesn't recognize it anymore and the clickwheel doesn't work. I never once dropped it or got water in it. I ended up giving it to my friend who collects broken i pods for parts and believe me, he's got A LOT of them. These items aren't worth nearly what they cost. They break often they're expensive to fix. Why Apple gets away the obvious contempt they have for their customers by selling them over-priced faulty equipment is beyond me.

<Title>The second-generation Ipod Mini is a hit!
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went into the Apple store this weekend, planning to buy myself an Ipod shuffle to keep myself under the $200 mark while buying an Ipod, and what did I see but the newly released 2nd generation Ipod Mini, selling just within my price range!  This mini is totally worth the added cost compared to the shuffle. While I envy the shuffle's extremely light weight and even lower price, I'm glad to have the extra storage space on my Ipod as well as a much-needed screen.  My ipod mini is pretty light, even if not weightless, and it has an amazing 18-hour battery life.  On the missing regular Charger: I haven't had any problems using the USB cable and connecting my Ipod right to my computer.  Plus, so many people have ipods these days that I imagine I could always borrow someone else's charger if I needed it.  And buying a new charger is always an option.

<Content>I just got an ipod mini tonight. Within 20 minutes of having it at home i already had about 2 gigs of music on it. Within an hour i was listening to my music. Plus the price point now beats out the zen micro, the mini's only real competitor. I have played with my friends zen micro and i have to admit I was going to get one before the price drop.But it takes time to get used to the touch pad and the fm reception is bad. Overall this is a great  product adn even better due to its price. my advice is to go out and get one ASAP. UPDATE: this thing is very sturdy i have left it in the snow for 5 inutes and it still works. I have left the headphones dragging on the road at speeds upwards of 40MPH and they still work great

<Content>everyone knows the iPod mini is a great player, but I was really amazed at the new battery life. I don't even have to care anymore, it lasts so long. I HIGHLY recommend the mini. Are you going to be one of the poor souls that end up with a zen micro that gets 10 hours battery life on a good day? --  Personally I think the zen looks like it came out of a cracker jack box and it seems to my ear that they use a bass preset as "normal" to trick the consumer-- just try amping one of those creepy zlooking zens! Whatever folks, thats up to you. However, you WILL NOT be dissapointed with this SUPER mini from apple whereas you may be very depressed if you buy one of the lesser players like the zen or dj

<Title>Revised: Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good  1.The new Ipod mini has made one major improvement over its predecessor i.e. a battery life of 18 hrs or more. My 4GB lasted for 22 hrs on the first go.  2.The looks are the best coz of the sleek anodized case.  3.Easy to use,Click wheel Navigation features are unbeatable. 4.Easy to use iTunes software and music downloads. 5.For students you can get this on the apple store for $179 and the 6gb for $229.  6.Good Customer Service 7.Anti-Shock memory good for those of us who drop things  :D  The Bad  1. The sound quality is not the best, PC World compared it to headphones quality while comparing the iRiver and Creative products to listening room quality. However for normal listeners this shouldn't matter. 2. It cannot play WMA tracks so it can store only half the number of songs that a wma player can for the same capacity. 3.Doesn't come with the wall charger now that the price is reduced  The Ugly  1. The ipods have to be returned to Apple to replace the battery which normally will run out in 6-12 months depending on use, that costs $99 besides shipping not to mention the waiting...it would have made more sense to produce them with replacable LiOn batteries.   My suggestion I would suggest getting creative's zen micro.They hav a 5GB version for $229 on Amazon .They are releasing 2 new models a 4gb for $199. A 6 gb for $249.They are equipped with replaceable 10-12 hr batteries which you can get for $40. Carry around an extra battery an you get 20-24 hr listening time.  The zen micros also have better sound quality as compared to the pods.  But if want great looks and not bothered by less than perfect sound quality stick to the ipod mini.

Music Quiz is the only one you CAN'T play while listening.  This is a must buy!

<Title>Simply THE best mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iPod mini was the hottest gadget last year & the best mp3 player around. Looks like this will be true even in 2005. There is absolutely no competition for the iPod's, no other player is even half as good as iPod.  Pro's, 1. Very good audio quality. Support for normal mp3's (unlike Sony). 2. Small size (smaller than most cell phones like much-talked-about-Motorola-Razr) 3. Extremely well desgined (let's hope Apple makes a cell phone and PDA in near future) 4. Very intuitive interface (award winning touch wheel and minimal buttons) 5. 4GB hard drive (enough space for about 800 mp3 songs) 6. Available in many colors (hopefully Apple will come up with Nokia style faceplates for future Mini's) 7. iTunes is one of the best music software around (rate songs, keep playcount, easy-sync with the iPod) 8. Excellent screen for such small size 9. Recharges from a standard USB port with the same cable as used for the upload of songs. No need to carry around a charger now. 10. Tons of innovative accessories in the market (from Bose speakers to colorful socks!) 11. Good battery life, about 10-14 hrs depneding on how much you surf around on it. ofcourse we all want more and there is no end to that demand :) 12. Everything about the iPod Mini is designed to perfection (no other company has put this much time & effort into their mp3 players even in 4 yrs since iPod hit the streets)  Con's, 1. The battery is internal with no easy replacement chances 2. Colors on the new Mini, except Silver, IMHO, are all gaudy. Last generation of Mini's had much pleasing colors. Check out for yourself at a local store before buying. 3. Gold version has been dropped now, its become a collector's item? Instead of adding more colors they have dropped one! 4. Doesn't come with a wall charger any more and takes longer to charge from USB port. You always need to be around a computer or pay extra for the charger.  Its simply fabulous and I am running out of superlatives to describe it. Thanks Apple for the new iPod Mini!

<Content>last time I checked you could get an ipod for $180. i last checked about 2 weeks ago and i thought it was a rip off then. this is outrageous, apple makes their ipods for $30 and amazon is selling them for $200. they're earning more money than they need, yet people still keep buying them. Sure it's great with all the songs, games and features but, it's not worth the money your paying for it. IT'S A RIP OFF.

<Title>Such a rip off
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't like iPod's. I think that they're a total rip off. You buy an iPod for like $200.00, then you have to buy your charger, then you have to buy your headphones. Plus you have to pay for the songs you download on it. Thats what blew me away. I think that since you payed about $300.00 for your iPod, they should atleast give you the songs for free. I would advise everyone to stay away from them if they want to save money...

<Title>I don't know how I ever got along without it...
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVE MY SILVER IPOD MINI!  After about a year of research and procrastination, I was having a particularly bad week, so after seeing a teenage at the drug store with her Pink mini, I decided that if she can have one and she doesn't have a job, I can surely have one and buy it with my hard-earned money!    I marched myself into the Apple Store and treated myself to my mini.  Awesome decision!  I was wavering between the 4GB and the 20GB since there was only about a $50 difference.  It didn't even make sense to me to consider the 6GB because that was $50 more as well, and if I was going to pay the $50, then I was going to get the 20GB.  I decided on the 4GB for now. My computer hard drive is only 6GB at the moment, so there's really no need for an iPod whose storage is bigger than what my system can hold! :)    MY LIKES:  1.  The Size- It's absolutely perfect!  It stays in my purse so I will always have music on the go.  My co-worker gave me a baby blue skin to put on it so it will be protected in my purse.  2.  The Color-  I was aiming for the blue one until I saw it in person.  The color was a little too blue for my taste (even though blue is one of my favorite colors!  ZZZZ-PHI!) I'm not a fan of Pink nor Green, so Silver was it.  It's sophisticated looking.  3.  The Battery Life- This was the sticking point for me.  Up until I bought my mini, I was listening to music on my 1GB SD card plugged into my Palm Pilot.  It was a good solution for a while.  I was, and still am, thankful for the capabilities of my Palm, and if it weren't for the fact that my Palm's battery life is horrible, I may have stayed with that and never bought my mini.  So far, I have gotten a good 12 hours on 1 charge.  That's awesome.  The advertised time is about 18 hours.  Look, if it lasts me a whole work day without dying, then I am happy.  So far, it has totally surpassed that.    4.  The Screen-  It is clear and bright.  I love it!  5.  The Click Wheel-  It took some getting used to, but now, I love it.  It makes it easier to navigate around the menus.  6.  USB Cable-  Quick music transfer!    7.  iTunes-  I used to use MusicMatch faithfully.  I will probably still use it since I have lifetime upgrades.  I also like the burning capabilites of the program.  I use Windows Media Player as well.  I let RealPlayer go.  Too much spyware.  iTunes is a very robust program that does just about everything you need.  It organizes your music very well, and it is an easy program to learn.  8.  Sound Quality- The sound quality is awesome.  I can't ask for anything better.  Very crisp and clear.  Plus, once you play around with the EQ, you'll find what suits you.  9. Educational Discount-  If you are a student, you can get an Educational Discount on all Apple products if you purchase directly from Apple.    MY DISLIKES:  There aren't many, but there are a few...  1.  No AC Adapter-  I had to buy it separately!  Apparently, it was included in the previous generations.  I own a laptop, so I don't keep it on all of the time.  Therefore, that would have been counter-productive trying to charge my mini from the USB port.  The Adapter is $30 by itself, but for people like me, it's a necessary cost so I can plug it up to the wall and it can travel with me.    2.  No Stop Button -   There isn't a dedicated "Stop" button in iTunes or on my mini.  All I see is a "Pause" button.  If there is a stop button, someone please show it to me!  3.  On/Off Management - I don't like the fact that whenever I plug up my mini to charge, even if it's already turned off, the unit turns on.  I have to physically turn it off.  Not a biggie, but it's just something I've noticed.  4.  The Earbuds-  They sound just ok to me.  I'm not a fan of them.  My inner ear is shaped funny so I'm probably not getting the full effect of them since I can't really put them in as far as they are intended to go.  I may have to get some of those ear canal ones.  I have figured out to have these stay in my ears all day without them hurting.  I don't wear them with the foam though.  The foam irritates me to no end.    Ok...that's my review.  I hope it helps you all!

<Title>More Hype than Substance
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok the price is good, for a 4GB Music Player. The interface on the iPod itself is great! The clickwheel is a brilliant innovation, I love how you just have to move your finger round the wheel and have things like volume, location in song and scrolling through the menus change seamlessly Sound? Well I have hooked the iPOd up to a pair decent pair of PC Speakers (complete with subwoofer) and the output was great. As for earbuds, that's good too, plus let's not forget that the sound quality also depends on the MP3s you've got...Also there was absolutely no skipping occuring.  Ok so that's the good. Unfortunately, there's a lot that's bad - BATTERY LIFE - it's ridiculously low. I get about 2/3 hours mileage out of it at most. This is without playing with the clickwheel too much. I don't know if mine is a defective piece, but I don't think so.  iTUNES IS AWFUL. This is the least user-friendly piece of software I have ever come across. Instead of allowing you simply add songs to your iPod based on filename, you have to conform to the ID3 tag format. Although this may not seem too much of an issue for some, it was a real problem for me, as none of my songs are catalogued according to ID3 and I have over 700 songs! Winamp is smart enough to pickup whatever info it can get, and iTunes should be too.  Further, and most importantly, on Windows 2000 Professional, if you try and install iTunes when Quicktime is already installed, the setup hangs, and you get nothing. So you have go back and uninstall quicktime, before installing iTunes.  It is not very easy to create playlists. You can't just select 5 songs and say create playlist out of these 5 songs. You have to first create a playlist, and then drag the songs into the list....  Finally, the iPod's casing is looks a lot stronger than it is. It has a niced brushed metal look, but is very weak. I've gently dropped my iPod once, and was upset to observe a dent on the top left corner :-( I guess one needs to invest in a case for the ipod.  Keeping these things in mind, I would say that the iPod is a good buy, but more for fans than for practical people...

<Title>Apple iPod Mini is the Apple of my Eye
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple iPod: definitely the best MP3 player out there. $200 is not a lot of money for hours and hours of entertainment. Last year, I considered buying a cheap MP3 player. You know, even below $100 if possible. In the end, I couldn't find one nice enough for my price range. This year, my best friend purchased a green mini. I fell in love with it! Every time I went over to her house, I sat down and asked her about the features. I listened to all of her songs, and I was blown away by the sound quality. Even the style of the mini is adorable! I asked her how much it was, and she said $250. Yikes! A bit steep for me! But i wanted that mini, so I started saving up. A good 6 months later, I hadn't spent one penny of my now saved $300. Then one day my best friend called me to tell me that minis were now only $200! I was so excited. With my extra cash, I bought a wristband, speakers, and a case from www.apple.com. What a buy! I love my pink mini so much! Here are my favorite features:  -Style: It's adorable! Fun pink, blue, and green, plus a more conservative silver.  -Size: It's remarkable. About the size of a credit card, and less than 1/2 inch thick!   -Click Wheel: Hated this feature at first. Just could NOT get used to it! But now I find it great.  -Battery Life: Not too shabby for an iPod. I'm impressed.  -Screen: One of the only reasons I bought a mini as opossed to a shuffle. Clear words are a definite plus.   Things I would change:  -iTunes: Hate it hate it hate it. Everything about it annoys me! I mean, even something as stupid as the visualations on my computer. They stop after one song! What a pain! Worst software ever.  -Games: So hard to play. I mean, not really a big issue because nobody ever plays them anyway, but especially Solitaire disapointed me.    All in all, the Apple iPod Mini is a great buy at great value. If you're looking for a high quality Mp3 player, this is for you!

<Content>Apple iPod is a great advancement to technology that will have everyone smiling. The sound is inevitable and is extremely satisfying.  However, I marked it down by two stars because : 1. It does not come with any free songs; once you get it you do have your iPod, but you need to fill it with songs that'll COST you more money.  2. A little too expensive on the account that it has no songs in it

<Title>Great product, but want a couple of software improvements.
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm very pleased with my 4gig Ipod Mini so far, but wanted to add a few comments to what others have written.  The sound quality is quite nice, even with the standard ear buds. The capacity is right for the price, and battery life is good for how I use it (a couple of hours here and there). I have two concerns, but they are not significant enough to reduce the rating from 5 stars for me:  - I-tunes, the computer software you use to load/unload songs, is not completely intuitive. Although the software works well and downloading/purchasing new music is easy, getting songs onto your ipod can be difficult if you already have an extensive music collection. I solved this by creating a couple of specific playlists in I-tunes, and having the I-pod only synchronize with those playlists.  - Although the I-pod mini can play songs in set order, random, or direct selection, I've not found a way for it to shuffle songs from only one playlist. I like to hear relaxing songs by the pool, and energetic songs when I'm at the gym. Being able to shuffle only my "poolside" playlist or my "energy" playlist would be great. Perhaps it can be done and I just need to research more.  - Some of the help documentation isn't very deep. This is typical of Apple. Because their hardware and software have so few problems, most users never need extensive documentation. But if you want to go back and change some unusual settings (like the I-pod's name, or the shuffle method I mentioned above), how to do it is either not explained or difficult to find in the manual.  Those caveats aside, I'm loving my I-pod mini and definitely recommend it. All of my concerns are non-critical, and they could be addressed with a software update.

<Date>Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So what am I supposed to do when I travel and the battery needs charging and no computer is handy?  That's it!  Shell out another $30 for an AC adapter!  And why would one want to boot up the computer at home just to charge the battery anyway?  On another matter, after iTunes software installation on my XP system, iTunes would not recognize the iPod.  Eventually I had to uninstall the software and repeat the process to make it recognize the unit.

<Title>Don't bother with this product...
<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got one and when I opened the box it (the iPod) didn't work.  I called the Customer Service and they said quote: "Too bad."  I was PISSED off! I called later and someone else said to return it for a new one so I did.  Pros: *Navigation is good *Nice design *Lots of options to do *iTunes is easy *Get good comments  Cons: *The sound quality is horrible.  It's like listening to a cassete player. (Little exaggeration) *Customer Service is bad *Costs more than Zen Micro *You have to pay $.99 for one song from iTunes *Terrible Manual  I was using this and suddenly it broke (as in stopped working) AGAIN.  I called Customer Service and they said they'll send a replacement.  I said I didn't want one because I'm getting the Zen Micro instead. I got my Micro at Best Buy for $199 with 5 GB of memory WITH a power adapter, belt clip and stand, and those other accossories that it says it has.  Conclusion: I recommend getting the Creative Zen Micro instead because it costs less and you don't have to pay $.99 for EACH song. For the Zen Micro you just have to pay about $12.99/month for "Napster To Go" with UNLIMITED songs. Do the math: iPod Mini: 1000 songs= $1000 Zen Micro 5 GB: 1250 or 2500 songs (depends)= $12.99/month. Less than $.02/song if you download ONLY 1250 songs.  If you download double it'll be like it costs $.01 per song. And so on.

<Title>Little but Big Problems
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I always admired people with these mini iPods and I was surfing amazon one day and I saw it for the low price of $149.99 with free shipping. So I decided I deserved a big present for myself, I bought it. It took about 2 weeks for the shipping and I took it to Washington D.C., the battery life isn't great for a trip but it's good. It takes several hours to charge, which is a downfall but it should charge overnight. Although, I had the same problem with it 3 times. It kept giving the exclamation point folder icon, which meant a low battery, no memory, or reset. Well I know it had memory because I had songs on it and I know I charged the battery. I called apple for help but got no help what so ever, I was very fed up. Apple charges you $49.99 for each Tech Support Phone call you make after the first one, just so you know. If you are up for a headache then sure it's a great buy. I know people who never had problems, but then again I know at least 2 other people that have had this trouble with it too. Needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.

<Title>The iPod's great, the software is terrible
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the iPod mini as a christmas gift.  It's the only mp3 player that I have ever owned.  But the Itunes software is terribly annoying.  My first beef with it is the size of the program; it is SLOW.  It takes 2 to 3 times to bring up as windows media player.  It rips a CD at nowhere near the speed of wmp.  Also, it destroys any type of organization scheme that you develop on your own.  If you rip a CD using Itunes, it will put the files in my documents\my music\itunes\itunes music\artist name\album name.  If you have multiple iPod's sharing the same computer, forget trying to keep things straight.  Also, apple has added the "convenience" of only being able to upload to your iPod using the Itunes software.  A drag and drop using windows explorer would be much appreciated.  Bottom line: If you've never touched a computer before, apple makes it 100% idiot proof, otherwise the software will frustrate you to no end.

<Content>I bought this iPod about a year ago, a total newbie to mp3 players. I wasn't sure what to get, or what I'd even need. This one turned out to be just right.   Right now, I have over 700 songs downloaded, and STILL have room for lots more. (Basically, this means I have my entire music library - including just about every song I ever heard and liked even a little bit - plus comedy clips. It's super-easy to import, delete and organize your music, and all the features are equally simple.   If you just want to listen to music - not watch epic-length movies, or concert series - this iPod will suit you just fine. True, you can get the shuffle...but for fifty bucks more, you might as well spring for the 4GB, which will hold all the music you could ever want.

This little pink beauty does everything I need it to.  I've downloaded every album I could possibly think to download and I haven't put a dent in the 4gigs.  It's been through some hard use at the gym but the classic apple case barely has a scratch.  The battery is excellent.  I've had it play for hours even after it warned of low battery life.

<Content>I just have to say, I really enjoy my ipod mini. I like the lightness of it, the color, and the pretty good durability. I've dropped my ipod twice without it having any sort of case on it and from a standing point. It has yet to show any signs of wear & tear! The one thing that I dislike is the users manual. It took me at least 2 hours to figure how to download songs. You're better off going to a friend who has an ipod and asking them how to configure your ipod with the computer. Although this is a sort of major setback, once you figure out all the kinks, you are well on your way to having a great time with your ipod.

<Title>The Best iPod Out There
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a blue iPod mini from Apple's Refurbished section in March 2006. When I got it, I read the manual first. It was confusing. It wasn't really helpful. There was nothing on how to import songs. It wasn't a setback because I also had a silver one, but I just wanted to point that out. Once I hooked it up to my Mac, it worked perfectly. The nice blue color, lightweight, and easy to use clickwheel. It was wonderful! But just a few days ago, (Jan. 3, 2007) the mini started acting up. The hold switch wouldn't lock the iPod, and the clickwheel wouldn't respond to touch. Finally, the hold switch started working again, but the clickwheel was another story. I brought it into Apple, and they said it was caused by abuse! I never dropped it, scratched it, or got liquid on it. Finally, they repalced the Clickwheel cable, for no charge. Although there was a problem, and even though people now think they are out of date and they would'nt get one because of no color screen, you can keep the new iPods. The minis are all i need.

<Title>All Well and Good Except for the Battery Life
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second - and last - iPod. At this point in the history of the iPod, anything I say will be superfluous, but I'll reiterate the one reason why I'd never get another iPod. The battery lasts about a year if you're lucky, and 6 months if you're not. At that point, Apple expects you to put out another $60 for another battery. Not only is that expensive, but it's also a pain in the neck. Even if you're close to an Apple store - and I am - you wait in line, you come back four hours or more later, and pick up the iPod, and pay tax on the battery to boot. Then you reload and hope that this one will last another year. Truth is that I picked up an iRiver 1 gig MP3 player which may not be stylish, but I get almost as many songs and the one AA battery lasts about 35 hours! Then I dispose of it and just replace it. And I'll repeat this: for anyone who flies, how are you going to charge your batteries on an iPod in flight (or worse, stuck in a snow storm in Denver while sitting on the tarmac?  P.S. The earbuds are still lousy, but I immediately replace them with Sonys.   It's now last June, and the iPod sits in a drawer and will probably remain there. IF you must have an iPod, get the "insurance" with it which runs about $15. Though you'll still have the pain of taking it in or sending it in for a new battery, and least it'll be $15 plus postage rather than $60.    In the meantime, my iRiver continues to serve me well, and I found that a 2500 mAmh rechargeable battery will last about 40 hours. We have two of them now, each with different music and I just trade off with my wife depending on what I feel like listening to. Besides, the FM works beautifully. Before iPod knocks them out of business, I might just get another one to be sure.

<Title>I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy just thinking about my iPod!
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Oh my gosh! I love my iPod so much and I think I would've died without it. You might be thinking, "1,000 songs? I could just name 5,000 songs from the top of my head!" but you're wrong. I was thinking the same thing until I took a risk and bought from the wonderful Amazon.com. Here's the story...  One day, my friend came to school and said, "Look, I got an iPod for my birthday!" I was like what is that? And she explained to me. I totally fell in love with the idea of getting one and I asked my mom for one for a birthday present. But of course, she said no. So I saved up. After a while, I had about $400 saved up for just an iPod mini 4G. But I needed it. I got the iPod (of course) for $174.95, the iSee mini case for $11.55, the portable charger for $29.99, and the speakers for $39.99! I just got it 3 weeks ago, and I already have 122 songs!  Things I love:  1,000 songs, now that's a whopper compaired to an mp3 player! its adorable appearance clear, beutiful sound  Things I detest:  iTunes (it takes 4 min. for one song to download) charging, HOURS AND HOURS! battery life...8 hours, come on! horrible for a plane ride  but still...all these things can't keep me from giving it 5 stars!

<Title>A solid product which deserves to sell a bazillion units
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I visited the ipod mini page from a link on my purchase history. I didn't expect to need to add my positive review until I read some of the negative comments being posted here.  I own a second generation ipod which I bought as soon as it became available to Windows users. Put it this way, when I bought it, the cashier at Best Buy was like, "What's an ipod?" Ok - maybe that says more about Best Buy hiring practices than anything else.  I bought a garish pink ipod mini this round for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Took about an hour to fill it with a 1,000 of her favorite songs. USB 2.0 feels a lot faster than my firewire ipod transfer.  I had a few issues with loading the ipod mini software but as an old hand at this stuff I didn't worry about it. I fear a few newbies might freak when their computer fails to recognize the ipod without rebooting their machine and plugging the ipod back in. Subsequently, I've had no recognition problems.  The navigation process on the ipod mini is still excellent. The physical build is solid and attractive. I highly recommend the ipod mini but please get a case to protect it. I sat across a guy on my ferry to San Francisco the other day and was horrified to see his 4th gen ipod scratched to bits. I shook my head in disgust. Lol.  Enjoy your music!

<Title>Where is my charger to go with this ipod???
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is nothing to be said about ipod minis and how fantastic they are. But where is the charger to go along with the ipod from this particular vendor!!! It's like selling someone a car without a steering wheel. This is the 3rd ipod I bought from Amazon and the first two came with a charger as you would expect! But this one, which I bought a s a mother's day gift came without one and makes it completely ungiftable. Yes yes the description does not include one, but come-on, it is only common sense that a charger should be included, when you pay the same price as one that would have it!!!

<Title>Impossible To Set Up 
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently received a 4GB Mini Ipod as a birthday present, and was quite excited until I found out it was almost impossible to program and came with almost no instructions.  After more than 10 hours of trying and searching the Apple website for solutions, I am giving up and returning this item back to where it was purchased and buying an iriver.  The itunes software kept telling me that there was an error and that I needed to reformat to factory settings - of course, it does not explain anywhere how exactly do do this in the limited instruction manual that comes with the unit.  Even when I finally managed reformat the unit and download songs into the unit, the songs would not play - again, no instructions as to how to deal with this problem.  So I try to download the songs again and get the same error message that the unit needs to be reformatted to factory settings and is not able to copy any of my songs!  Before completely giving up I went to two different friends that have MP3 players (one with a 20GB ipod and the other with a 20GB iriver).  Both spent over an hour trying to figure out the impossible before giving up and recommending that I return the unit for something easier to use.

<Title>Great design and appearance, but not built to last!
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is from the perspective of someone that has used my iPod mini every day for just over a year.  Let me start by saying, I loved my iPod. I have the Belkin iTrip for my car, and I listen to it most of the day while working at my desk.   I say "loved" because after about 10 months I noticed my battery life became shorter and shorter. I've read about battery fatigue, but this didn't concern me too much. I was a heavy user, and most of my listening happened in places where I could keep it in a charger. No worries.  However, after about a year my iPod sound quality became very staticky. It became apparent that when I jiggled the phone jack that something in the physical headphone connection was causing the signal to get distorted. Still, this was not a huge deal for me. If I was just careful in the car or at work I could still listen.  I've now had it for about 14 months (I bought my mini from Apple the first month they came out), and it is just not useable. Which sucks, considering there is only a 1 year warranty. Nice timing.  Obviously, my 2-star rating could be seen as unfair because I really don't have many complaints about the product and the way it functions.   However, given the problems I've had with it, and realizing that it didn't last for more than 2 months after the 1-year warranty, I wouldn't feel right giving it a higher rating.  Just be careful with this product. It looks sexy, and it is a great mp3 player. But, if you plan to actually use it every day, you should plan on buying one every year.

<Title>Some people dramatize bad points...
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unlike what some people will have you believe, the iPod does in fact work. It took me about four minutes to import all of my music from iTunes- perhaps it's easier to do if you're on a Mac computer. The interface is easy to get a hang of, and from then on it's pretty easy to use to. Songs can be organized easily from iTunes, into whatever scheme fits you best.   The earbuds are, however, very uncomfortable, albeit they have good sound- some people complained about lack of bass, though I've found, at least with my classical music, that there is plenty, if not to much, bass.   Overall, very worth the price, though you might spring $50 more for 2 more Gigs.

<Title>Ok product
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friend have a new ipod mini and I helped her transfer and setup and all that. I was impressed at its size and beautiful color. I was hoping that it didn't cost about 200 USD, I wish it was a bit cheaper.  The Bad: When I tried to install Itunes, it does not work. Why? I have Windows ME. It ONLY works for Windows 2000 or GREATER. I had to transfer the songs to a cd and do it on my brother's computer. A big pain in the butt since my computer is bought in 2001 with one cd drive.  Transferring the songs from a music cd to Itunes took awhile, maybe 5-10 min if you transfer about 18 songs. I don't know, but it may vary from computer to computer. I don't like the fact that you have to use itunes to transfer your songs to the Ipod. You can't use the Windows Explorer to do it.   The Good: Using Itunes was easy. it can take a few seconds to know what the buttons do, but its pretty much easy for those people who hasn't used Itunes before. The mini also comes with a belt clip, which looks nice. I'm not sure if it's secure since I my friend does not put it on her belt (she has a little pouch to put her ipod.) The backlight is AWSOME, so bright and it's whiteish. The Ipod mini's controls are very easy to use. The click wheel is awsome. The earbuds are good, the sound is good too.  The Good//Bad: The Mini only need an USB cable connected to the computer to charge its battery. But if you're going on a long trip without a computer, then you would have to buy an iPod USB Power Adapter for around 30 bucks. I would rather use an outlet to charge it than an USB cable.

<Title>The NEW iPod mini
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is defintly the best iPod that has came out so far. I do like the regular iPod's but they are to big for me to carry around. The iPod mini is easy to use holds 1000 song (4 gb $199) or 1500 (6 gb $249). But if you want to get your iPod cheaper go to the apple website and go to the bottom and you can get education discounts if you are a student ($20 off). Besides the iPod being easy to use it is very small. The click wheel is very nice, I considered the Zen Micro because the FM tuner but the quality for the radio is bad. Plus the Zen Micros keys aren't as easy to use becuse if you accidntly tap a button it is touch sensitive and it screws everything up. The games are an great feature but the iPod mini is made for music. iTunes is also very easy to use. Also, the apple support is very helpful and your warrenty is 1 year. I had a Creative flash player and the customer service for Creative isn't very helpful like appl. So anyways the iPod mini is a must have.

<Title>used computer at work to copy cd to Ipod & lost my Music
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

<Title>I love my mini
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod mini about a year ago and it has been working amazingly for me ever since. One of the reasons I love it is that I'm a huge clutz and I drop my stuff all the time. I don't keep it in a case ever, and I have dropped it from five feet and it has not even scarched. Of course, I don't drop it on purpose, it just happens. I particularly don't need a color screen. My black and white screen displays the song I am listening to fine and if you want, you can turn on the backlight. Many of my friends have iPod Nanos, but I don't actually see how they're SO much better than the minis. You can see the little album picture next to the song title, so what? If I really wanted a cool new iPod, I would most definitely get an iPod video. All of my friends who have nanos always keep their iPods in cases so they don't break, but I don't need to. With a nano I would be too afraid that I would crush it... It sits in my pocket comfortably, I don't have to worry about it while I'm moving around. Unlike many people, I download plenty of music from the music store and I love it. I don't like leaving my house, going to the store, and buying a CD for one sone that I actually like. The only problem with this iPod is that the backlight goes off if you don't do anything to the iPod, but it's fine. iPod minis are, in my opinion, better than nanos.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my ipod mini for approximately a year and a half. My menu button and volume control have stopped working.  I just went to the Apple Store in Oak Brook, IL and apparently the ipod's only have a one year warranty.  At the store they confirmed that "yes your ipod is broken, so you have two choices." 1. "Since we don't repair them you can purchase a refurbished model for $183.00" or 2. "We will give you 10% off a new model(new model is $249.00)".  I am not very pleased with Apple and the quality of my now useless, one and a half year old, $250.00 ipod.  I chose neither option 1 nor option 2.  I refuse to pay more money so that I can once again be sitting in the repair chair at the Apple store in another year and a half.   All I ask is that you take into consideration my experience and take to heart that while I was waiting in line for the repair man, there were four people ahead of me with broken ipods and two people behind me.   Honestly, my money is spent better elsewhere.

<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My (now ex) boyfriend got a white Ipod Nano for his b-day. I was slightly jealous, because the things were expensive as crap. But after a while I lost many reasons to be jealous, so here come those Cons, ya ready?;   1: The thing doesn't take Double A's, it has an internal battery... On a long Greyhound trip I would rather be able to run in and out of a gas station to get a fresh set of AA's, then hafta wait til I got home to plug into USB to charge.   2: I like versatility! Say I buy a new Dir en Grey CD at Hot Topic, I want to listen to it as soon as possible, not wait till I get home to rip it all to MP3 and wait even longer to transfer it all to the Ipod. If they made an Ipod that could play store bought CD's as well as data files then yeah, I would probably buy one.   3: The earbuds, I'm not sure but I think they run off a special jack... so that means I hafta get headphones specifically for Ipod. No chance of using my HUGE Panasonic cup headphones I got at Fred Meyer.   This tiny little thing does have its strong points; so here's the Pro's;  1: 4 gigs of storage (more than enough to hold my collection of Jpop and several NIN and Manson albums)  2: Very pleasing display, anyone looking over your shoulder can read off what you're listening to.  3: It reads ID3 tags (so does a Rio Volt), this is great for someone who obsessively names and tags all of his mp3's.  4: Its small and can fit in your pocket, unlike a CD player, though with that smallness comes the ease of losing it, someone stealing it, and functionality like playing CDR's which woulda been useful.  5: It can display japanese texts in the ID3 tags. Perfect for someone like me who listens to mostly japanese music.

<Title>Complete waste of money
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok I liked it when I first got it, it was the popular thing to have. After three months though I got tired of the limitations of itunes, the first and formost being its incompatibility with virtually every other program on your computer.  It got worst when my ipod completly broke, it would only play half my songs and then completly refused to turn on. I sent it in and got a new one, that new one worked for about three weeks.   The constuction of the Ipod makes it impossible for anyone to troubleshoot without the intervention of apple. I filled out many messy complaint forms and help-plea emails that were never followed up on.  There are lots of other Mp3 players that are much better, perhaps not as well known or expensive but much better.

<Title>Not impressed
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my iPod mini over Christmas in 2004.  My headphones broke after just a few months, and right around the one year mark, my iPod stopped working completely.  I took it to the Apple store and they gave me a new one, after I bought an extended warranty for $75.  I've had my new one for almost a year and for the last month or so, the fully charged battery will not last for even one full song.    iTunes is seriously disappointing as well.  It is completely incompatible with any other media or mp3 players.  Also, any songs downloaded from the iTunes store can only be burned onto a CD 6 times.    Apple sucks people in with the iPod's cute appearance and user-friendlyness, but I have not been impressed.  I have spent way too much money on accessories (which have also been unreliable and I've replaced chargers, headphones, cases, etc.).  I have spent the past 2 years building up a library on iTunes that I will not be able to use with the next mp3 player I buy which will not be an iPod.

<Content>Like others have reported, the hard drive in the Mini is very delicate.  My wife's died within about 10 months. It can't be fixed, you have to get a new one.  So that's why the new Nano, which came out only about 1-2 years later doesn't used a hard drive.  Don't buy the Mini used, get a Nano.

<Content>I don't know if this is the same with every Ipod Mini, but...I bought mine a year and a half ago. It was working great up until last month. I have always run the battery down as Apple has suggested and then fully re-charge the unit before next use. Unfortunately the battery won't hold a charge for more tham 15 Minutes. Oh well.

<Title>Don't Waste Your Money!!!!
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, I must admit, I was smitten with my first generation mini for the first year and a half.  Back then, I would have given it 5 stars.  Easy to use, durable and decent battery life with moderate use.  I just had to reset it every once in a while.  But my mini just hit the year and a half mark, and I think it was made to self destruct.  The battery performance went horribly wrong.  The battery indicator is useless.  And recently, the "unhappy" ipod appeared, basically indicating my iPod is garbage.  I have done enough research to know there is not much I can do, except buy a new one.  I am not about to put more money in Apple's pocket, and I am not made of money, so my next MP3 player will not be an iPod.

<Title>Simply the BEST!
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved a green iPod mini back in September for my 14th birthday.  Now it is July, and I have to say, I love my iPod.   Me, being the clumsy person I am, have dropped it more than a few time onto solid pavement, and it still works properly.  It has never skipped or anything, and aside from a few scratches on the corners (from me dropping it), it looks pretty much new.    Even though it doesnt have a color screen, that doesnt really matter; when I listen to it, I'm not really looking at the screen.  My iPod fits into the palm of my hand.  Sure, it's not as small as the Nano, but it's small enough.  I keep the belt clip on all the time anyways...it makes it less awkward to handle.  My iPod is small enough for my lifestyle, and it's cute too! Many people have commented that they love my "cute, green iPod."   There is one drawback though, but I've still rated this product 5 stars because it's something you could easily avoid.    The only drawback is the earpieces.  Almost every night I fall asleep with my iPod headphones stuck in my ears, and I always end up waking up sometime later with extremely sore ears.  This can easily be avoided by simply getting a new pair of headphones.  To avoid my problem with falling asleep with them in, I have found a clever solution; a pillow with speakers in them! You can just plug your iPod into the pillow, and it plays your songs all night, without the hurt in your ears the next morning.  If you're looking for an iPod, I would highly recommend this particular type.  The mini is the only Pod that has a vibrant color to it; all the rest of the iPods, you have to buy a slip case for them if you want any color other than white or black.  The mini is convinient in size and price.  Sure, it's more than a shuffle, but really...who wants an iPod with no touch wheel or a screen to see what song you're listening to? ;D  My iPod's battery life is long enough; I can easily listen to it consistently for a day and a half if I wanted to.  It takes a while to get the battery to last that long, but I just charge it overnight when the battery is running low.  Another helpful thing I've gotten for it is a portable charger.  It comes with a plug in for the wall and for in a car.  I've found this VERY useful when I went to Calgary for two weeks and Cuba for a week.  Remember, Apple products work around the world! So it's a very good investment if you travel a lot and enjoy music or your Mac!  Courtney

<Title>Mixed Emotions
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the Apple iPod mini, 4 MB/green edition, for a little over a year. Never mind it has a monochrome screen. It offers a few games, plus the ability to store over a 1,000 songs (if you rip the songs at less than 128kps) and Podcasts. I like it so much, I bought a nice leather case to prevent from scratching it, or dropping it and shattering the screen. I've even added an FM transmitter to broadcast the music over the car radio, which is quite handy when there are no radio stations or the radio programming is inadequate.   It's a fabulous device, and I prefer it over the competition. But there are a few things Apple MUST do to make this product even better. One, music from Apple's iTunes Store cannot be purchased in all parts of the world, particularly in Malaysia where I live. Two, the battery is encased and can only be removed by an Apple technician. Three, the Apple Customer Service in Malaysia is non-existent, especially should you need to have it repaired or the battery replaced. I discovered this just recently. So, iPod affacinados in certain parts of the world BEWARE of the limited Apple Customer Service before you plunk down your hard earned bucks.   Overall, I give the iPod mini 5 stars for being such a neat, compact and innovative product. I give the iPod battery (which when it worked gave me about 8 hours of continuous play) 1 star. Lastly, I give Apple's Customer Service/iTunes Store 1 star.   Post-script (29 January 2007). After being quoted nearly US$100 for a replacement battery and installation charges by an Apple representative in Malaysia, I opted to buy a replacement kit from a website ([...] also offers it) for approximately US$[...] and installed it myself. My iPod now works as good as new.

<Content>We purchased an ipod mini about 9 months ago, and it runs well. However, the battery doesn't hold much of a charge, and needs frequent re-juicing. This is not the kind of thing one expects from a new Apple item costing this much. Overall, while the product is well-designed, and works wonderfully, the batter problem leaves us  somewhat disappointed.

<Title>I love my iPod
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My trusty discman broke in January 2004 and so I was finally in the market for a new portable music player.  I looked around for a decently cheap mp3 player, but couldn't find one that I liked.  I went to the gym music-less (and my workouts suffered for it!), I rode the train in silence, or was forced to listen to yuppies talk on their cellphones.  Then, Apple saved my sanity and brought the price of the mini's within my range! Halleluja.  I went out and brought one from their website straight away (I get student discount from them).  I got it within a couple of days and it's barely left my side since.  I love it! It fits in my jeans pocket, or my jacket pocket, or my shoulder bag, so I can take it everywhere.  Going to the gym has become a joy again.  Riding the train is not so boring! And if I forget a book to read (or I'm bored in class), I can play solitaire on my iPod.  My iPod is my favourite thing.  Ever. I have the silver one (to match my powerbook) and it's crazy and cool and goes with everything I wear.  The earbuds kind of start hurting my ears after I've been wearing them for six hours straight, but apart from that, it's all thumbs up from me.

<Title>Great Music, Ease of Use but just a couple of things missing
<Date>Tue May 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I finally decided on the mini because of the size of the player and the fact that music could be stored in files. Three of my family members were going to use it, and we wanted to make sure we could all have our own seperate playlists. Downloading from CD's was so easy, even I could do it quickly. I really like the "look" of the player as well. Very Cool. The things I noticed that were somewhat lacking is a guard or shield (you have to remember to hit the "hold" button even when it's off if you're going to put it in your purse). You can buy one of course, for $30 extra. It also doesn't have an "off" button, but turns itself off if not in use.  The earphones are ok...the fuzzy things came off after about 3 days of use. My husband and son like a different kind, and ended up purchasing those instead. The sound is wonderful and the Monster car adapter ($79) works great. I kind of wish it had a neck cord like the shuffle, I'm not a big fan of the arm band (which is also extra). We also have a one outlet hook up to our stereo and can play the mini straight through our speakers.  Love the green color, btw...very fun.

<Content>Get this player! I'm serious! I just received this! I was so mad though. I'm like,it doesn't play WMA format! I had hundreds of songs in WMA! But it's easy. Just burn it to a disk then import it into AAC in iTunes. iTunes is the best music system! It so fast and easy to learn! You geta free radio when you download it! It's quick and easy. Garunteed no hassle! The Ipod itself, amazing! Sounds really good! Better then any other player! The click wheel is so cool! It's touch-sensitive! Don't think, I want a 20Gig Ipod. These things suck. I can name thousands of songs in minutes. Well you might be thinking that but It's plain awesome! No flaws! The guy that said he downloaded more then 1,000 songs is a retard. You can only download 1,000 songs! The games are cool too! I got a "Contour Design ISee Mini" it's so good! Best case there is! It looks dumb in the picture but It's really good and it keeps the perfect look of the iPod! Buy this. I recommend for anyone. From Kids to Adults anyone will like this item.

<Content>All I can say is that I love my iPod mini and I haven't been this excited about a toy since I was a kid.  I'm confused by the negative ratings on this site.  They complain that it's impossible to set up and that there's no recharger.  I can only assume that they're Apple-haters because no one can be that stupid.  Firstly, I have an iMac g4 and it took me no more than 5 minutes to set up my iPod and get it in sync with my already installed iTunes.  Secondly, the usb cord that comes in the package IS the battery recharger.  If you need to recharge when away from your computer, then yes, you'd need to buy an additional component.    Sheesh, people get a brain!

<Title>High praise for this gadget!
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I haven't seen a gadget this genius in a very long time? Have I EVER seen anything so wonderful and compact? I can't even think of anything that compares to the iPod, any of them: Mini, Nano, Video or Shuffle. With this compact music holder and a good computer, you are able to store you favorite songs all in one place. The music is sorted a couple of ways for your convience. It's sorted by genre, artist, album title, and song title. So Apple has given you a vairety of ways to find the songs you want to hear. Good things come to those who wait..that being said, it took me about 5 days to completely fill up my iPod mini. I have 919 songs on it, but it took quite awhile transfering the CDs to the iPod. Once you have done it once, all you have to do then is take off or add songs, which takes just a few minutes. I love the fact that you can operate your iPod using your thumb. It takes almost no effort to hear your favorite music!   IPod Mini also features the shuffle tool, something I use all of the time. I don't want to hear my songs in the same order all of the time, so with this feature, I can listen to them any way the iPod wants! They never play the songs in the same order. Also, this is a gadget of endurance. I have dropped it a number of times (whoops) and it still works just fine. I did put a few scratches on it, but that is expected.   I highly recommend the IPOD (any iPod...Nano, Mini, Video or Shuffle) to anyone who is tired of carrying around CD players or walkmans. I love this thing!!!

<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Goodbye, Apple Ipod Mini. Ye had yourself an easy life, seeing as how ye were the most popular MP3 player in the world. However, ye are very outdated. Take a good look at the competition, Minidude. Look at the Creative Zen Micro Photo; instead of ye, people can enjoy 8 GB, FM radio, voice recording, and color screen for less (yes, a lot less). The Sandisk Sansa E100 series blows your nose, Mini. It has a big 1.8" color screen, movies (yes!), photos, voice recorder, FM radio, user-replaceable battery, and an awesome metal in the back. Ye are dead, Mini. You have risen from your grave and are being sold here on Amazon (I have no idea why or how...I thought they were discontinued), but you are old-very old. Die in peace; don't torment yourself by waiting for people to buy ye...it won't happen. Now that people are brain damaged with the Crapple Ipod Nano (which I think is way inferior to ye, Mini), and other (smart) people are buying nice things like the Creative Zen Micro Photo instead of ye, and the Creative Zen Vision: M instead of the Ipod Video (sorry, the Ipod with video playback capabilities), and anything but the Ipod Shuffle of Nothingland, ye are no longer king. It was a good try though, and I wouldn't be surprised if some weirdo fanboy of Apple will buy this. Yet, deep down in ye, Mini, ye know, ye KNOW, that this is the end. Die a peaceful death, be a good sport, and be happy and satisfied that you had many fans. You better hope that your children-the Ipod Nano, Ipod with video, and more to come-will be good and do as you've asked. You'd beter hope that they don't sacrifice many useful and/or cool features (voice recorder, FM radio, etc.) just so that they can look cool. You were the wiser one, Mini. You KNEW that this would happen. You came back from your grave to warn your disobedient children-to give them their last warning. They don't seem to care, but keep trying, Mini. Someday, your children will die-someday they will realize that they're fading away, and that other companies (Creative, Sandisk, etc.) have been selling players with some nice features and taking the fans who blindly loved you so. The time is coming, bad Nano and Video. Make up for disgracing the Ipod Family by working hard to get your creators to make decent Ipods in the feature. If you do this, you will be rewarded. If you don't, you will be surprised-painfully surprised. Take this as a serious warning, evil children of Ms. Mini. Mr. Nano, stop trying to look cool and deceive smart people into buying you. If you continue on with your evil life, you will suffer death-the painful way. Put some meat on your plastic and build some battery muscles. Also, practice memorizing poems and saying them out loud to learn how to remember peoples' voices and all noises so that people can record, and learn how to get signals off your potentially brilliant, as your friends can. Oh, by the way, I heard you never got through High School. Until you learn more than 4 GB of information, we're not gonna buy you. At least bring your wages down; not everybody's a millionaire. Not everyone is going to pay you that much to get very little info outta you. And can you please stay out of the woods once in a while? Really, all those scratches gotta hurt. And you don't look to pretty with 'em, either. Mr. Video, will you also stay away from the pricker bushes? They scratch your lovely plastic and make you ugly. You're also very lazy; after two hours of showing someone a movie, you go to sleep until the computer wakes you up. C'mon, you can't be that tired. The Creative Zen Vision: M is a hard worker, conking out after a good four hours. Also, can you please go to a decent college?! Get a brain so you can record noises and figure out how to get signals through your brain like other players. And, along with your younger brother Nano, let people use "drag 'n drop" instead of iTunes if they want to. So, I guess you get the point, Mr. Nano and Mr. Video. Get off your lazy butts and get to work. If you get through High School and college, then maybe you'll be smart enough to record what people want and get signals off of FM through your brain. If you work hard like your fellow classmates, maybe you will be worth buying. Remember your friend Iaudio U2? He did great in college. He decided to become an ICANDOEVERYTHING, and he succeeded. DO you see what he has? It has an FM tuner, voice recorder, Line-in recording, clock, screen, and tiny size that blow away the iPod Shuffle and Nano. It's better to be smart than to be "cool".

<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod is the best if you are a heavy traveler. It can take a lot of damage and still work. my friends iPod mini was thrown against a wall by her mom, and it still works. also its compact, so if you lose it its hard to find. I used to have a nano, but it was really flimsy. It ended up breaking.

<Title>Best overall - still needs improvements
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has a very sleek design, innovative wheel control, and nice sound output and mine was also quite reliable. Also it has the advantage of many aftermarket accesories. But also many things to improve,  1) no radio, no radio recording (Apple wants you to buy songs from them, that's probably one of the reasons why they do not include a radio which is a free music source) 2) you can't delete anything without connecting to PC 3) Itunes itself needs a lot of improvement 4) Battery is not removable so when it dies you have to send it back to Apple to get it changed.

<Title>Don't buy the mini ipod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an ipod mini about a year and a half ago.  This was the worst purchase of my life! Never buy this ipod.  The menu button stopped working(this is the most used button- ipod mini is not functional without it!) and the play/pause button stopped working.  I took it into an apple store to the genius bar(where they "fix" products) and all they told me was that i could get a new ipod with a 10% discount if i give them my mini to recycle.  I'm not sure what new mp3 i'll get, but it won't be an apple.

<Title>The iPod mini: BETTER THAN THE NANO
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I know that most adults don't care about the look of their mp3 player as much as the capacity for songs and quality, but for a kid, (especially a kid that has to earn their money, like me) appearance is a very important role, and customizing does cost money. If you buy the nano for $150, you can get a 240 song capacity, and choose between black, or white. And of course, you want to make your mp3 player different from everyone elses, so you then need to earn yet more money to pay $20 for a pink, red, purple, or whatever color hard case. As a kid, it's better because you can buy it, and not have to change the face plates to make it your own. And for the same amount of money as the 240 song nano, you can get a 1,000 song mini, and even choose the color, without having to pay a cent more.

My brother got this for his birthday and thats when I found out why these are more money.  They Hold about a million times more music than my old cheapie MP3 player did.  The song quality is amazing.  The iTunes software is one of the best players that I have had in a long time.

<Title>Ipod In The Convience
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is just everything that really is hot when it comes to playing the songs from a MP3 Player. It is just about the hottest thing for all music lovers. Apple really does know a thing or two about that status. Since the Ipods were released, everybody around the world has been getting on the Ipod craze. More people are buying those Ipods for downloading tunes than getting music from your local record store right now. But for so many, considering on buying the Ipod in the regular form in just all but a bit too expensive for some. Well, for those the Mini Ipod is just the way to go.  Apple's Mini Ipod is really everything your heart could definitely love in a MP3 Player, that the regular Ipod could carry. This version can accomidate as many as 1,000 different tracks that can be stored into the hard drive. The device is just as simple to operate as the regular Ipod, and is discreet to store anywhere. The Mini Ipod has also a few advantages as the regular Ipod. One of them is a longer battery life, that can playback 18 hours of life, six more that the regular Ipod features. It also has a very valuable electronic skip protection that lasts up to 30 minutes. It also comes in a variety of spectacular colors to fit your style like blue to hot pink. So that you can have a player that can possibly match the decor of your lifestyle.  All in all, Apple's Mini Ipod is a very good quality item, for anyone who is just destined to be into MP3. I really would suggest this for anybody who wants a good MP3 player at a affordable price.   Price: A 1/2-  Quality: B+  Sound: B  Easy To Operate: B 1/2+  Overall: B+

<Title>WARNING for WINDOWS LAPTOP USERS
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I brought 2 ipod minis just in the last week. One for me and one for my boyfriend for his birthday. I figured that it was finally time for me to enter the future and get on the ipod bandwagon. Well let me tell you all something, he popped his into his windows computer and it worked great. I, on the other hand have not been so lucky. I have Compaq laptop that works great except for when I tried loading my ipod mini onto it. First let me say that I expected some small compatibility issues, but no where near what I have experienced. First laptops that do not have a USB2.0 port or Firewire card (most don't) will have to buy one ($30- 50$). So I brought the firewire. Then the idiot Apple tech person tells me that the cable they sent me isn't a firewire cable, it's a USB 2.0 cable and I will have to buy one! That's another freakin 30 bucks. It's been a week and I still haven't been able to load it up with music. By the time I'm able to, I'll be 80 bucks in the hole for additional wires. I hate this thing already, but I'm going to go through the pain because I figure it's better than my portable cd player which keeps skipping. Just be warned everyone out there with a laptop that APPLE does not give you the option of choosing a cable depending on whether you have a laptop or not. Nor will they exchange the wrong one that comes in the package with your ipod. You will have to spend additonal MONEY!.

<Title>Somewhat of a disappointment
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, first I should say that this is my first iPod so I can't compare it to any others.  I chose this primarily for blocking out the awful music they play at my gym and listening to my own while I'm working out.  It holds plenty of songs for that and my CDs are very easy to upload now that I've bought an upgrade to an operating system that will work with it (along with new antivirus software to go with the new OS, etc., etc., but we'll chalk those little annoyances up to Microsoft, not Apple).  Here's where things fall off a bit for me:  The menu interface is difficult to navigate and the "click" wheel (which doesn't click, it just rolls kind of aimlessly) is hard to turn effectively.  Since you can't set playback volume when you upload software, if you want to shuffle your songs and use CDs from different time periods, it requires constant twiddling with the volume and that is difficult to do quickly or, for that matter, at all sometimes.  The display is impossible to see without holding down the button for the backlighting.  I've only had the iPod a week and the white click wheel is already filthy.  Looks really nasty against the hot pink/mauve of this unit.  It's not that soft pink you see around sometimes -- this one is a real attention getter, not the most pleasant color.  The hold button works fine, unless you bump the unit.  The slightest bump pauses the iPod, which is really annoying when working out since of course it's going to get bumped.  To restart the unit playing, you have to take it off hold and press play, then reset the hold button.  Then there are the provided accessories -- the earbuds are great for about 10 minutes and then they are incredibly painful, so count on throwing them out unless you have a high pain tolerance.  The belt clip is too thick to work directly on clothing, but too flimsy to work on anything that isn't soft and thick without falling off.  Inevitably, it falls off and then the song it was on won't play so you have to move the hold button, press play and then reset hold.  In short, the sound is great and the size is really convenient, so overall it's worth it, but Apple could sure stand some design improvements.  On the plus side, it's really lightweight, adding music is quick, and with broadband internet it enters all the info for you (artist, album, genre, time) and keeps track of how much music you have on there.  It sounds great and is easy to haul around, but the crummy accessories and difficult interface make me wonder whether it was worth the cost.

<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I actually have the 6 gig, which costs a little more but it holds more and is worth it. It took a little bit of time to figure out how to work and download songs as the information disc isn't all that helpful, it loses a couple of points for difficult start-up.  The features are great, the wheel/finger-slide couldn't be any better,  BUT:  A big problem is that Apple claims this mini is good for "up to 18 hours."  Not even close. Seven hours is top for me so I end up having to recharge every 3 to 4 days. Fudging the truth is one thing but this is lying, plain and simple.  It's a great product particularly if you have an iBook or Notebook, but you also have to remember to recharge it. I let the batteries run almost all the way down so I don't lose anymore charge time,   ENJOY but BEWARE.

<Title>iPod is awesome, iTunes is lousy
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I used to love my iPod.  Now I'm thinking that when it dies I'll look somewhere else for an mP3 player, or find a way to buy songs in Napster (the .99 way) and send them to iTunes.  I love the Ipod.  It is easy to use.  I've owned mine now for four months.  I enjoyed it until this week.  iTunes is the problem.  Why?  I was using my credit card in iTunes to buy songs for a while, and then decided that I wanted to use my paypal account instead.  The credit card is not attached to my Paypal account, and iTunes accepts PayPal. Or so they say.  I deleted the credit card and told iTunes to use Paypal.  A snap, I figure.  Nope.  iTunes decides to resurrect my credit card and place it back on the account-without my permission, without me using it to buy songs, and without even contacting Paypal.  Frustrated, I look for some support.  I mean, even amazon.com has support if you have problems, even the phone kind of support.  And you don't have to pay them for it.  The only support they have is email support, and I've heard that they take their precious sweet time answering, so I look for phone support.  They have it.  But it will cost me $49 to get them to help me with my problem.  And I even bought an iPod!  The woman I got was snickering at me loong before I got mad at her, and she tells me "well, that sucks."  So I no longer use iTunes, and I'm praying those morons don't resurrect my credit card again, because if they do I'll kindly report them.  If I delete it, I should never have to see it again-and Apple should not be authorized to use it until I say so.   	As for my iPod, I like it, and am grateful I bought the BEST BUY warranty that went with it-at least I won't ever have to get help from those worthless buffoons that supposedly call themselves "support."  Now, for my iPod experience: I own the older one, and I can be quite harsh towards it.  It has survived being accidentally thrown at a wall, it has survived the nine degree temperatures of Logan, Utah, (and not inside my coat), and the 100 degree temperatures of Layton, Utah.  Creating playlists for it is quite annoying-you have to change names or trick the playlists into accepting songs, and you won't have nearly as many playlists as you would in Microsoft's Media Player.  Overall, iTunes is the most annoying component of this product.  If they made it so you could get it to work with Media Player, I'd be happy.  For now I'm going to buy my music in Napster, the .99 kind, and burn it to CD-and then get iTunes to recognize it.  A tedious process, I know, but I don't like buying my music from iTunes anymore, not after they messed with my credit card like they did, all the while not helping me.  I give this product 3 stars-the iPod is awesome, iTunes honestly sucks.  The battery life on the newest iPods is better than mine is-supposedly an 18 hour battery life, with you acutally playing it.  Compare that to my iPod mini, which has a 6 hour battery life.  So the iPod has gotten better recently, but iTunes continues its downward spiral.  I would figure that with Napster out there that they woud get a clue.  But apparently not.

<Content>I give this Mini I-Pod a rating of three stars. i think that the Mini I-Pod is a very good product. this is a very good prduct beacsue you can carry it around everywhere. it is small and it can fit practically fit anywhere. This product can fit about 2,000 songs. it also cames along with games. My favorite game is brick. It entertains me and it gets my mind thinking while I listen to my favorite song. I also like the backlighting you can make it last for how ever many seconds that you want. At night if it is dark it helps me to see what song I am picking. The mini I-Pod also comes in a variety of colors. It comes in pink, silver, blue, green, and gold. There is a color for everyone. It also has a really cool feature where you can select your favorite songs and put them on a list called the To-Go list. This list allows you to listen to only your favorite songs if you are on the move. Something else that is really cool is that you can rate the songs that you have. It is from a scale of 1-5. Something that is really helpful for me is that you can search for songs accoriding to album, artist, genre, or song names. That helps me look for the song i am in the modd for instantly. I think that the Mini I-Pod is in the reach of most poeople. It is about $200. The prices of it are going down though becasue the demands for them are also going down. Even though the demands for this product are going down i still that that this product is of very good quality. If anyone loves music i think that this would be the perfect gift eitehr for someone or for yourself.

<Title>Forget the Nano
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Mini for a year and a half, and it's still going strong, has great battery life, and is unblemished despite considerable abuse. I originally bought it for long plane rides, and my Mini has travelled around the world with nary a hiccough in performance.   I write this review knowing that many people will skip over this "old" iPod and purchase the sexier Nano. My plea is this: the Mini is a better value. Yes, the Nano is small... tiny, even, but if what you want is a solid and durable music player (that's also quite small), the Mini is just better. It lacks a color screen, but the razor-sharp, high-contrast screen guarantees that you'll never have trouble seeing clearly in bright sunlight like the Nano screen. Also, the Mini is more durable. The Mini's metal housing can take quite a lot of punishment and you'll never see a scratch... which can't be said for the Nano, to be sure. But also, the Mini is a better value. For almost $100 less, you can get a great iPod with the same storage capacity and comparable size as a Nano.   So before you shell out the big bucks for 4GB of iPod, consider the Mini over the Nano. It's not the newest iPod, but it's certainly a great value and good performer.

<Title>Has some issues but is a great little player.
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a first generation green Ipod Mini (meaning before they added more color). It is a great player, but I have problems with charging it. If you want the charge to stay you need to charge it every night, and who can remember to do that all the time? Another HUGE problem now is that they discontinued it. Since it's discontinuation, stores don't sell them, or many of their accessories anymore which is a real hassle since you have to go through the expensive Apple website. Also if you plan on investing in one of these, buy yourself some better headphones. I tried to jog with these and after one step they fell out of my ears. They don't fit snuggly in the ear so the music doesn't sound great because you don't hear it directly. Plus the earbuds make the quality of the music sound poor.   With software, Itunes is increadibly easy to learn even for the not so computer savvy like myself.   I plan on buying an Ipod video since mine is discontinued, won't work properly, and is most likely defective, even though I've only had it since February 2005. I had wanted to put some audio books onto it but I realized it would take up alot of room.  Buy it if your looking for something small, sleek and attractive to hold a small amount of music, but don't expect it to be a music powerhouse.

<Content>My husband and I were both SO excited to get our ipod minis last year -- they worked extremely well, very user friendly, sleek...and we loved them for a year.  But then BOTH batteries totally gave out (mine before his by about 1 month)...toward the end we were having to charge them every night and now, they don't last more than 20 minutes or so.  We had followed all the 'online' advice for not ruining your battery, but, didn't work.  Also mine has just completely stopped working --- about a month ago when I tried to turn it on it gave a little 'sick' face (or something like that, the message picture indicator went away pretty quickly).  So I thought it needed a software update.  I tried updating it on my PC, but, it just did not work whatsoever.  Now they are both pretty much going in the trash...all $500 worth.

<Content>Okay I have had my Ipod mini for over a year now and it has been running just fine.  I had about 300 songs on it and everything seemed to be running smooth.  Then about a year later my computer got a serious virus on it and had to be reset, not a big problem.  About a month later I decided to install Itunes back to my computer.  Once installed, a message came up saying in order to get the your songs from your library, you will need to delete them off your ipod and then will be installed to your library.  I thought this was a little strange and searched around to find any other options but there wern't any.  The only way to do this was to click yes, and i did.  Everything from my Ipod was deleted to never be found again.  Sure I have some of the Cd's but probably [...] was spent on Itunes merchandise.  I am thoroughy disapointed with Apple and all there people you have working there.  Thanks Apple, thanks a lot.

<Title>Comparison of Flash MP3 and Hard Drive MP3
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay. Here is a write up, that I did, on the comparisons/contrasts on MP3 players. Mainly, the Harddrive versions (I.E. Rio Riot/Apple IPOD -both of which I own) and the flash memory type... (I.E. Memorex 3642 Mp3 Player/IPOD Nano, of which I own as well).  What prompted this little jaunt (of which you may send to as many people as you like) My (expensive) Apple 40 gig 1st generation iPod died during an autofill. Just me copying files over to it, and the battery ran out of juice. I would have not attempted to copy music had I known the battery was low, but the battery read FULL STRENGTH. There was, later on, battery issues, and one of the issues -there were quite a few- was the false read on the iPod.  Don't try to do any sort of autofilling on a hard drive MP3 player (Apple or other brand) if the battery is low.  Anyhoo, I called Apple, they said return it for maintenance.  I did. Sent it back.  They returned it, still broke.  To my suprise, there is only a TEN DAY return policy.  TEN DAYS.  That policy has since been revised.. remember, this was the first generation of the iPod, and stuff like warrantee's and batteries were not quite worked out... but I digress...  So, after a month or so of messing around trying to find another MP3 player... I decided to go with a flash memory MP3 player, the ones that use an internal memory much like the memory in your computer.  And I bought a german Mp3 flash player then a Shuffle, and then a bit later I bought a Nano.. both of which I liked quite a bit.  SO, here are the pro and cons of these devices.  Pro's for the Memory Stick MP3 players  -Cheaper. NORMALLY WAY CHEAPER than Hard drive types.  For example, now Apple makes a 1 gig Nano, and it is 140 bucks.  And you can get other brand Flash memory ones for around 65 dollars.  And that is not so bad, and nothing like the 300 or more you will pay for the monster hard drive versions.  -If you go into music match or any other software (the iTunes software I think does this as well) and file convert to MP3 Pro and shrink the size of your MP3 to like, say 3o percent... you can really make a good Kompression. Example. My Memorex MP3 player has 32mbs of memory on board. It is expandable to 256mb. 32 mb will basically let you put one cd's worth of music. It is easy to put music on and off of them, due to your computer reading the USB as just another hard drive, so you drag and drop to put on, delete them to take them off. But, after you shrink your files to MP3 Pro 30 percent, you can put twice as many. So, basically a 256mb chip will allow me to put 208 songs on my little less than palm size MP3 player. And it weighs like 3 ounces.   - More on memory.  Some of the Mp3 players have insertable memory chips.  Much like the stuff you use in your camera. These little chips are the size of the upper part of your thumb, at least my thumb anyway. They come in 128mb, 256mb, 512mb and even though there aren't any MP3 machines out there to handle them YET, you can even buy a 1.5gig thumb size chip thingy. Considering the size of the chips and the shrinking kompression I told you about earlier, I could shrink my whole KOLLEKTION down to 10 of those 1.5gig chips. At the current shrink rate I am at 5 DVD's, which are way bigger and more fragile than these little chips.  Other types use the internal memory, like the Nano.  All the Apple Nano versions have various sizes, the Shuffle smallest one is 512, then goes up to 1 gig... now the Nano is as small as 1 gig and goes up to 4 gig (the one I have is the black 4 gig, and is only 50 dollars more than the 2 gig version).  - Flash Memory is not as fragile as hard drive type. You can drop one of these chips and not scratch it. I wouldn't stomp on one with my foot, or get one in water, but they are encased in plastic. Ruggedish.  I have dropped my nano, and my shuffle multiple times and no problems.  I would NOT try that with a hard drive version, although it must be stated that they make some very rugged cases for the hard drive versions, and I have a friend who has the video Apple 40 gig iPod and he says his rugged case has protected his after he dropped it... but they are sorta expensive.  - Batteries last for quite a while, and some have internal batteries (the ipods do), others just have regular removeable batteries... There isn't much going on here, no moving parts, no laser or hard drive to put power to. Most of these flash Memory types have a single AA battery. I use a rechargeable type, so we are talking very low cost here.  In comparison to the hard drive types, where you will get a solid 8 hours of playing, the battery powered flash memory can get up to 12 hours without a recharge, and the ones with removable batteries, if you buy the recharge ones you can just swap out...this really whupps up.  So, in the comparison to the hard drive, the flash memory only wins out due to it not being so harsh to the drain on the battery.  - Size. Small. Very small. Mine is three inches by three inches. A square. But, you can get smaller ones. And the memory chips that go in them are the same ones you use for your camera. And you can put files on them. If you want to put a word doc on your memory chip, you can. Your Mp3 won't recognize it, but it is nifty storage.  The Ipod Nano, you can put just about any file you want, you can put photos, you can put email info and song lyrics etc... very verstitle.  COMPARISON/CONTRAST  - Size does matter. In the case of hard drive Mp3 players... lets face it, you can, if you so chose to, put a library of congress on these monsters. They are the caddilacs of the hand held devices, and guzzle batteries like gasoline. But when it comes down to it, size is the only thing they have going for them. I don't mean to downplay the hard drive types, but don't drop them, don't shake them, and after shelling out $399 to Apple you might consider insurance. And now apple offers a two year warrantee, and I got one.  It cost 50 dollars.  If you are getting a hard drive version of iPod,  you'd be foolish not to get a warrantee.  - Price/Komparison. IPOD ran me $450 bucks. The 4 gig Nano ran me 250, you can get the 1 gig nano for 149.  My memorex MP3 player ran me 45 dollars. The 128 memory chip runs you 50 bucks, but are getting cheaper by the week. There really isn't a comparison to the two. The memory stick Mp3 players just kick @$$ on this issue.   I have really liked all the mp3 players I have bought, from the german ones, the rio riot (no longer being made I think) to the three different iPods... and the iPods are getting more durable.. but I really feel the future is in flash memory as it becomes larger and larger in memory bandwidth.  So, that is my review in a nutshell.   Have fun

<Title>There is a reason this has been discontinued
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my ipod mini in August of 2004. Broke in January of 06. Apple can't fix it. Wasn't worth the 250 and all the money I spent on Itunes songs. Will probably buy an MP3 player from a different company next time. 1) Itunes doesn't have nearly as many songs as it should; example: Madonna's catalog, which is about as mainstream as you can get, was just added at end of 05; 2) I don't think I ever got the battery to last past 2 hours even when it was new--I read there was a class action lawsuit about this issue; 3) If you have a Dell with a USB port, your songs may not automatically download into the mini from your computer. Mine never did. I had several friends look at the problem, researched the help pages. Turns out many, many people have this problem--where ITunes doesn't "recognize" the mini as being connected, even when it is. You have to delete out your existing program and then re-install every time you want to download. 4) Sometimes the music store won't open, and even itunes sometimes won't open. Remind me to never be in the first generation of any electronic device; I'll wait until the rest of you get the bugs out!

<Title>Still Going Strong After a Year
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first bought my Mini a year ago and it is still going strong. It suits all of my needs, as I don't have that much music to fit on some of the larger models. The battery doesn't run out nearly as fast as the newer models (I owned a Nano briefly before selling it to a friend) because of the lack of a color screen. I'm also not that concerned about carrying photos or videos around.

<Title>A bit of a disappointment
<Date>Thu Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I do LIKE my iPod, but I don't love it. It needs to be recharged very often...i like to play around with it and switch songs often, which uses more batteries than just listening within a playlist, so i literally have to charge mine every day. And it's much more expensive than comparable mp3 players from other companies (obviously because of it's cuteness!) and though I demanded THIS one over others, I regret that slightly. Many of my friends have mp3 players that are better than mine and cost about half as much.  Finally, I hate the On/Off function. At first it wasn't so bad, but after having it for maybe 2 or 3 months, it takes a long time to start, sometimes 45 secs to a minute or more, and two of my friends who have iPods have experienced the same problem. One of them returned hers because it just wouldn't turn on at all.  Also--- if you do buy one of these, DEFINITELY get a case for it ASAP. A girl I know dropped hers two weeks after she got it and it broke immediately. :( Good luck.

<Title>Purchase Anything Else but THIS
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my mini iPod last year, and it was "decent" for about a month. It started with the battery life. After playing for maybe 10 mins, the battery life bar was down by 1/2. And like others have said, the mini iPOd lasted no where near 18 hours, more like 4 on a good day. After another month, the controllers started to lock up: I would push the wheel to the right and the control for Up would go. Then, I couldn't turn it off and on, it would just stay on, until it wanted to go off.  It comes with a 1 year warranty (if you register it), so I took it into the Apple store, where the not so friendly Apple Geniuses (the name of the Apple Techs) did many tests on it just to prove my point that the controllers were broken. So, they sent it in and gave me a new or refurbished one. I should have asked at the time, but it looked brand new to me. After 2 months later, the batteries are still crap, but now it would go into the mode where you adjust the dimming and volume, and I couldn't get out of it b/c there is no reset and once again, the controllers would lock up. The playlists would just sift through the list, as if I was sitting there and played a song, then next, next, next, next, every 3 seconds...without stopping.. I took it back to APPle, where they said my warranty was up soon, and after it ran out, they would not give me any more service unless I bought another $60 warranty. After a bunch of dirty looks and irritation, they gave me another refurbished unit, where I sold it immediately. I couldn't wait to get rid of that piece of cr@p. For something that costs THAT much money, you can get much better performance and maintenance (if you'd ever need any) from any other manufacturer. I was soooo disappointed and tried to convince anyone I knew NOT to buy any Apple products. At first my friends' iPod weren't breaking down, but now, they emai me and say they are experiencing the exact same issues. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, you are WASTING YOUR MONEY!

<Title>battery life
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am surprised at the mostly positive reviews. Yes, this is a fun little mp3 player!!! I got it with the hopes of being able to listen to music while I run. Well, it might work if it had a complete charge the minute I left the house, unfortunately I don't have that luxury. The battery starts loosing the charge the minute it is taken off the charger. I find that annoying. I've never owned anything that works this way. Also, be careful not to tap it, it will go on. I also sometimes have trouble turning it off. I guess it doesn't matter because no matter what you do the battery looses it's charge. I do not regret buying this ipod. It is still fun, I just cannot count on it to workout with. I just would like to warn others who might want it for the same purpose as me. If you are concerned, I recommend checking with consumer reports, etc. After my purchase, I found a review that rated this 2/10...just be aware. Apple would be smart to make these with the disposable batteries like my Samsung. I never had a problem with it...I guess my biggest disappointment is this, why make a machine that has so much memory, but can't play the music back. Maybe I'm too old to understand.

<Content>Im 15 and i just finished saving up for this and i love it. I think it was better that i waited for the second generation to come out,the battery life improved drastically. Everyone else says that there are other mp3 player out there cheaper but do they hold as many songs?? do they display it so beautifully? b/c if your like me and have more than 600 songs this is a perfect mp3 player. Its pretty ( i have the pink one even though i like the 1st generation pink, this is more brighter than pastel-y), its small, very simple to use - its dumby-proof for all of you out there that arent so electronically intellectual. All in all i l0ve it soo much, its great for listening on the train or public transportation nd  i cant imagine me going anywhere w/o it, well worth my $$. If you love your music and want it with you and are thinking about buying an mp3 player get this one!!  - I gave it 4 stars  nd not 5 b/c im a windows user nd i just absolutely hate iTunes, its not difficult to manage just not me, id prefer windows media player, im so used to it.

<Title>Good
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased a mini iPod about a month ago and I gotta say, it's a pretty darn good looking mp3 player and thats pretty much expected from Apple. First off, if your a huge musicgoer and would like to upload all 200+ of your CDs onto this mini iPod, this isn't for you. I use this just to listen to my favorite songs usually shuffled so I can listen to songs I haven't heard in a while. I am pleased with the sound quality but not very happy with the durability of the earphones but Apple never is known for that. With that said, the battery life simply is bad. It hardly has 7 hours of battery life which means I have to charge every 2 days or so which can quickly become a pain. I'm not sure what people are complaing about but so far I've had no problems with iTunes. I find it fairly simple and easy to upload my wma and mp3 files to my iPod with ease, no longer then a few minutes.  All in all, I found this to be a very handy and reliable mp3 player and I don't regret my purchase at all.

<Title>Apple iPod Mini: Perfect Balance of Memory. Portabilit
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well good thing you are on eBay - because thats now the best and really the only place to buy iPod Minis. Now that Apple has forgone the iPod Mini series for the iPod Nano. Now that the Nano is getting all of the press attention for being the sexiest gadget ever - its hard to remember that just 12 - 18 months ago, the iPod Mini was in the same boat. And, for iPod Mini fans, thats good news because it means that the value of the Mini has decreased - effectively making them cheaper to buy on eBay as everyone else oogles at the Nano.  And I'm not 100% convinced that the Nano is better than the Mini. I believe it depends on what you are using it - the Mini is sturdier than the Nano - in fact, there are already blogs and reviews citing the Nano's lack of durability - something the Mini is great at. Of course, the give in that situation is that the Nano is lighter than the Mini... but remember - we are only talking ounces!  For the dollar, you get more music storage with the Mini than just about anything on the market - and all in a very light-wight MP3 player body. But again - it depends what you are looking for:  * If you want to a large music library - either for the office, the road or your home - the regular iPod is a better value and better idea  * If you are a gym-rat looking for the lightest MP3 player - perhaps you want a tiny flash player like the Rios, the Shuffle, or the Nano  But if you are looking for the perfect hybrid MP3 player - small enough to take a run with but spacious enough to play hours of unique music at the office - the iPod Mini really is the perfect solution. And of course it has the Apple interface and sexiness.  The minor points: with the second generation of the iPod Mini, Apple has improved the color scheme and really made them shinier and brighter. My preference is the Silver color - but beware that it will show scratches and nicks more so than the other colors. The Blue is bright, the pink quite girly, and the green look a little much like split pea soup for me =)

I listen to it on the metro going to work and also during some of my classes.  Pro's: - Charge lasts for a long time - iTunes has most songs I love; bonus is the audio books you can download.  I have some 11hr drives so I buy one or two and it's much cheaper than at the stores. - Small and compact  Con's: - Small storage space, go for a bigger one if you need it - Scratched up pretty easily, buy a cover

<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPod mini is the must have gadget of the 21st century. Apple really has no competition because no other player that's nearly as good.  Sound quality is excellent and the size is compact. Completely intuitive interface.  iTunes is a great music software and the mini's screen is beautiful, but all that defeated by the fact that the quality isn't great.  Then mini has a major defect in it's clip wheel, it breaks.  I'm a adult user who uses it about 1/2 hour a day when I walk my dog and it didn't last a year.  That's a short time considering I paid hundreds of dollar for the item.  Almost every ipod owner I know had issues after about a year and the repair service is almost non existent.  The ipod is great if you rich enough to buy a new one every year but for someone thinking that this will be the last player they buy for awhile is mistaken.

<Content> Having owned a turquoise 4GB iPod mini for a significant period of time -  several months. I believe it to be the best-buy of all the iPods available, at this point in time. It is very rugged though compact, and beautiful at the same time. Even though the smaller design of the nano is tempting, the mini is much more robust and manufactured with a higher quality of materials. I find the colors, form and style of this older model &lt;grin> (lately the term "older model" has been used to refer to a mater of months), not to mention quality, superior to all of the existing versions. In general, The iPod can be used for listening to books (my normal usage), or a thousand of your favorite songs. The iPod mini is compact and versatile & as previously mentioned: a joy to own.

<Title>Great until it breaks and you deal with "customer service"
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am sure I don't need to go on about how great an ipod is while it works, most people know that by now.  But I had an ipod which broke after 2 months.  When they replace it, they don't give you a new one - they give you a "refurbished one" which really means an ipod from someone else which broke and is probably older than yours.  The warranty only exists for 1 year from when you bought the original ipod.  Now after having my second ipod for under a year, the battery completely looses it's charge in minutes.  As it is just over a year since my original purchase, I am out of luck.  Their entire concept of customer service is a disgrace.

<Title>This Thing's A Steal.
<Date>Sun Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've toyed around with a few MP3 players in the past, and even bought a few only to return them all. They couldn't cut it. They just plain stank.   I remember when Apple came out with its 20 and 40 gig iPod models asking myself, "why would you need 10,000 songs?"  One-thousand songs will do just fine. Apple's four-gig model works perfectly. Great Idea. Now maybe, just maybe, if you're a traveling DJ doing weddings and getting 150 requests per night, the higher-capacity hard drives are for you. But to us ordinary Joes out there who only want to hear our favorite songs as much as possible, the Mini's for us.  I gave the iPod a four rating because it's a bit tricky to get used to the controls when you're used to the average buttons on a disc/standard MP3 player. They also could've dedicated more than the three whole sentences (if that) they gave to explain transfering music from iTunes to the iPod. It seems that they tell you to go to the instruction manual in the CD's 'help' section, and in turn the instruction manual tells you to check the CD for more info, so it's gonna take a little hit and missing (i.e. frustration) before you get it right. The click-wheel control is great once you get the hang of it though.  What kept me from sending it back after pulling my hair out because of not being able to transfer right away was the sound quality. Once I got all my songs into place, I played it, and it sounded incredible. I've worked as a musician and a sound engineer for years and that's probably why I'm so picky, but I anticipated making a return from the moment I bought it, and now I could never live without it. Even my girlfriend liked it. That's deep.  Make sure you get the wall-adapter for the USB port connection so that you don't have to hook into your computer everytime you want to charge it. I hope they start releasing them with the adapters so folks don't need to spend the extra 30 bucks.  If you've got some cash lying around, and you love music, pick one of these up, you might be suprised.

<Title>The Best Purchase I Have Made in a While!
<Date>Wed Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was skeptical about how an iPod could be worth the cost. I tried to buy a used Rio on Ebay, and another MP3 player from an electronics store, but I quickly found you get what you pay for! I love my mini iPod, and I take it with me to work, in my car, and all through the house. I am afraid I would have a hard time doing without it now. I have all my music in one place, with playlists, so I can listen to whatever genre or artist I am in the mood for!

<Title>Best MP3 Player Ever!
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini is close to perfect!  I got one and it came three quarters charged!  It is very small and light.  It also has very fast transfer times, you can transfer 20 songs in 10 seconds.  Also the sound quality is amazing.  The iPod is far better than any other MP3 player.  Trust me, the iPod is amazing!

<Title>Oh Dear Lord. Ok music player.
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok. I just bought the silver 4GB model iPod mini. There is some good features and some bad ones.  Pros: -Light and Compact. -Backlight -Easy touch pad. -Stores lots of songs. -Comes with iTunes. -Earphones are good, light.  Cons: -Litheum battery is not good. Lied about battery life-"Up to 18 hours of music playback." But I tested this thing out and it only lasted about five hours. After five minutes, the battery bar goes down 1/4. Then after five more minutes it's halfway down. And if you have the backlight on, it doubles the battery use. I think it's a waste of money to buy a popular music player that everyone has that only lasts about 5 hours.  -Too expencive. One hundred ninty nine dollers for a hard drive that only last five hours. I bet iPod makes a profet because it's so cheap to make them. My Sony Cd player owns the iPod mini, 53 hours of batter life.   -Head Phones. Personally the headphones suck. They don't snug into my ears. They feel very loose. I know I said the headphones are good on my pros, because I've heard people say they fit perfectly.   -iTunes Store. Rip off for one single song. Think about it fellows, 99 cent for one song. You could either go to the go to the library and wait for the album that contains your favorite song and add the track/tracks to your music library and update the songs on your iPod. Or for you obsessed impatiant people who can't wait, waste 12.00+ on that CD that contains your song. The only thing I like about iTunes is the free weekly single track, even they all suck, it's free and you don't have to wait.  ------------- Even though I'm a kid, these facts are all right except for the headphone one. Trust me, think about it before you buy an iPod. I can't believe people say "AMAZING" "SPECTACULAR PLAYER" ect...the good comments, because all out, the Apple iPod need's redoing. ------------- -Adrian

<Title>A teen's review
<Date>Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have to admit that I absolutely adore iPods. I have what you could call a "fetish" with them. I remember early last year, when I first saw the advertisement for the Apple 20GB model, I was almost drooling. Every time I saw a picture of an ipod on the side of a bus stop or an apple store, I would linger and wish I had one. Because the iPod is more than just a music player- it's a fashion accessory, a symbol that you're cool and up with the trends, and an amazing little piece of technology that lets you be yourself, no matter what type of music defines YOU.  At first, the prospect of owning an iPod was a dream. I can't tell you how many people I freaked out on the street, spotting the distinctive white earbuds and staring at them 'til I lost sight. About halfway through last year, a friend of a friend signed onto MSN Messenger with the screen name, "OMG I HAVE AN IPOD!". My reaction was nothing short of overwhelming for her. I attacked her with questions, everything from "how much does it weigh?" to "does it look nice?", only to find out it was actually an iPod mini, and a PINK one at that. I was seething for a week. Guranteed way to make a teen girl jealous- tell her you have the latest piece of technology in a colour she absolutely loves.  Towards the end of last year, the dream slowly start to take place as reality. I watched as one by one, my closest friends slowly started to fall into the iPod trend. The 20GB version seemed too much- it was a little too big, and only came in white- but the iPod mini was PERFECT for giggling schoolgirls. I made sure to take note of what colour everyone was buying- the agony of choice between all the pretty metallics was the hardest part of buying one. In my spare time in between school and daydreams about iPod players, I moved over my Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne cds, and began to pay a lot more attention to my dad's enormous cd collection. (Now, I have to admit, that I am the biggest 14 and a half year old Beatles fan that you have EVER seen.) My dad noticed the considerably larged-sized dent in his collection, and that was how I finally got to tell him about my love for the Apple iPod.  Christmas came and went, I gathered cash slowly and steadily. My birthday was approaching, my father made a deal with me ("ok, you be good and i will pay for half of it"), and I realised that in late February I was really and truly going to have an IPOD MINI!  It was surprisingly difficult to buy one- we must have gone to about seven stores until we were told that the second generation of iPod minis were about to be realeased, which was why there were no first generation iPod minis in stock. I ended up ordering an iPod mini off the Apple website, along with a Griffin FM transmittor, and recieved it delivered to my door only 3 days later.  I figured out how to work it extremely quickly, for someone who has not even grasped the concept of the cheese grater yet. On the first day, I'd gotten about two-thirds of my beloved Beatles collection on it, as well as my still-loved Avril Lavigne. Four months later, I now have 542 songs on it (and there are more to come!).  PROS: 1) The battery life is very good, in comparison to the first generation of iPod minis. I listen to my iPod mini for at least 5 hours a day (straight), and it lasts me approximately 5 days until I have to charge it again. I do think it lasts longer than the advertised 18 hours, and it only takes about an hour for it to be three-quarters charged (if I don't have four hours to wait for it to be fully charged). 2) For some reason, it's quite a bit cheaper than the previous model as well. (and I had a good reason to laugh at all my friends who went out and bought the previous models.) 3) It's well-sealed in a gorgeous metallic case, and VERY durable indeed. I've dropped my iPod countless times (even on tiled floors), gotten the headphone cords stuck on doorknobs, had it bouncing around in my schoolbag, etc, and it still looks as new as the day I got it.  4) It's MINUTE- about the same size as my mobile phone, with a bigger screen- and incorporates a whole heap of features into one little package. I can easily fit it into the pocket of my school uniform or my jeans, so it goes everywhere with me.  5) Navigation is wonderful- it's so easy and so fast. The click wheel is a wonderful idea, I can go all the way from "A Day In The Life" to "Your Mother Should Know" in my Songs list in seconds. Plus, on iTunes it's so easy to organise playlists. I have a playlist of songs I listen to when I'm sad, one for when I'm happy, hyper, angry, etc.... 6) The colours on the new model are just plain cute. I chose a silver one, and don't regret my decision one bit, as it goes with every outfit, is a totally classy colour and I love buying colourful cases for it. I had a tough time choosing though, because the sweet blue and pink ones are adorable. And wherever I go, I can always be guranteed an, "Oh, wow, you have an iPod!"  7) It's extended my love of music considerably. With my old cds, I couldn't be bothered changing cds so often. Now I can flip to any artist or genre I want so easily- and I have discovered so many new artists that I love, trying to build up my music collection, that now Simon and Garfunkel cds have replaced my Hilary Duff ones.  CONS: 1) I only have one complaint, and that's about the charger- you always need a computer handy if you want to charge your iPod, and that's not always possible. I recommend buying a power adaptor for wall outlets, as that's often easier and you don't have to leave your computer on for hours at a time. My family also travels a lot, and I like buying the wall-plug converters you can get at the airport for ten dollars, so my iPod will definitely work in every country.  I've read reviews complaining about the battery life, comfort of the earbuds, etc, but have to say that I haven't had any difficulties with these issues whatsoever. Battery life will depend on how you use your iPod (don't keep the backlight on... it's a waste of battery and really unneccessary unless you're listening to it in bed :D). And with earbuds, it's personal preference- I find them very comfortable, as does my brother (who, having limited music tastes, owns an iPod shuffle) and my friends, but if they really bother you, it's a standard headphone jack and you can fit any pair into there.  Overall, I love this thing. I take it everywhere and listen to it all the time (my parents think I'm antisocial, but I'm not really!). Apple iPods were definitely my first love.

<Date>Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you don't want to pay $299 for a regular iPod. I would go with this. It holds about 1,000 songs. I bought a silver iPod mini about a month ago. It worked perfectly. Yesterday I just exchanged it for the 20gig iPod because I wanted for room, but if you think 1,000 is enough...buy this. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>I got my silver 2nd generation 4gig last month. The sound quality is great and I'll end up being able to hold around 850 songs with my better quality files.  Battery life is good-- around 15 hours with some backlight use in my experience. I wouldn't have bought a first gen mini with only 8 hours of power at most.  A great buy if you know you'll use it a lot. If not, get a Shuffle.

<Title>Be sure to get the extended warranty
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**Note: this is a review of the 1st gen Ipod mini bought from the Apple store**  I recieved one of the 1st Ipod minis as a birthday gift from my girlfriend. At first I thought it was great. The user interface for this MP3 player is remarkable and intuitive. More than enough songs fit on it and it looks cool. Unfortunately, it broke as soon as the warranty period was up (one year). Considering how much it cost and then to only work for one year at that price I don't feel like it's worth the money. Now my entire music collection is in proprietary Apple formats. I'm trapped in iTunes with no way out and I have all of these useless ipod accessories I can't use. I just read where the new ipod nano has a screen so fragile it breaks when you put it in your pocket. Take it from me, the Ipod is a trendy piece of crapware. Avoid it at all costs or at least get the extended warranty.

<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I LOVEE MY IPOD MINI!!! I bought mine right before Apple foolishly discontinued them. The size is perfect for me, not too small like the new nano while not being too big either, as the the original seems to be. The design is sleek and high quality, whch serves it's purpose much more efficiantly then some of the other plastic cased ipods. I do, though, strongly recommend a case for security and protection purposes. I personally love the Iskin, which is availible somewhere here on Amazon. The sound quality on the Ipod mini is wonderful as well. Also, a major plus on the ipod brand is the huge selection of accesories, ranging from speakers to chargers to cases. This is my first mp3 player, however I have experienced other mp3 players from family and friends, and without a doubt, prefer the ipod mini to any other. It's completely beautiful! I honestly am a total music junkie after purchasing the ipod, and take it EVERYWHERE I go! Stop reading this and buy one if you really want an incredible music experience!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Good deal, but get a nano
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod last March (ten months ago) and have been pretty happy with it.  The music quality is good, iTunes is quite easy to use,transferring songs to the iPod (USB 2.0) is fast, and so is ripping from CDs or converting from wma format.  The clickwheel is really easy to use-- once you get used to it.  (It took me about two weeks).  The headphones are really nice, fit perfectly into my ear.  The skip protection is really good.  Browsing songs is easy, and although the games aren't that great, who buys these things for the games?  Nice display-- the reason I got this over the shuffle.  The volume range is good, whether you like to deafen yourself, or conserve your eardrums (like me).          Unfortunately, the music is hard drive based, so the songs sometimes just...stop.  When this happens, I have to reset the iPod (toggle the hold switch on and off, then hold MENU and select (center button) simultaneously for six seconds) and sometimes the song that froze can't be played again until I reset the thing a few more times.  The iPod also takes a long time to warm up, depending on how long since it was last on (anywhere from 2-15 seconds).  And here is my second biggest gripe (after the stopping): the battery life.  I've kept my backlight off the whole time, and I've never gotten more than twelve hours of battery life, versus the advertised 18.  Also, loading songs from iTunes store takes a long time, which is to be expected, but still...      My advice is to get a 2GB nano over a 4GB mini, unless you're really budgeting and NEED that 4 Gigs.  However, I do think that this product was worth my money.

The only surprise I had was that apple does nt provide the s/w to transfer songs across PCs while you use the iPod with multiple PCs. You can download freewares like iPod to PC, but I feel apple should be packaging this along with their bundled s/w.

<Title>Good for listening to songs...terrible battery power
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This ipod is a good ipod, it sounds great, it holds just the right amount of songs, and I love this thing to death. I take it everywhere with me. The only thing I don't like about this is that the battery power on this is the worst thing ever. It says that the batter lasts 8 hours. I get about 4 hours if I'm lucky. I sent it back for $50 for shipping for them to replace my batter and when I got it back....it did absolutely nothing. It is just the same, the batter doesn't last. So that was a waste of $50 right there. The ipod mini is the only ipod that i have heard that has these battery problems. 2 other friends of mine that have this same ipod have batter problems too. All of the other ipods are fine. I don't recommend you buy this item. I am glad that they don't make this anymore. Buy an ipod nano if you only want to spend around $200, they are much better and they don't have battery problems. The only thing taht is bad about the nano's is that they hold only half of the songs, 500. the ipod mini holds 1000. I like this ipod a lot except for the battery. Otherwise this is a very good product.

<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this product is the best buy i have ever made. the sound quality is great (in large speakers), and it is great! PROS -perfect weight(not too heavy, but doesnt feel like plastic crap) -nice looks -holds tons of music (i have had it for 6 months and it's still not halfway full! Cons the only cons are these- -really cruddy headphones (apple should just put more expensice headphones in the package) -there is a glitch in the software so sometimes it won't play some songs- you just plug it into the computer and it's fixed. tjis would be a problem if you didnt have a computer nearby. THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE TO ME.  the pros completely outweigh the cons... this is a great product.  Congrats, Apple. you did a good job.

<Title>As usual, Apple scores again
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod has been an extreme success over the past two years and it seems no matter what competition comes in, Apple is still going to win.  This is the second edition of the iPod mini. It still has the same, durable, and fashionable design, and the easy click wheel to navigate from music to the calendar to the games.  The battery life is up to 18 hours, which is excellent. Some other MP3 players won't even last 5 hours, which is pretty lame becuase you need (or as I'm agreed with) at least 5 hours of playback.  The sound quality is very decent. Not the best sound quality, but still has bass and clear treble to it.  The price has been lower to $199, but still, the price seems a bit overpriced...as most 4 GB MP3 players are lower priced.  Another big drawback is that the AC adapter and the FireWire cable is unincluded. THis means you need to pay an extra $50 for these needed accessories. Also, the iPod Mini can ONLY be used with iTunes, though, iTunes is a nice software, if you haven't used it before, re-iding your tracks will become a pain.  Also, as most people know, all iPods are FM tuner free. This is poor because 80% of MP3 players out now have some tuner in it.  Overall, the iPod may not have FM tuner, the decent sound, stylish design, game features, and a strong battery life to be happy about. If you really careless about a radio tuner, and have some cash on hand, the iPod Mini is a fantasic choice.

<Title>nice MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is pretty nice if you can afford the price.   Touch wheel: simple to use, but takes some time to learn how it works. 4.5/5  Battery: lasts long, but I hate the fact that it has to be recharged when the battery runs out unlike my muvo n200 where I can just put in a new AAA battery when the battery runs out. I've also heard that you have to pay $100.00 to send it to apple when the battery dies to get it replaced. I hope that never happens to my ipod. 4/5  Design: The design is awsome! My silver ipod looks sweet in it's black silcon case. 5/5  apple support: this is kind of where the ipod lacks. $50.00 for a phone call with apple! $50.00 JUST to talk to apple represenatives. Apple should lower the cost of talking to a rep to about...nothing. 1/5  Overall: Overall The ipod is a sleek device that holds tons of music and while I would have liked to be able to use music match to transfer music to my ipod instead of itunes, i'll live. 4.3/5

<Title>I know how great the iPod mini is! Do you?
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Alot of people have used the iPod mini but you don't know how great it is until you go and buy one. I was decideing over this and the Zen Micro and I'm very glad I chose the iPod mini. The thing I did'nt like about the zen, was it was alot harder to use then the iPod mini. Some people say the battery doesn't last the full 18 hrs. but if you don't use all of the setting (backlit, EQ) then it should. Also, when you aren't using the clickwheel and you are listing switch the hold button on it saves more power also. The music on this also sounds great, it is also very easy to use. Another good thing about the iPod mini is that you use the same cable to charge and transfer songs. The people at my apple store said it wouldnt work on my computer because I didn't have a USB 2.0 card but it still works. Just make sure you get this at Wal-Mart so you can buy the 3 Year replacement plan for about $17. Instead of paying about $60 for applecare that only extends it 1 more year and only cover the battery if it is 50% depleated. I didn't see this online at Wal-Mart but they had it in store. If you can show me a better music player you would have to make a new one. The iPod mini is great I have owned other Creative and RCA brand mp3 players and many CD players and this is the best music player out there. So what else can they do to make this better beside add a color screen? It is small, light, thin, looks good, sounds good, battery last long, and easy to use there is alot more but can't type all of it here. So if you can try this model of the iPod and if you like it but it and give it a shot and I'm 99.9% sure you will love it.   P.S.- I'm just a kid I DON'T work for apple in case you were wondering.

<Title>Apple should redesign the iPod
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod is a fairly recent product from Apple, and it's like a bank of songs at the size of about an inch.  It's become extremely popular, and its concept intrigued me, so I decided to buy one, and yes, they are great, but I do see some possibilities that Apple could use to improve it once it gets redesigned.  The iPod puts portable CD-players into shame, as well as makes downloading music a much better option, since you won't really need CDs afterward.  Just insert a compact disk into your computer, import the songs off and get them on iTunes, charge your iPod, and listen to some of your music all you want.  It's really that simple.  There are even some games that you can play if you get tired of listening to music, including Brick, Music Quiz, Parachute, and Solitaire.  The iPod even possesses a clock and a calendar to keep track of time.  PROS:  - iPods can carry plenty of songs for you to listen to.  Even an iPod mini, like the one I'm reviewing, can hold up a whole ton of songs; the larger one can carry five times as many songs as a Mini (20 GB), while the tiny Shuffle contains 512 MB. - They're extremely portable. - As said earlier, sparing some money on buying CD's at a store over downloading them becomes a better idea because you won't really be needing the CDs themselves after you've got an iPod. - They come with their own headphones. - The power lasts for 18 hours. - You charge this music player (which is free) without having to go out and buy batteries for it. - Great sound quality.  Even my copy of Licensed to Ill (recorded in 1986) sounds fresh and new.  CONS:  - The controls could be much better.  To turn it on, you need to click the center button; turning it off is much worse, as you need to hold the play/pause button for a couple of seconds to do so.  There should be an on/off button, instead.  Scrolling is done by rubbing your finger around the circle.  This innovative feature can be solved quickly, but you'll need to get used to it. You can only use it if you have iTunes on your computer. - If you bring this along on a trip and it runs out of juice, you can't charge it back up unless you also brought with you a laptop with iTunes on it (the iPod is charged by its own adapter, not a plug). - At $200, an iPod Mini looks overpriced, considering its small size. - The life may be long, but often, you only listen to your iPod for a short time, turn it off, come back to it again after a while, and a huge chunk of battery life is gone!  Annoying. - Primitive-looking graphics (the least important con, but it still makes the games a lot less fun).  Overall, the concept of the iPod is brilliant, so it's no wonder people are really buying into these things, but Apple needs to redesign it to improve the simple shortcomings it has.  Still though, this is a great purchase, so buy one now if you haven't already.

<Title>power packed in a little package 
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Mini is so much more than a music player. I had never had like a mp3 player before but a lot of people like at my school and stuff did so I decieded to look into one as my birthday present. When my parents asked why I didn`t choose something like an iRiver or Creative I said because I knew the iPod was better.    First, It has on of the BEST music systems called "iTunes". iTunes is very easy to understand and learn about. I got my iPod on a Thursday and by Saturday I was a pro at using the system! You can take things off CDs or purchase songs from iTunes. The only down side of the product is that you have to have a computer with a USB 2.0. The USB is that bad but the thing is that if you go on a vacation and have no computer that you can plug it into you need to have a adapter that can charge it.    Once when I dropped it out running, it only scratched a little on the pavement. The belt clip doesn`t hold it that well so don`t really TRUST  it when you want to go for a run. Try the sports sleeve.   Overall, the product is GREAT!   It has tons of extras like note pads and calendars.   FIVE STARS

<Title>Boo!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Why get an iPod when you could get a Creative Zen 5 GB.  You have to send the iPod's battery back in every 1-2 years and pay $100 for it when the Zen has a battery that you can take out and put a new one at home. The Zen costs $199.99. Look it up on amazon and don't buy this.

<Title>Is it supposed to break this much?
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>first off, you should know that, despite my 2 star rating, this mp3 player is actually quite good.  it has great sound quality and is a breeze to use.  However, about 6 months after getting this player, it just died on me.  OK, no biggie; i took it in for repairs and they gave a me a brand new one.  Great.  the replacement worked fine...for about 3 months. now, it has broken for the second time, and I'm going to have to drive it back to the Apple Store for repairs or a replacement. i think that this player is great, but something that costs so much and is such a hassle to get fixed should not break down for no apparent reason so often. i could have given this mp3 player a 5 star rating, but not when it is shutting down sporadically all the time. and since the support website basically tells you to check your iPod again or reinstall something, there is no choice but to take it back to the store.  you should probably get the more reliable iPod 10GB or 20GB if you want an Apple mp3 player without the trouble.

<Title>Simply a delight to own and use
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Mini is a wonderful little gadget.  I bought the original iteration 16 months ago and have used it just about every day, either when working out at the gym or when walking around on my lunch hour, daily train commute, etc.  It has performed flawlessly with only one caveat that I learned to be very leary of the hard way:  charging iPod using my USB port.    I always use the wall charger since one night when I left it on overnight and it wiped the iPod completely.  When my computer went into sleep mode, for some reason the system thought I was trying to disconnect iPod from the charger without properly ejecting it using the iTunes interface.  I got this warning several times with no ill effect, and would just turn it off, until one day when I took it off the USB port and when I got to work, there were absolutely no songs on it.  At all.  This was mostly a time inconvenience as I don't store absolutely everything I ever download solely on my iPod, but I still had to reconstruct a lot of information.   Unless you are prepared to change your computer settings to turn the sleep function totally off while you charge or keep waking up your computer, don't hook it up to the USB port.  Pay extra for the wall charger and you'll be glad you did.  I would also strongly recommend the purchase of the optional headphones with silicone earbuds (comes with three different-size earbud cover options).  The regular headphones offered with the iPod were positively painful, which is definitely something that Apple could work on.

<Title>not for anyone on the go
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The battery life is awful. The first one I bought lasted about 2.5 hours, even though I was very careful to follow the instructions because I'd heard that it could be a problem. I returned it before the first 30 days were up and got a new one. It seemed to be much better at around 5 hours of use, but has since declined to around 4.  The controls are also incredibly difficult to use with any accuracy. I thought I would get used to spinning the wheel, but I continue to have trouble selecting exactly what I want if I am walking or doing anything other than sitting at my desk.  I had two Rio sports before this one and thought I'd be better off with more capacity but it's turned out to be a great disappointment.

<Title>There is a reason behind the phenomenon...
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>About iPods: They change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,000 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.   In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.  About the new mini:  It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.  The wheel and click input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.  Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.   Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...  Enjoy!

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I recently bought a green iPod mini for my birthday and I LOVE IT! I used to have a iPod shuffle and it was okay but this is so much better. The screen is awesome. One thing though is that it doesn't really hold 4 gigs . . . I don't think. In the information on the iPod it says that the capacity is 3.7 gigs. Well whatever I still love it. Is is so small and easy to use with the click wheel. iTunes is very easy to use in transporting songs onto the iPod. It takes less than a second to transport one song. You just drag the song onto the iPod icon. But I highly recommend getting a case! It can scratch really easily (so I've heard). If you get a case with no screen protector you should (need!!!!!) to cut out a piece of plastic out from the case's case and insert it in front of the screen. Does that make since? All in all this is the best freaking thing ever!

<Title>PIECE OF CRAP!
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had mine for about a month, and it worked fine....until one day, I was uploading songs into it, and it just erased everything! My ipod's music disappeared, and I couldn't upload my music again because my ipod wouldnt appear on the uploading software.  I tried a different computer, reinstalled the uploading software (Itunes), updated Itunes to current version, reset my ipod...and nope...it did NOT do squat..so now I'm screwed with a piece of crap that doesn't wanna work.  I read different Ipod FAQ websites, and I couldnt find any useful info.  It appeared to me that A LOT of ppl have A LOT of problems with these things.  A friend of mine also told me that he had to buy a new Ipod because his messed up.  There's a lot of cool MP3/music players out there..BUT...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF ROTTEN APPLE IPOD CRAP! I assure you that you will have problems with it within a couple months from purchase.

<Title>READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THIS PIECE OF JUNK
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I know this is just one more review out of many, but I'll be very honest about this product.        A college buddy has an Ipod photo with a 40 gb capacity. I see him everyday and I notice how much he enjoys it. So, I decided to be in the "in-crowd" and bought myself an Ipod just a couple of weeks ago. The price in the first place is a killer. I mean, consider that all the ipod mini has as accessories in the box is an usb cable, earphones, and a belt clip.       I started my first problem by purchasing this product without me having a pc that has Windows 2000 or higher. Mine is Windows 98. So I still bought it, since my sister has a compatible computer. But then I thought it was such a hassle to be going back and forth, as the Ipod is very reliant on a computer and itunes. Just today (and the reason for this review) is that it froze for 4 hours and the battery got drained. How was I going to fix this problem? Well, according to the Apple website, you have to connect it to the computer and do something with itunes, which I don't have at hand. So now I wonder, "What If I take it to a party, hook it up to the DJ system, and the ipod freezes? What if I'm on a 3 day trip somewhere outhere and this happens?" I was hoping to replace my listening to cd's with the Ipod, but I guess that won't happen. The Ipod away from a computer is like a knight without his  horse. You can't even delete unwanted files from the unit without being connected and itunes running, how pathetic is that?         Another thing that I find annoying from the ipod is that the files are named different from how you want them. For example, my file, it being "Baby's Gang - America" is named as baby baby track 17.  I'm sorry but I'm a perfectionist and I like my files to be named artist first and song name second. This means I have to delete the song and delete the ID3 tag. I was very dissapointed by this.         On the other hand, the controls are hard to use. You are always skipping through the song you want to play. It feels like you are playing at Chuck E Cheese at one of those games where you have to stop the light at a certain spot. Just by touching the control wheel makes the volume control appear, so the volume is always fluctuating. If you forget to use the hold button, the ipod tends to turn on accidently, thus draining your battery. The equalizer sucks as well, as you can't set the bass or treble the way you like them to sound; they are already preset.         The battery performance is a big let-down. It only lasts about two hours at full charge. Now, think that I've only had it for two weeks, and used it for 5 days. What idiot coudn't make the ipod dependent on replaceable batteries (AA, or AAA, or even those 9 volt batteries)? If you don't want to spend more money, then you will have to settle with charging your ipod at your computer, and you can't even play it as it charges. I wish I would had known this before I bought it.         So right now my ipod sits at my desktop waiting to be returned to Target. I will get charged a 15% restocking fee, meaning 32 dollars but I rather pay this than get migranes. It is truly a trendy, nice looking, state of the art device, but inside are encased many imperfections that I wish I had found out about before making the big investment (my mom thought it was worth around 5 dollars by just looking at it). The LCD screen is quite bright and the font is sharp, and before I scratch it or drop and break it, I want to get rid of it. I guess I will go back to the stone age and keep playing my cd's on my 30 dollar car cd player, which sounds truly rich by the way.       My friends want to get one, but I will suggest them to purchase something else. This thing is truly not worth the price. You will go through many hassles, according to other reviews, and who knows, maybe tomorrow they are completely forgotten. I'm a soundphile, and I agree it sort of delivers crisp sound, but I like to listen to my music without problems. Now I'm waiting for my exams to be over so I can find the time to drive to Target and get my money back. There are many alternatives outhere so, please consider them before you purchase yourself a 3.6 oz. of dissapointment

<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have gotten this mini twice now. And both times, I had to return it because it only lasts for up to 2 hours. For an item that supposed to last to 18 hours, I feel I was cheated when it only lasted for 2. I returned this to Amazon and bought from Apple directly. I still have the same problem. Only 2 hours. If I didn't like the design of the mini so much, I would just get rid of it altogether.

<Title>Apple a rip off
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Think twice before getting this machine!  I was looking for convience and the ability to load CD's with protected music for play.  iTunes does that.  But the mini is trash, real trash.  The software is hard to use, it doesn't always reconize the Mini is hooked up, and there is no total wipe of the drive if you wanted that option.  THEN the battery starts at around 8 hrs (NOT 18) and is going down.  Yesterday it totally froze up on me and I could not turn it off.  So it drained the battery.  I hooked it up to the computer overnight, and yet this morning it told me to "do not disconnect".  Well it played today but what about tomorrow.  I find it also annoying that there is not an on/off switch.  Like one other reader, the hold button is the only function which prevents the system from being sensitive while moving it around.  In addition, I get static in the left ear piece, the sound is not all that great, and if you accidently disconnect the earphones, the system goes to pause.  Which means, you have to turn off the hold key, press the pause key, get the music back and then hit hold again.  DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DO ALL OF THIS?  Maybe they get a bad-batch in?  It appears my problems are consistent with other people to test this theory.  Oh, and one writer is correct.  Not having external batterys is annoying when the system dies and you are on the metro in a longgggg commute!  Good luck in your choice!

<Title>The iPod mini
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned my iPod for about half a year now, and I half to say that I enjoy it. The sound quality is better than that of iTunes on my computer. It's pretty much the only mp3 player that integrates usability, simplicity, and convienence with style and sophistication. Plus the click wheel is simply ingenious.  However, I have several complaints. First of all, the metal outside is very easily damaged and dented. I dropped my iPod (in its case!) once on a non-concrete surface, and the corner dented a bit. Another thing is that the click wheel gets dirty. Another problem is the battery - it runs out relatively fast, and obviously, replacing it is inevitable (but IMO, only apple's scheme to get money).  I wrote the following for an ebay sale of my iPod mini. I thought it might be helpful for a lot of people.  iPod 4GB really only holds less than 3.7GB. Apple defined GB as something bigger than it actually is (like instead of 1024kb per mb they did 1000... or something like that). Plus there are already installed programs on iPod. Charge - 2 (80% full) hours or 4 hours (100% full) Battery life - Apple claims 18 hours, but in reality it's nowhere close. 	Tips on the battery: 		Don't use backlight unless needed; backlight kills battery. Wait until your battery is out, and then charge overnight to full capacity (this is my own theory; I think it works because supposedly rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (ie the iPod one/rechargeable batteries in general) run longer this way.) Use iPod regularly (helps the battery stay alive, the Li-ion works better) Fast forward reduces battery. iPod can be used as a USB (look for enable disk use in iTunes), so if you have an iPod you wont need a USB drive. iPod can open and read text documents (see users manual), and this helps if I need something to read/have something that I need to refer to often. Music file format - AAC, MP3, Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, WAV Using iTunes, you can convert almost any format (e.g. wma, midi) into AAC or another iPod-compatible format iPod supposedly crashes easier when it has to deal with more than one format, so convert everything into one format iPod can be used with regular computer speakers. Lots of people don't know this, so they go out and buy "iPod-specific" speakers which cost like $100+. So don't. Get a nice set of computer speakers, and you can listen to your iPod anywhere there's a power source. iPod and hearing loss. I play violin quite a bit, and as a result I'm going partially deaf in my left ear. Because of this, I take special care of my ears while listening to iPod. Recording studios record everything, and this includes the extremely high pitches that the human ear can't hear. These high pitches make your ear drum vibrate extremely fast... which causes more damage than regular pitches. Luckily you can control this on your iPod in several ways. What I do is that in iTunes, I control the EQ settings so that any sounds 16kHz (the high ones) are reduced. You can also choose the "treble reducer" EQ setting on iPod, but this reduces battery a bit. I also recommend getting a set of noise-reducing headphones (NOT earbud headphones like the iPod ones). That way, you can listen to your iPod at a much lower volume in a loud environment.

<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>18 days after I got it as a gift, it went totally dead.  The "Applecare" people didn't care.  They offered to send me a new one for $30 unless I wanted to buy the extended warranty for $60.  They had no other advice.  Having personally experienced that Apple's first- and second-tier phone/email customer service is often wrong, I took the iPod to the local Apple store.  The "Genius" got it up and running in a flash and offered a simple act of preventative maintenance on my Mac to get the iPod running again.    So, I've changed the iPod's score from the original 1 star to 4 stars.

<Title>Praise from a holdout
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was certain that iPods couldn't be nearly as good as everyone kept saying.  I was certain it was all hype.  I was wrong.  With a couple of exceptions -- about which more in a moment -- this is really the best MP3 player I've ever used.  And I have gone through a lot of them looking for the right one, believe me.  The capacity, the sound quality, the way ease of use (generally) is superior to most of the other players I've tried.  The matte case is superior to the awful, shiny case on the 60Gb iPod photo which starts to look funky if you breathe hard on it.  (Yes, on the strength of the mini, I bought a big iPod.  It's that good!)  Even the price, which I originally found both prohibitive and inexplicable, considering prices for similar-sized units on the market, makes more sense to me when I see how much better the iPod is than the cheaper models.  There's very little I don't like about this iPod mini.  But...  Major gripe: The earbuds.  Who designed these and why has s/he not been run out of town on a rail?  Maybe it's just my ears, but these things don't remotely stay put for more than a couple of minutes.  And when I'm working out?  No way they stay in my ears.  None.  I've had to resort to snap-on adaptors from Griffin which hold them more firmly in the ear canal.   Minor annoyance: I'm not nuts about iTunes, and trying to load tracks onto the iPod is often cause for tooth-grinding.  Minor annoyance which may be attributable to my ignorance: I have not yet figured out how to make tracks play in order.  Mostly this isn't a problem, but there are some albums which really should be played that way.  Abbey Road comes to mind here. Minor annoyance which is certainly partly attributable to my being a dork:  That click wheel is sometimes a little TOO responsive, and I occasionally find myself looking at a totally unfamiliar menu and saying "Huh?"  Making it a touch less sensitive might be a good idea for some of us.  As you can see, these are all relatively small problems, and nothing that would keep me from investing in iPods again.  In fact, I've been so spoiled by my mini and my iPod photo, that I can hardly use the others anymore.  Yes, they are.  They are that good.

<Content>ipod mini is my favourite of all of the ipods because it is so sleek and simple. the majority of other mp3 players are not easy to get the hang of and are too bulky PLUS you have too carry them everywhere or put them in your pocket (which can scratch them or get them quite dirty).  pros -the click wheel. whoever created it was a genius, it is so easy to use and unlike other mp3 players were you keep on clicking the buttons 500 times to get to the bottom of your song list you can just rotate your fingers pretty fast and your there. -size. god the size is so small and sleek for something with 4 gigs but not so skinny that it will snap in your pocket (previos experiences with ipod nanos). -the tin cover. unlike other ipods the mini has a light tin cover instead of plastic which makes it so much harder to see scratches.  cons -you've probably heard this a few times but you need to use itunes so you cant use any other type of music player but that isnt so bad cos itunes is good.  if you are a music freak that likes about 500 different bands then you should get a normal ipod because 1000-1500 songs might not be enough (trust me my sis used up 1500 songs in like the first 2 days of buying hers). under absoulutely NO curcumstances buy the ipod nano because it is so skinny it just snapps in your pocket. i guess if you are not a music freak but you want an mp3 player you should buy another brand of mp3 player instead of getting an ipod shuffle because an ipod shuffle dosn't have any of the pros i just listed for the mini and you could get a different brand of mp3 player for less money.  overall i love my ipod mini and if you listen to music casually but you arent one of those dyhard freaks then you should buy an ipod mini (like me).

<Title>My Favorite Christmas Gift
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was so happy to get my iPod Mini for Christmas! This is my first venture into the land of the iPod and so far I have not been disappointed. I love that it's so easy to use! It is super easy to download my cd's on to and the sound quality is awesome. It's hard to believe that something so small can hold so much music, be so durable and so user friendly. This is by far the best gift I've received in a long, long time.

<Title>Just say "No" to Mini's
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Screen is small and you can't see very well.  Color on mine chipped.  iTunes would delete my songs, leaving me from 105 songs to 5 songs.  Not a good product.  Ended up returning it after a long struggle of trying to fit the USB cord in it.  Restless of trying to fiddle with it, I brought it back and relized there was no refund.  Actually, they wanted me to pay THEM for me returning it!  Ha, yeah right.    As the iPod Video came out, I thought it would be junk, seeing as how unhappy I was with my iPod Mini.  My husband wanted one, though, so I purchased one (this time making sure there was a good return policy).  That thing is 10x better!  I actually envy it and hope to get one of my own.  Look for a Nano or a Video if you're going to spend 200 - 400 dollars on an mp3 player you want to last.

<Title>iPod mini
<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own both a mini and a 20GB iPod, and I have to say I LOVE my mini.  The 4GB will hold close to 1,000 songs, and is perfect to take running, biking or to the gym. The only reason I didn't give the mini 5 stars is becuse of the short battery life (about 4 hours).   Not only is the mini perfect for workouts, when combined with a good set of speakers (I went with the JBL Creature speakers--too cute for words) it basically makes your stereo obsolete.  I even use it in the car!

<Title>Believe the hype: well worth the price.
<Date>Sun Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Forget all of the 1-star reviews, this mp3 player is top notch.  Pros:  Excellent design - easily fits in any pocket. Great navigation system - The menu is very simple to use (unlike that of the Rio Carbon) and the click wheel is very handy and easy to use. Great sound quality - No static issues, everything sounds near-CD quality. iTunes is very simplistic, fast transfer speeds Great build  Cons:  Subpar battery life - It doesn't last the whole 18 hours, and even then that's mediocre for a Microdrive player, and no replacable battery Bad Apple Service - 50 bucks per call, the Apple support site is hard to navigate The colors on the new generation are slightly gaudy, no big deal.  About the people who give this 1 star:  Here's how you find the maximum battery life: Put the volume in the middle, plug the headphones on, and start from the first song (not on shuffle) and don't touch it. I have a first generation mini which is supposed to last 8 hours, and the tests got 8 hours and 25 minutes. The backlight, EQ's, fidgeting with the controls all the time, not using the hold switch will deplete your battery.  If it freezes, reset it by holding down Menu and the select button for about 2 seconds.  If you are away from your computer, you can still plug it into a PC or Mac and it will charge, and you can unplug it when it says do not disconnect because no files are being affected. If you aren't near a computer, just buy the 1st gen (if you can live without 10 extra hours of battery) so you can get the AC adapter and the Firewire cord.  About people who copmplain about the earbuds: They're crappy stock earbuds, what do you expect? Apple included them because they're cheap, and if you really care about your iPod listening experience, get something nicer like Sony Fontopias. Don't judge the iPod on the earbuds. And the sad thing is, they're one of the better stock earbuds out there.  If you want to hold a small music collection, this is the perfect mp3 player. If you can't live with FM radio, color screen, or photos, consider the iRiver instead, but if you just want a thousand songs in a tiny device about the size of a business card, look no further.

<Title>As stylish as it is useful (Good and Bad Reasons)
<Date>Tue Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If your just a average Joe looking for the right tool to hold all your favorite songs, this is that "Right Tool" But they're still some Good reasons and Bad reasons to an Mini Ipod.   Good Reason #1  Even if your that much of a music lover, why get a 40GB Ipod or higher? (It's not like they are people out there who can afford, let alone, own 10,000 songs)   Good Reason #2  The Memory is not to little and not to much at the same time with a good price on it.   Good Reason #3  It's small, so it'll go anywhere, anytime, at anyplace you desire.   Bad Reason #1  Unless you get a warranty, the world can be a dangerious place for an Ipod Mini.   Bad Reason #2  Eventually, the battery will start dying, which means the 8-10 hours of music playing will go as low as 1-2 hours.   Bad Reason #3  Becaue of the fact that your the Mini Ipod's battery will eventually die. It will cost you about 100$ to get the Ipod's battery replaced (Same goes with every other Ipod)   Bad Reason #4  Because Ipods are in and pricy, they'res no doubt your Ipod will be a target for someone to steal. (Trust me, I know that, because I got my Mini Ipod stolen, and I have to go to court to get it back)  So my overall score would be 8.5 out of 10.

<Content>I think the Ipod mini is great! Who needs more than 1,000 songs? I love mine because it is so easy to use and control. For example downloading music is simple and fast. It is great for everyone because you can put any music you want even if it is oldies or barney. My only complaint is that my new green one only gets 3 hours of battery life and the box said 18! Anyways buy a case for protection!

<Content>Having kept away from buying this for months now, I wasn't sure what to expect.  There are so many variations out on the market and I researched this thing to death.    It really is great, with 18 hours of time now, instead of the usual 8 hours, and it stores a tremendous amount of music and anything else you want--spoken text, etc:  I put my schedule on CD--spoken, and then plug it into this--great for keeping up with stuff.    Light, easy to use, and easy on the pocket book (for what you're getting), this is THE IPod to buy.

<Content>My son bought this ipod and after 45 days the batt. does not charge anymore. We called Apple and they do not stand behind their products. They said because it was made in June (we bought it in sept.) it was out of the 90 day warranty. We have faxed the papers they have asked and it has been a week; no word on what they are going to do. We have noticed the store we bought it from has pulled all the mini's off of the shelf due to it being junk. Dont waste your money on it nor any other Apple products because they do not stand behind their products.

<Title>iPods- The Gadget of the Future
<Date>Thu Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received an iPod mini for my birthday in May of 2005 and I immediately fell in love with this little trinket. It comes in 4 shiny, luminous colors (blue, green, pink, and silver) that look astoundingly great! The sleek design isn't the only thing that makes the iPod mini the gadget of the future. They also have many other pros that come next!!!  ***PROS*** 1.) The stunning design 2.) An AMAZING battery life (works for about 14 hours non-stop for me- of course it differs if you move around with it a lot or if you use the light 3.) Something most reviewers haven't talked about- the built-in light. This helpful little gizmo makes it easy to find which song you want in the dark. You can also set how long the light stays on- 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, or Always on. Or you could make it off. This light even helps me see the screen much better in the daylight thatn without it. 4.) The STUNNING sound quality! The iPod mini has great sound which is perfect, no cutting in and out of songs or anything like that. 5.) Only one word- iTUNES!!!!! iTunes is the BEST music software on the market today and it comes free with the purchase of an iPod mini. iTunes lets you transfer songs from CDs to your iTunes library, then to your iPod. If you wish you can also purchase songs or CDs directly from iTunes but the software doesn't make you feel obligated to do so. It is just another option that you can choose. On iTunes you can also burn CDs, make playlists, and you can subscribe to Podcasts. They are like talk shows you can put directly on your iPod. Also you can listen to your songs on iTunes and their are pre-made radio stations (country, rock, rap, bluegrass, religious etc) which you can listen to for no-charge. iTunes is the greatest music software ever created. Best of all, it is very easy to do once you understand what buttons do what! iTunes also lets you rate songs and it even keeps track of what you have listened to the most and puts them into a TOP  25 MOST PLAYED playlist!!! 6.)Size- Even though this version of the iPod isn't as small as the nano, it is still as small as a credit card and very lightweight! Also, it is fatter than the nano which gives it much more protection as opposed to the nano which would break on one fall. 7.) As I just said, stability. This iPod is very stable for its size. It is much stronger than the nano. I have dropped mine a few times (which I promise you, it will happen) and haven't even gotten a scratch on it.Even so, if you still feel like it's too flimsy, you can purchase a protective cover of just about any color to put on it. 8.) The click wheel- WHAT A FANTASTIC INVENTION!!! The click wheel is so much easier to use than clicking a button OVER and OVER and OVER until you get to the right song. The click wheel makes it go much faster. 9.) All of the add-ons in the market today. They have everything from speakers, to chargers, to protective covers and back!!! 10.) If you purchase directly from the Apple store you can get the back engraved with whatever you want! I put my last name on mine but I know people could put ANYTHING they wanted on theirs!!! 11.) There are games that you can play on the iPod mini. (Brick, Music Quiz, Parachute, Solitaire) 12.) There are extras like a clock, contacts, calandar, and notes that you can put on your iPod! 13.) It has a feature where you can create ALL different types of playlists that you can make. You can have a work-out playlist, a home playlist, a car playlist, or ANY type of playlist!!!  I'm sure I am missing some but I can't think of them right now!!!  ***CONS***  1.) DOESN'T come with a wall charger. If you want one, you have to go and buy one from the store. 2.) The gold color that was in the other iPods has now been dropped and you can't buy them anymore. It was a cool color and I'm sure that I would have gotten that if it was available.  That is all the cons there was! The iPod mini is a must buy. Now I will tell you why you should buy the mini instead of the nano or the other iPods.  1.) Size- It is much smaller that the old iPods but not as flimsy as the nano. If I had a nano, I'm sure that I would break it!  2.) Cost- The mini is pretty cheap. I think that it is $200 for the 4g and $300 for the 6g or something like that.  The iPod mini is a must have for all families in America who like music. Nothing can compete with the mini when it comes to size, sound quality, coolness, stability, and many other aspects of the mini. Make sure to purchase this the next time you go to the store!!! They also make great Christmas or Birthday gifts!!!   PS- Thank you for reading this exceptionally long review. I hope it has convinced you to go and pick up a mini right now! (...) I have spent a lot of time on this so I am VERY thankful to anyone who read this entire review! Thanks a lot! And please vote to say if this review was halpful or not. That always tells me if I'm doing a good job or not!!! Thanks again!!!

<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the apple mini ipod for my 5th grade graduation (last year) and I haven't put it down since! You can buy songs from the music library and you can also purchase cads for like, $9.50. I have also heard about how u can download books onto it, I haven't tried it but it sounds cool! I do NOT recommend the plastic skin, they are very annoying to put on and take off because they grip the ipod! Also, with the plastic skin you cannot put on the ipod pants holder (you slide the ipod in to it and clip it to your pants)! The pants holder is ideal for someone who doesn't feel like holding the thing, and is convenient.  I would say that the mini ipod is the best and smartest chose over all the ipods! Sure the orignal thing can hold 50,000 songs, but that thing is chubby! Anyway, who needs 50,000 songs, you'd need to download all your cads and then to fill it up you'd need to still spend about $40,000 on songs from the music  library! Then the nano can only hold 500 songs! Sure it has color and shows you the CD cover, but WHO CARES! It also has a setting where you can download pictures, but you can't take them with it and when do you need to have pictures with you when you're listening to music? When you purchase the songs, they cost 99 cents, but they really cost $1.00(1 cent tax). You should also buy some type of speakers. They have a lot of different kinds out there. I have tried a lot of them and so far none of them seemed junky, all good quality! Any of those reviews out there that say "its too expensive, the screen breaks, or its junky" well just brain wash yourself from all of those false comments and listen to this " ITS A GREAT BUY"!  I have many friends who have it and not one single complaint! They may seem expensive, but trust me, ITS WORTH IT! Also to make your song purchases easier, get a music card and put like $50.00 into it. On the back it gives you the 3 easy step instructions on how to put the money you downloaded into the card on your ipod account. I would recommend this for someone who is 10 or older. Anyone younger may loose it or play with it the wrong way. By the way, I have dropped it several times and nothing happened! I hope my review was helpful to you and your decision (which should be YES) on if the ipod mini is good quality and worth buying!

This makes a great chistmas gift that your kids will not be able to put down. You can recharge the battery so you don't even have to buy new ones. And it comes with a clip to attach to your jeans so you don't have to hold it witch is convenient, and they come in different colors!! DEFINITLY A MUST HAVE!!

<Title>BEST MP3 PLAYER EVER!
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think this is the best music player ever created. From a kid's point of view that is. The color options are cool, and ipods alow you to put the songs you actually LIKE on to one player. No more "i have to carry a million CD's around." Buying songs off of itunes only costs 99 cents. So, if you are a parent, but his for your kid. The ipod nano (in my opinion) is way too thin, and will easily break if dropped. My friend has a black one, and there are scratches all over it, they are very visible. So the ipod mini is the best choice!

<Content>I LOVE my iPod mini. It works great, even the replacement one. Yes, replacement. In September 2005, I dropped my iPod mini while playing, and the screen froze. I reset it, but the screen wouldn't go past the iPod logo. After about 3 days of sorting this out, trying methods people recommended online, my dad decided to go to Apple. Apple would send us a box that we could put our iPod in and ship it to them, and in exchange, they would send us a new, replacement iPod. I was so happy when I got my replacement because iPods are like the best thing I've had in a really long time. Don't know how I lived without it.   4 stars. would be 5 stars except for it breaks pretty easily.

<Title>The King of All MP3 Players...Enter the iPod Mini
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I had purchased a Rio Forge Sport 256 MB MP3 Player. Someone must have slipped me a mickey when I bought that, because that was one of my worst purchases to this day. The case wasn't grounded, so the headphones kept shorting out, and something was wrong electronically, so it unexpectedly turned itself off. Rubbish.  Almost six agonizing months later, I managed to scrape together enough shekels to Get An iPod (please note the Capital Letters). Before I got mine, I shook my head, wondering who in their right mind would need 20 GB, even 4 GB of music. Now, I sing Apple's praises.  I must say, the iPod is the epitome of tr�s cool. It is the most stylish and beautifully simplistic players out there. All lesser mortals bow down to this machine, and now I understand why. The elegant, color-coordinated click wheel is simple, and relatively easy to use, finding you favorite tune. The anodized aluminum case is one of my favorite features, understated (mine is silver) yet very sexy and classy. I feel as if I could jump up and down on the iPod Mini without consequence. (You couldn't pay me to demonstrate, though)  Functionally, it's almost, ALMOST perfect. The interface is still one of the best I've experienced, allowing you to find you music quite easily. However, the click wheel can be a little petulant for me at times, sometimes overshooting what I want, and sometimes being sluggish, even when I whip my digits around the white track fast enough to conjure up thoughts of carpal thumb and gangrene.   Let's get to the best part; sound quality. The sound quality is the best I've heard out of any MP3 player. The only complaint I have is the second day I used the iPod, I heard a faint crackling in both sides of the Sennheiser earbuds while listening to a song. A few days later, using different earphones on my laptop, running iTunes, I heard the same thing. Is this a problem with the proprietary Apple software and iPod firmware? Anyway, this problem went away, and I'm still very, very pleased with the sound. It is phenomenal. My last niggle (I always seem to find something to complain about...)would have to be the loose fitting of the Sennheiser earbuds. It allows a lot of ambient noise to come in. I do own Sony Fontopia Earbuds with Anti-Bacterial Earpieces or the Bass Boost earbuds, but you can't beat the mystique and flash factor of those characteristic white earbuds. It's like a sign that says in huge letters, "Yes, I'm cool and I have an iPod" I'll wait and eventually replace those Sennheisers with Sony Fontopia White earbuds...  iTunes is fairly simple and straightforward to use, though with my notebook computer, I find that I must plug in the iPod before booting up, or iTunes will not recognize the iPod mini, instead displaying it as "Offline". This is maddening, but I can imagine desktop users don't have to deal with this.   Though not perfect, it is, I think, one of the best MP3 players on the market today. I unhesitatingly reccommend audiophiles everywhere to plunk the $189-199 for this machine. It is absolutely worth it!

<Title>disappointment
<Date>Mon Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Ipod Mini has several problems.  First, when you lose power completely, you can't charge it by connecting it to your USB 2.0 port through your computer.  The USB 2.0 can't power a completely dead IPOD MINI, but it can charge up a low battery one.    Second, when you lose power completely, the Ipod Mini doesn't remember its settings.  So if you turned off the annoying clicking sound, it will come back because the click is apart of the "default" settings.  Third, the scroll wheel is not as sturdy as the 20gb or 60 gb models.

<Title>I Love My iPod mini! But it is right for YOU?
<Date>Mon Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are several mp3 players on the market right now for different people. Before I bought my iPod mini, I had a Rio Cali mp3 Player. I liked it, but very quickily I ran out of space. I downloaded about one song every other day, and after awhile, there was no space left!  For me, it was obvious that a larger mp3 player size was needed. I needed lots of space to store all of my CD's and old mp3 files.  Just to clear things up, one megabyte is about one minute. My old Cali had (i think) 126 megabytes. You can get the iPod mini in either 4 gigabytes (which is 4000 megabytes) or 6 gigabytes (which is 6000 megabytes).  So really the question is: What will you be doing with your mp3 player? Check out the chart below.  YOU SHOULD BUY AN IPOD MINI IF:  - You want to have a good amount of space to store songs.  - You want to have a very flashy mp3 player.  - You love to listen to music.  - You are willing to pay a somewhat large amount of money.  - You have around 10-20 CD's you want to change to mp3 files.  YOU SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER MP3 PLAYERS (such as the Rio Cali) IF:  - You want a good mp3 player that holds songs, but will not have too much unused space.  - You don't want to spend too much on an mp3 player.  - You will only download a song or two every two weeks.  - You have a few CD's you want to have on one mp3 player  YOU SHOULD BUY AN IPOD (regular iPod) IF:  - You are a HUGE hardcore listener of music.  - You are willing to pay around $300 on an mp3 player.  - You will download one or two songs a day.  - You have tons and tons of CD's that you want to have on one mp3 player.  The bottom line is that I love my iPod mini - it's perfect for me. But the question is, what mp3 Player is good for you?

<Title>Don't buy an iPod
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just returned my iPod to the Apple Store... no refund, no exchange simply left it at the store. This is the worst piece of electronic I hav EVER purchased and my first and last Apple product.   In a nut-shell... the iPod would skip what was downloaded from iTunes... go figure, another Apple product. I have reset the factory settings numerous times, reloaded the software... I sync it with my PC and it works briefly, only to start skipping again. And, of course, when I bring it in today (the 3rd time) it works, so there's NOTHING Apple can do, except to advice me to come back when it happens again.  Well, that's it for me and Apple. I don't have the time, nor the energy to keep going back to the store whenever the iPod "acts up".  Jan

<Title>LOVE my iPod Mini
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a gadget girl, and my iPod Mini is one of my prized gadgets.  While I admit I am quite an Apple girl and didn't consider another player, I love it for running and I have had wonderful luck with it not skipping in my arm band.    Only two gripes:  I had to replace the in-ear headphones because they got totally blasted.  And, I really hate all of the FM transmitters I have attempted to use.  The only sufficient method I have had in using it in my car has been the tape player (who has a tape deck anymore??) and in my new MINI Cooper I paid a ridiculous $150 to have a dock installed into the stereo.  Totally worth it as it runs through the stereo controls (and the sound is amazing!!) but almost as expensive as the iPod.  Oh well.  If you are a runner or plan to use it for other types of exercise, I recommend highly the remote.  It is simple to change the song or adjust the volume.

<Title>Great Mp3 player
<Date>Mon Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I mainly bought this because it was so popular. A suggestion, DON'T BUY FROM ANYWHERE ELSE THAN A REAL STORE LIKE APPLE. My first one that I bought off ebay had the touch wheel broken and skipped like crazy. My new one from apple performs flawlessly. It is so light and music transfers extremely fast. If you are going on a trip, this is a MUST! The battery lasts so long (18 hours) I have Altec Speakers/Dock/Charger and another charger, so I don't worry about charging. I don't use the USB way of charging. Nothing about it that I don't like, except that it could have a lot more features for the price.

<Title>An MP3 Player for the ages
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A long time ago, I used to heckle the IPODs. "I'd never get one of those! I don't wanna be searching through hundreds of songs just to find the one I want to listen to."   I thought settling for a regular MP3 player would suit me and it did...for awhile. It didn't dawn on me that I would be replacing a triple A battery a couple of times a month. It was then one day my girlfriend had mentioned IPOD and the cool things you could do like catergorize your songs into folders.   It was at that instant, I decided to go out and find one with her. By chance, she and I managed to buy the last two remaining IPODs at the Apple store. Immediately, I fell in love with this little trinket. All the CD's in my room fit into this little gadget and the rechargable battery was great.   It is a tad bit heavy, but it doesn't bother me. The only thing you have to be careful about is not dropping it. It's slim size could easily fall out of your hand such as the NANO that was just released recently.   I have conformed myself into APPLEism; it's pretty fun.

<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My kids bought this for me for Mother's Day.  I was eyeing a new mp3 player because my old cheap one had like 11 songs and chewed up batteries like crazy.  I love this!  More songs than you can listen to!  I create playlists for workouts, work-time, and more.  Your mood can change many times and you'll have music to suit each one!  It has a long battery life and is easy to learn to use.   It's tempting to buy lots of songs from the Apple store, too, but they're only 99 cents, so even if you have no cd's to copy, you can get some tunes pretty cheaply.

<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Now this is still the best mp3 player around, I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  I have the blue iPod mini and I love it just as much.  We both use it in the car, at home, at work and on trips.  I have the Logitech 22mm speakers for travel and the iTrip for car travel - I even have a hardwired solution for our cars that allows direct playback through the stereo.  The iTrip is only used for rental cars or if we're in someone else's car.  The quality and reliabilty is excellent, I honestly just think the other manufacturers are way behind when it comes to the usabilty factor and the clickwheel menu is the only way to go.  Just couldn't be happier - and I like this way better than the Nano, I feel the sound is better after I tested both with the same headphones at the Apple Store.

<Title>iPod mini...Amazing Gadget
<Date>Sat Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini is an invention that has taken over the gadget world. With its amazing database and compact size, it's no wonder why every person should not own one. Consumers should consider purchasing this product if they are still using a portable CD player. The differences between the two are out of this world!    Using a CD player, the listener can utilize only one CD at a time, which may hold up to eighteen songs. However, with the iPod mini, the listener has the choice of having up to one thousand songs at their disposal. It makes it so much easier not having to carry around all of one's CD collection when wanting to listen to music. The listener has their entire source of music on one gadget.    Size is another advantage of the iPod mini to a CD player. The mini is approximately four by two inches, and is equal or less than the weight of a cell phone. It fits perfectly in a pants pocket when walking, or in a woman's purse without having to worry about it taking up a lot of space. A CD player is bulky and heavy, and the listener would still have to find a place to hold all of their CD's.    One disadvantage one might see towards an iPod mini is the price compared to a CD player. One can purchase a decent CD player for approximately twenty-five dollars, whereas the cost of the iPod mini can be up to two hundred dollars. Additionally, the consumer would have to have a computer in their possession as well to be able to put music on the iPod with iTunes software, or it would be useless to them.    The buyer of an iPod mini must have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages out to see if the purchase is worthwhile.  In this writer's opinion, with today's technology, the iPod mini is well worth the money spent. It is a great concept with longevity gadget that will continue to be improved upon in the future and will last.

<Title>WOW, what a lemon!
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's amazing how one product can totally turn away a die-hard Apple fan, and this is the product. Before this, I had been a loyal Apple buyer since 1998, but no more. The first one I got had battery problems from the get-go, so I had it exchanged after about 6 weeks. After about 5 months, the exchanged unit started having the same problem. I went to request service, but Apple would not support it and insisted on charging me $30 for shipping back to Apple to repair. As this was still under warranty, I balked at the idea for having to pay to ship back an obviously defective product, so I requested a return/refund. No one at Apple or Mac Mall, whom I had purchased the unit from, would assist me, shuffling me back and forth without resolution. Today I finally got my fill and challenged the purchase w/my credit card company (American Express). I'm getting my money back, and I'll never buy anything from Apple again!

<Title>Good Starter MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is another generation of a long line of Apples Ipods. This is a good starter mp3 player,but eventually you'll see its flaws and want better.It is nice for a casual music listener,but some of us like me think 1,000 is nothing.The price though more then makes up for it.Ipods are the most familiar MP3 player out.Their price is upsetting for anything 20GB and up.So this as said is cheap.  The spin wheel is wicked.It makes it alot easier to pick a song and no individual button clicking wich takes hours on large libraries.The color is girlish or preppish.I got it at a reduced price as it was a open store model and pink didn't sell too well at the Best Buy i went to.If you can get this at a cheaper price then it's list go out and buy it.If not,well don't save alittle more and get the cream of the crop.(The screen lights up,but no color battery life is decent)

<Title>Nothing sounds like it! But power source limited! (Adaptor costs extra).
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod's USB interface recharges from a computer USB connection only. This means if you want to go anywhere that does not have a PC available for recharging then you are left with a dead hunk of metal until you find a computer to power it up again. It takes about four hours to do a full recharge (and half a day to charge when out of the box, not 4 hours like it says in the manual), so I am not sure how you will feel about leaving your $300 iPod with an Internet Cafwhile on holiday or away from home. You need to buy a USB power adaptor if you want to plug your iPod into the mains. Without the power adaptor, which costs an extra $30, you are limited to PC recharging only. So be prepared to pay more than just the cost of the iPod for these nitpicky add-ons.   The iPod is an amazing device on two counts. One is that there is absolutely nothing on the market that is this size and holds so much data. Palms can not compete for storage size, end of story. Even the low-end 4GB iPods are overkill for MP3 playback. The clickwheel at the front of the iPod is genius. You move your thumb in a circle to scroll everything in the menu or volume. It has an amazing blue ambient backlight for night viewing. There is a top switch for locking the menu buttons so you can't accidentally adjust volume. If the headphones jack out by mistake the unit pauses automatically. The iPod mini series can easily go undetected in your jeans' pocket. The full version is a little bulkier but not by much more than already stated. The Nano series is nearly invisible. If you read the manual properly you can even store data files on the unit (in the notes folder etc.), so you can also use the iPod as a mass storage device for transporting files. As for extras, well it is quite smart. The software is updated by Apple over the internet, so you have calendars, address books, time-zones and an assortment of other extras that give the unit more class. However the alarm clock is just garbage because the device has a very limited internal speaker that is designed for just low-level `clicking' sounds. The iPod is both PC and Apple compatible. The earphones are really well designed; the white cord plastic even feels nice with a respectable length that does not tangle. However the universal white nature and shape of the earphones makes it easier to identify you as an iPod user. Although there are claims that the iPod is scratchproof, this is absolutely not the case. My metal is already starting to show scratches after a month of use. The screen, for all intents and purposes, scratches the same as a mobile phone does. Whoever programmed the sound software deserves a Gold Medal. The only sound system that even comes close to matching the iPod's sound quality is DOLBY DIGITAL or THX. The iPod is in that league. An expensive hi-fi system will not even sound as good as it.   The iPod file loading is not as easy as it seems. You must start working on your MP3 files before you can use it. This means right clicking the MP3 file (or group select) going into the file's properties and inputting genre, artists, albums, so that the naming systems work when in the iPod. You load the MP3 files into the Library of the iTunes software and see if you have the lists alright before finally dumping the chosen library selections onto the iPod's hard drive and taking your whole music collection for a walk on your hip. This could well be the FIRST MUST-HAVE APPLE PRODUCT that a PC user should own.   *Note - There is one major downside to the way the iPod plays files. You can not have continuous play of an album without breaks between tracks. If you want to solve this you need to join up your album into one giant MP3 track using external MP3 software. However Apple updates their software and firmware so maybe in the future they will solve this issue.   Pros:  - THX, DOLBY DIGITAL quality music centre that fits in your palm.  - Cosmos sized tiny hard drive.  - Design and Clickwheel.  - Apple support   Cons:  - Mains Power Adaptor Costs extra.  - Tracks pause between each other.  - MP3 files must be annotated.  - Recharging time is a bit long.

<Title>Great price, attractive package
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my mini iPod.  I would suggest it to most adults with a decent sized cd collection.  The size is small enough to hold onto while I work out.  I like the option of making lots of different playlists and the ease with which I can make, delete and change it.  There are the extras that aren't a big deal like the "name that tune" games, solitare and something else that I can think of right now.  The only benefit to these, I imagine would be if you are waiting in line or something but they are nice freebies.  Four gig gives you a little less than the thousand songs that I had heard of but more than enough for me to use a little selective "dj-ing".  I like itunes.  That's why I would suggest this for an adult versus for your kid.  Perhaps for a teen, one of the mp3 players where you can sign up for the "renting" music by the month would be good since their tastes change so rapidly.  My only problem is the quickness with which it scratched but that's easily enough to prevent by buying a case or skin.  It charges directly from the usb port on the computer, so while you are deciding if you want to buy new music you can charge it up.  I ALWAYS forget to lock it and the battery runs down but in about 20 minutes it gives me enough battery life to workout with and cleaning my carpet (the only times that I use the iPod).  I, personally, have a small problem with the wheel but that is probably just my machine. My husband has the second generation 16 GB and has never complained about it.
