<Title>Even a dummy can use it
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am a complete novice to MP3 players, and only a little computer savvy. I have resisted the MP3 craze for a long time now because I am an old school audiophile and prefer "albums" to "tunes". But when my FM headphone unit I used for workouts at the gym crapped out on me, I decided to take the plunge, assuming they could be had with FM capability for the option of watching the TVs at the gym.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how easy this Sony is to use, and how good it sounds. I did have to download an updated version of Windows Media Player, but once I did that even a tech dummy like me easily ripped my favorite CDs to my computer, and "sync-ed" the songs to the MP3 player.  And the sound is pretty good for a relatively cheap set of earbuds, with actual bass and good clarity. I'm not going to give up my multi-thousand dollar stereo anytime soon, but for car and gym use, it will do very well.  My only problem is finding an armband for it, seems any elastic armband with a small sleeve would work but I'm haven't found one yet.  [EDIT]I did find a cheap armband that looks promising, a Nextar MA-ASAB01. The Sony fits pretty snugly and is still accessible due to the clear plastic pouch of the Nextar.

<Title>very good, could be better
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little mp3 player is well worth the money invested. The SOUND quality is fantastic, probably on the level of Creative players, and much much better than Ipod. That said it is probably little more on the bass side. You can edit it with 5 channel Eq - which is great and makes sound just the wasy you want. DESIGN is one of the best I have seen, it is clad in nice, not cheap platic, you can feel the different options without even looking at the small, albeit incredibly precise and readable display. The hold button is made of metal, and very very easy to operate, and the device has play/pause, forward, reverse, menu, record buttons, on/off, reset (pin) - (each distinct) and it plugs directly into computer USB port. It feels very good in hand and it has the capacity of 1.81GB. BATTERY lasts for 10h even and it even holds for week or two without charging (2-4h). INTERFACE is made to operate on Windows Media Player but I usually drag files and folders manually. The device sorts through folder/file or artist/album way - you can actually switch the way wou want to check it. It has FM & recording, Voice recording (encodes into mono/stereo 92/128/256 mp3s), great sound and fine earbuds which go along. WHY 4 STARS? - It does not resume the file you are listening to after you turn it off, the search with forward/reverse buttons is painful although precise - if you listen to audiobook/podcast it takes forever to go back where you have stopped, there is no deleting on the device. For video of the device and overall look please go to cnet. I would buy it again and these minor things could be possibly changed with an upgraded firmware. I have owned it for 3 months and I have not had any problems...

<Title>Truly a work of art
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After reading the experiences of others you may begin to worry about the consequenses of purchasing one for yourself.  I work in an IT department and can testify to the complete lack of knowledge many users have.   I own two of these units (one black and one white) and cannot say enough about their usefulness. I will admit that the many controls may confuse some users, and that it takes a few minutes of practice to master; but the product cannot be matched for its size, features, and cost. It outperforms my Sansa by a long shot.  I have ONE computer that will not play nice with the Sony, yet accepts the Sansa (that's my fault - and can be easily fixed). These Sony's work flawlessly in the dozens of other computers I work with. If your computer doesn't recognize the Sony device, try another computer. The fault is in the computer, not the Sony.

<Title>good hardware, bad firmware
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've chosen this product for two reasons: (i) it can be used as a USB stick without a cable, hassle free. (ii) A 2 GB Sony mp3 player with FM for this price is a very good deal. However my experience is not quite what I expected.  After just 5 days of usage the USB connection failed!!! It was disconnecting then connecting over and over again by itself. Basically the connectivity to a computer was lost. This happened in just one week, without any abuse or mistreatment. After going through a one hour troubleshooting on the phone with Sony customer service, they decided to replace the product. I have received the new one last week, no problem so far.  I have some other 'minor' complains about this player. Start-up is slow considering to the complexity of the product. Even though I was using only the %25 percent of the memory it takes 5-10sec. to start up the player. Battery life is 12 hours which is bad but bearable. It does not resume the file when you close and open the player. I hope they can fix this with a firmware upgrade.   And, couple of words about the sound quality. I am not an audiophile but my ears did not like the response of the included headphones. I bought the cheapest Sony headphones, now the sound is superb. I also own an Iriver (390T) and I can not tell the difference. Do not expect much from the equalizer; I think the default setting is the best.   I think the strongest point of the player is Sony's excellent customer service :).

<Title>Better have pockets, there is no case available.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As a player, it works well.  However, we discovered there is no case to hold it.  There is also no place for a lanyard or really anyway to secure it.  If your outfit doesn't have pockets, I guess you can tuck into your underwear.  Not good for you gym rats and runners.  Owning previous Sony Walkman's, we have used Sony Connect and have all of our song ratings/playlists on there.  Unfortunately Sony Connect does not support this model.  It comes with a disk for Napster which we don't care to try and are trying to set up Window's Media Player 10 for it...but can't say we like it.

<Title>Useless. doesn't resume long files.
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.    This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.    I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.  It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.  For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):  Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect) Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place) Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)  No PlaysForSure: Rio (indestructible, so don't be afraid to buy a used one) iPods (Shuffle has no visible display and is worthless, so avoid it)

<Title>Exceeded My Expectations
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very positively impressed by the ease of loading content on to this Walkman, charging it, battery life, and audio quality.  The earphones that come with the device are light and easy to use.  I am happy with the 2 gigabyte capacity.  The "hold" wheel lock on the back allows the push-button controls to be temporarily suspended, which is perfect when keeping the Walkman in a pocket while doing some manual activity.  I am glad that I bought this product rather than some similar competitor products.  I would recommend it, and consider it an excellent value.

<Title>Much more than the ipod Shuffle
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is great, u don't have to use cables to sync or charge it. Has FM radio, voice recorder and u can even record your favorite FM program on a MP3 file. The sound quality is amazing (like all Sony's products) and is very portable. I don't know why most of the people prefer the iPod Shuffle instead of this one... and is cheaper too!. The only complain is that the shuffle doesn't work as expected.

<Title>Okay purchase
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I very like the fact that I do not need some complex program to download to my computer to just access my music files from the player and I do like that  it's so easy to add musics and files in it with few clicks from my computer to the player itself. But there is some missing things like a repeat option for the songs, there is no clipper where I can hang it up when I work out. The screen is not the best quality, I wasn't impress about the screen at all and I would have expected more from sony about on that...  But it's affordable, the sound is great, of course you have to get your own good earphones, since the original ones that comes in the box aren't the best... not to say cheap.  I am using it, it's working fine... but could have been better. I had a ipod shuffle before, it had a clip so it was practicle working out with it. It was smaller too, but of course, less memory space and no screen like the sony one. But I have to admit, the ipod shuffle is way lighter and smaller than the sony.

<Title>Nice features but buggy... not recommended
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is faulty. First, Windows (depends on how updated it is) recognizes it as a MTP device. Theorically you could use as a USB storage device but when Windows recognizes it as MTP device, it does not show up on your computer's folder. This can also happen when you install the software that comes with it.. so don't. When moving certain kinds of files to it, it messes up its configuration and it hangs in an infinite loop "CREATING DATABASE.. " I could not stop this for a while and then I searched for a firmware update. After searching on US sony website and Europe's site, I found it on sony japanese site. Had to remove everything in it to update and format (yeah.. updating was not enough). This device is not worth the hassle. I am computer savvy person but I am disappointed    about how difficult has owning this device has turn out to a friend of mine. Cannot be return .. Thinking of selling it. Don't buy this product. It is not worth it.

<Content>I bought this for my husband but couldn't get it to do a damn thing.  It couldn't upload a single peice of music it didn't even recognise music.  I am not computer savvy enough to figure out out how to hack into the thing to make it work!  And absolutely no tech support to be found! VERY disappointing!!

<Title>Works great for me
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not sure why others are having problems, but this item works great for me. I'm using Window$ XP, with Winodow$ Media Player 11. I plug the Walkman into my USB port, and it shows up in Media Player, ready to save music to.  I created a few Playlists, dragged them to the side (as Media Player showed), and clicked "Sync." Then all the songs were loaded onto the Walkman. It even converted my non-MP3 files into MP3s without me having to do anything.  All this *without* having to insert the provided CD (I think it's mostly a Napster free trial and the instructions for the Walkman in PDF).  I also really like the FM receiver. It's a nice feature that I don't think ipods have.  It also has AVLS, which if you turn it on won't let you turn it up past "safe" sound limits--I found the maximum volume lower than I might have thought was safe, so it's a good reminder that these little ear buds can easily cause hearing damage. (This feature is an option, you can blow out your hearing if you desire.)  I haven't had a need to use it, but the Walkman does come with a voice recorder that allows you to record a voice memo. It will also let you record a song off the radio--if you're listening to the radio and your favorite song comes on, just hit the Record button twice and the recording starts--sorry, it can't go back in time and get the start of the song you missed :-)  The last nice feature is the easy to twist "Hold" switch that inactivates all the other buttons. Since the others are so easy to push, the Hold switch is nice if you're jostling your Walkman and might accidenttaly bump one of the buttons.  I find the USB cover clips on quite securely. It has a nice little metal spring inside it, unlike most USB storage devices that just slip on and can easily fall off.  I'm taking a language class, and was able to easily move the practice tracks from the class CD to the Walkman.  The one main "flaw," as others have stated, is that it will not start at the same mid-track place after you restart it--this could be quite annoying if you are listening to electronic books and don't always finish a track before you turn it off. It does remember which track you are on, but will start at the beginning of the track only.  All in all, a great little MP3 / FM player.

<Title>Not a worthy successor to my iPod Shuffle
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I chose the Sony NWZ-B105F to replace an aging Apple iPod Shuffle (first generation), hoping to get a slightly richer user interface along with the ability to create playlists.  I understand that this device is not targeted towards Mac users such as myself, but I am comfortable working with devices that conform to open standards, and was drawn to the "drag and drop" software interface of this device.  In my ideal world, I would be able to plug this into my Mac, drag some songs from my iTunes library into the Music folder, unplug and enjoy the tunes.  Unfortunately, the device does not have a very robust implementation of the USB mass storage device class.  In fact, it seems to be a bit of an afterthought.  When plugged into my employer's Windows computer, the device shows up as an MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) device, not USB mass storage.  This allows drag and drop within Windows Explorer, and for Windows Media Player to see the device, but no drive letter is associated with it.  Apparently, this is the only way to get playlists onto the device (using Windows Media Player).  On the Mac, I did not have success dragging large numbers of files to the device.  An album at a time works fine, but more than 100 songs just fails silently.  And playlists show up as zero-length files, so they can't be manipulated.  One of the features I expect from a player that looks like a USB memory stick is that it operate like a USB memory stick.  MTP does not allow the device to show up as a disk drive, so the device cannot be used by Windows programs to save or retrieve data (other than Windows Media Player, of course).  I give this device a two-star rating as a Mac user.  I believe that Sony took some shortcuts in the design which severely hampered the usability of this device on computers that don't run Windows.  It seems obvious to me that one of the big reasons iPods are so successful is that Apple made sure to enable iPod and iTunes on Windows as well as Mac.  Sony (and many others) seem to go out of their way to be "Windows only", as if that were a good thing.  I wish I had options other than Apple, because I think competition benefits all consumers.
