<Title>Very pleased
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been very pleased w/ this little unit after a month of use now.  The ability to plug it into any system and drag-drop is a huge plus for me.  I don't like having to install software just to manage a MP3 player.  I've not measured the battery life but it's impressive.  I listen to audio books frequently on it and it starts up mid-track, right where I left off, very nice.  The mirror finish front picks up prints etc but they wipe off w/ a finger swipe and it hasn't scratched yet, seems durable.

<Content>This is just fine for my needs. I didn't want anything too fancy or too complicated. Easy downloading, easy to use. I wish the buttons were a little bigger but overall it's perfect for my needs. I just wanted a player to listen to mp3's and that is what I got. I'm happy.

<Title>Great Small MP3 player for new users
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the small size and easy to use features of this player. The USB port charging is extremely convenient since you can recharge it on any computer without worrying about carrying the cord with you all the time. Copying music onto it is easy. The FM radio is a nice feature when you cant decide what music to listen to. Its very lightweight so easy to bring with you everywhere. The MicroSD slot means you can add more music easily. I wasnt impressed with the original earphones, but once I changed them, the sound was much better.

<Title>Great MP3 Player for the price
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You probably won't find a better MP3 player for the price.  While it has its flaws and occasionally buggy performance, the combination of size and features more than compensates for its shortcomings imo.  Pros: 1. Small size 2. Direct USB connection - no need to carry a USC cable around with you (although it comes with a small USB extension cable for use if you need it) 3. Doubles as a USB drive - I have had no problems storing all kinds of files on it 4. Syncs well with Windows Media Player or simply by drag and drop 5. FM player and recorder 6. Charges fairly quickly from computer 7. Decent battery life 8. Good sound quality 9. Micro SD expandable memory slot  Cons: 1. Prone to occasional glitches such as screen freezes (I found that connecting it to a live USB port will fix these problems) 2. Sound quality of FM recording is average at best 3. FM radio appears to mainly use headphones as antenna - may need to find the right pair of headphones for best FM signals 4. User interface could be slightly better  The headphones that come with the device provide decent sound and FM radio signal but are not comfortable (to me).  I purchased another pair immediately.  I would update the device's  software as soon as you get it to improve reliability.  Use the device lock and remember to turn it off when you're done using it to avoid the battery from running out - it is easy to turn on accidentally.

<Title>Superb item as long as you know about the "hard reset"
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very affordable and great quality music in a tiny package.  I use the device to play music in my car, for jogging, and just anywhere else.  I believe this is the best product out there for its particular category.  I recommend buying the 2 gb version because a 1 gb expansion card costs just about the same compared to the difference between the 1 gb and 2 gb versions of this product.  Only a few notes: The shuffle option does not seem to spread out music from their initial alphabetical-order well.  A few minor problems of not turning on or freezing, but this occurs after unplugging the device from a computer or initially turning it on.  The problems do not occur during playback.  A "hard reset" fixes everything.  When I bought this product, I noticed bad reviews, but I also noticed reviews that explained how to circumvent problems noted in the bad reviews.  A "hard reset" was the answer in their reviews and the answer from my own experience as well.

<Content>I received this player and it seemed to be a great product for the 3 hours it worked.. I had charged the battery as indicated in the manual, loaded some music on it and listened for a while. Then after reconnecting it to my PC and removing it the device does nothing. A "hard reset" didn't help. Go over to the Sandisk site message board and read before buying this player. I did and ordered one anyway thinking it won't happen to mine... Now I'm going to try the Samsung U3.

<Content>With horrible software design, awkward button positioning and bizarre crashes, this Sansa Express made me realize why companies are struggling to displace Apple.  I wanted a cheap USB style MP3 player and I got a nightmare, even with the newest firmware.  Buy the Sony USB style MP3 player. It's designed much better but has no microSD slot.

<Title>Dont buy the express
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this Express for my daughter for Christmas.  It worked great for about 1 week.  Were having the same problems as everyone else.  If you go to the sandisk website you will see an overwhelming amount of people with Expresses that dont work. It wont turn on I tried the hard reset and it turns out there is a firmware update.  I am on dial up - (no other option where I live) and it will take waaaay to long to DL the patch. I bought this based on the reveiws which were good mostly.  I wish I had the foresight to look at the sandisk webboards to see what kind of probs they had.  Hopefully we will be able to exchange for a different one.  As for the Co I bought it from J&R. They shipped very quickly no probs with them.

<Title>TOO MANY FATAL FLAWS - cannot plays songs by folder...
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, my needs may be different than many peoples.  the sansa is tiny and nice and sounds pretty good, though you may want better headphones than the ones that come with it for free.  TROUBLES:  #1: sansa doesn't recognize FOLDERS at all when you're navigating through songs. it just jumbles all the files together. if you store your music by albums or any catagory it's impossible to listen to your music with ANY predictability. if you have hundreds of songs on it, it's amazingly slow to move through the songs in search of anything and the order seems to be almost random! i record my own things and then use a mini-mp3 player to listen back while working on things. this was impossible with the sansa. usually you can browse your files by name, artist, etc... which you can do, but it doesn't have by FOLDER. so once your files are on it... good luck figuring out where they'll be. and because file naming can be so random a few songs by one band will come up then something else them more of the previous band later... often much later. without any method to navigate, this thing is only for people who just want some cheap thing to play back whatever. if that's you... go for it.  #2: i bought it for the voice recorder. IT SAVES VOICE RECORDINGS AS .WAV FILES!!! which are 10 times the size of mp3 or wma. i have to batch convert them on my computer - most people don't have a program that does this. not sure what they were thinking.

<Title>sansa express, small, sexy and versatile
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This thing is remarkably small. I bought an 8GB micro SD ($100) which fits in and works seamlessly, so for $60 + $100 I have a 10G music player that also has FM radio, voice recording and file transfer/storage and all smaller than an old school pack of chewing gum. For me it's the perfect device. One of the best features is the charging from the usb port. I go days between recharges. Also audio books download well to this device. Two issues though. It should have a scroll wheel rather than the buttons. It stores so much info that basically tabbing through everything (albums, fast forwarding, etc..) takes a lot of time and I'm scared that after awhile all of that holding down of the buttons will wear them out.  Also, it seems that you can't just plug it into a computer and play the songs. It needs to download the song through  something like Windows Media, then play it. On my regular old usb key I would plug in, double click a song and it would play. Not really a big deal. The other issue is that you have to move music with Windows Media. No itunes, but that's Apples' fault, I guess. All around a great, mini player and usb key that does much more and holds much more than a nano.

<Content>I purchased the SanDisk MP3 player for my daughter for her birthday.  I have one that is similar and I love mine so I was pretty confident she will enjoy hers too.  She has downloaded several songs already and was very pleased how easy it was to do this.  I wanted one for her that she could recharge easily.  I had one that took AA batteries and as we travel a great deal that was such a nuisance to always carry extra batteries with me. My son gave me a SanDisk for my birthday. Wish he had checked with AMAZON and he would have saved money.  I have a cigarette lighter adapter to recharge mine and plan to purchase one for her also.  Would I recommend this MP3 player?  Yes definitely.   I did not have to wait very long for it to arrive after I ordered it and recieved it before her birthday, so she got an early birthday present.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this item for nearly one month.  It has been great.  I would defiantly recommend this product for how inexpensive it is.  I personally feel that for the price it can't be beat.  It has great music quality (unless you're a mouse you're not going to tell the difference from an ipod). I also like the ease of use with its small menu; I haven't found it difficult at all.  I also have not experienced any skipping as was stated in other feedbacks.  It is extremely easy to charge and the battery seems to last around 20 hours.  One small drawback is that the file transfer seems to work much better with Windows Media Sync rather than the drag and drop, (that is if you want the artists names and alike to match up correctly).  All and all this is a GREAT little mp3 player/jump drive to own.  Defiantly buy this rather than taking out a second mortgage to buy the latest ipod.

<Title>Sandisk Sansas Express
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player for myself after doing a little internet research. It has not lived up to expectations. Not a lot of fancy bells and whistles but doesn't do what it is supposed to do. It has 2 GB capacity which is plenty for my use but can also be expanded with a 2 GB micro SD card. It has an FM tuner for when I get tired of the stuff I've listened to many times. It's small, about the size of a pack of gum and comes with a lanyard so you can hang it off your neck if you're wearing a pocketless shirt.No separate charger is necessary; you just plug it into a USB port to recharge which is very convenient.It supposedly will run for 15 hrs. but I haven't tested that out, but it does charge up very quickly. I wasn't thrilled with the earbuds, but then my ears are hard to fit well. Not a problem with the sound quality.The instructions for use are very easy to follow. Overall I think it was a great deal for about $55 and I'm very pleased with it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2866020-5076729">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  New info 2/9/07 Here it is only a couple of weeks later and the player doesn't work at all. Searching user forums, I found that this is not an isolated case. I have asked for a replacement and hope it will be OK, but in the meantime, I would not recommend buying this item.

<Content>I got this because I had a gift card to use and so had to pay very little OOP for it. I like it because it is very small, has a built-in battery, and has that MicroSD slot. I guess as long as they keep making memory in MicroSD format in greater capacity, this unit should be usable until they stop making batteries for it! I got a 2GB MicroSD card for it, with a different gift card. You definitely need to run the SW update when you get it, just like you do with any updateable piece of gear.

<Content>The SanDisk Express 2GB MP3 player is my first experience with an MP3 player.  I'm amazed at the technology that allows me to easily carry audio files, listen to and record FM stations, and even record my spoken notes.  I purchased it after reading several reviews of MP3 players, looking for something that would allow me capacity to carry numerous files with a purchase price in the $50 - $60 range.  The ear-plugs aren't comfortable for long periods of listening, but the jack accomodates padded headsets, so I can get by.

<Title>Wasted my money
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, so I'm  a complete newbie with mp3 players and apparently not smart enough to operate it. The instructions were inadequate for me, even after printing out all 17 pages and writing my own notes all over them as I attempted for several days to use the player to listen to an audio book I had downloaded from my public library. The worst part was trying to navigate to the forty-third minute of the second section of Alan Alda's book. The last straw was when I had to turn it off (yet again), after getting myself in a complete muddle, and on restarting, all I got was the blue word SanDisk. No animated critter, no "building database" message, no access to menus, and not even able to turn it off with the power button. This happened while driving to work, and it stayed like this for 20 minutes, until a coworker showed me that I could jump-start it by sticking it into the USB drive of a computer. After it froze like that for the second day in a row I put it away and haven't tried to use it again in more than a month.   How do I get my money back? Surely not from Amazon...

<Title>Basically a suped up version of the sansa m series
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Basically this Mp3 is a suped up version of the sansa m series.  Pros (?): Slim and sexy look. You can see yourself on that faceplate. OLED Screen. Very light. Very good sound quality. Amusing Dino  Cons: USB Charging only (I haven't check for products that'll charge it w/o a computer yet 08/07) Easily smugable (fingerprint prone) No info of bitrate of a file on the bottom like the m series (But I think that'll be fixed in a future firmware update). Easily ejectable microsd card. (Better buy that toughskin accessory) OLED screen not really visible outside on full brightness.  Other Thoughts: This Mp3 has a weird Graphic EQ. Only 5 bars. Leftmost being the bass and rightmost being the treble. When you turn a bar up, basically the Mp3 will just lower the sounds from other ranges of the sound spectrum. Solution: Just jack up all 5 bars by 3 times and then set your EQ preference.  Lousy shuffling Solution: Repeat All and then shuffle.  Pretty good so far.   I wouldn't recommend the c series normally b/c I do not find it a plus to have photo viewing on a ridiculously small screen.  The dino is amusing to watch.  Ipods have the best interface. The sansa seems easy to get lost in for the average person.  The dino is amusing to watch... ... ... ... SanDisk should animate it more. ...  ------ Opps, that dino is a dog

<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is ok. Not very good, not very bad.  The plus of sansa is its reasonable price and its many functionz. Voice recorder, radio, radio recorder. Battery last long and be charged fast.  The biggest minus of the sansa is in its songs locating. the screen only have 3 lines, so we can only see 3 songs name at a time. without "fast scroll-down" function like ipod, sansa still take lot of time (and a bit of effort) when you have to keep pressing "down" button to find the exact song you want.   One more thing Sansa better let user make/edit playlist and information of songs in Windows. Once music is synced into sansa with media player, you can't edit song info anymore. Also, When open sansa with computer, I don't like the way it organize music into artist's name folders.

<Content>I'm not looking for an MP3 player that has a mischievous bent.  Roughly once a week, my player decides to empty out the playlist or the radio presets.  All on its own.  (Even when it has been in my pocket, playing away, with the lock on.)  This is big on the hassle factor scale.  There are plenty of MP3 players out there with a number of good features, and the Sansa Express is one of them.  However, this random reset is not a feature that I like.

They should also tell you that they install half-a-dozen sample songs on it before it arrives; I was beginning to think that the first one was "used" because it already had songs on it, and it wouldn't work properly. It's a pretty decent MP3 player but it's impossible to see the screen when I'm outdoors, even though the screen is crisp and bright indoors.

<Content>I received this product the week before last, and was rather impressed for around an hour.  At that point, I decided to do what any good nerd does and update the firmware from Sandisk.  Sandisk does not provide direct download links for firmware.  They only provide an updater, which is fine.  However, this updater does not tell you what the new firmware does.  it installed the firmware, and rebooted the device.  At that point, the 2gb microsd card I had purchased to go along with it was no longer recognized, even though it worked in my cell phone and in my card reader.  Sandisk's support was nearly useless in fixing this issue.  After seeing numerous reports of problems with this device, I have returned it to amazon and I am hoping to get a refund, because I do not want another sandisk product.

<Title>On your own risk
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use to put just whole albums in my 30Gb iPod ("Classic" iPod nowdays) so i was looking for a device to put singles and "one hit wonders". First i think to get an iPod Shuffle but then there was the Sansa with 2Gb (enough for my interest) and specially the FM tuner and recording options (also i was thinking use it to record some radio shows that i cannot attend when they go live) so i get one. How is doing this thing? Regular, very close to bad. I've been using the Sansa for a month and in a couple of times the thing just hang out, i mean it doesn't respond to any key and i have to wait until the battery goes down.   Pros (when the Sansa works): - FM tuner and voice recording feature. - Files transfer is simple. Just copy the files as you do in Windows. - Light and fancy design. - Equalizer presets (they make a real difference in the sound quality). - Expandable storage capacity.  Cons: - The menu/interface is confuse. - The radio tuner is good when you listen live radio, but every show that i record there was a noise, some kind of interference, no big deal but a little bit annoying. - The shuffle option is not very intelligent; it can repeat 2 or 3 songs when there are 20 songs that have not been played yet. - Rechargable only trough USB ports. - Not reliable.  Maybe i got a defective unit, i don't know but i don't recommend this thing, specially if it will be you main player (maybe could be a backup or secondary player). If you don't need FM tuner or voice record go for an iPod Shuffle, no doubt. Otherwise, get a Sansa on your own risk.  Pedro S.   Last minute update: Yesterday the "Sansa Updater" program detect a new firmware version so i download and install it (you have to format the unit in order to update the firmaware, can you believe this?!!). After the update i let the Sansa plug to the computer to charge the battery. A few hours later i want to use the Sansa, it turn on for a minute, and then suddenly dies. At this moment the Sansa doesn't turn on. I plug it to the computer and still remains dead. Crappy.  Very Last Minute Update: The Sansa come back to live. After a couple of hours i check the user guide and applied a "hard reset", after that the Sansa just turn on and is working now. What happend? I have no idea.
