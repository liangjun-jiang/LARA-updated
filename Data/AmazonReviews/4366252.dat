<Title>Sticking with the old version
<Date>Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Zen Touch when it first came out with the intention of replacing my old Jukebox Zen.  While I like the looks of the Zen Touch better, I was bothered by a few things. 1) The random button.  I never put my player on hold since I am constantly changing tracks and the volume.  I kept hitting the little random button which put every file onto my playlist.  So then I had to go and delete the files I didn't want only to hit the button again a few minutes later.  Annoying. 2) The playlist feature.  Unlike in the Jukebox Zen the now playing files are not grouped by artist or by album, they're simply placed in one large list.  This makes it very time consuming to delete a particular band from the now playing. 3) Button placement.  I actually like having the buttons on the side of the player (as in the Jukebox Zen), that means that I can easily slip it into my pocket without hitting any buttons. 4) The touch pad.  It's a little difficult to select what you want with this thing but it makes for easy scrolling.  It's also nice that you can set how sensitive it is and you can just tap on it to select songs. 5) The software.  Okay, we all know by now that the software that Creative packages with it's products sucks.  I like their products enough though to deal with it. Overall I thought that the Zen Touch was a good product, I just wish that they had kept some of the features that made me fall in love with the older models.  And until they do I'm going to stick with my Jukebox Zen.

<Title>Third Time's The Charm
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been using the Zen Touch for several months now. Extremely pleased with my purchase. A couple of years ago I bought a Nomad3, its round shape caused a lot of slipping and falling to the ground. Eventually I had to send it back to Creative to get fixed. An eighty dollar service charge was too much so they sent it back and I managed to fix the unit by dropping it again. Nervous, I sold it to a buddy (it's still working) and bought a Dell DJ15 GB. Made by Creative the unit it self was great but the software (MusicMatch) was very buggy. After discovering AllofMP3.com I ran out of room. So I went back to Creative and loved the new software. Nice unit, very clean looking. The software supports dual players at the same time so it is very easy to swap songs through a PC. Nice feature.

<Content>I love this thing.  The Good: Almost everything!  Particularly: EXCELLENT battery life. Solid build. Incredible sound quality. Unique, if not eniterly effective firrmware.  The bad: The included software isn't good.  At all.  But I've used worse.  My 20 GB Zen Touch had a harddisk failure after around a month.  Creative speedily replaced it with another, though on the replacement, the scroll wheel was broken when I received it. They took it back, and somehow I ended up with a 40 GB model.  This is the most excellent and efficient customer service I have ever encountered.  No player I've seen sounds better.

<Title>Very Impressed!
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this elsewhere for much cheaper, so do your homework. Amazon prices don't seem as competitive as they once were! Anyway, on with the review. I think this unit sounds fantastic. The headphones really work well for me. They fit my ears well and sound full and robust. I have a pair of Sennheiser ear buds (MX500) and a Sennheiser headset (can't find the model number) and they do not sound as good as the included earbuds. This is a pleasant surprise as I expected the included phones to not fit well and sound poor. So that is good. Earbuds seem to be a very individual thing. In any case, I want to get a new set of headphones, perhaps the Sennheiser PX100s... Overall I find earbuds dainty and difficulty to store well (there is no case for the included earbuds, I use my MX500 case...)  I find the software to be completely usable. I do not use it to rip unless my EAC/LAME setup cannot handle one of my CDs, then the Mediasource software usually handles things just fine, which I find interesting. One thing for sure is that files upload VERY quickly to the player and it is so easy to SYNC your PC music collection to the player (or vice versa). I especially like the media sniffer aspect of Mediasource which scans the directories you point it to for new additions to add to the collection... Very handy!  I would give the player five stars, but: I do wish Creative had included a remote. Also, the case is just crappy and doesn't clamp well to my belt or jeans pocket. I usually put the player in a pocket. Get used to using the player lock button as the random button for some reason seems to get pressed a lot for no reason....   As for the controversial touch strip, I find it to be okay. Yes, it is sensitive, but I find that I am getting better. Initially I was terrible, but incrementally and slowly I am seeing improvement. I turned the tap feature on the touchpad off.  The buttons are useful, except for the random one, which is just plain dumb... No one must have tested this in design phase.  Overall, this is a great player. Comparatively cheap, well designed, and fabulous sound. Works perfectly well for me. I have had it for about 3 weeks now and have been listening and using it a lot!

<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great mp3 player with one fatal flaw. All mp3s are stored in one directory, making it very hard to organize songs and resulting in a lot of file name conflicts.  An mp3 player just needs to be a portable hard drive with headphones. Amazing how many lack this basic functionality.  So it's not perfect, but it is better than an ipod. At least it doesn't meddle with my primary music library the way the ipod does.

<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Touch is slowly becoming the most important electronic device that I own. My favorite thing is that I can put any MP3 on  the device and it will play it. I have and extensive MP3 collection and it plays them all without fail, from my old MP3's to my newest licensed ones. Throw the bundled software away and just install the newest driver though, I found it very confusing to use. I simply use the drag and drop method to get my music onto the device. I am very pleased with the device and the performance the audio sounds great. It will soon be supported by Napster's To Go service and I can't wait to fill all 40 gigs with music.

<Title>Could be a four-star player if they'd fix the firmware and computer interface software
<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Positive things: I got my Zen Touch 40GB about a week ago, and overall I'm very happy with it.  The touchpad isn't as easy to use as the iPod's wheel, but if you turn the sensitivity down in the settings it shouldn't be a real problem.  The battery life is exceptional.  I've been skipping tracks like crazy, playing 128kbps-392kbps audio, running my backlight on 30-second mode(the highest), and using 30% contrast.  I charge nightly after use, and I've never yet managed to eat an entire bar off the battery life display.  The sound quality, as others have said, is great.  A clip-on case comes in the box.  It's fine for carrying it around, but if you want to access any of the buttons on the player, you'll have to remove it from the case until you're done messing around.  Negative things: The earbuds that come in the box suck.  They hurt my ears and fall out every three seconds.  Get yourself a pair of these, instead: &lt;A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000092YR6/ref=pd_sbs_e_1/103-8083684-1691818?v=glance&s=electronics">Sony MDR-J10&lt;/A>  The player's firmware is very minimalistic.  You can't set it to display the time of day along with the track information(which isn't something I've seen on any mp3 player, but it would make sense... why should I have to carry an mp3 player AND a watch?), and it doesn't support any lossless encoded audio format.  It also doesn't support viewing text files...  which would be a useful feature for keeping recipies and such.  I'm hoping that Creative will address these three issues in a firmware update.  I've also heard a lot about problems with the player's interface freezing.  I've not personally experienced this, but apparently the only way to fix it is to either wait for the battery to die completely, or push a straightened paper clip into the reset-hole.  You'd think they could make that a little more accessible.  I hope it never becomes a problem for me.  The computer-interface software kind of sucks.  It takes absolutely forever to transfer music to the player, even when using a USB 2.0 port.  The placement of the OK button on the touchpad track was a bad call on the part of Creative's design team.  It's not a huge problem...  it's just not where I'd have put it.  Overall, it's a great player, and I'm happy I got it instead of an iPod, but I'd really appreciate a firmware upgrade.

<Title>money well spent
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Zen Touch for a few days now, and it's been wonderful to use.  All things considered, I fully researched the player before I made the purchase and came to the conclusion that it was exactly what I was looking for.  It has its low points, but the long battery life & low price definitely outweigh its chunky size and lack of subdirectory support.  The High Points: --Sound quality:--  I listen to a lot of classical music in addition to shake-yer-booty club tunes, and the Zen Touch has played everything I've thrown at it clearly, crisply, and without any distortion.   --Price:--  My budget for the player was limited, and I only went a few dollars over while getting lots of bang for the buck. --Data support:--  I have about half the space on my Zen filled with movies and random files which are really easy to drag & drop.  It's great for taking a movie too big for CD over to a friend's place. --Durability&Construction:--  This player feel like quality.  It's obviously well made and sturdy.  It would probably be easy to scratch the finish, but that's why there is a case.  I would definitely be mindful of dropping it while it's running, though, since that's a great way to kill a hard drive.  A fall would likely not harm the case, but if the hard drive is spinning it can ruin the drive. Thankfully, the belt clip has a little edge which helps to keep it from slipping off, and I've clipped it to everything from necklaces to bra straps to a swimsuit with no fear of it falling off. --Battery:-- It just keeps going and going and going!!!  I haven't timed how long I've gotten yet, but it's definitely way over 20hrs.  Docking sucks the life out, though.  Plug in for it.   Things I Expected To Be Low Points But Were Fine: --Scroll Bar:-- A lot of people have complained that it is too sensitive, but mine has been fine to use without playing with any settings.  It took about three minutes of useless flipping from the bottom of my playlist to the top, but it's easy to get the hang of.   --Headphones:--  The included headphones are perfectly adequate.  They're not Sennheisers, but they don't distort and I plan to use them because money is tight and they're fine...  In fact, they're noticeably better than any other headphones provided with CD players I've purchased in the past. --Software:--  I expected that the software would be awful, considering the reviews, but I used both Creative's NOMAD Explorer and Red Chair's NOTMAD Explorer for a while and I didn't feel that it was necessary to pay the extra bucks for it.  Creative's software is perfectly adequate for transferring files to the player, creating playlists, and editing certain ID3 tags in bulk (artist, album, and genre).  That's all I expect it to do, and it does that very well.     The Low Points: --No Subdirectories:--  The Zen Touch uses ID3 tags to organize the files, which is a pain since a lot of the time the tags are wrong, especially on mp3s which have been around for a long time.  However, tags are definitely better on downloaded files these days than they were in the Napster era.  Creative's software makes it easy to bulk edit some tags(album, artist, genre), too, which really helps to cut down on the pain-in-the-butt factor.  Thankfully, there are plenty of free ID3 editing programs out there to easily bulk edit the track number and year fields. --Provided Case:--  Don't get me wrong, it's great protection for the player, but it's not possible to access the buttons while it is in there.  That means everytime you want to change the song, you have to pull the player out, take it off hold, press the next button, turn hold back on, and then slip it back in the case.  What a pain.  I haven't purchased a new case yet, but I'm definitely going to look into it!  And, inconsequentially, the headphone cord is white, so from afar it looks like I'd actually waste my money on an iPod.  Boo.  All in all, this is a great player and definitely worth the money.

<Title>A fine, but abandoned player
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a fine mp3 player that holds a massive number of files.  The sound quality consistently beats the competition (Creative is, after all an 'audio' company) and the battery life is tops in the industry.  There are a few quirks in the software and user interface but nothing that would take away from the overall usage of the product.  But when paying hundreds of US$ for an mp3 player all of the issues of ownership must be factored in (as opposed to just the player itself).  The problem with this player is that Creative has completely abandoned it.  When it was released in mid-2004, it was billed as a quality alternative to the Ipod (some trade mags and websites were close to crowning it as the Ipod killer).  Yet, more than a year later, there are no accessories of note (Ipod has how many?), and the lack of firmware upgrades (Audio books anyone?) are evidence that Creative has little faith in this product, and more damaging to the possibilities of a future increase in the overall mp3 market share, in developing the consumer loyalties have allowed Ipod to own the market.  Further, given that this product has been on the market for more than a year, not even the most optimistic fan truly believes that Creative will begin, now, to release the needed firmware upgrades (audio books, file management, etc...) or the most desired hardware accessories (car chargers/speaker systems, FM transmitters, high quality sound docking stations - see the Bose product, functionally sound cases, etc...)  Clearly, Creative has moved on to focus on the new mp3 player releases.  To make matters worse, this same player, in essence, is sold through Dell as the 'DJ' with nearly all of the firmware upgrades and a number of quality accessories that Creative has denied to its own direct customers.  No small amount of irony there.  Again, the zen touch excels as a player but minus the support of Creative, and at even the current reduced pricing, it cannot compare to the entire ownership experience to its chief competition.  If you really like this player and don't want to wait until the price drops below $100 (where the 'ownership experience argument begins to be less of a factor in comparison to Creative's competition), buy the Dell version.  If you are looking for an alternative to the Ipod, bite the bullet and buy the Ipod.

<Title>Difficult to use
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As others have said, the sound is great and battery life is excellent.  That's about it.   If you (God forbid) hit the "shuffle" button (why do we need a "shuffle" button on the outside where you'll hit it often?) you will "shuffle" until you magically hit the button(s) to correct it - or the Zen gods shine down on you.  I've had this player for several years and still can't figure it out.  Instruction manual?  Forget it.  The touch pad is irritating as you will overshoot your mark often no matter how often you adjust it. There is nothing intuitive about the software.    Here's the best thing.  Sometimes it...just...quits.  You have to get a paperclip, stick it into a little hole and it revives itself.  No idea why it does this.  But rest assured, it will do it at the worst possible moment when there is no paperclip or other similar object in sight.  I bought the Zen because I hate anything Apple.  My next MP3, unfortunately, will be an Ipod.  And the way the Zen has been acting up lately - it might be sooner rather than later.

<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these after making extensive comparisons with other players. I didn't want video so I chose this older model. The sound quality is very good with some separately purchased earphones (the ones in the box are okay but not great). The battery life is amazing. I'm not sure if it gets 24 hours but I use it every day all week and I often don't charge it before going back to work again on Monday. I only have two complaints, this player is heavy, but that is to be expected with such a long-lived battery, and that when I am accessing a large playlist the player can take a very long time to respond. Also I find the random button on the front a bit silly, I listen to a lot of different styles of music and hearing opera followed by pop music just doesn't work for me. That said, this is a great player and when the time comes to get a new one I will buy another product from Creative.

<Title>Great sound and storage space. Somewhat annoying interface
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this to replace my XTRA 30GB. It's pretty much a good substitute.  The sound on this thing is great. Unfortunately the headphone Creative ships with it suck and don't do it justice at all so you will definitely want to invest in a pair of good headphones to go with it.   It's a little smaller than the XTRA and I guess it looks a little better. Unfortunately the little dial  you used to navigate around the menus has been replaced by a touch pad. This takes a while to get used to and still is hard for me to get right on the song I want on first try. Although going into the options and reducing the sensitivity of the touch pad helps with this, Also, there a lot of menus to navigate through. To me new interface is an example of trying to fix something that wasn't broken and actually making it worse. You can transfer music quickly and easily, Vista downloads the right driver instantly and the battery holds a long charge  This is a nice player for about $100 on the whole. The sound is by far the most important thing to me on an MP3 player and the Creative players all sound great. Its 40GB capacity is also nice to backup a lot of music or use it as a little portable hard drive. With all the benefits I can live with the slightly irritating interface and menus.

<Title>Built like a Cadillac, rides like one too!
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the pleasure of owning a Zen Touch for the past three years now! The only problem I have had to date is that I lost the power adapter; seriously, that's it!  The Zen Touch has solid construction (I've dropped it several times), is easily navigable, has great sound and has an amazing file capacity. I tried to get into the I-pod hype, but saw so many other cost effective alternatives; I thought I would try to make Mac work harder for my affection (not even the i-phone has swayed me yet).  Although I am a subscriber to Sirius Satellite Radio and make huge use of the Stiletto that boasts a pretty sizable mp3 capacity itself (along with recorded radio files and internet radio capability), I still use my Zen Touch heavily for work at our after school programs.  I would go to bat for the Zen Touch any day (although I don't think Creative makes them any more). I will use my Zen until they start downloading music directly to my brain... we, even then the Zen would probably be way more reliable (I've had to reboot the old noggin quite a few times since I work with kids).

<Title>Some Pros, Some Cons
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have owned it for 2+ years.  Pros:  - Excellent Sound quality - Long Battery Life - Durable, thing can be tossed around and screen has never scratched even with no case to protect it. - Cheap  Cons:  - The buttons slowly stopped doing what they were supposed to. Occassionally hitting "next" will do the dreaded random all. Or it might pause. Could be because of all the dropping over the years but I don't think so. Seemed more of a gradual onset of dysfunction than any "breaking." - Random all is useless and annoying. - The software is buggy. It crashes a lot, and the built in player rarely works. - The touchpad is hard to use, even after years of practice.  Conclusion... Buy it because it's cheap and plays great music for long periods of time. Plus it doesn't need iTunes or the proprietary song format.  If you have more money to spend, however, there is almost certainly something better on the market that is also non-iPod.

<Title>Fabulous!
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is awesome. I've had it for almost 3 years now and it's still running great. I bought it to take to Iraq with me when I got deployed and it survived the deployment, it's been to the gym with me (I know, not good for hard drive-based MP3 players, I'm in the market for a flash drive-based player), on all my travels, everywhere.  So first the software it comes with is incredibly easy to use and very useful. Easy to make playlists and sort through songs. True that you can't make playlists on the go, but I'm ok with that.  It's got a hold button on the top, which I've found very useful. I've had the thing in my bag and then pulled it out only to find that the battery drained; now I just put the hold button on and it can't do that anymore. It also helps when taking it out of the case so you don't accidentally hit 'Random' or the power button (done both).  Dedicated volume buttons, a must for me. Speaking of sound, it's pretty good. There are some songs that I listen to that the volume can't quite go as high as I'd like, but it's very possible that I've converted files incorrectly - don't know. Anyway, it's perfect for what I need.  The touch scroll takes a little bit of getting used to and it can be a bit oversensitive, but I got the hang of it pretty quick and now find it very easy to use.  I've never really tested the battery life, but it seems to be just fine, haven't had any problems with it.  That's my 2 cents, overall great MP3 player, highly recommend it!

<Title>Most enduring mp3 player
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have actually had my Creative Zen Touch for going on five years now, and it still works as flawlessly as the day I bought it. It's a real pity Creative doesn't make them anymore.  I am not gentle with my electronics. I have dropped, washed, left it out in the car, and who knows what else. The (somewhat) cruddy carrying case has long since fallen apart, I've had to purchase new earbuds over and over again as the old ones fall apart, but my Zen is still miraculously going strong.  Although bulky, I find that that larger size is a benefit more than a hindrance. If you drop it, you don't have to freak and wonder if you'll have to shell out another $250+ for a replacement.  Mind you, there are some negative factors as well, most of them applying to the software. I prefer ripping my cds with Windows Media Player, and occasionally I'll rip songs and the software simply won't recognize that there's an mp3 on my computer. I'll open the folder and the software just shows it as empty space. The only way to avoid that problem is by ripping the cd with the software's ripping program, and it's frustrating that you can't change the song quality. Also, I enjoy listening to music from many different countries, and, although when you first set up the software it supports all languages, if you should need to switch computers or download the software to a new computer, there's no longer any language support. You can fiddle with that program as much as you want and download as many patches as you can, it doesn't matter. You'll just have to find the romanized titles for those songs, or the song'll just appear on your mp3 player as gibberish.  Despite these setbacks, the fact remains that the mp3 player itself is sturdy, dependable, and, most imoprtantly, still working. It breaks my heart, but I've been having to look for a new one for no other reason than that I no longer have any room on my old one. And it breaks my heart even more that I can't just get an upgraded version of this one.

My only problem with the Zen player is that you cannot create files to store different types of music or certain albums, but I guess you can overcome that issue by playing music according to artist, genre, etc...

<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE WITH THE CREATIVE LABS LOGO!! Where to begin with this piece of junk?  I bought this due to its hard drive size, its compatibility with all types of music files, its long lasting battery, and the other reviews I read.  When I got the refurbished (by Creative Labs) player, the first thing I did was install the software, then tried to sync the player with Windows Media Player 11.  As soon as I turned the player on (after chargin the battery), I got a firmware error message.  A search through the Creative Labs website to find a fix resulted in receiving an RMA to send it back to Creative Labs for repair, which I did.  A month and several inquiries to Creative as to the status of the player later, I checked the RMA website where I was told there was as issue with the RMA.  No email notification that there was problem, and I was surprised as I had followed their instructions for returning it for repair.  I still don't have a working player and don't have high expectations when I get it back.  Maybe my viewpoint will change when I am actually able to use an operable player, but I wouldn't recommend buying anything made by Creative Labs.  There are better players out there for comparable prices, and I am regretting my decision to buy it.  Next time, I'm getting a Cowon, a Zune, or (may my tongue turn black for saying) an ipod.

<Title>Nice Build Quality, Great Sound, some minor Quirks
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Some brief notes on the 40GB Zen Touch from Creative. I have used it now for about two weeks and am very pleased with it after I got around some quirks.  The player seems to be built very nicely. It has a very solid and quality feel and has this substantial touch to it. Another way would be to say it's heavier than expected and certainly heavier than a comparable iPod (the size difference is quite neglectable).  The sound is very good and the equalizer works well too. It's usually not necessary, but it can help to customize the sound. I do not think, like some reviews of the 20GB version suggest, that the sound isn't loud enough. I don't have to crank it up to 25 even in my MCC Smart @85 mph (a rather noisy car, trust me).   The operation of the player is on the fast side. Skipping tracks is instantaneous and selection of tracks happens without noticeable delay (my player is loaded to about 80% with 5000+ songs @192kbs).   There are a few things I didn't like about the Zen Touch though. First, the touch pad is rather sensitive and while this is great to scan through thousands of songs, it's bothersome when selecting a single entry.  The second weak point is the file organization on the player. All mp3 files are stored in one directory, which inevitably leads to some clashes for songs with the same name. I had to convert the ripped files with a little script to include the artist and album information in order to create unambiguous file names.  Battery capacity seems very good when the player is used as a player. Downloading songs or managing play lists on the other hand is using up a lot of battery power.   All things considered, I am very happy with the player so far.

<Title>Amazed
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently received a 40 GB Creative Zen Touch for Christmas. At first I was not very excited because I was really looking forward to getting an iPOD (only because it was popular, bad judgement on my part). After doing some research, I decided that the size of the Zen did not bother me considering the 24 hour battery life that it offered.  I opened the box, charged the Zen in four hours and started to use it right away. I downloaded the software that was packaged with the product but I do not ever use it. Windows Media Player 10 has a feature that connects with many MP3 players. This feature allows me to download music in to my Zen easily.  In all the reviews that I have read, everyone has complained about the sound quality of the headphones. I have been using them since I've gotten it and I think they sound very good. My only complaint is that they are a little big so they don't fit comfortably in my ears but this isn't even a problem with the player.  I am so thankful that I chose to keep it. When I arrived to school on Monday, there was an abundance of kids with their iPODs and iPOD minis. I am glad that I am not one of them. I have even received compliments for not being like everyone else.  In conclusion, I am very grateful for my Zen and I recommend it to everyone.

<Title>If you have an existing large mp3 collection, DO NOT BUY!
<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wonderous Creative Inc fails to notify buyers of the Creative Zen Touch 40GB that all files in your music library get copied to ONE single ROOT directory on the player (Read: No Subdirectory functionality whatsoever). The only way to sort your new glorious one directory jukebox is by id3 tags. For those of us who have been using mp3s since the internet was born, we made a habit of deleting id3 tags because they were RARELY uniform accross the CDDB. Sometimes they seemed like they were written by people who could only type with a rubber mallet in one hand and a basketball in the other. Or they would classify Bach under grunge.  Lessons learned: Id3 tags are as only as good as their authors, and any kind of naming/classifying standards for music have yet to be developed.  Oh yea, and the touch pad pretty much eliminates any kind of in car usage.

<Title>a good player, but flawed...
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i really do like this player; it's great, super-fast (near-instant boot time, fast shutdown) and the battery life is stellar: i drove from austin to dallas and back--5 hours of driving--playing 128-to-320kbps VBR mp3s and the battery is still at 3 bars (out of 3.)  the problem i have with it is that the touchpad is just annoying.  even at lowest sensitivity, it's far too easy to accidentally scroll up or down by 2 items instead of 1.  i would say 90% of the time when i try to make the tiniest possible gesture, it either doesn't scroll or scrolls by 2 items.  what really gets me, though, is that the touchpad is just not the right mechanism for this.  if it were obviously a great idea that just needed a little tuning, i'd be fine with it.  but really, a set of four buttons--up, down, page up, page down--would be better in every way.  with the touchpad, you have to be looking at the player to use it.  i know my way around many of the context menus without looking at them, now, but i *have* to look at them since i don't know, using the touchpad, how far i have scrolled if i don't.  with buttons i could easily click 'down' 3 times and know where the cursor was.  this is actually a pretty serious problem while driving.  i didn't know this until i got the player, but the touchpad is divided into 3 regions; the top third is for "fast upwards scrolling", the middle for "precise scrolling" and the bottom for "fast downwards scrolling."  so they've already discretized this supposedly-analog touchpad, and even then it's often hard to use even on low sensitivity.  with buttons, problem solved.  one nice thing about the touchpad is that with a very fast, full-pad swoosh downwards or upwards you can scroll through a hundred or more items instantly.  but you could set up the page up and page down buttons so that if you held them for more than a few moments, they rapidly started scrolling up or down, and it would really be just as effective.  other reviews say things like "the touchpad is not bad once you get used to it" or whatever.  first of all, i'm unconvinced; i've been using this thing every day for several weeks now and it's still irritating to use: i'll seriously scroll up and down by 2 items 4 or 5 times just trying to home in on the item between them, which is frustrating.  but furthermore, the fact is the touchpad is completely unnecessary.  buttons would be better in every way.  seems like creative made the touchpad decision more to copy the iPod than because it was actually a good design idea, which is unfortunate.  nonetheless, like i said, i love the player; the sound quality is good, the size is nice, the battery life is incredible and the integration with my windows xp machine is really pretty seamless.

<Title>not durable
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this product for my husband's birthday.  Unfortunately, he only had it 2 days before an accident occurred in which the belt clip slipped from his belt and the player fell about 2 feet to our tile floor.  This 1 fall seems to have wrecked the player.  I might have done better to purchase a $300 brick.  I am currently researching methods of somehow rescuing the player without paying the exhorbitant repair fees charged by Creative (since the warranty doesn't cover anything that isn't Creative's "fault"--as if poor durability isn't their fault).  I have heard that the I-pod can sustain several falls without severe problems, and if I had known of the Zen's poor durability before my purchase, I would have bought the I-pod instead.  So: head's up if you're considering this purchase.

<Title>Great Player - Great Value
<Date>Thu Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my 40gb zen-touch for a week and couldn't be much happier.  In response to the review about the root structure....I think this is only an issue for the most intense 1% of users.  You can locate files by artist, album or genre, so unless you REALLY need to have sub-genre folders to separate cool-jazz from be-bop in your jazz folder, it won't be an issue.    I've got 6,200 tracks loaded (that's 490 albums) and still have over 9gb of space remaining.  I've been running for 20 hours on my most recent charge, and there's still a bit of juice left.  The style is slick, and the convenient lock switch on the top of the player will easily eliminate any un-intentional scrolling when in transit.  The touch-pad IS a bit sensitive, but that's about the only complaint I might have (and a minor inconvenience at that).    With double the memory and double the battery life of a similarly priced i-pod, the zen-touch is a great product.  Treat it with respect (i.e. avoid drops from height on hard surfaces) and you'll be pleased with your purchase.

<Title>iPod be damned...
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I brought this player in early January after a LOT of research.  I was really looking for something in the 20gb - 40gb category that could handle all of my mp3s, as well as backing up some of my data files.  And when I research, I REALLY research.  I was first interested in the Sony NW-HD1 for it's sleek, small design.  Then I leaned towards an iPod for both it's popularity and it's design.  At the end of the day, I went with the Zen Touch, because it claimed lengthy battery time, large disk space and exceptional sound.  So far, it has exceeded my expectations.  I listen to my music as I work in 4-6 hour strecthes, and I'm still listening to that music on my first charge.  Sound is fantastic.  The earphones provided aren't brilliant quality, so do yourself a favor and fork our for the Sennheiser PX 100 or PX 200.  Be aware that the player recognizes audio files by their id3 tags, and not by file name.  It takes a little time filling out missing ID3 tags in the supplied program, but it is well worth in the end -- because it gives you the ability to choose by song, artist, album and genre.  I have found the touch pad a breeze to work with.  Maybe it's because I was forewarned about its sensitivty, but it's pretty easy to get a handle on.  Unit response time is lightning fast.  I only experienced a slight lag between songs when I skipped through dozens at a time.  Now for the bad part:  The supplied software is okay for managing music, but is near impossible to manage data files.  And even as a music manager, it is needlessly complicated.  I uploaded all my data files, only to have them stuck there and unable to be deleted or added to.  This was a problem I worked at for days, with no solution.  Turned out that the 'Nomad Explorer' softwareis just generally terrible.  An ESSENTIAL program to go with your Zen Touch is Red Chair Software's NOTMAD Explorer -- it handles both music and data files easily, with a simple drag-n-drop interface.  Since using Notmad Explorer, I've had no problems with the unit or its functionality.  Unlike iPod, the Zen Touch feels expensive.  It's tough, well-designed and durable.  I've used an iPod before and it felt like a kid's toy.  The Zen Touch is something you'll feel compelled to be careful with.  Although, I take mine to the gym for my weight training and cardio workouts.  I wouldn't suggest sprinting with it or throwing it around, but it is very well-built.  The only reason this product gets 4 stars, instead of 5, is the terrible software included.  But if you pay the extra to get the independently produced Notmad Explorer, then the software bugs are a non-issue.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Great purchase
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this product for 2 weeks and I am very happy with it so far. I wanted a player that read wma, had at least 40gb, a good battery and easy navigation. On all aspects the player scores very high.  I use windows media plyer 10 to transfer the music and nomad explorer to rename some of the wrongly catgeorised mp3s. Overall it works well. I used to own the Gmini 220. This was such a bad player. It had only one good feature: the file tree structure. All the rest was crap (battery, speed, stability). This one is fast, and i have not had to reset it once in 2 weeks although I have been listening to it a lot.  HIGHS - Price - Very good built quality - Capacity - Speed of navigation. I read many reviews on the touchpad. True it is sensistive but i think it works fine. It is very easy/quick to find your song (i.e. to scroll through your entire collection) and then it is easy enough to select the exact song you want (i  do not use the touchpad "tap to select" option - i did not find it useful). Also, this machine is used to listen to music not scroll down and up for hours... - Battery - Amazing - Sound - very good. The bass are not pronounced enough though. It lacks a "boost bass" option. The EQ function is not very useful to increase the bass as it distorts the music too much.   LOWS - The firmware is not as evolved as the one used on the Zen Micro (the player is not recognized as a hard drive directly, the touchpad is more sensistive than the Zen Micro) - It is thicker and heavier than an ipod - Headphones: Apparently it is not good. I have not tried them. I use the etymotic er6i, which are amazing. I used to own a noise-cancellation hp. This is much better and much more convenient to carry when you travel.  Conclusion I would defintely recommend the player if you are looking after WMA playback, Capacity and battery.

<Title>Better design, but locks up all the time.....
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had a Zen xtra 40gb player that was great except for the toggle switch.  The Zen Touch fixed this with the touch scroller, but it is a little hard to get a handle on.  Sound was great using 3rd party earbud headphones or when connected to another stereo.  Industrial design/build/feel of the unit is greatly improved over previous versions.  Skip using the included software and just use Media Player 10 for free - works much better for organizing music and keeps all the same details on the player as well - cataloging, file extensions, etc.  The BIG problem with mine and my neighbor's 20gb Zen Touch is that it constantly locks up while playing.  You can hear the disk spinning/grinding.  Neither unit has been dropped and we have run scan disks and are running the latest firmware.  I am returning my today!  iRiver will be next on my list.....

<Title>Great Product ....
<Date>Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my zen touch for about 2 weeks now, and overall I'd say I'm very pleased with the product.  The design, while a complete ripoff of the ipod, is still functional and useful.  (with the exception of a "random play all" button on the front of the device)  The features involing the firmware are pretty much identical to the ipod as well; music library, artist, album, etc.  Finally, I can say from personal experience that the sound quality is actually superior to that of the new generation of ipods.  A close friend of mine had just purchased a brand new 40 gb ipod and we tested them both (pretty much for bragging rights) over several mediums including my fm transmitter, a/v cable input, and headphones.  We both agreed unaimously that the zen touch sound clearer with better bass response.  All that being said, the zen touch DOES have a tendency to hang up at times, especially while uploading music to it.  I've already had to reset it 3 times.  (This doesn't erase anything, but does require a paper clip or something similiar to stick into the "reset slot."  Hopefully once all my music is on the player I won't run into this problem.  One more thing, kudos to the file-transfer program included with the player, it has a pretty simple interface that only takes a little getting used to.  In addition, you can modity the files on the player from your PC!  I'm not quite sure if you can do that on the ipod, but it would be news to me.  Hope this helps.  ****Update****  Turns out my USB port was messed up.  Now that I fixed the problem it works perfectly and I can upgrade this puppy to a perfect 5 out of 5.  I've had it for 4 months now and I can honestly say that I couldn't imagine life without it.
