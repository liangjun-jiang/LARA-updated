<Product Name>Coby MP-C582 Clip MP3 Player 1 GB - Red
<Title>Only positive is the clip
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player because of the clip on feature which is great.  Other than that it has a cheap feel to it, it's hard to skip songs or adjust the volume while running or exercising without unclipping it and looking at it, and the buttons have a loud clicking sound to them.  It says the rechargable battery will last 5 hours and it hasn't so far.  The USB adapter to charge the battery and add songs is not a cable, more like a bulky flash drive and it won't fit into the front ports on my computer so I have to plug it in the back....it's a pain unless you have easy access to the back of your pc.

<Title>Fun Stuff

<Content>My grand children love these. Only problem is that some of the songs are MP4 and won't download onto these.  But the joy I have watching my 6 year old  grandson ... singing off key to  secret Asian man.... is priceless!

<Title>Economical No nonsense MP3s

<Content>I bought this for the purpose of having a cheap alternative to the Nano/Shuffle.  It does that.  It is a no-frills, no nonesense MP3, no LCD and the battery life is satisfactory.  Only complaint would be the clip is not too functional if you intetnd on moving a lot - it will slip and fall off.  But the function vs. price rating is very high.
