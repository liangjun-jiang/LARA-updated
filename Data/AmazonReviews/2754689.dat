<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only  time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5917596-0711604">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Can't go wrong
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player so I have nothing to compare this unit to.  I can't imagine anything that could be any better in this price range.  This unit is amazing. The sound quality is excellent.  It is a recorder, an FM player and audio book player.  The size of this unit is so tiny.  This is a perfect item for the gym or for walks.  Out of the box, easy to operate. You won't be sorry if you purchase it. This is a perfect gift.

<Title>Outstanding MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Sansa Clip 2GB about two weeks ago.  I was replacing an old 128 MB RCA MP3 Player.  I wanted something that was compatable with WMA files.  I did my research and found this player to have excellent reviews on numerous sites.  I have not been disappointed.  It is very easy to load music.  You can use Windows Explorer to drag and drop existing music files from your windows directories or you can use Windows Media Player to "Sync" music from your libraries.  I do wish that Windows Media Player was more user friendly, but that is not Sandisks problem.  Windows Media Player does allow you to Rip from CD and sync to the Sansa Clip without using Explorer.  I can't say enough about the sound quality.  With the built in equalizer, it is easy to customize the output.  I have been very impressed with the included earbuds.  I compared them with some Sony earbuds that I used with my previous player and the Sansa earbuds were superior by far.  I have been especially impressed with the range of the player/earbuds.  I can hear things in the music that I cannot hear with regular speakers.  When I first bought the player, I was thinking about buying some aftermarket earbuds, but I can't imagine that the sound could get significantly better than what I am getting with the included earbuds.  The phone plug on the earbuds was even gold plated.  I really like the display.  This gives you many options that would not be available without a display.  I can change settings, chose a particular song, navigate to different playlists, etc.  One thing I was disapointed with was the instructions.  I didn't think that it included enough instructions about loading music using Windows Media Player or about creating Playlists using Media Player. It took extra time to figure that out on my own.  Overall,  I have been extremely impressed by the Sansa Clip.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I just did a couple of days ago.

<Title>Great player for value
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  I own 1000+ CDs, and at age 37, consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I have listened to some songs from my phone, but never took the plunge to a dedicated MP3 player. Even after a few days, I don't know why I put this off.  First, moving music to the player was remarkably easy.  I just plugged it in, and the player showed up in Windows Explorer.  I copied MP3s from my computer, with no specific directory/file structure to follow, and they showed up, sorted correctly by artist/album/song, etc. No extra software to use!  No iTunes or WMP or Rhapsody or LockYourMusicIntoOurStore stuff!  Second, this is a fine interface. Yes, it is text-only.  But that is how I always listened on my phone anyway, I scrolled through the album titles and when I found the one I wanted, I hit "play". Naturally, if you REALLY NEED to see cover art, get a different player.  But if you are buying music, and not cover art (and also not little plastic disks and boxes), then get this player.  Now I have already purchased eight albums from Amazon in MP3 format, with no problems putting them onto the player.  Great playback quality, easy to use.  I won't go back... I can't go back...

<Title>beware of rip-off aspects of this device
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is cheap and easy to use, but comes bundled with a softwre music sales package that *you don't have to install to use the system* but which the documentation makes it sound like you must have to use it.  The Rhapsody system of BestBuy is the software it installs. This wouldn't be a problem, except the software requires you to pay a monthly service charge to use any of the music, and when you download (BUY) something, you will likely not get a set of files you can actually burn to a cd.  Oh, yes, it also overlays DRM on any media you have on your computer unless you say "no" during the long and onerous install process.  In general, cheap, but you are conned into paying lots and lots after you have it. In general, I say avoid. We got to sit through a lot of frustration trying to get the tech support to help. This is not a quality device. I would only recommend as a gift for someone you really don't like.

<Title>Beware Install Trouble
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good product, but the install process can be a mess (check the SanDisk forums, and you'll see there are a lot of people struggling). I have an XP machine and am computer savvy, but it took me 3 hours to get my computer to recognize this player and two frustrating and very unproductive tech support calls (they tried, but they ran me around in dead-end circles that did not make much sense). I *finally* got it to work by reading a random non-SanDisk website that said to turn the player to on, slide the bar to "hold," and then press the center button while plugging the device into your USB port. For some weird reason, that did the trick, even though never suggested by tech support. So, watch out, but if you can get it to install, it's a good deal.

<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was impressed with every aspect of this sansa mp3 player.  Pros:    - The navigation, buttons, and settings on this player are extremely easy   - The screen is crazy bright, I didn't expect to see the graphics / text so clearly on such a small screen   - The radio worked better then any other player I ever owned.   - Sleep timer   - Just plug and play on any computer. Drag and drop your music files (works like a flash drive).     - THE PRICE  Cons:     - Wish they had 4 Gig version, maybe next year

<Title>Very Good / Very Small / Very Simple - just what I need!
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB Black MP3 Player to replace my outdated SonicBlu Rio S30S 64 MB + 1 GB SD Card MP3 Player (which is great, but lacking USB 2.0, etc.)  Pros:  Compact Light Easy to navigate menus and buttons Great colour Physical volume button in excellent location 2 hr Charge time ~ 15 hr usage on a charge Easy drag-n-drop MP3 transfer (USB-Mass Storage Device) Very low price 2 GB is plenty of space for going to the gym or going skiing all day or in between jobs while in my work-van (using an FM transmitter for lack of CD Deck/Tape Deck/Line-in)  Cons:  My player had much difficulty in the first few hours.  The unit froze at the SanDisk graphic screen after unplugging it from a computer.  I had to search online forums to find out how to use a master reset and various other procedures to unfreeze the unit.  Then I had to go update the Firmware to the latest from the SanDisk website.  My iMac and my XP based PC work great with it, but when I plug it into my Win2000 SP4 laptop, it sees the device and directory structure of the unit, however, the \MUSIC folder is empty.  If I put it on to my XP or iMac machines, they see the contents of the \MUSIC folder.  I'm sure there isa work around or if you started using it with the win2000 machine you'd be okay.  Minor issue unless it effects your situation directly.  Overall:  Very Good player.  Exactly what I wanted, once firmware was updated and I learned how to do a master reset and such.  Make sure you update to the latest firmware immediately after purchasing.  I do not regret this purchase and I do recommend this unit to everyone, except those who wish to hold their entire MP3 collection on their portable unit.  ****/5

<Title>Gift from the Gods!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My recommendation is to buy this MP3 Player. Did you hear that? I'll say it more clearly: BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT!!!!!!   Background: This is my first MP3 player. I had been using a portable, plastic casette player with some cheap Sony headphones that had good sound if I pressed the earpads against my ears but had a problem with one of the earpad clips always coming loose. Other than that, I have been listening to a cheap pair of Logitech speakers on the computer and a cd/casette no-brand cheapo player in my living room--not the best set-up for an audiophile wannabe, right?  So, I left my backpack somewhere along with the casette player, the Sony phones and a Chinese language casette. I have an 8 cd Chinese language set, so I decided it was time to transfer the CDs onto an MP3 player so I could practice on the go, whilst entering the 21st Century, technologically speaking. I researched and researched and researched some more and all roads led to this player. Following one reviewer's suggestion, I bought the 2 GB rather than than the 1 GB, which for me is more suitable because of the amount of storage I'd like to have with me.  So how is the player? Well, I'm ecstatic. This has to be a gift from the gods (for me anyway). The size of the unit (smaller than my thumb), the clip, the display, the incredible functionality, ease of setting-up, ease of downloading, ease of re-charging, are all worth the purchase price. This said, what is the most miraculous thing about this gem is the SOUND! It delivers wonderful and big sound with a clarity I have not heard in years--it is as if I am discovering music (and sound itself) for the first time and it is an experience I can only describe as sublime.  I have a varied music collection and this plays everything from Electronica to Classic Rock to Classical well with EQ settings you can change yourself. My greatest surprises have been with vintage rock albums, albums I suppose were first recorded on vinyl, which play superbly. I listened to T. Rex's Electric Warrior, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's So Far last night and was amazed at hearing them and the music separation between the left and right phones--such a wonderful trip--listening to music as it was intended to be listened to--what a concept? Madonna's Ray of Light really allowed me to appreciate William Orbit's production--I heard things I had never heard before. Last but not least, my greatest amazement was listening to Opera. I selected the Classical EQ and listened to an Opera compilation CD entitled Aria: A Passion for Opera--the experience could only be described as revelatory. At one point I was listening to an aria from Puccini's Tosca and without warning tears just began flowing down my cheeks--all this from a player 1.25 x 2 inches. That experience alone was well worth the purchase price--everything that happens from here on is just GRAVY!  By the way, my 8 Chinese language CDs with about 8 hours of lessons, took no time to transfer to the Clip. 2 GB will hold about 30 hours of tunes and other material. The 2GB is actually for convenience, since you can easily delete from the device while it is attached to the computer so 1 GB would be fine if you don't mind the slight inconvenience of deleting music now and then--I'm telling you, this is really an amazing little device. The ipod shuffle suddenly seems like the stupid man or woman's portable music solution.  I have the player clipped to my collar and the earbuds in and I have to remember they're there. Whether listening to L'il Kim or Banco de Gaia, I'm groovin' with the sound. I have the black model, which I find aesthetically pleasing, and I just can't wait to experience the WOW! factor when I show this off to my friends.   Summation: 6 STARS on a 5 STAR scale

<Title>Basic player but great at what is made for.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am coming from a Sansa e250 that the headphone jack broke. The clip's music output is much better than that of the e250. Navigation is more cumbersome due to the smaller screen, but with playlists it is ok. Battery life is less than advertised but that is most mp3 players out there. Construction feels solid but then again so did my e250. Price and capacity are just what I was looking for. Very portable and at the gym it feels great since it doesn't get in the way. I recommend it for anyone that wants a simple music player for a great price. Sound quality is rival to those of much higher prices.

<Title>Best sound for the buck!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a bunch of these for gifts after Thanksgiving because they were are sale for $35. At this price they are disposable.  I own Sony,Apple,and Creative DAP's.  This is by far the best sounding of all them.  The sound is very rich and smooth compared to the Apple devices I own.  In order to get good sound out of an Apple device I have to rip at 192 kbs. I ripped a CD in WMA at 160 kbs and did a side by side comparison for over 3 hrs on three tracks.  The clip wins hands down.  I also compared the clip to a Sony with the same tracks at 64kbs Atrac.  I still think that Atrac is a superior format but Sony has discontinued support for Atrac and Sonic Stage is a pain to use.  I like the Shuffle because of the smaller size and sturdier clip but the Clip is just as small and has a better battery life.  Compared to a Apple 5.5 G, Nano 3G and Shuffle 2G the Clip has better detail.  It also nice to have FM radio. Which came in handy when I was listening to Classical radio and heard a piece last night on my car radio.  I wanted to hear who the composer was and didn't want to stay in the car to hear the composer.  It was the first time I used the radio on the Clip and found it easy to use and reception was as good as the car radio.  The navigation to find songs was easier than the Shuffle since the Shuffle doesn't have a screen. It fits under a hard hat or clips to a t-shirt for discrete listening when traveling or at work.  You don't know it is there.  I would recommend the clip to anyone that is looking for great sound that is discrete or works in environments that can beat up a DAP.

<Title>Little Giant
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased an unknown brand of MP3 player for $8.00 less and it lasted about 2 days then shorted out.  When I found this little giant of a player I had my doubts but after reading the other reviews decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  It is very user friendly and is extremely easy to program.  The sound is unexpected for such a small player (about 2 1/2" x 1").  Another great feature is that it is so light that it securely clips onto a pocket, shirt edge, or the lanard of my id badge at work without the need for any addtional holders or armbands. I also recommend purchasing the travel pack that includles an outlet charger, car charger,and silcone protective cover. This allows you to charge the Sansa Clip from a electrial outlet or your car so that if you are not near a USB port you can still charge your player for continuous listening pleasure. That "other" player could only be charged from a USB port, no additional chargers were available.

<Title>Money well spent
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Rating: Possible CON - I feel the build material could be a tad bit more robust. Considering this MP3 player is designed to be attached to your body as you are working out, I think the plastic casing might be a little fragile in the event the Sansa Clip falls to the floor. Then again, the MP3 player is so light that the force of it dropping probably wouldn't crack it. Actually, the only reason this thought came into my head was because my Beagle was eyeballing the SansaClip as it dangled from my computer case. I'm sure one crunch from my dog and this thing would be less than fully functional. Other than the small player being plastic(which is a completely minor gripe since the only small player I know of made of metal is the iPod Shuffle) I have no complaints and believe the device warrants a 5 star rating.  Size: The Sansa Clip is super small. Granted, it isn't quite as small as the small iPod shuffle, but any smaller and the player becomes too small in my opinion. With this size you still have a nice sized screen, easy to access buttons, and yet a small enough form factor to forget you've got it clipped to your shirt.  Features: I won't run down all the features because many people have done that. Suffice it to say, you won't find any MORE features available in an MP3 player of this size for the same money. The newer small iPods with the video can claim video play back, but those are larger than the Sansa Clip. I'd also contend that you wouldn't use video on such a small device anyway. I will say that my FM reception was good on strong stations, but only passable on weaker channels. Don't expect to get that college radio station with that weak signal. Still a handy feature to have especially if your gym puts the TV sound on an FM frequency.  Purpose: Very important is the idea that the Sansa Clip serves a distinct purpose, transportabitlity. The ultimate use for this device is to listen to music while being active. No more goofy armband cases for your $400 video iPod which is too heavy to be strapped to your arm. No more worrying about your iPhone falling out of its case as your go mountain biking. Just clip and go.  Value: $55??? Really?? All this for less than $60? That just says it all really. Imagine you're running with your $400 iPod video and the velcro strap comes loose. SMASH! there goes $400! Now let's say for the sake of argument that some how the Sansa Clip comes loose and smashes into the ground. You're only out $60! Seems like a steal to me.  Connectivity: When I first got mine I went straight to SanDisk's website to download the latest firmware (I don't think this was all that necessary, but it couldn't hurt). You download and intall the firmware updater (a self-running program which requires no effort on your part), then plug in your Sansa Clip. The program updates your device and asks you to unplug it. Done. When I plugged in my Sansa Clip (even before the update) Windows XP recognized it right away and gave me the typical window with choices for what action I wanted to take. I could have opened it in Windows Explorer, but I had other ideas. Each time I plugged it in I would get the same window so using the device is a snap, complete plug-and-play.  Transferring Music: Not recognized by iTunes (obviously) Recognized by Windows Media Player Recognized by WinAmp Recognized by MusichMatch Jukebox (version 10) Recognized by Windows Explorer for drag-and-drop transfers these are the only methods I tried I didn't install any programs and the device didn't come with any CD to load anything anyway. It seems the choice is up to the consumer on how to transfer music.  I used MusicMatch (the version just prior to the blackhole that is Yahoo's version after buying out MusicMatch). The jukebox recognized the SansaClip right away and I had full-functionality. I made a playlist and transferred 370 songs with room to spare. Disconnected and started listening.  Sound Quality: I will admit, I took one look at the included earbud headphones and didn't even bother unwrapping them. I already own several "good" headphones that I prefer. With my Bose Triport headphones the sound was as rich and full as my 80GB iPod video. For earbuds, I'd recommend pairing this device with Creative's EP-630's, they are cheap, light weight, and sound great.  Sansa Clip vs. iPod Shuffle (the small one): Has FM tuner, iPod does not Has screen to view song information and change settings, iPod does not Has 2GB, iPod will but not just yet Has on-the-go playlists, iPod does not Let's you choose song, artist, etc., iPod cannot Costs $55, iPod WAS $79 now $49 but is still only 1GB (2GB version forthcoming) Has a clip, iPod has a clip too! Comes in different colors, iPod does too!  I think the choice is clear.  Hope this review was helpful.
