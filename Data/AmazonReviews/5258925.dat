<Title>So far I like it.
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Meizu for about a month now, and I like it fine so far.  I bought it to replace an iAudio G3 that couldn't stay out of the repair shop.    The sound quality is good, but there are a bunch of audio controls to play around with to get the sound the way you want it.  The battery life seems good too - around 12 to 15 albums worth of life I would guess.    There are a lot of features to this unit.  Some of which I probably will never use.  The video feature is one.  The Meizu comes with a little commercial preloaded, and I played it just to see how the unit works.  The picture is bright and sharp.  It also has picture storage and some stuff like a calculator and some games.  I can't see me ever wanting to use them though.  The FM Tuner is pretty good.  You can turn on and off the stereo reception, which is great for listening to stations where the signal is not strong enough to sustain a stable stereo signal.  The one drawback to the the Meizu 4GB (and one that someone else mentioned too) is that control pad is a bit too sensitive.  Scrolling up and down can be frustrating when you keep blowing right on by the selection you want.  Perhaps there will be a firmware upgrade at some point to fix that.  The one feature that I would like and the Meizu doesn't seem to have is a "Auto play next" type of thing.  The iAudio G3 I had could be set so that when one album was finished, the player would just continue with the next album.  The Meizu will just stop at the end of an album and you have to navigate back the main menu and select another album. Most people wouldn't care about this, since they just use the player to play single songs - like we used to do with 45rpm records - throw on a stack of 45s and you were happy.  But I tend to use the player to listen to whole albums, so the feature I've mentioned would be great.  All that said, the main reason I traded away from the iAudio was for dependability and durability.  The Meizu seems solidly built where the iAudio felt a bit flimsy.  Thanks to the dog, the Meizu has hit the floor a couple of times now, and hasn't skipped a beat.  But - the iAudio lasted 6 months before the onslaught of problems began.  This Meizu is only a month old, so we'll see.  So far so good.

<Title>Meizu is a great Rival to the iPod
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this lil' player. It's affordable and the size is convenient. I think Meizu will give Apple a run for their money if they keep this up. I didn't get it from this site, but I got it from J&R in Manhattan, NY and the salesman who recommended it was 100% correct about this player being the best. It's loud enough for you not to have to buy all different types of headsets, you can adjust the volume limit, watch videos, add pics, play your music. It's just off the hook. Pick one up if ya can.

<Title>Good Buy!!!
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: Very compact, sleek very nice cosmetic features. The menu options are fairly straight forward and esay to use. Music and video playback quality is very good. The battery life is quite acceptable. The FM tuner gives a fair receptions indoors and outdoors. Creating a playlist is very easy. All in all this is a very good alternative to an ipod at a much more reasonable cost. This product gets an A. Cons: The touch pad is very sensitive so you have to be carefull when scrolling through menu and selecting options. There's a slight learning curve in order to adjust volume in the video mode and fast forward/rewind in the music mode. To delete files you have to attach the player to your computer. But with all this said it is still a wonderful product.

<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>MEIZU'S ARE GREAT! no fuss with new software on your computer, its just a simple cick and drag action to load songs and photos. i have made 2 mistakes with it though...when using it with your cmputer for the first time make sure to turn it on after you hook up the USB, i freaked out thinking it wasnt connecting, but hadnt realised i was just being stupid by not turning it on aswell. also, the screen scratches really easyily so keep it in its little case if your putting it in your pocket or bag. im currently searching for protective carry cases for it but havent yet found one that protects the screen as well, but all in all, the meizu is perfect!

<Title>Superb! Nothing can beat the quality and price.
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this unit has superb sound and video quality.  The supplied ear buds are just fine and you don't need to buy anything else. The sound volume can be adjusted to this side of blowing your brains out.... yeah, with deep bass!~  Software suck big time along with the instructions. Ignore the software and manual and just play with the unit until you discover how it works. Chinese to English translation by a software engineer is about bad as it can get. I don;t know why they don't spend a few bucks and hire some English person to go over the manual after the translation.   They got the software from the net FREE that's included on the cd disc installation. It's not made for an average person and I guarantee that you don't know what to do with it. The player software did not install and can not be found or any way to install where you could convert video to their format. All you have is a bunch of tools that's useful for programmers and make no sense to any of us. Even so, their conversion section is crippled and the video conversion plays 90 degree offset. I have no idea what was the reason for this. Your video plays sideways! It's soooo idiotic this software that I removed it immediately. Still trying to find something else to do the convertion, but no luck so far. None is accepted by the player.  Let me say this again; the software for video conversion is sooooo bad and makes no sense at all. It does not convert correctly and there is no help on their site. The entire software is totally idiotic. If you are interested in videos for this player, either find a convertion software that works of buy a ZUNE player. Seems to me that these mfg, including other name brands are going out of their way to have screwy convertion and difficulty to make a simple convertion to video.  However.... This little unit does everything I need and works flawlessly.... right now. All music plays pristine clear but I haven't been able to add any video with their software. It's nothing but a nightmare to add a simple video. Clearly, this product will not accept video by converting well. I managed to convert with great difficulty some video but I would not recomend it to anyone to go through all that nonesense.  Still, it's a hit an miss to download video and am not able to do a good copy that plays. This is not to say that the video is bad, on the contrary, the promo video is just gorgeous, clean, sharp as a razor blade. So, the potential is there to see great video, but how to get there is a mystery. It would have taken a little effort to write a converter or just play WMV files. It's not that big of a deal.  Company support is zilch.... nada. They're in China. They really don't speak English and the company is small.  There is a meizu forum of sort, where you can see the struggle of people having a hard time with the unit. Mostly video problem. Go find it and read the problems. Then make a decision if you're interested to fight this thing.  If you want music and still pictures then it's a good deal. Trasfers are simple drag and drop as mentioned. Screen colors and resolutions are astounding. Don;t let the small size fool you. You can watch movies with great clearity and wall to wall sound... providing it will accept the correct format.   Update: a few days later. As much as I like this unit for it's great sound and small frame, I think a Zune would have been better for video and the ease of transfers. I think that's going to happen when the new Zune will be available after October 2007.  AS with any Chinese products, the software is really bad. Instructions or manuals are equally bad. For support, don't look to them. You're on your own. I still give 5 stars for the function of the unit and three zeros for the software and user interface... that's worthless.

<Title>Wonderful MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Meizu Miniplayer is very good all round.  I have used it connected to speakers as well as an FM transmitter in the car for playing audio files.  The battery life has been good, about 15 hours.  The sound is very good with a tendency to have more bass as the volume of the player is turned up.  With the FM transmitter I am using, if the volume on the player is too high, some songs will get clipped or compressed at times, making a static sound.  I have restricted the volume to 37 out of 40 and that mostly fixes it for me.  The controls are sensitive but easy to use, although they are too sensitive to try to use while driving.  It is easy to connect and copy files from the computer by simply dragging and dropping.  If you connect the player while turned off it will only charge, so it needs to be on before connecting if you wish to move files.  The video and picture quality is very good and the video converter software is easy to use to compress and turn the video to fit the screen.  The video converter software also works well under Linux using Ubuntu 7.10 and Wine 0.9.46.

<Title>No hassle and very easy to use.
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice product at a reasonable price. No headaches, no mess or hassle with annoying software and no freezing up and constant resetting like other more expensive players that I have purchased in the past. All you do is plug it into your computer, drag and drop the music you want and listen. it is as simple as that. i myself love technology and am very literate when it comes to electronics and computer technology, but the no-hassle, no mess attitude that this player has is very intriguing. People who can't figure out certain electronics and other technology easily won't have to worry about that with this product.

<Title>Nice Product  and I like it
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the product very much and recommend it as well.  Features/Cons:    High in performance,   Slick design, light weight,    Nice quality of the product,   Very good display,    Long battery life,    Quality of headphone and other stuff is excellent.    Controls are very good,   Menu options and navigations is very good.    Audio Recording Quality is also sensitive and good.  Improvement needed:-    1) FM does not work outside the US - I assume it has not got a dual    frequency mode FM  - however, when you are out of country, least you like listening FM but more the stored songs and for this MP3 player quality is excellent.     2) Battery charging does not show the actual charged level. This causes me to check player's screen every time before removing, has it been charged? As it shows charged fully at the end only.    3) There is no facility to search a particular song. So, if you have around 900 songs loaded, to listen a particular song, you need to browse through a whole list! I am not sure if this feature is available in other brands. But it really helps in case a long list of songs and where browsing of songs in not that easy like in this set.   4) Manual print quality is cheap, descriptions of the instructions is also not good.  Problem:   1) Viewing a photo is slow, get very slow, even system gets hang, when you load a high resolution photos like of 7 mega pixels or higher or movie. This behaves similar even when you are browsing the photos-because it shows thumb nails of the loaded photo.   Overall an excellent audio player but the video player is average.

<Title>Great Device/ Poor Software
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, So I spent weeks researching MP3 players. I read every review I could, and finally settled on this little machine. It's got a great look, great size, just what I needed as far as storage capacity goes(4GB). The screen is large in relation to the overall size of the player. The picture is sharp and the sound is clear. I loved it...until I started to use it. I AM NOT tech savvy. So some of you computer geeks may be rolling your eyes at this post, but I have had a VERY TOUGH time trying to get this thing to do even half the stuff it's supposed to do. Video downloading is a nightmare. I can download all the music I want from CDs I've ripped to my hard drive, but I can't put a single song on there downloaded from the internet. The overall installation was not near as smooth as my wife's Sansa clip. The user manual is worthless and unless you understand computer speak most of the online forums will be very little help. In short, unless your willing to spend some serious time with this gadget, I would recommend a more mainstream player.

<Title>Please don't waste your money....
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this Meizu Mp3 Player for my daughter for Christmas 2007. First, of all the controls are difficult to navigate, (a combination of buttons and touch controls) and the instructions were of no help.  Secondly, the unit worked for 3 hours and them the display went to French, scrambled then shut down after 2 1/2 hours.  We thought that the battery was just low so we charged it for 5 hours but the unit refused to turn back 'ON.'  We return it an bought another brand.  Please don't waste you money on this item when there are better quality units for a similar price.

<Content>I love this mp3 player.  It is extremely easy to use and the video works great.  I use it daily, especially for podcasts and educational videos.  I did have a little problem with the video software, but using the MeizuMe fansite I found software the was more user friendly with Vista.  I would definately get another one or give it as a gift.
