<Title>Very unhappy with the quality of this device
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for 2 reasons. One, my son had a similar, smaller version that he was very happy with. Second, I wanted a small flash player device that would work with Rhapsody and their Rhapsody to go service. Initially the player performed well. I was syncing about 90 songs which consisted of subscription and MP3s from my own CD collection. After I added a second playlist which was mostly subscription music, the player froze up. At first, I thought I had tried to sync too much music, but I was well under the 1 gig limit at 650 meg. So, I started doing all the usual things to reset the device (pop the battery, hit different control key combinations, etc.). But everytime I turned it on, it froze on the Sandisk screen which is the initial screen. After 1.5 weeks of working with Sandisk support, they decided to have me ship it back and they would send a new unit. The new unit arrived and things worked well for one day then the unit started to stop playing after each song and freeze. Popping the battery would unfreeze this time and I was able to follow technical support instructions by reformatting the device using Windows Media player and resyncing with Rhapsody. After the resync, the device froze again and now I cannot reset. I suspect that the problem has something to do with the Rhapsody service and the "Play for Sure" code, but that is only speculation. If I can't get my money back, I will try to get another unit and only sync it with MP3s. If that fails, I will crush it underneath the tires of my car and call it a day.

<Title>Waste of Money
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first bought this device it was for the FM recording capabilities. When trying to record stuff off of the radio, the instructions were pretty simple. Once finished my recording I listened to it back and the sound was VERY distorted and it skipped alot as if it was a CD player with no anti skip feature. If SanDisk is going to advertise this feature they should atleast make sure that it functions half-way decent. I was very dissapointed in this player

<Title>Good product for use and price
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for my dad so he could retire the CD player when jogging and traveling.  While I prefer the iRiver series, I chose this line for a few reasons:  1.  Buttons were larger and easier to maneuver. 2.  Music and radio functionality were available. 3.  Storage size is a good size to have enough variety of music. 4.  Price was more than reasonable. 5.  The unit runs on a battery so a battery change would only be necessary versus charging it.  In addition, I learned that this unit could carry photos and videos.  While unlikely to ever be used, it's there as an option.   Like other SanDisk products, this item does deliver on what it advertises to be.  The instructions for how to upload music is a bit confusing, but solved with the following:  I opened the unit as though it were a regular flash drive.  Thereafter, I opened the "Media" folder and clicked and dragged the music I wanted into the folder.  Simple enough.    The sound quality is fine (i.e., equalizer options) and the bright color screen allows for easy reading.  In addition, there is the option to listen to the radio if so desired.  The unit is small, light, and an easy companion for where ever it may go.   In the end, I wanted my dad to have something that was easy to use and delivered on quality.  SanDisk does both with the Sansa c140.

<Title>Froze after a week
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For a device with practically no moving parts, there is no excuse for it to freeze after a week of ownership, and barely an hour of use. If it would work, it could be just about my ideal mp3 setup. We'll see what happens if I am able to get it replaced...

<Title>Okay for the price......
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its an okay mp3 player. I like it. Its easy to use and easy to travel with. What I don't like about it is the triple A battery thing. I use my mp3 player A LOT, and I go through so many batteries it isn't funny. I'm thinking about selling it and getting a different model. Maybe one from the Sandisk Sansa e200 models. They are better and guess what?! They have a rechargeable battery. So if you don't plan to use this mp3 player often then by all means buy it. But if you're like me, find another brand!

<Title>After reading all the bad reviews I was leery about
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>buying this, but the used price of $55 was too good to pass up.  Figured to send it back if it didn't work well.  Don't buy this for the screen.  The color looks washed out and the edges are not very good for displaying.  The design is fairly easy to use and I have no problems hitting the right buttons through the pockets of my shorts.  This thing was SO easy to set up it was ridiculous.  You don't even need their software if you are using XP.  I had their songs off and mine on in 5 minutes using Windows Media Player.  The standard USB rule applies:  DON'T unplug it from the USB connection without first shutting down the port from Windows.  Like almost all USB devices it will hang if you do, and you will have a piece of scrap electronics if you do it enough times.  The sound quality is not particularly great.  My old Rio Sport, using technology from about 5 years ago, sounded better.  On the plus side, battery life seems very good so far.  I play it in a noisy health club so have the volume cranked up pretty good.  It has played MP3's for about 6 hours so far and the battery indicator is still almost full.  1GB is more than enough storage for me.  I have every song I would listen to more than once on it and have barely filled half the device.  Could have gotten by just fine with a 500MB unit but it's nice knowing I can dump a whole album (or 5) on it should something really good come out.  I wouldn't pay full retail for this, but if you can get it for under $75, go for it!

<Title>A great little player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa c140 is much smaller and easier to carry than a CD/MP3 player, and that is a plus for traveling. Several reviews below gave a low rating to the player's sound fidelity, but it sounds clear and rich to me on voice or music.  My main for purpose for using it  is voice Podcasts.  I have been using my player for about three weeks.  There are two volume levels in the Settings.  The highest volume in the default or low setting is not very high.  This means any background noise can easily overshadow what is playing.  Changing to the higher level is a distinct help when walking along the street or listening on an airliner.    Several previous reviewers also complained about short battery life.  The AAA alkaline battery that came with the unit gave out before its listed time, but it may have been weak from sitting on a shelf.  The battery meter in the display does not give any reliable clue as to when the battery will fail.  Always carry a spare battery with you, especially if you are using rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise, it seems to be a great little unit and I am looking forward to getting a lot of use from it.    The player is easy to use without installing the factory software.  As long as "MTP" shows on the screen when connected by cable to the computer, just drag and drop files.  It does not matter if files are in a folder or not.  The player finds and plays them in alphabetical order.  If properly shut down, it remembers where you stopped and begins there the next time the player is used.  It will even save your place during a reasonably quick battery change.  When a battery fails, the player starts again at the beginning of the file playing when the battery failed.  The PDF manual on the software disc is far more detailed than the printed quick start guide and is worth reading soon after your purchase.  It is not difficult to navigate the menu, but a little practice makes use of the controls much easier.  The FM radio feature is nice to have.    The voice recorder works well.  Files are stored in the Record folder in the unit's memory.  You are supposed to be able to play them on the player, but I had to move them to my computer first.  The files appear with a WAV extension on the player, but appear on the computer as MP3 files.    The microphone does not produce a loud recording and must be held close to the mouth, making it easy to get a lisp on the recording.    The player will not accept an external memory card, but with 1 GB of internal memory, it is large enough to hold an entire MP3 audio Bible.

<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the sandisk c140 mp3 player is a very good mp3 player (nowhere close to as good as an ipod but....) here is the run-down  pros   1. cheap!   2. good sound quality   3. very user friendly   4. very easy to download music  cons   1. runs on 1 AAA battery instead of a rechargable lithium-ion battery pack, so its pretty expensive to keep it runnin  in the end its a very good mp3 player, i love it

<Title>Bad player. Zerro reliability.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bougth this player almost one year ago. From the first minute I was dissapointed by the sound quality. Compares with old cassette player (not even with the worst cd player). Battery average life was under 10 hours.  Doesn't connect directly to USB (had to carry always with me the cable huge connector). Documentation is poor. It took me over 2 months of web research to find out how to create playlists (you sinply transfer the .m3u files to the root of the audible folder). Finally after 10 months the player is broken. After a media transfer with my pc it was never stopped updating the storage so the only sollution was to take out the battery. After restart the player was FROZEN with the last song played before the media transfer and the battery level on red (no control working, not even the power button). I wrote to the sandisk support twice (they never responded to the phone either). Buying again from SanDisk? NEVER!!!

<Title>Great inexpensive MP3 starter for pre-teens!
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased these for my 10 and 11 year olds for their birthdays coming up soon.  This was my first experience with MP3 players as well as theirs-and I didn't want to spend IPOD money on a player until I knew they would take care of them.  The sound quality is great, it's easy to load songs, and it's nice to have a screen.  For some reason, I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger of a unit, but that doesn't matter at all.  It's also nice that it offers an FM radio as well (and the reception was good too!). I figure we can always upgrade from here in the future, but it IS a great product-If they won't loan me theirs, I would definately buy the same one for myself!  I did read all reviews-pros and cons-and as with ALL electronics, anything can happen....But, so far, so good!!

<Title>Mine's frozen...
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my C140 for a few months now with no problems - no distortion issues no trouble moving files to it.  HOWEVER, with doing absolutely nothing to it, my C140 is now frozen.  I can power it off but it's as if the hold button is on.  I can't forward to the next track, reverse to the last track - play and pause do nothing...  It's stuck at 1:06 of the last song I played.  It's toast...
