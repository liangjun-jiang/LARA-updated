<Title>Great player
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>People who are afriad to take thier Ipod, cellphone or other expensive player to the gym or trail running will love this option. I picked up the "Nightmare Before Christmas" version. I had low expectations, owing to a consumer review that said the sound quality was poor. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this player performes very well, the sound is great, and the controls are easily mastered.   The player has an on/off switch, repeat and shuffle buttons, and a typical skip forward, skip backward, play/pause volume up and down layout.   The lanyard my player came with was a plastic lanyard which does not easily pull off. the lanyard's materials do not absorb sweat or odor.   I did not use the included earbuds- I had several pairs of my own already that I preferred.   I also did not use the included software- I doubt it will run on my Windows Vista system, but the songs are easily placed on the player as though it were a thumbdrive.   The built-in rechargable battery has more than enough power between charges- I've used mine off and on for a couple days between charges. The manual says you can expect 8-10 hour playtime continuously.  Pros: Solid player, inexpensive and unique.  Ease of use. Slot for SD (most inexpensive media available) in case the included memory is lacking. Laynard is durable.   Cons: Software is out of date, no LCD screen of any kind. The player's fast forward is difficult to use, so picking up a podcast or audio book where you left off is difficult; the player automaticly returns to the beginning of a song or chapter when the player is powered off.   All in all, it is no ipod replacement. However, if you are looking for a first MP3 player for a child or one that you can have at the gym or out running, this is a great choice.

<Title>Perfect 1st Time MP3 Player for 6yr old

<Content>My 6yr old daughter carries this around with her everywhere.  I had no problem transferring files onto the player and can download around 15-25 songs depending on the length of the songs, without having to purchase an additional sd card.  Great, durable, and cute!

<Title>Perfect for a child's first MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My 11yo daughter loves it!  It has a decent battery life, charges quickly, and it is very easy to add/remove songs.  I ended up buying one for myself, it is perfect for me.  I also have a sansa, but didn't use the picture or video features at all, so I gave that one to my 17yo, since she likes to download movies and pics to it.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I hate ear buds, and these are ok headphones for a child, but I had to get some better ones.
