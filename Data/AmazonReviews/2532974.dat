<Title>Stupendous Little Gizmo
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm very pleased with my S5 the first day I got it.  From a design perspective I still like the old YP-K5's simple/retro speaker design but overall the S5 is slimmer, lighter and cheaper compared its old predecessor.  The headphones that came along looks very stylish and also doubles as an antenna for the fm radio but it falls out of my ear every now and then when I use it.  The interface is surprisingly user-friendly and the new blue-tooth connectivity is a pretty nice addition.  Only cons I have found so far are 1. The graphic equalizer is very sluggish, 2. Video file compression has some audio quirks/delays when I tried converting AVI movies into the player, and 3. You can't turn the on/off animation screen off.  On the plus side you've got a nice slim mp3 player with a built-in speaker and microphone, a very user-friendly drag and drop file browser, fm tuner, blue-tooth, image and text viewer, voice recorder, alarm, world clock, games and a very useful audio-in adapter in case your friend forgets his/her headphones for his/her mp3 player :D

<Title>The most versatile mp3 player ever!!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This mp3 player is loaded with features!!  The interface is intuitive and responsive and the display is crisp and clear, albeit a bit small.  This slim player fits easily into your pocket or the palm of your hand.  The FM recording recording function is a big plus for me.  Other cool features are a sleep timer and, get this, an alarm!!  You can wake up to your favorite song every morning.  However the thing that really sets this player apart from all the others is the SPEAKERS!!  The speakers  are attached and slide out from behind the unit.  This makes it easy to share your music with friends or to listen when earphones aren't convenient.  These speakers are surprisingly clear and loud for their size.  Blue Tooth is an added bonus, so you can use blue tooth enabled head phones or external speakers.  Oh, did I mention it also plays mp3 and wma's??  All of this bundled into a cool, light weight, smart package!!  Good job Samsung!!

<Title>iPOD's beware
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter wanted a new MP3 for Christmas, but as she had one that still worked, we told her she needed to save her Christmas money and buy her own.  She did all the research on several different sites and chose the samsung YP-S5JAB over everything else in that price range (under $200.).  She loves the new MP3.  Wanted it to come before school vacation was over so she could have time to load all her music, but it took less than 3 hours to have the 2GB of music she had stored on the computer all loaded and named.  She loves the built in speaker feature, and although she's tried all sorts of earphones, she likes the way these fit and how they feel.  I would give this MP3 a 5 star rating, and would tell anyone looking for an MP3 in that price range to look no further.

<Title>Great Sound
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the product for a little while now and the sound is great.  I am very impressed with the quality of the speakers, being that they are so small.  The only thing I don't like abou it is there are too many screens to go through to get to what you want. there also doesn't seem to be a way to search through a song.  Other than those minor issues, this is a great mp3 player.

<Title>Great for audiobooks and traveling
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched MP3's for several weeks after having a bad experience with the Creative Zen V Plus. My primary interest in an MP3 is to listen to audiobooks, downloaded from my local library for free, while traveling. I wanted it to be easy to use and to have good bookmarking features. I narrowed my list to those recommended on the library's link to Overdrive, the service they use for books.    I got what I wanted and more with this great little unit. First, it looks cool (though I wish the shiny surface didn't get so marked up with fingerprints). Books are easy to download. I like the feature that allows you to shut off the player and return to where you left off in a book or song when you turn it back on. Bookmarking is easy as long as you remember what track you were on (if you want to listen to music after you listen to a book). It's easy to fast-forward or reverse.    It took a few minutes to get used to using a light touch on the touchscreen, but now I love it.    The battery lasted almost as long as my flight to Japan, and it recharges quickly. I do recommend getting a plug-in charger for travel if you aren't taking your computer.    It's great to be able to set the FM radio to various countries--I recorded songs from the Japanese radio stations to play as background for my slides--way cool! Fun to wake up to J-pop (Japanese popular music) while I was there (using the alarm feature).    Haven't used the bluetooth feature yet, and the screen is too small to enjoy videos. Seems like there is room so they could have made the screen larger.    Music quality is great, and it's fun to have the speakers. The earphones did take a little getting used to because of their shape, but they deliver wonderful quality sound.    Since I'm not very intuitive with products like this, I really appreciate the very thorough manual that comes with this, though you have to download it and print it yourself.     I recommend checking the various message boards on Amazon to get a variety of opinions before you purchase an MP3. I found them very helpful. I also recommend going to the company's website and taking a look at the manual to answer questions before purchase. In this case, it's samsung.com.     The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with a case and it's an odd size. I found a cool case in Japan.     All in all, I'm delighted with the size and features of this MP3 player and hope it lasts a long time.

<Title>really awsome mp3 
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second mp3 player my first one was a creative wav (2gig) but this one is much better. I dont know where to start at because there is so many things it does. The bluetooth is slow with large files such as songs and video, but it does work. Has built in games and customizable menu. Great sound and includes 7 band eq. The touch screen is some what sensitive but cool. In my opinion this mp3 player is better than any other mp3 player on the market including ipod and zune. The price seems high but well worth it
