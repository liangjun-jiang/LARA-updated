<Title>Great Step Up
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've rocked out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y7976/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-4812178-4699210">Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White</a> for a while and loved the mobility and such but figured since I'm heading off to an out of state college next year I'm gonna want more then 2GB storage space...which brought me to this iPod video. The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.

<Title>Battery life is horrible for music
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got the ipod 30g.  I had the dell digital dj 20g prior.  the dell would easily go 10 hours plus on one charge listening to music and advancing songs as often as you like.  I cannot even do one leg on a flight with the ipod.  I get 2-3 hours per charge at best and that is trying not to touch the unit and have backlight set to 1 second.  If it try to plug into my laptop in flight you cannot use while it is 'connecting' and never stops saying that even when set to manual.  I always heard that ipod had battery issues but thought the newer ones solved the problem.  I did look at the battery tips page and they do not help, not a good sign that they have a whole page dedicated to just that issue.  Mine is likely going back.  Amazing how many they sell of these with these issues.  unit looks good but not practical

<Title>catch up on your desperate housewives
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this the day it came out in the stores...not on purpose though. I was bringing my U2 edition ipod in to the Apple store to be fixed, and when I saw the quality of the graphics on this screen, I found myself in a semi-sort of trance handing my credit card to the cashier. So far, I have brought it to a pre-party for u2's concert, and we all watched the videos on my i-pod while it was plugged into the awesome Bose base....it was fun...great sound and fun to watch.... Also, I have caught myself being very content eating alone in thai food restaurants watching my missed Desperate Housewives episodes.....how fun is that? and no commercials too....easy to download videos, songs, pictures from your computer....I have the Kate Spade case (very reasonable price and it perfectly protects it) and it clips easy on my purse so I can listen all the time to my ipod.....only thing i recommend....phillips makes better ear buds than the ones these come with...i bought them for under $15 I think....Enjoy!

<Title>What's with the complaining?
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fantastic. For me, the battery life is solid, i've shuffled through songs for 5-6 hours without ever thinking about the battery, and last night i fell asleep with a 3/4 charge and forgot to turn it off, but was shocked when i woke up in the morning with music still playing. I have the white model and it looks great, people notice it a lot. I've had it for well over a week and still haven't taken the plastic screen protector off and I don't plan to until a skin comes out for this new model, and i recommend everyone else do the same, it's really hard to even notice that it's still on and the player is fully functional.  Yes you do have to tweak your videos before adding them, but you have to do this for most portable video players so I don't know why everybody is yapping. My only complaint is with adding photos to the ipod, there's no obvious way to add one photo at a time, you have to have a folder for the ipod to sync to, and delete and add photos accordingly, but its not that big of a deal. Overall i have been verry please with this product and recommend it to all.    Side note - everyone should realize that while customer reviews are very useful, people are much more likely to review the product if they have had a bad experience or a defective product than if they have had no problems, so the proportions of negative to positive reviews are somewhat skewed. Just something to keep in mind while reading reviews.

<Title>iPod Video 60 GB
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is undoubtedly the best iPod yet.  I have had the last three versions and this one is my favourite.  Like the iPod photo, the support for USB2 is much better that in earlier iPods (where there either was no USB support or if there was you still had to use a Firewire cable for power).  This version you can sync and charge via USB which is great as all you need on the move is the USB cable - you can normally find somewhere with a PC (or use your own laptop pc if you have it with you) with USB to charge up your iPod.    The screen is bigger so you can see your photos better and the iPod video is significantly thinner than the iPod Photo too which is great.  Width and Height seem pretty much the same as the previous iPod (with the exception of the screen which as mentioned is much bigger than before).  You can definitely watch movies on the video iPod.  I used it recently on a trip over to Europe and watched a few movies I had recorded on my Tivo video recorder on my iPod.  The quality is reasonably good and the battery life sufficient to watch a movie.  The current iPod is still a long way from ideal (I could easily list off a whole raft of improvements I'd like to see), but given the highly portable nature of the device, huge disk capacity and the not too unreasonable battery life its a very good effort at video, music and photos on the move.  Update Feb 2006: Having had this device a few months now, I remain very happy with it.  The main issue I have with it is the inability to play most video formats other than MP4.  Converting video into MP4 format to watch on the iPod is a pain.  If I go to considerable time and trouble I can do this using my PC, however it takes hours to convert a movie into MP4 and in my experience there are frequently conversion problems (e.g. sound getting out of synch with the video).  I'm hoping that the forthcoming support from Tivo for conversion of Tivo content for viewing on the iPod will make this simpler.  Until then (or until Apple upgrade the iPod firmware so that it can play back a wider range of video formats) I will probably continue to use my iPod mainly to listen to music rather than as a video player.

<Title>pretty good
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>when i first saw the video ipod online i was DYING to get one, but it's important for you to go and look at them in the store first.  this is my second ipod, my first one being a 4G mini. i bought the video primarily for more song space. the picture quality is great, even for the small screen.  however, i must say that i'm very disappointed in the scratch factor. i've only had mine for about 3 days and much of the faceplate has scratches on it. i have the black model and i'm seriously considering returning it for the white model, in the hopes that it will show less scratches. i've babied mine and there still remains to be numerous scratches.  any advice for returns?

<Title>disappointing
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Its an ipod and so, of course, you have to love it but... I was pretty annoyed to find that in order to transfer video to it I would either need to download from itunes store or buy a separate piece of software to do conversions. For $300 this baby really needed to include that. Also, the itunes that came with this one replaced my old itunes install but doesn't recognize my pre-video 20 GB ipod. This is causing some trouble as my husband and I share a computer but each have different generations of ipods. I still love the little guy. It's thin and the color screen is great but the annoyance factor is taking its shine off mighty quick.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 30gig unit in the middle of October.  Like most of us I was a little worried about scratching, because of the media blitz on the nano.  I pretty much keep it in its case and if it's in my pocket it is always in the case.  I find this being a little annoying, but I'm going to keep doing this until a better case is on the market.  The screen does have scuffs on it but by NO MEANS DOES IT IMPARE IT'S USE.    I haven't timed the battery life, but it has never been a problem where it has drained and I couldn't recharge.  Recharging seems quick. Sorry haven't timed it.  I purchased a video online and that whole process was about the same has music but a little bit longer.  I also copied a DVD to it and that took about 3hrs to encode.  Both the Pixar video and the DVD look great on screen.  I haven't tried it on my TV yet.   About three years ago I got tired of replacing cd's that I already have bought, so I copied my whole cd collection to my PC.  Unfortunately I did it with wma codec.  The process of converting my collection took forever.  I haven't noticed any degration in the sound quality.  What is cool is after I copied everything over I still have about 14gigs free and that's the 30g ipod.    My laptop is only USB 1, so it is slow transferring to the ipod.  I hooked it into my PC with USB 2 and it was much faster.  If you are married pay attention.  I give the Ipod a WAR (Wife approval rating) rating of 10 out of 10.  She loves it.  I had a netgear 101 wireless audio media center for our home stereo and in her mind it was a disaster.  Now we just hook up the Ipod to it and everything is great.  I bought the monster fm transmitter for the car, but I was not happy with it.  I returned in and got the Transpod FM Transmitter and power dock. It works great with the video Ipod.  I don't believe it states that it is supported yet, but it works fine. The Transpod places the Ipod at eye level, so you are not distracted from the road.  I have had some complaints about the Ipod.  First, I hate the earplugs.  They make my ears sore and sound is not that great.  Also, don't like how itunes and the Ipod handle soundtracks.  You can group them but that removes them from the artist list and put's them in another menu screen.  I wish it would group sound tracks and leave them in the artist menu.  Hope this helps I love this unit and hope to buy another for my wife.

<Content>iPod Video 5th Generation Review The 5G (5th generation) iPod with Video and Photo viewing capabilities is the latest evolution in the iPod line. The key word here is evolution, as, for the most part, it only includes a few minor improvements from the previous 4th generation iPod. Read on, and I'll tell you exactly what I think of this hot new product.  Installing Installing the iPod, I decided to just plug it into my computer. Unfortunately, the iPod locked up! That seemed pretty bad to me. After browsing the web a while, I figured out how to reboot the frozen iPod (hold down the middle select button and the menu button at the same time for about 6 seconds to reset/reboot it). Also, make sure that the iPod hold switch is not set when you try to reboot it. After rebooting, I decided to upgrade my iTunes from 6.0 to the most current version at the time (6.0.1.3) just to be safe, and then plugged in the iPod again, and it worked this time.  Design The 5G iPod has the same classic iPod look of the 4th generation design. From a design standpoint, it is gorgeous, the same width and height as the 1st generation iPod, but about half the thickness. It has a classy and classic design that looks beautiful and elegant. In the hand it feels nice- moderate weight but solid. One thing that you'll notice is how minimalist the design is- there are very few buttons and knobs and switches. The most notable thing is its round touch wheel which has 4 buttons embedded on it and a button in the center. The 4 clickwheel buttons have a nice tactile feedback when you push on them, however, they are completely flat on the touch wheel. In fact, it's so minimalist that there is not even an on/off switch (you have to hold the pause button down for several seconds and then flip the hold switch). There is no volume knob- you use the touch wheel (which also serves also to scroll through songs and also for rating your songs). Sadly, the latest touchwheel is a downgrade from all previous versions. It is much more "twitchy", and error-prone than the one on my second generation iPod mini, and much inferior to my 1st generation mechanical wheel in feel and accuracy.  The LCD screen is color and it's beautiful. It is 2.5" diagonal and has a resolution of 320x240. Videos look good on the screen. Motion is clear and smooth, though the screen is really too small to watch long movies on. On the top edge, there is one headphone jack and a hold switch. On the bottom, there's a custom connector which you can use a cable to connect to your computer's USB port (Firewire is no longer supported). No docking station is included, a money-saving tactic on Apple's part.   I Call It Scratchy The 5G iPod has a very scratch-prone screen. In fact, after just 1 day of using it gently, and putting it in my pocket (without any metal objects or coins) it somehow developed far more scratches than my 3 month old 2G iPod mini which was not babied at all. In fact, it's rather upsetting that the screen in some parts is so marred with scratches that it causes video playback to sometimes shimmer in that area. At least Apple now includes a new ultra-thin neoprene-like case. I like the case a lot, it's very simple but compact and provides just enough protection for carrying around without adding much bulk.  Features  The iPod is fairly light on features. It plays music files in AAC format (used by Apple's iTunes music store) and plays MP3s and Apple Lossless format. Apple has finally added reasonable recording support (though you need to buy a separate add-on microphone). And, the big news is, Apple's video support. Actually, video support is pretty good. Apple's web site says it supports H.264 video at 320x240 resolution at up to 768 kbits/second, or MPEG-4 resolutions of up to 480x480, and 2.5Mbits/second but. The MPEG-4 video size limit is slightly misleading, as it in reality supports resolutions that have up to 480x480=230,400 pixels. That means with a normal 1.33 aspect ratio, it can actually do up to 554x415 pixels (good for output to a TV, the built-in screen is 320x240 and downsizes the video shown to fit the built-in screen). Note, using higher resolutions increases file sizes significantly and could severely decrease battery life because of the increased computation power needed. Other reasonable resolutions for a 1.33 aspect ratio are 512x384 or 480x360. I've decided to standardize my video content on 480x360 at 1.5Mbits/sec. as a reasonable compromise in terms of quality and space.  Photo viewing on the 2.5" screen is very nice. However, Apple left out the most important feature, being able to zoom in on the details of an image. Even my obsolete 3 year old digital camera could do that. Also, the iPod doesn't support viewing RAW photo file formats.   There is still no FM radio, there is no bluetooth wireless connectivity built in (you can buy extra 3rd party addons for bluetooth, but really, it should be built in), there is no 3rd party software support for applications to run on the iPod. I hope they'll correct these deficiencies soon. There are a few extras like an alarm clock which which is practically useless because the built-in speaker is so weak, and there are a couple of games that aren't very good.   Other extras include a contact manager, a calendar, and the ability to show text notes.   A recently added feature is support for Podcasts. Podcasts have their own menu and also are bookmarked if you switch to something else in the middle of listening to one. Also, a dot appears next to podcasts that have not yet been listened to (a nice touch). Happily, smart playlists work correctly (if you set the star ratings for a song for instance, it will dynamically get updated on the iPod without having to re-sync with the computer). This feature had been broken by Apple for my 2nd generation mini with Firmware version 1.3.   In Use With all this talk about design and features, we shouldn't forget, it's all about the audio. My opinion is, the iPod's audio quality is very good. Audio is clear and clean. It seems to be an improvement on the iPod Mini I own, as it doesn't seem to have audio glitches when switching tracks. I'm not an audiophile, so you may want to check for yourself if you're particularly picky. Overall, I'm happy with the audio quality.  Where the iPod really shines is on the software side. iTunes integration is fantastic. Keeping your music in sync between the computer and the iPod works really well. iTunes is great at managing your music, if you are willing to give it full control over organizing your music- I fought this for a while, but in the end gave in as it's just easier to let it manage and consolidate your collection. It has nice little features like finding duplicate songs so you can clean up your collection. The iTunes user interface and functionality is excellent.   Playlist management in iTunes is fantastic. It is easy to create playlists and rearrange music within playlists. In addition, playlist management is very good on the iPod itself as well. Smart playlists are playlists that dynamically get updated (for instance, you can have a playlist of all 5 star rated songs, or of the most recent songs you've downloaded). You can create on-the-go playlists on the iPod directly, which is one feature I really love.   This 30GB 5G iPod I own is advertised as having an 14 hour battery life, or 2 hours for video. The iPod battery is also not easily replaceable, so you can't just switch batteries when it runs out, instead, you have to recharge the iPod. Your battery results may vary. (Come back later for a full report on battery life!)   Video content is now available on iTunes. However, the quality and the restrictions are a joke. You pay $1.99 for video content (such as music videos, or TV shows) but you get poor quality 320x240 resolution videos that you can NOT burn to DVD. Low quality and severe restrictions, together with a lack of much content to begin with is a disappointment.   Trouble in paradise: There is a very dark side to using the iPod and iTunes, however. Apple has been very consumer unfriendly by refusing to let iTunes protected AAC format music to interoperate with other software and other MP3 players. You can not play music purchased on iTunes using any other MP3 player on the market. Although you can burn the music onto CD and then rip it again, that is a rather annoying and time-consuming barrier. Furthermore, if you purchase music from any other online store such as Real's or one that supports WMF, you can not play it in the iPod. In fact Apple has threatened to sue Real for making their music files playable on the iPod. This level of anti-consumer monopolistic behavior is beyond comprehension, for a company that has so much going for it. They basically lock you into their system and keep you there through incredibly anti-consumer practices. There is no excuse for Apple's monopolistic behavior and consumer unfriendliness here. They have a good product that stand on its own merits.  A Note on iTunes Encoding Sound Quality: When ripping songs from your CDs, you need to think about what sound quality you will be happy with. The audio encoder and quality settings are found in the iTunes Preferences (under the Edit menu --> Preferences), and select the "Importing" tab. The general consensus is, the high quality 128K bps AAC setting is adequate for most purposes, though definitely not CD quality. In general it's a lot of trouble importing your entire CD collection into iTunes, so, I recommend picking a higher bit rate AAC encoding to get higher quality (select the "Custom" option). I experimented with MP3 encoding and it seems to be produce poorer quality audio in iTunes. I ended up choosing the AAC Encoder at 192 Kbps, which is a reasonable compromise in terms of space usage and audio quality. At this quality level, all but the most serious audiophiles should be satisfied. See A Report on Apple's iTunes AAC Compared to CD. See also the iPod Audio Page for more details on audio quality.  CONCLUSION: The iPod 5G is an excellent music player, though still missing some important features. It has style and design that's unmatched, and works well with Apple's outstanding iTunes software. It is functional and works well for what it was designed for. Features are lacking, certainly lagging behind the competition, and you get locked in Apple's system, so that's a tradeoff you will have to weigh. I like my 5G iPod video edition, and plan to keep it at least until the next generation comes out

<Title>Well... it's an iPod.
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I've had this new iPod Video for about a week now.  I've had one iPod before; the 4th generation 20gb.  I won't waste your time by writing the things you've read a thousand times.  I'll try to put a fresh spin on things.  First of all, the video capabilities.  Right now, I'm going to be honest, it's a pretty overrated feature (unless you're buying it simply for music videos).  There is very little you can purchase on iTunes currently.  All they have are 6 different TV shows and 7 Pixar shorts.  However, there is a plethora of music videos available.  Now this is not what I really want to utilize the video feature for, but there is a variety of them for those who do.  Granted, I'm sure Apple is going to be releasing more shows and even movies for purchase on iTunes, but as of now (Nov. 21), it's limited.  Of course there are alternatives, such as capturing your own video, but unfortunately this process can take hours to do.  Also you need Quicktime 7 Pro to convert it to the special iPod video format, which will cost you an extra 30 bucks.  But it'll probably be worth the money for some extra video on the iPod to watch.  So take my opinion with a grain of salt, but for those who want movies or TV shows alone, you might want to hold off on this for awhile.  Now, the style of this new iPod.  Of course, it is thinner than the previous model, which is nice.  It's about the same length and width, the clickwheel is smaller, and the screen is obviously bigger.  Now one thing that I did notice that was different about this iPod (and also the nano) is that the front faceplate is no longer rounded off but cut with sharp edges (see the side profile picture above).  This shouldn't bother anyone, but for me it was a change I'm not too sure I like.  I mean, an iPod is supposed to be round all over, just like every model before it... I don't know why the designers made this change and I hope that they go back to the old style eventually, but for now, it looks like it's here to stay.  Also, the headphone jack is offset to the right, if that makes any difference.  I'll also mention that I have the white model, which scratches less.  I've seen the black one at Best Buy and it is all scratched up and because it's black and everything shows.  Right now there are no official cases for sale at the [...] or Amazon.com for that matter, but they do have quite a few on eBay and I ordered the brand new leather one on DLO.  You can find that here:  [...]  All other features are still intact: music, videos, colored screen and the like.  The battery life however is roughly only 4 hours.  The backlight and keeping the backlight while video plays really sucks the life out of the thing.  But for me I usually keep the Pod close at hand or in the car where I can keep it charged.  So if you are always travelling and want to carry it with you to watch videos, you should probably get a full charge before you leave.  I think eventually this iPod will grow to the 5 stars it truly deserves, but as of now, there really is no improvement.  It meets all expectations for Apple's iPod, but it needs more video options to get a real step up from the previous model.  I hope this review has been helpful to you.  _Max

<Content>This is a great product (quality, design, functions..., are all great).  However the battery charger is $30 (the battery charger is a necessary, if you share computer with someone else you can not charge the ipod anytime you want.  How can you price a regular battery charger at $30?).  The software for converting video for playing on Ipod is $30 (Ipod video only support H.264 and MPEG-4 format. Ipod video does not have video software with it, how can you rip off customers this way).  A cover (to prevent scratch, Ipod is very easy to get scratch) is $30.  A Universal dock is $40 (for transfer video to TV, you also need a cable to do that, $20...).  I like Ipod, but I am not happy about the way they rip off customers.

That means that you will be able to put the video you recorded on your tivo onto your Ipod Video.  INCREDIBLE!  Yes this is an amazing little product, but the reviewer that said thier is no video is correct, unless you want to watch Lost again or Desperate Housewives or the Disney Chanel.  But, now you will be able to use Tivo recordings on your Ipod.  Finally video worth watching!  Hope this helps.  This story was reported on Ign.com a very reputable video gaming news scource.

<Title>Nice update to iPod line but video drains battery too quickly
<Date>Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's nice to be able to play videos and I can even rip a DVD movie using third party shareware software and play it on the iPod. Although the screen is much larger than prior iPods, it's still a bit uncomfortable to watch a movie on it. Also the battery will only last about 1.5 hours (60GB model lasts slightly longer) when watching video so it would probably be better to just watch TV shows and music videos when using the battery. If you want to watch a full length movie, you should probably plug the iPod in to a power source either using the included USB 2.0 plugged into your computer or using an AC Adapter which costs extra. Apple absolutely should have included the AC Adapter/Charger with this iPod like they have with the previous 4th generation iPod.  The good news is that for music, this iPod lasts quite a long time! And it sounds great (better than prior iPods) and it's physically much thinner (with the same outside dimensions). Most of the accessories that I already had for my prior iPod work on this 5th generation video ipod (such as my Belkin Tune Doc and power adapter). If you use a case for a prior iPod, you will probably need a new one though.  While I recommend and like this iPod, if you plan on doing a lot of video, be prepared to have some other power source available. Music is still the main thing it's good for, with the video capability just being a secondary extra.

<Content>I purchased two 60 GB units recently. I love the size and features of the new iPod but have been disappointed when I search online and find there are virtually no accessories yet available for the new models. (The 60 GB comes with a flimsy cloth case (no belt clip).) I also visited a local Apple store where they only had one case for my units. I had an older 40 GB model and grew accustomed to cases, iTrips, chargers, etc. Anyone have any ideas?

<Content>i travelled with my friend who had one of these, and i was jealous the whole week!  it's beautifully made, thinner than previous IPODs and the video play back is actually pretty decent.  only downside is that battery life is not great, needs to recharge daily...  - Dazhi Chen - Dazhi Chen

<Title>I'm Amazed
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wow. Thats all I can say. This ipod is so incredible. When I first opened the box, my heart started to race. When I saw the slick, thin, 30gb ipod sitting in its pocket, I was amazed. The downloading was easy and fast, and I cant stop listening to the music. Not only is the sound quality amazing, but the bright, color screen makes it a must have. Going from a 10gb orange lit button ipod (dont know the generation) is a huge step. I love this ipod, and you will too. i have no regrets at all buying this ipod!!! :)

<Title>Better than I expected
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When buying this I expected the video capability to be okay. I found it to be excellent, with vibrant colors and very clear picture. You can easily convert your own videos to fit on it using one of many free converter programs available on the net.  There is only 1 problem I have with it - the battery power. Watching video sucks the life out of the battery in about an hour and a half of use. That aspect of it is annoying, but its not the end of the world unless you plan on watching a full feature film on it

<Title>this is an amazing ipod!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my new white ipod video about a week ago and so far it has been wonderful.  i got it with a case, and a very nice case to be specific.  so far i have kept it scratch and fingerprint free.    the sound quality is amazing.  it is like listening to the songs straight from the recording studio.  ok, maybe not that good, but you know what i mean.    the ipod also allows you to put in album art too which is a really neat feature in my opinion.  although i haven't tried out the video feature of the ipod yet i have seen it and it is in fact very cool.  i wouldn't watch like full feature movies on it or even television shows but it is nice for music videos!    pictures can be put on it also which is pretty cool.  they take up pretty much no space so i have almost 500 already!  the battery is the only problem with the ipod.  while listening to music, the battery lasts a good 10 hours at least if you have the backlight off or to a minimum.  if you look at pictures the battery is sucked up pretty good.  and watching videos gives you about 3 hours of battery!  aghh!!  not cool! other than that the battery is pretty good if you just listen to the music...  the ipod comes with a "case" if thats what you wanna call it.  it is more like a well ... er...well i don't really know what you would call it but it sucks!  i use it to put headphones in because my case's headphone opening is in the middle instead of to the side but that is a different story.  also, if the case was a bit bigger, it might be a good temporary case until you get a real one but other than that it is crap.  also i have said before that my case doesn't support the video ipod.  it is actually a GREAT case but i am still gonna have a shoe maker put a hole in the top for me.  but i would suggest getting some sort of thing to hold your ipod because of the vulnerable surface of the ipod.  overall, the ipod is a WONDERFUL mp3 player.  in my opinion it is the only good one available, and if you are stuck on whether to get an ipod or a zen or iriver or whatever, i 100% recommend getting this because it is just as expensive as all of them more or less but is definitely the best!!!  you can't go wrong with these things.  hope this helps you decide if it is right for you.  enjoy!!!

<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this iPod a few weeks ago.  I took good care of it, and only put it in my pocket for listening.  Within three days it was extremely scratched.  Now it is in the same same as my old 20GB 4th generation iPod was after a year.  I like this iPod, but getting it without a case is out of the question.  Also, I recommend the white one as well, since it is harder to see scratches.

<Title>The COMPLETE need to know for your 5th Gen  iPod (and why it costs over $500)
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For those of you that are about to break down and get a MP3 player (like I did), let me share a couple things about the iPod 5th Generation with Video.  1) Best Value of all the players!!!    For the 300 bucks retail, you can't beat it.  The iPod Nano goes for around 50 bucks less, and it only has 4 Gb. The shuffle is cheap, but has no screen.  And the other brands like iRiver, HP and Creative have some nice features compared to the non-video iPods, but generally have less storage, and you still don't get the video of the 5th Gen.  2) Is 300 bucks really 300 bucks - No! (you'll want accessories)  Think of the iPod as being like a cell phone.  You get the phone, go to use it, and realize that all you got was the phone.  No car adapter, no hands-free for driving, and no case to protect the phone.  Well the iPod is no different.  If you're like me, you'll get into your iPod the moment you upload your first 100 songs into it.  Let's break it down...  2a) You need a computer.    This may sound silly, but a friend of mine won an iPod last month, and couldn't use it because he didn't have a computer at home.  Hopefully you have a computer at home, and if you're still using Windows 98 as your operating system, either you're getting a new computer, or the iPod will get dusty.  2b) Charging the iPod.    The iPod comes with a USB cable that allows you to charge the iPod while connected to your computer.  Now think...how are you gonna charge your iPod after using it on the plane, or at the beach?  No home computer = dead battery.  Cost of a 120VAC wall outlet charger can run around 30 bucks.   TIP - go to TJMaxx or Marshalls, and look around the accessories area for a knock-off brand home charger that could be as cheap as $13).  2c) Using the iPod in the car requires hardware too.    There are two choices:  I) Use a cassette tape adapter to connect into the headset port on your iPod, or II) Get an FM transmitter attachment.  This allows you to tune your radio to an obscure station, like 87.9FM, set the attachment to the same frequency, and your iPod will play through the radio.  The first option, the cassette one, is better, but how many cars after 2000 have cassette players in them.  RECOMMENDATION - the Monster brand FM transmitter with car charger cable, which goes for around 80 bucks.  Connect from the cigarette lighter socket into the data port on your iPod, and not only does it let you use the iPod in the car, but unlike the AirPlay2, the FM transmitter draws power from the car, instead of the iPod.  Think of your road trip from NYC to Ft. Lauderdale, using the AirPlay2, and the iPod goes dead in South Carolina and all you have left is two kinds of music - Country & Western (Thank you Jake & Elwood :)  2d) Protective Cases are a must!!!    The iPod has video, please protect your screen.  When you buy it, it only comes with a soft leather sock.  And the Apple stores and other retailers do not have the leather cases with screen protectors on hand yet.  ADVICE - DO NOT REMOVE THE PLASTIC FROM YOUR IPOD UNTIL YOU HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR!!!  Scratching the iPod's screen is not covered by the standard warrantee, and ruins any video you watch on it.  From what I found as I searched for a case, the only cases Apple plans to offer are cotton tube-sock types, again, you can't see through these things, what good are they???  I recommend going to a 3rd party website like [...].  Cost of a iPod jacket can run upwards of 35 dollars, depending on your preference.  Bottom line - if you want the flexibility to use the iPod in the car, charge it without your PC and protect it with a case, expect to spend an additional 100+ bucks.  3) Do you want the extended warrantee?  YES YOU DO!!!    Think about it, you're already dropping four bills on the iPod, the chargers, the FM transmitter and the protective case.  For the extra 50+ bucks, you get the AppleCare plan for iPods.  It's essentially unlimited coverage on your iPod for 2 years.  And if you're getting this for your son/daughter, keep in mind - you're paying for it, not them, and they probably won't respect it for the amount you paid for it.  Just do it for peace of mind.  I was at a retailer over the Thanksgiving weekend, and a sales associate told me that countless 5th Gens were coming in for screen repairs, and most of the customers were less than happy when they found out they had to pay for the replacement, even if they only bought the thing a week prior.  Get the warrantee.  4) iTunes and video uploads cost money too, even if you have the videos already.    I'm speaking of those "mpeg" commercial clips we all e-mail around for a 30 second laugh.  I tried to upload them, and failed miserably.  I found out that most mpeg files are "MUXED", or MULTIPLEXED.  You'll know if your files are MUXED if they can't add to the iTunes library from your PC, or if you are lucky enough to get them into the iPod, the video plays without sound, or vice-versa.  HOW TO FIX THIS - you need a couple of things.  1) You need QuickTime 7 Pro on your PC.  Most of the PCs have QuickTime 7, but not the Pro version.  Cost for the Pro version is $29.99.  2) This only enables conversion of video files to iVideo versions.  You still need to fix your MUXED problem.  This requires another software patch from Quicktime... Sorry, I forgot how much I paid when I wrote this.    Note - Quicktime is owned by Apple, what a surprise.  All in all, you could find yourself spending over five bills, like I did.  And if you ask me if it's worth it.  I would say "yes" every day of the week and twice on Saturdays!

<Title>A tip to prevent scratches...
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a big fan of the new Video Ipod;(I have the black one). A few complaints include the battery life as well as the surface which does scratch pretty easily (this is why I gave it 4 stars). Before getting the I pod I read about this scratch factor, so I was prepared, especially because they don't make cases for them yet. I bout some LCD screen protectors from an electronic store, and they work great. They stick right on the surface of the ipod, and stay there very securely. Then you can use a razor blade to trim around the periphery of the ipod, and you can barely tell its there. The click wheel feels a little different with the protector, but it still works fine. I highly suggest this until you can find an appropriate case for your ipod!

<Content>This is an awesome i pod probably the best yet. When you read the reviews about the black ipod they all say "get the white one it doesnt scrach as easily" well theyre bolth the SAME!! Black is just a different color so they bolth scrach just as easy as the other. another thing is that the scraches show up more easily well that might be true but for only 5 more dollare you can get the Apple iPod Video Anti-Glare Screen Protector [5th Gen iPod] (Single Pack) by JAVOedge for only about 6 dollars! Trust me on this one i hav a black i pod and its awesome. i have the JAVOedge screen protector on it and there not a scrach to be found. So sereously get a black ipod video they're a lot cooler than the white ones.

<Content>hello, i just recently bought one of this babies in black, and let me tell you it's awesome!!!! love it!!!!! i have read about how easily the black ipod can get scratched,  and for the moment all i do is after i use it i put it back inside the case it came with, and i don't take it anywhere, at least not for the moment until i find a protector, but the sound quality is great and love the fact that now i can see the cover art for each of my 2,2302 classic rock albums!!!! i don't really use it for the pictures or movies, but the fact is that it's really a great little gadget and if you're a music fan like myself i highly recomend this ipod, the nagatives???? i haven't found any of them yet, i know the battery can sometimes be a little problem, but that's not a "BIG" issue either, so i'm very pleased with this purchase, and like i said before, if you really want to get a cool ipod this is the one, it doesn't matter if it's black or white or yellow, get one and enjoy your music!!! p.s. if you don't want your ipod to get scratched, don't put it in your pocket along with nickels or keys!!!!!! ramoncito te extra�o y se te quiere gratis primo!!!!!!!

<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this iPod for a week, and I am going to tell you exactly what problems I have experienced, since the pros are already well known.  Cons  1 Screen cratches easily, even with religious use of cover provided in iPod package (Screen is now paramount to protect with video capabilities)  2 Fast Forward maxes out at just 4 seconds when held down for video! What the hell! What if I want to skip to the 60th minute of a 73 minute file. That means 15 minutes of holding down Fast Forward??!! Really now!  3 No FireWire? USB 2.0 is significantly slower in transferring data  (Though, I must say, black is a rather fetching colour. Too bad scratches are even more apparent than with white.)

<Title>A New Level of Music
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple continues to evolve the mp3 player and now on top of music, pictures, and playlists there are videos. The new ipod allows you to play movies either from itunes or convert from your own computer. The 30 gb does give you room to put as much as you need for songs, photos, and videos but for those that need the extra space to use as a external harddrive or storage or for those that just have that much music and videos.  The video quality on the new ipod is viewable and moves in sync with the audio.  As of now itunes has posted some videos and a great deal of music videos that you can buy for 2 dollars but it might be recommended to convert files on your own in order to save yourself some money. The audio player is just as good as the last generation and the photo resolution as also increased.  The con about this product is that the battery life is not very long if you plan to watch movies. Its a primary mp3 player with the capacity to play movies.  http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=22601006 In my time i have owned a 10gb, a mini, a nano, a 40gb and now the new 30gb video and it is well worth it if you are an mp3 user.

<Title>iPod Video 30GB review
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am very pleased with my new iPod, does everything it was designed to do (plays music) with a little bonus (plays videos and pictures).   Apple has gotten it right again, with the perfect compromize of function and size. I really am amazed at how thin the 30GB iPod. I got the 30GB iPod as an upgrade to my old 20GB, and the 30GB is considerably thinner.   This iPod generation (the 5th one) is the first one that has been competitively priced. Prior to this generation of iPod, there was always a cheaper option from Dell or Creative that offered the same features without the simplicity and beauty of iPod. Now it's really a no brainer that iPod is the better choice, since Apple has packed a lot of bang for your buck.  The video looks stunning and crisp. Even at at mere 2.5 inches, it is still enjoyable to watch last night's episode of Lost or Desperate Housewives. I have even ripped DVD's to the iPod using "Handbrake" (a program for Mac only).  As with previous generations of iPod, music is the primary functionality. It is still the best music player out there, hands down.   The only negative thing I can think of is that the screen and back scratch easily. I suggest buying an invisibleShield, for 100% durable, permanent protection. (check out theinvisibleshield.com)

<Content>I just rcvd my new ipod about 1 week ago. Even without using the 30gb ipod for photos or video, I'm only getting about 2 - 3 hours of music time with it! It's my 1st ipod and I'm really disappointed. I chkd out the apple.com site and even DISABLED the equalizer and reduced the backlighting period to 5 seconds. I'm going to do a couple more test runs this week by charging it via my laptop for 4+ hours at a time, if I can't get more than 2 - 3 hours of music time, it's going to be returned to amazon.com ASAP. I LOVE the features of the ipod, but with this battery record, I might as well go back to my portable cd player!  =(

<Title>Scratching is NOT an issue. Please read.
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In other reviews, people mention how the iPod Video has a great tendensy to scratch. I have owned my 30gig white iPod Video for about 3 weeks now, and the iPod has minimal scratches. (Just a couple hairline scratches, but that's normal on ANYthing you own, even cars.)  The simple fact is, if you aren't a dunce about it, and know how to take care of your things, this iPod will NOT scratch. If you are careless with it, and drop it on rocks, then yes, it is sure to scratch.  As for the little case that now comes with it and the iPod Nano, the case is the PERFECT accessory for the iPod, and just so happens to come packaged with the iPod Video (black or white, 30gig or 60gig, doesn't matter), for free.  As about the battery life, it is fairly stable. On a sensable level, there is no need to listen to your iPod a STRAIGHT 14 HOURS without a stop to charge. The iPod charges very quickly (around an hour), and is perfect for people who are always "on-the-go". Video playback, however, is quite a damper on the battery. Then again, if you are going on a 5-hour drive, and you are the driver, there is no need to watch movies while you drive, now is there? 2 hours of video watching doesn't seem to fit my fancy on such a small screen.  There is a small problem, however. Every now and then (especially after you watch videos of a large length), the iPod tends to "lag" when navigating through menus. For example, if you are trying to go from the "Videos" to the "Songs" and then "Artists" sections, whenever you press the Menu button, it may take up to two seconds for the section you are trying to get to for the iPod to get to it (mostly when backing up from a menu).  Over all, this is a pretty solid piece of equipment, and is a must-have for someone looking for a sturdy music player.  If you currently own an iPod of any model, this may NOT be the best MP3 player for you (especially if you are buying it mainly for the video function). However, if you are a first-time-buyer of an MP3 player, and are looking for something GREAT that will play your music in a flawless quality, and even has a video ability at that (even though it isn't the best on earth), the iPod Video is perfect for you.

<Title>Don't get it for your own video
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you intend on using this for your own video or for movies wait until the next gemeration iPod.  Using Quicktime 7 pro to transfer a movie (One & half hours long) to my iPod took two days..yes TWO DAYS.  It took me about 12 hours to transfer a thirty min show to my iPod.  Sadly enough, my iPod rejected the file, saying it was the wrong format.  The file's property tag states differently.  If using it for music, I swear it sounds better than the last generation.  However, it seems to be made a little cheaper.  The first iPod I received did not work.  Apple replaced it, however it took a month.  The second iPod works, but it is less stable than my 3rd generation iPod and the dock interface is loss in the iPod.  Also, I hate the click wheel...I don't know why they changed it.

<Title>Like MAGIC, it even makes HOUSEWORK fun!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't even know I needed one and now I really love it!  Even my 4 year old can work her way around it and navigate exactly where she wants to go.  I recieved it for my birthday, and this little thing makes everything more fun.  The video quality is very impressive, considering it's size especially.  I have to leave home for a couple days a week for work, so I asked my technically inclined husband to load my pilates video on to my 30GB unit.  All be it no Matrix reloaded as far as grahics go, but I am extrememly pleased with the picture quality. (Now if I could just motivate and do the videos). It is a great size for someone wanting to watch something on the commute, plane, train or sitting on the bike at the gym.  Really amazing, and really easy to use.  I agree with other reviewer, the "included case" is nothing to write home about as it is difficult to get your Ipod in and out of.  It does serve it's purpose of protecting the screen though.  I bought a dlo rubberized case, it fits but does obscure the outer edges of the expanded screen.  It will do until the come ut with accessories for this unit. The head phones are a bit uncomfortable ( for smaller ears) as well, but the sound quality is great.   Great gift for anyone, techy or not, who loves music, movies and portability.

<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love everything about my new video Ipod except the battery life.  The box claims it can play songs for up to 14 hours but I've found reality to be more like 8.  I don't really watch videos on it but I can only assume that would deplete the battery very quickly.

<Title>To buy or not to buy
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am writting this review because I saw couple of people complain about Apple launching too many products too soon. If waiting for the next best thing to come out is the reason for you not to buy this product buy it please. It is sad but tech companies even confess that they no longer make products to last, I dont mean durability, the popularity. I mean I was so excited when the first digital cameras were launched. Then the best thing was 1.3 megapixels. Then the ipod came out it was great I didnt know how many generations of the mini they had until I read it here. Then they had the photo one which was the coolest for like 600 bucks. Anyways what I am trying to say is that when the best of the best ipod nano or video comes out (if it ever does) apple will launch another version for sure. Its just the way this game of consumer seller relationship goes. Apple is the coolest thing now but who knows in ten years whats going to happen to that. It is alot of money to spend but if you are thinking this as this great investment and saving money by not eating or feeding your infants to buy this, dont buy it,This stuff is meant to be replaced after a couple of years. So if you like the idea of owning an Ipod buy it, if you like the design buy it, if you like the features buy it, I have to say that I didnt experience major problems with ipods but if the customer relation department is bad, people should put solid reasons and evidence of how it was. Just saying my screen was burnt and I called them is not enough, where did you buy it from how long has it been, why was it burnt, what else did you do to fix the problem, things like that. Although I can see it happening, I wouldnt go by these comments. It is your choice, think what u going to use it for, if you can honestly imagine putting all of your cds in to this and playing it buy a higher memory one. If you just want to put 100 songs or so buy smaller one. Think you might play video on it buy the video one ( would go with the higher memory with ipod video, it wouldnt hurt. It should be a simple decision to buy something like this. Go ahead treat yourself if you can spend the money. If not SanDisk ones work great as an mp3 player for workout. Its not like anyoneat the gym is actually looking at your mp3 player. Cheers.

<Title>Battery, lag issues with 5G video iPod
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own a 3G iPod and was getting old of the 3 hour battery life, so I decided to get the new video iPod.  I purchased it (30gb black one) and enjoy the wider screen as well as the color display.  I especially enjoy the album artwork being showed on the display. However I do have some issues with it in.  First of all, as I have been reading these posts I can see that I am not the only one that has complaints about the battery life.  I listen to music on the train to work (45min to 1 hour), listen to music at work (2 hours to 3 hours), and then listen to music on the train ride back home (1 hour) and usually on that train ride home the battery icon is showing red.  I am just listening to music with the iPod hold button as well as my backlight on for 2 seconds so that the battery is not drained more.  The 14 hour battery life they are claiming?  I have yet to see it.    Second, the lag that one post commented on.  It happens most of the time even scrolling between albums, artists.  Sometimes the "center button" works when you click it, sometimes it basically double clicks and your selection starts playing music and you do not want it to.  This is really aggravating.  I hope Apple releases a new iPod update with something that fixes this bug. Compared to the battery issue, this issue is a lot more aggravating to me.  In response to all of the scratching posts.  I have owned the iPod for at least 3 weeks now and still see no signs of scratching and it is used daily.  The case that comes with it is very soft and does a great job to protect it.  I definitely enjoy the new video iPod.  It is a great deal with all of the technology involved.  I paid $399 for my 3G 20gb when it first came out.  I hope Apple is able to fix the two main issues I have with these units, when they do I believe those iPods will be the best ones Apple has ever issued.

<Content>One word, incredible! this new ipod 30gb is the best mp3 around these days. its soo nice, sexy, thin, plays video and music and is incredible. and for all thos people who whine about scratching get one of these   [...]  and for all those people who cannot properly get music to the right format go here. jeese im 13 and i can even do this easily.  http://www.bittorrent.com/  and lastly for people who cannot find good shows or dont wanna spend 2 bucks a show at itunes go here and get stuff free  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/  thats that and overall the ipod is a great buy.  some of the bad things to this ipod can be the battery life which is quite slim when watching video. i bought the charger that you can charge your ipod anywhere. this works perfectly. another thing could be the scrachness. this baby can easily get scratched so i suggest not even playing woth your ipod before getting an invisable shield or other skin.   so imo, i think that his was a great buy and everyone else should think the same. dont let whiners discourage you, this is a great buy

<Title>These things are awesome!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Thank you, Apple!  I ran out and picked one of these up as soon as people started carrying it, and I was not disappointed.  The first thing you might notice upon seeing the box is that it's about a quarter of the size of the old boxes.  Yeah, Apple was pretty stingy on the accessories this time, but you get what you need (Ipod, computer cable, manual, earbuds, "case"), so what's the big deal?  I don't really know what I was expecting out of this thing, but as soon as a loaded a video on it, I was thrilled by the awesome video quality.  One con about this piece of equipment is that it DOES scratch very easily, but a nice case can solve that problem.  Definatley worth the money (A good value too)!

<Title>Is this ipod really worth it?
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this ipod for three weeks and I love it. The itunes program was easy to set up and use. It was easy to transfer songs to the ipod (when you hook up the USB cable the program opens up and transfers all of the songs on the playlists that you've selected). The video quality is amazing. I was blown away at how clear the picture is. Overall, I am very impressed. The downsides are that the battery life is very short when you're watching a video (maybe two hours instead of the claimed 14). It also scrathces very easily. They send you a little pouch with it but I would recommend getting a case for it. Probably the best part about it is that I got it for free. It took me about a month to get but it actually worked. I was blown away. [...]

<Title>Very good, doesn't scratch
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The new ipod is definitely worth the money. $299 really isn't a lot for all the new features.  Video is very easy to get on.  If you want to get DVD's onto your ipod, you need a dvd to ipod converter such as cucusoft.  I find that the free videora converter messes up my videos.  Also, don't Quicktime Pro unless you have home videos from digital camera, etc.   The ipod doesn't scratch if you take good care of it.  It is defintely a product to buy if you really like music, videos, and photos. (don't buy it just for the games, it's not worth it). Also the battery life is 14 hours, i timed it, but only if you just play music and turn off the backlight completely. When playing DVD's, i usually get aboubt 2-3 hours, then have to charge again.   Overall, the only flaws would be short battery life for videos and no charger.  PS. GET A CASE. It will definitely prevent most scratches. I suggest one from Agent18 as theirs look awesome and are usually out right after the ipods come out.

<Title>I LOVE THIS iPOD
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No doubt, the best mp3 player. Sleek design, easy interface, very user friendly iTunes. For the price, the iPod is absolutely the best buy. It use to be a matter of price, but now for what you get 300 is pretty cheap. An additional 10GB, even smaller size, photo features, and the new video features. Think about it, the photo was a whole separate model and now they combined it into the standard iPod without raising the price.   I use to own a Zen Touch, and I was against Apple. But ever since the video iPod came out I have just been in love with this player. It's everything I wanted and for the same price I got my Zen Touch a few years ago.   When compared to the Zen Touch there is really only one problem and that's the iPod takes scratches and smudges so easily. Of course that can easily be solved with a purchase of a case, and I recommend the agent 18 ones. Those are really nice and they protect the whole iPod with an opening for the click wheel, hold lock, and plugs.  Really the Zen Touch is a good mp3 player, but the iPod just does it better. The click wheel is far user-friendly than the Zen Touch scroll. The interface is far nicer. iPod has color and album artwork. That really isn't that big of a deal, but it's nice to have. Zen Touch is way bulkier than the iPod and its much heavier although this is because the Zen has a longer battery life(5 more hours). Still 15 hours for the iPod is really good and if you get the 60GB it's the same battery life to the Zen Touch.

<Content>Overall the Ipod Video is an amazing piece of equipment to have. It's screen is alot better in resolution and size that i ever thought and runs videos smoothly.   I would though, like to mention that instead of buying quicktime PRO to convert your videos into MPEG-4 you can use free alternatives like videora ipod converter. This is just as good as quicktime PRO and is absolutely free so i urge you to get this software instead of paying 0 or however much money it is.  Also if you are contemplating buying one of them i would urge you to buy a case before or right after purchasing the product. I was foolish and didnt bother buying one for a while and even though i was really careful with it, it still managed to accumulate quite a lot of scratches and blemishes.  Overall this is a great buy and one that you won't regret!

I get at most 3.5-4 hours of music and at most and hour and 15 minutes in video per charge even with my backlight setting to 2 seconds, volume about half way, and the equalizer off. (Is this happening to anyone else or is there something wrong with my iPod???? lagging is very annoying. sometimes when you wanna switch songs or get in and out of menus, it lags a few seconds.  All i wonder about is how Apple comes up with with their numbers. 14 hours of battery life?? I have yet to see it. The iPod is a great music player, but it has its flaws. mainly the battery life. I am still debating whether to take mine back to the apple store. an iPod is just trendy, thats why i got mine, but there are far better mp3 players out there.    (...)

<Title>why I pod sucks
<Date>Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Last year, against my better judgment, I let my teenage daughter buy a mini-I-pod (since this is a service related complaint, it applies to all apple mp-3 players).  I had advised her not to do it.  I knew that the hard-drive was fragile, and the words "fragile" and "teenager" are not normally a good mix.  I also didn't like the battery. But my daughter wanted to use I-tunes.  Plus she thought the other models were nerdy.  In order to protect us against normal teenage behavior, I paid for the extended warranty, which is 60 dollars, or about a third of the price of the I-pod. Our mistake. Technically, it is OK other than the battery issue (the battery cannot be replaced).  But the service is insultingly bad, the worst service I've ever experienced from a retail company. We first learned of the service problems when my daughter had a sound problem that turned out to be multiple headphone failure, not Apple's fault.  I tried calling the local store, but they are not accessible by phone.  The phone links to a central tech support line, which on high use hours may require 30 minutes or more on hold.   So we took it into the store, which has a tech support section (the "genius bar" or "Conceirge service").  But you cannot get walk-in service.  To get to talk to a tech support employee you have to make an appointment on line.  You cannot make an appointment in advance unless you pay 100 dollars for "Procare" service (I don't know any other retail operation that requires you to pay 100 dollars to make an appointment for service).  Otherwise, appointments are available only on a same day basis, first come, first serve, assuming their server works (more on that later).  In order to make an appointment after normal working hours (so you don't have to take a day off to service an I-pod), you have to wait until all the earlier appointments are full, but not wait too long or the "genius bar" will be full.  I thought of just making 20 appointments and filling up the day-that might work, although it inconveniences everyone else.  Our big problem came when my daughter's battery died after about 10 months of use.  This is not a problem that can be resolved by the "genius bar".  You have to call the central number for technical support, which will send you a shipping package with a DHL label (our mailing label was missing the proper return address), which you then have to deliver to the DHL mailer. We did this, and after over a week with no response, I called the central tech support unit.  It took me 20 minutes to get a service rep.  He checked the computer, then put me on hold for another five minutes.  When he came back, he told me that they found a small dent in the unit, and that voided the warranty, but for 210 dollars they could send me a new machine.  I asked to speak to his supervisor, which just got me another 15 minutes on hold and a lecture on how this small dent eliminated their obligation to repair the machine.  I told them that we had not noticed any damage when we returned it, and it could have been damaged after shipment.  I reminded them that I had purchased an extended warranty, and that if they were voiding this during the original period of the warranty, I would demand a full refund of the warranty price.  Nothing dissuaded them from their position. We had them ship the machine back (DHL packages require a signed receipt, and had we not been home when it arrived we would have had to make a trip to DHL to pick it up).  I tried to make a service appointment, but their server was down for a week (and this is a computer company?).  My wife and I finally walked in and demanded to see the manager.  The manager and sales rep were actually sympathetic and friendly, but the tech supervisor looked at the I-Pod (with a very small dent in the upper right hand corner), and lectured us on how that voided the warranty and they could never allow for a return.  My wife and I (both of us were now furious, both at the time we had to waste on this and the 300 plus dollars we had invested in this machine, accessories and I-tunes) then had full scale tantrums, yelling and screaming until their techie, lecturing us on how to use their equipment properly and warning us that this is a once in a life-time exemption that would apply to any future purchases (I told him that was no problem--I would promise to never buy an apple product again) gave us a new mini-ipod--otherwise we would have driven every customer out of the store.    What I don't understand is from a purely business point of view, this makes no sense.  If they voided our warranty, they would have to refund our extended warranty contract (we are still in the period of the original warranty), which is 60 bucks.  That is probably more than the cost to them of the item, which is now discontinued anyway.  Instead, they have permanently alienated a family who already owns two I pods (we had to buy one for our younger daughter so she could use her sister's I-tunes) worth over 600 bucks w/accessories, and a household with 2 computers and 3 mp-3 players.   I remember when Apple advertised themselves as the David fighting the IBM Goliath.  Now that they have a near monopoly on a product, they are the big, unfeeling company.  Their business model seems to be modeled after an elite club for those worthy of their great product.  But no other retail business gives this kind of shoddy service (other than other quasi-monopolies like cable companies).  There are other Mp-3 players available that you can buy from normal retail outlets, and if they die these companies will accept them back even if they have a small dent in the right hand corner. So why buy apple?

<Title>Black 30 Gig ipod video 
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm extremely satisfied and excited with the new ipod video.  This has been very hyped and it's extremely difficult to get one before Christmas so if you do congratulations.  The new ipod comes in 30G or 60G varieties and black and white.  For me black was the only one available and it really didn't matter to me much.  Here are a few things I noticed  APPEARANCE It's beautiful simple as that.  The major difference between ipods and other competetitors such as Zen and Iriver is the simple and elegant apppearance of the ipod and the easy to use interface.  The new ipod based on pictures looks wider and the larger LCD screen makes it seem somewhat awkward looking.  However, I was pleasantly suprised when I got one in my hands.  The new ipod is much thinner and no wider or longer than the previous models, despite seeming so in pictures.  The ipod photos could be stood upright from the ground, but the new ones are so thing they cannot stand on its side.  The screen is small but it really supports videos just fine.  You don't need to put it extremely close to your face to view it well.  Although I'm not a tech wizard about videos, the resolution and clarity of the videos seems great to me especially with such a small screen.  MAJOR DIFFERENCES There is more space for the same money than previous models, which is a definite plus.  The addition of black as an optional color is probably a plus for many cutomers.  The size is smaller and supposedly the sound is crisper with less noise from the hard drive, I personally can't tell the difference.  Also there is the stopwatch and screen combination lock features that were available in the nano and the battery life is nicely extended (20 hours of music playback on the 60 gig ipod).  The big difference is video, which is somewhat complicated to use.  You must mantain a MPEG-4 format with a specific resolution limit to be converted onto your ipod.   This requires either QuickTimePro, which costs money or downloading Videora Ipod Converter on the Internet, which I did and it works brilliantly on my computer.  Within minutes I had a movie and some music videos downloaded onto my ipod.  I definetly reccomend checking that out.  SCRATCHES I know this is a big concern for everyone with the ipod.  My previous ipod was my first and I purchased a silicon case with cutouts for the screen and scroll wheel for only 5 dollars.  Within a week it was scratched up miserably and the screen had many large scars.  So this was a huge concern for me.  The case supplied with the ipod is not really a case, but a small velvet sleeve for the ipod.  Obviously you can't see the movie if your screen is covered up and you need to remove the case in order to plug it into an adapter or computer, so the sleeve will be removed.  I reccomend buying a good durable case with a screen protector.  Although I haven't gotten any scratches on mine, it's because I have been extremely careful with my ipod and have only had it for about a week.  However, despite this I still think the new ipods are slightly less prone to scratches than the infamous nanos.    APPLIANCES It no longer comes with an AC adapter so if you don't have one from previous ipod purchases, it sucks because you have to spend 30 dollars to get one unless you just keep it charged to your computer, which I don't do.  Also there is no dock but there wasn't one for the ipod photos and I don't really find it that useful.  As usual there is the headphones and the Itunes software in the box.  WORTH UPGRADING? If your ipod is aging and you really want a new one, I'd say go for it.  But if the video function isn't useful to you, and your old Ipod is working fine for you, then I don't suggest upgrading.  And knowing ipod, in a year or two there will be a new model that you'll envy for anyways.  But if your not upgrading from a previous model and want an MP3 player, I DEFINETLY reccommend the ipod video.  It's reliable for me and works like a charm.

<Title>Video and Music come out Crisp
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has to be the coolest gift I have ever recevied.  Sound quality is incredible and the video looks great on the new screen size.  A friend had bought the iPod photo 2-3 weeks before this one (iPod video) came out and she is visibly jealous.  The new version is slimmer with a bigger screen.  Downloaded videos and tv shows look great.  You'll miss your bus stop...unless you are in NYC right now (MTA is on STRIKE),  The podcasts available are AMAZING!  You can get audio only or video and just about anything...news, comedy sketches, how-to-guides.  There is are a few drawbacks...you will need to purchase Quick Time Pro (29.95) if you wish to import your own videos.  Once you do, though, ANYTHING is possible.  Another option is handbrake (http://handbrake.m0k.org/) which allows you to rip most of your dvds into Mac format.  While this is a gray area (duplicating media electronically is illegal), I feel that copying a dvd that you own for your personal use on your ipod is considered fair use.  The other negative is that battery life typically only last 1.5 hours for video playback...just under a typcal movie length.  You can rememdy this with a battery pack that runs off a 9-volt and adds another 1.5 hours.  Auto integration was a bit pricey.  I didn't like the quality of sound provided by the FM radio transmitters on the market (and I tried a bunch of models and brands).  In the end, I had to get a new car stereo (Kenwood has some nice ones) that was iPod ready (you'll probably spend around $400 to do this right).  The results are FANTASTIC!  I can control the iPod from the dash unit or remote control.  It charges while it plays.    Cross-country road-trip?  No biggie!  Fire up a Harry Potter audio book and roll withough ever having to change a disk.  TV busted in the motel?  No biggie!  Catch up on your favorite tv series one day after they broadcast.  The best gift this holiday season

<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First, the only good part: the display is incredible.  However, that's the only good thing I have to say about the video iPod.  The movies are pretty much limited to movies that have been specially encoded for the iPod so it is not a good general media player.  However, I was mainly going to use it as an MP3 player anyway.  This is where I was shocked.  I was expecting the best MP3 player I've ever use and discovered the iPod is actually the worst.  I've had several MP3 players.  The iPod is by far and away the hardest to use.  The UI makes no logical sense and my touch is too heavy causing me to always end up somewhere unexpectedly.  The volume selection is extremely hard to use.  I also found iTunes very, very difficult to use especially after using the free MediaMonkey software.  I told my wife she could have the iPod because I couldn't stand it and I would use the 2.5GB Rio Carbon I already had instead.  My recommendation is to save your money and buy the cheaper and better Rio.  The Rio is easier to use and you just copy your files onto it without needing special software.
