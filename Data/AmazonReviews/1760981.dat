<Title>Battery problems?
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player is nice, looks nice, and is small, but the battery is internal, literally, and cannot be accessed so far as I can see or tell, to replace later on (rechargeable battery's do eventually need replacing!), as it it is rechargeable, and charges when the unit is plugged into the USB port of your PC.  Also, menu navigation is really hectic, as buttons on player are so close together you find yourself doing a lot of back tracking to get back to where you need to make a right turn so to speak :)  We will definitely pay more attention and check features even better next time we purchase an MP3 player, this is our first :(
