<Content>This is an amazing little player. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is the small amount of time it took me to copy my songs from my cds to windows media player, then drag them to a list, and presto one click and they loaded onto this player. (But the instructions could be alittle clearer.) But once you play with it, it is worth figuring it out ! GREAT sound!! I sugest a set of regular ear phones rather than the ear bud type that come with this. You do Not need the little cd that comes with this at all...at least not if you have windows media player on your computer.Windows XP has it, I think all the new windows versions has the media player that you can use to up load your favorite songs to this player.It holds about 250 songs. After I put my favorites on this player, windows allowed me to back up the ones I put on it to a cd,...So my favorites are backed up on cd's if I ever want to reinstall them witout resorting all my favorites from all the albums of cds.!! Great little Player, cheap price...I am 58 and if I can figure it out I'm sure you can too !!  
<Overall>4
