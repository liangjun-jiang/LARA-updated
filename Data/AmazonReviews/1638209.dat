<Title>Every Feature Usefull.
<Date>Sat Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the 30GB Nomad several months ago and it has really been a gem of a purchase.  I was only expecting to by a 4 GB MuVo but for the extra 40 bucks, 26 GB is a bargin.  The people at Creative designed a nice package here.  Over the few months that i have had the Nomad i have had a chance to use all of the features.  It fits my life style perfectly.  You can customize playlists on the fly.  You can set bookmarks in the middle of a track (very handy for long audiobook files).  The sound quality is fantastic, and the EAX Features make it even better.  I also like the fact that it can be utalized as an external hard drive.  I have some files i need to transport from school to home and this is ideal.  I can keep all of my work files on it and still have enough room for an extensive music collection.  The battery life has never let me down and the controls are quite simple to use.  The travel case that came with it is also quite nice looking and functional.  This is a good bye.

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Sat Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sometimes I wonder who really writes these reviews...I could swear that 50% of them are written by either Creative or Apple.<p>Regardless, I just received my Nomad today...so everything I write is based solely on first-day use (cannot vouch for long-term performance). I'd like to first address those who complain about software problems/incompatiblity issues, etc. Is it really fair to comment about things like that on a hard product review? When I read through these reviews I was looking for the performance of the player itself, not of Windows problems.<p>I come from a strict loyalty to minidisc players. So this is coming from college student whos boyfriend inducted her to the world of MD and who swore by hers for the past two years: I really am impressed with the Nomad. My 18-year old brother got an iPod for his graduation, so naturally in sibling competition I had to outdo him. He got the 20gig, I bought Nomad in the 30gb for about $200 less. Ha! I won!<p>So let's be fair here. I love the touch controls on the iPod, I just didn't have the patience to wait for the Zen Touch's release, or the money to dish out. The fact that Apple includes a remote is quite nice. I do like the address book feature of the iPod as well, it gives me an excuse to hold off my tech-y temptation to buy a palm pilot.<p>On the other hand, the default carrying case for the iPod has no viewing window. I guess the Nomad didn't have one at first, but mine does. It's sort of faux-leather with a nice feel and a dinky clip (I don't plan on using the clip anyway) and makes the unit feel sturdier than it does alone. The front cover which houses the battery is a lighter material than the rest of the unit and almost seems like its in preparation for interchangeable front panels (I tried to look it up but found nothing of the sort). It has a release button and I have not found a way to make it &quot;accidentally&quot; fall off as of yet. ;-)<p>I do wish there were a manual hold button, I don't like pressing the power button to lock the keys. With the buttons being on the side, and the openings of the case being there as well, it is pretty easy to hit something when you pick up the unit to move it. Yes, its a bit bulky and larger than the iPod, but I would describe it as sturdier, not larger. My brother's iPod is scratched up so horribly because of the plastic, and he's only had it for about 3 weeks. At least the Nomad has metal covers (as thin as they may be). I'm all about aesthetics, so my superficial side is happy.<p>As far as sound quality goes, it certainly matches that of my MD player. I love having everything on a drive as opposed to minidiscs...even though they were durable I still had to carry around 5 of them. I thought 5 hours of music on one disc was great, but now I have more than 30 and have barely dented my CD collection, and have used only 2.3GB if not less. The Nomad definitely converted me and put my faith back into MP3 players, which I resisted for the longest time.<p>Guess we'll see how it holds out. I haven't found any reason to be unsatisfied yet. Although I will mention that I am using a third-party ripper to get my CDs, I haven't tried their software in regards to that.

<Title>Good value for money
<Date>Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Have had mine for about 5 months now...still working fine, battery life lasts 10 hours on mine (but that's only cos I'm diligent about recharging only when it's completely empty) and the sound quality is exceptional.<br>There are a few downsides, the main one being the size and lack of remote control...now I am sooooo tempted to buy the zen touch...<br>I've had no problems with the software, I'ved already used up 20GB of the alloted 30GB...mainly with personal files, it also doubles as my backup hard-drive...transferring of files to and from the Nomad to PC is a breeze, and with USB2.0, absolutely flies!<br>Conclusion is: Not as sexy as the iPod, but for this price, unless you have more dosh than sense, then go for this...

<Title>Nice MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is certainly a nice product. It's well put together, attractive, durable, provides some good options, and has great sound. <p>However, there are a few little drawbacks. First, it doesn't support a very wide array of sound formats; you're basically stuck with MP3s. Second, the &quot;jog dial&quot; scroll button is a little annoying and difficult to use, but not enough so as to ruin the experience. Third, it's practically impossible to read the LCD without perfect light or the backlight on (you can set how long the backlight stays idle, up to 60 seconds). Fourth, and finally, the button style and button/input locations are just a little...off, for lack a better word. The buttons aren't quite sticking out far enough and the button/input locations are a little strange (they work and all, but it could have been designed just a slight bit better).<p>Besides those few quirks, this is a really nice player. The sound is amazing, and the EAX settings are really nice, albeit some scale down the volume whilst using them. Battery life is acceptable. The player is a little larger than say an iPod, but it's still a nice size. The sync from your PC to the Zen Xtra (or vice versa) is a snap and very quick. Also, there's firmware and driver updates available, and the little harddrive is replaceable; if you ever want to replace or upgrade it, it's really simple. The case is really attractive and more durable than the plastic players out there, but the front case cover is easily removed, which is a good thing but can possibly become a bad thing as well, although I've yet to be able to make it 'accidentally' come off.<p>With everything the package includes, there's really no reason you shouldn't pick this up. For the score I had to knock off one star (I wish I could knock off only half of a star, though) for the my four small annoyances with the player.

<Title>Beware - no customer support
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Stay away from creative - far away. They only want your money. The unit itself - a creative zen 20 gb - has a few quirks but operated sufficiently. However, it did not hold up well and each time a repair was made, we were charged $100 minimum. Now, just over a year later, the headphone jack no longer makes contact. We were told &quot;This unit is no longer supported&quot; but we were offered a REFURBISHED unit (now, where did that come from?) for a price more expensive than a brand new 30 gb unit. I thinks its time to get an iPOD.<br>Consider me a disgusted, former customer of Creative. I will never buy their products again. I expect a several hundred dollar item to last longer than a year and to be supported as well.

<Title>Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 30 GB Mp3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was looking for an mp3 player that would hold almost every song and artist from my harddrive.There were 2 reasons I picked this over the Ipod.Price and a replaceable battery.I just got this unit today so I'm writing a review on my experiance with this product today.I will write again in 6-8 months to let people know how this is still working.I bought this at circuit city and also bought the 3 year warrenty in case the problems with the harddrive and ear plug jack pop up that I've read about.So far this is a great unit thou.The install of the creative software and drivers installed on my xp computer with no problem.It was very easy to copy from my computer to this unit and very fast.You can also delete very easily if you want to.There is some pros and also a few cons from this unit.The price of this unit for this much memory was much cheaper than the ipod.Also I don't know about battery life yet since I just bought this.When you get it thou you will have to charge it for 4 hrs.      Pros   1)This hasn't been mentioned but when playing if you scroll to the now playing you get song,artist,title,album info and Gendre all at the same time.Here's what it looks like.Note you must be in now playing to see this.      Michelle   Percy Faith   The Beatles Album/Jesus Christ Superstar   Easy Listening      Also if the title is long it will scroll across.      On my lyra 64 I only get the song title.If I want to see the artist I have to hold the Dsp button down.      2)This comes with the 2.0 firewire and it is very fast.      3)The battery is removable so when it won't charge anymore you can just go buy another one.      4)This thing has sound effects for example concert hall,bathroom etc when listening to music.      5)A backlight for night viewing      6)You can shuffle songs and it will play like a radio station.      7)Times between songs are quick for example when one song ends the other imediently starts.      8)This thing holds a lot of songs.500 hrs with mp3 and 1000 with wma.My lyra usually won't hold over 20 songs.      9)This unit comes with music already installed.It includes quiet a few classical songs if you like classical music.It also comes with demos.      10)This can also hold video from your harddrive.      11)You can organise your songs by artist,song,album or gendre.      12)The sound sounds great thru this unit even better if you have the sound effects on.   Cons   1)The case with the belt clip don't have a see thru window.      2)You must put music tracks in the selected music to hear one after another.If you just choose a song from the playlist you won't hear another one following it.      3)It's not as small as the ipod.      4)No stop button.You must hit pause to cut the song off and if you want to power it off just hit the power button after hitting pause.      5)The packaged earplugs don't fit well      You can also play this in your car 2 ways.Either thru using a cassette adapter if you have a cassette player or by using an FM transmitter.I use the Belkin Tunecast Wireless Fm Transmitter.You can buy these for less than $20.I recommend this product just make sure you buy the warrenty.

<Title>Highly Recommended
<Date>Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned several MP3 players over several years, with this one replacing an old hard drive-based Nomad Jukebox (which replaced other RAM-based devices...) I highly recommend this one.    This device is a great value at the $215 I paid for it, especially when compared to the iPod (which I tried and thought was comparable). It's portable and compact, easy to use, high-performance, and the batteries last the whole day on a road trip.    I'd have preferred to see a directory-based listing for selecting genres, artists, and albums like the Nomad had, but once I got used to this format I like it. The desktop application for editing the embedded track information is very good, and highly addicting; I found myself spending hours getting all the data &quot;just right.&quot;    Overall, no complaints, a very satisfied customer. Thumbs up!

<Title>There's a Reason Why This Player is So Cheap . . . 
<Date>Tue Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been following the specs and prices of jukebox MP3 players for a couple years now, just waiting for a bargain to pounce on and digitize my whole music collection. A few weeks ago, I noticed the impressive price drop of the Creative Zen Xtra (30 and 40 GB models) and couldn't resist.     I guess I should say now that I own an iPod instead.     Why? While this brand and model might be suitable for some, I feel that only one word describes this gadget: CLUNKY. First of all, it's a pretty hefty device, it's size and weight comparable to an old cassette tape player. The screen isn't very sharp, and the menu scroll button is cheap and takes careful &quot;balancing&quot; of your fingertip (you'll know immediately what I mean if you try it). Furthermore, the model I received was either defective . . . or there just might be something to the gripes on this site about the battery life on these models - as my Zen Xtra would chug with juice for only a pathetic 80 minutes. While the Creative Zens are unique (to, say, iPods) in that you can remove and replace the battery, the claims of the company are just downright misleading. That's why I bought it over a variety of other brands: the advertised &quot;12 hour battery life!&quot; Nope.     Of course, there are some things that made it hard to send back for a refund. The sheer memory size, 30 or 40 GB, is HUGE. And Creative DID get one thing right - the SUPERB sound quality. Absolutely amazing, it makes the iPod sound bland. With cool effect equalizers that turn the sound into environments such as &quot;Concert Hall,&quot; &quot;Indoor Arena,&quot; and &quot;Auditorium,&quot; a whole new experience is added to old musical favorites.     But altogether, the bad far outweighs the good. If you're terribly strapped for cash, go for it. But unless you plan on keeping it plugged into the wall for home use, this isn't the player for you. Shell out the extra $50-70 for the iRiver or iPod.

If you arent hooked up to CDDB to get the album info I guess you have to manually input the stuff, but that little work will save you looking for songs.

<Title>Good player, but this technology is not yet great.
<Date>Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this as a gift.  I had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite CD's transferred.  However, the Creative software is not real intuitive.  The software  is somewhat nice to look at, using it is not the easiest.  If you want to rename a CD title that you have already transferred, you will become frustrated quite quickly.  You are better off deleting it, re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player.   <br>Transfers are surprisingly quick through USB 2.0. It is great sounding, even with the supplied earbuds.  I must have differing preferences than others here, as I prefer the supplied earbuds to the Sony's that I thought sounded good on other players.  I love the storage in this thing.  I have 100 of my CD's transferred and haven't made a dent in the 30 GB drive.  I doubt I will use half of the storage capacity, but you never know.  this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining MP3's in which I would have never purchased the CD.<p>Now my dissapointments.  The description of the Warranty is buried on the supplied set up CD.  The warranty is 90 days.  This is ridiculous.  To me this alludes to the manufacturer's confidence that the product will last for a year.  Buy the re-seller's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later, after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time (probably sooner than later).  The scroll wheel, to be blunt, sucks.  Seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection.  The interface used could be better designed.  It is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want.  I am a software engineer and if I wrote an interface to my software that worked like this, there would be hell to pay, not to mention the ridicule from my peers.  AND the case, how did this ever make it out of Quality Control.  It is some protection for the unit, but for useability, forget it.  The screen is covered, so to make any new selections you have to open it.  The cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls, especially the scroll wheel.  There are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet, so you have to live with it.<br>Despite the things that I have listed so far, I could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a CD case to work, to the gym, in the car, etc..  However the main reason I am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times.  I have had it lock up after a transfer of music.  The files are there, but I could not access the player without removing the battery, waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery.   Also have had it lock up when I shut it down to attend to a phone call.  Left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over.  Could not stop it, could not get out of the &quot;Now Playing&quot; screen.  Again had to remove the battery.  There have been other occurrences of locking, but I will not bore you with the details.   Quite simply, the firmware and/or the OS that control this thing is not ready for prime time.   There have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time, upon powering it up it starts on the &quot;Now Playing&quot; screen with a song or CD that I had been playing days before.  I haven't quite figured this one out yet, but it is probably operator error.  <br>Now I have not owned other MP3 players as I was waiting until they matured, but since I received it as a gift I now have this one.  I would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology.  And we all know about the rush to market on new products.   I have had this player for 2 weeks, I will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit.  While I am at the store I will definitely get the extended warranty as I have another day or so (from the purchase date) to obtain one.  I know this unit will have problems in the future and the $40 for the 2 year &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; replacement warranty will be worth it, since Creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous!

<Title>Another electronics fan
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Summary<p>Overall I like the unit. I gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when I dropped it from a fairly short distance (less than 2 ft). If it were not for that I would have given it 4.<p>Pros:<br>1) Price / GB of Storage<br>2) Storage Capacity<br>3) User replaceable battery<p>Cons:<br>1) Fragile (I broke the 1st one within 10 days)<br>2) Scroll button / switch<br>3) The case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing.<p>Features that would have been nice:<br>1) FM receiver - some models out there have this.<br>2) FM transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo. They sell an adapter unit to use with your car's cassette deck. But who wants the wires involved. A short range FM transmitter would be much nicer. I believe the Napster MP3 player has this feature.<p>Details:<p>Don't drop this unit:<br>I've had the player for about a month now. Overall I like it. As mentioned above I broke the player within the 1st 10 days. I was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke. I think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell (Murphy strikes again). I was able to return it to the retailer where I bought it and got a replacement. If you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you. I purchased the extended warranty (something I almost never do) when I returned the unit to get the replacement.<p>Updating the unit's firmware:<br>When I first purchased the unit I downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website. The upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions. I would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.<p>Storage:<br>The storage capacity is great. I don't think I will ever use the full 30GB. I currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and I haven't even used 10GB of storage yet. I'm starting to listen to CD's that I haven't listened to in years now that I have them all handy in one place.<p>For those out there that are not familiar with MP3 encoding, you can encode your CD's at varying quality levels. Typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps. The higher the number the better the quality (less data compression is used) and the larger the file size. If you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps. You should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player. If you're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end (typically 128 is considered close to CD quality).<p>Price:<br>The price compared to the iPod is great. Price, along with the replaceable battery (which I understand Apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it) were the two main factors on why I picked the Nomad. One word of caution with regards to using the Nomad with iTunes. I discovered this weekend that iTunes does not sell MP3's in the MP3 format. It using something called AC3 (at least the trial song I purchased was in this format) which is not a compatible format for the Nomad. I haven't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on iTunes. But for now it appears that this player doesn't play well with iTunes.<p>Scroll Bar:<br>The scroll bar is a bit of a pain. Sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items. It's not the end of the world, but a better design sure would be nice.<p>Software:<br>I've had no problems with the software. I found it intuitive to use (I didn't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes). The software will convert your CD's to MP3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to. My 2.6 MHz Pentium 4 with USB 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly (I would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per CD).<p>Through the software you can classify songs in genres. This is a nice feature (i.e. it's early in the morning and you rather listen to "easy listening" rather than "heavy metal" - no problem. The software comes with plenty of defaults genres. You can also create your own if you don't like their classifications. You can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later. This can be done on a song by song basis or in mass. In addition, you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation CD right on your player. This is pretty cool.<p>Sound:<br>The sound from the player is ok. I was a little disappointed in the low end. I did buy separate headphones as other have recommended. I was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base. The sound level is also not as high as I would have expected. It's probably good for the health of your ears, however I consistently play it near the high end of the volume range (and my hearing is fine).

I haven't checked the resilience of my xtra yet, and don't plan to.  However, if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their Zen, please share your experiences.

Of course you do!<p>a)feel cheap-- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop<br>b) the screen is hard to read-- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display<br>c)the scroll bar is a travesty-- enough said<br>d)software is another great misfortune-- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on<br>e)the case is too small-- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage<br>f)it doesnt look pretty-- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course<p>So... Im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new iPod instead. Don't waste your time, engery, resources on this thing, just spend a little more for a far more functional iPod.

<Content>I bought the Zen Xtra 30G as a gift. What a disappointment. The software failed repeatedly. I couldn't load more than one song before the software crashed. Creative Labs Customer support website is useless. Software downloads on the site crashed my pc. Creative tech support Operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if I had time during work hours to spend time on this. Don't buy this thing.
