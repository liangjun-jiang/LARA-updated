<Title>Fake mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got mine (512MB, blue version of this) from Sonystyle.com just yesterday. After playing with it for a few hrs here are my impressions.  First and foremost the mp3 playback quality is atrocious. 128kbps files sound like 64kbps or lower. Even my no-brand-name cheap mp3/cd player has better mp3 quality.   I suspect the codec/DSP in the Sony are still designed for their propreitary ATRAC3 plus format with a secondary mp3 support. In fact converting a mp3 file to Atrac3plus (with included software) sounded better than just mp3 file. Inspite of this hassle, it was still below mp3 quality from other players.   The battery life seems to be in line with the specs listed by Sony. No complaints on that front. The backlight LCD display is a nice bonus too. The size/volume is significantly more than the iPod Shuffle.  The user interface is more loaded than such a small palyer can withstand. As a result it more cumbersome and confusing than Apple/iRiver players.  In short this awkwardly named "mp3" music player is a step in right direction for Sony but is still below average. Price is right but not the quality.

<Content>this is my first mp3 player and i just chose it after a good research over net and considering my budget.at first wanted to buy an iPod but considering the fact that,going to buy a PMP in near future,decided to go with flash-based players and also lower the price as much as i can my choices now become:creative zen n200-Shuffle-NWe100 series.considering shuffles lack of features my main choice became N200 because of low price and featured-pack  package,but when i saw all those awfull ratings reviewers gave it and seeing it at store i went with my last choie:NW-E103 cause it has the nearest price to N200 and never go back. and now my expressions: after i got it,i must say it is very beautiful and stylish(i picked the one with Orange color)to hide in your pocket!and also very small.sound quality is extreme as expected from sony products dont let other reviewers confuse you,it IS excellent. and for the software side you can either Drag&Drop by updating mp3 file manager to v.2.o or using sonicstage 3.0-i must say after reading all those reviews which say it is a crap i found it very useful and also beautiful UI you can with a little effort import all your library and(you must rearrenge it) and then transfer them.you can also convert your songs to atrack3/plus and reduce their size so that you can double or triple your players space,wich i find very nice and useful,you can play with the settings and choose the bitrate that best suits you-in most cases you cant tell the diffrence after compression. the unit itself is well-built and can last a long time.face plate buttons are very intuitive and nice my only compliant is the usb cover and Hold switch wich are not that easy to operate and wish it had 512mb or 1gb thats why i gave it 4 stars. over all very happy to buy it and recommend it.

<Title>Perfect for simple needs

<Content>The 256mg NW is perfect to put your workout cd's on and do your thing.  I use it for walking at lunch at work and doing stuff around the house.  Pick your favorite 15 or so cd's, load it in your computer and have a great time.  The software is extremely easy to use.  The sound is beautiful & it is lightweight.  The only complaint I would have is that a strap was not included, BUT it does have a place to connect a strap or lanyard.  You can buy the armband for $14 at Wal-Mart. If you're not techno-savvy or into downloading music all day and just want something to put your favorite tunes on without all the wweight of a cd or tape player, this is PERFECT!  Plus, it's a very reasonable price for Sony quality when the knockoff's cost more than this!!

<Content>I purchased this item for my daughter.  I was very happy with the easy set-up of the software to record music and the ease at which it recorded.  I expect her to enjoy it very much when we give it to her for her birthday.  I also was very happy with the low price.

<Content>I thought this MP3 Player was worthy of the WALKMAN brand.  I was just a little disapponted that it didn't hold more songs, and the volume control was hard to adjust sometimes, but it was still worth the money!
