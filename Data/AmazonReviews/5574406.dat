<Title>Not as quick to operate
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first purchased this item, I loved it.  I really appreaciated the very long battery life and how quickly it charges back up.  However, I have noticed that it now does not hold its charge as long, or it doesn't charge up all the way.  I do not do any exercising activities with it, so I have never had the moisture under the screen problem and it has help up very well in the past two years that I have owned it.  However, I started to feel the annoyance of the fact that you cannot fast forward or rewind songs.  Also, you can't just push a button to go the the next song.  I have to go to the main menu, go into the albums, find the album, and scroll down to find the next song that I want.  Other than these small annoyances, it works great!

<Title>decent enough
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>my dad sent me this after my video ipod got stolen.  I have to say that it does the job well enough.  Controls are great once you figure them out.  Very compact.  Long battery life.  Quick charge up.  Nice sound quality.  Also comes with FM radio if you get tired of your own music.   all an all... it's a nice basic MP3 player if you aren't looking for anything fancy.

<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily.

<Title>Great MP3 player!
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this MP3 player.  The reason I picked this MP3 player over all the others is because it is small and it has an FM Tuner.  In the winter when I have to exercise inside the gym has televisions with FM transmitters to listen to them.  If I didn't have the FM tuner I would be able to listen to the televisions and it gets old after a while if you can only listen to straight music.  It is also nice to listen to a local station to get the local news and events that are going on.  The only downfall on this item is the display is difficult to see out in the sun.  Battery life is super long and it charges up fast if you forget to charge it up.  It really does last 3 hours with a 3 minute charge.

You can organize your music on the player from Sonic Stage which is a great program. The battery lasts a long time and takes a very short time to charge via usb 2.0 port.   It is absolutely excellent

<Title>if you don't want video or your whole music library with you.....
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this little mp3 player for over a year now, bought one for my wife, and my brother loved it (bought one too). It's about the size of a lighter, light weight, and comes with a clip that actually works well. You got to spend a little bit of time to figure out the controls, especially if you're just trying to figure it out on your own, you might not notice the shuffle control. A tiny little button on the back side of the player.   Battery time is awesome, there's just nothing else to that.  The moisture thing is true... I just started to notice it about a month ago. A small part of the screen is starting to have a little cloudy spot on it.  But after over a year of using it on my runs and workouts, and all of my travels, I cannot complain.   I had bought a zune which was huge, then an ipod (not as big, but still bothered me on my runs). Then I realized that I don't need my whole music library with me at all times, so one gig is perfect for me.  If you purchase a good set of headsets... this player will deliver a good sound, great battery time, and plenty of music (you can use the atrac formatting from sony).

<Title>Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars)
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible.  Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer?  I just don't understand proprietary third party software.  I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive.  That alone makes it not worth buying.  Stick with players that are open source.  As for the authorization thing to get files off the player?  I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.  Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For every one of you who is looking for a way to transfer MP3 files directly to this player (or any other newer NW-EXXX models) follow the link below and download Sony MP3 file manager V2.0: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3  You need to install the drivers first so that the Windows would recognize the device. You don't need SonicStage if you use this software to play MP3 files. All you do is to run an executable through MP3FM folder inside the player and drag & drop your MP3 files. Unfortunately I could not find a way to combine/rename folders after the transfer. Even if you organize your mp3 files into folders as you want to access in the player beforehand, after running this software your folder structure will be gone if it's deeper than 1 level.  Apart from this the player sounds very good with an awesome display. VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files are recognized and played back flawlessly. The track/album access with the dial is also designed very well. On the negative side the player feels a bit too plasticky, not like the earlier titanium NW-MS70D. Also the bag that comes with this player is too big for the player itself. I wish there was a smaller one bundled in.

<Title>Some Clarifications
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before I start with my mini review, let me first clarify some things:  1. This device support MP3 drag-and-drop without using Sonic Stage using a program provided by Sony. See the following links:  Sony: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3 How to make it auto-launch: http://forums.minidisc.org/index.php?showtopic=11234  2. This device works as a regular flash drive. It lets you copy non-audio files.  Mini review:  Having used a Sony miniDisc player before, I'm used to Sonic Stage already. One thing I don't like about it is, there's no Mac support. Sonic Stage is not really hard to use. I look at it as, it's not as easy as iTunes.  It comes with 5 free songs (gift cert) at Sony Connect. The upload of the songs to the device was a bit slow since it's USB 1.1. A good thing about Sonic Stage though is, you can choose what songs to upload to your music device (Apple added this feature when the Shuffle was released).  Although just one color (light blue), the OLED screen is great. Think of an LCD screen but brighter (it makes me want to get the Sony Clie VZ90). All devices with screens should use OLED! :D  The metal controls require getting used to. It reminds me of the small dial at the side of an analog watch -- pull once and twist up or down to scroll through the songs, pull it one more time and twisting up or down scolls through the albums, push it in and it's on 'hold' and controls are protected from accidental pushes or twists.   On power saving mode, when a song is playing, after a few seconds, the screen turns off. Every after a few seconds thereafter, an animation - like four "(" - runs to show you that something is playing.  Battery life - I have no plans of testing it but the box says it will last 50 hours of continuous playing. The box also says that a 3-minute charge is good for 3-hours use (wow). Charging is done via USB through the computer by the way.  As for weight, it's slightly heavier than the Shuffle.  There is an option to adjust bass and treble. Using good earphones makes it sound really better than the Shuffle.  Purchased music are in ATRAC3 format, though it can play MP3, WMA, and WAV files if you upload them via Sonic Stage.  Earphones, USB cable, belt clip, a black pouch, and a 5 free song Sony Connect coupon are included in the box.  As for the cost, the E507 (which has 1GB) is $199 - the 1GB Shuffle is $129. Is the $70 difference worth it? Knowing that Sony included an 3-liner OLED (not just a regular LCD) screen is well worth it already. It also comes with an FM tuner and a clock. While it says at the the back that it was built in China, the build is solid. I highly recommend this device.

<Title>*SIGH* oh Sony! When will you get it right?
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loved this player.  I thought it was beautiful and it complemented my PSP quite well.    But you know of course that Sony had to mess it up.  Have they not learned anything from the ATRAC only Network Walkman debacle of a few years ago?    See here is what has happened.  Sony is composed of two companies.  Media and Engineers.  The engineers put out all the cool stuff like Plasma TV's, PSP, PS2 (PS3!), etc.  Media puts out cool stuff like Spiderman 1 & 2 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Media side thinks EVERYONE is a thief and makes the engineering side put all kinds of stupid restrictions on their hardware.  Like on my PSP I have to rename .mp4 movies to NV25349.mp4 and place them in a folder called NV0001.  Music and pictures go in *gasp* the music and pictures folder!  Anyway this isn't a PSP review.  I got this MP3 player from Amazon and I was so happy when I got it.  I immediately unpacked it, marveled and drooled at how beautiful it is, and hooked it up to my USB port on my computer.  I then tried to copy over MP3's.  Alas that didn't work.  No I had to use this program that was REALLY lame.  It is very restrictive on what you can copy over and, like a previous reviewer said, you have to authenticate to even pull your mp3's off!  IT's MY MUSIC Sony.  I own all the CD's and you're treating me like I stole your baby's college fund.  Come on and wise up.  You didn't get where you are today by restricting your customers and your own innovation.  This could be such an iPod killer but alas restrictive software (even moreso than iTunes!) doesn't help me out.  I sold this player on eBay for more than I bought it for anyway.

<Title>love it!
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Has a great look, very modern & sleek!  The screen is really neat, but it's hard to see when using outdoors in the bright sun.  Love how compact it is, how light it is, and how the small number of buttons and things do so many different things.  I do wish there was a arm band for it, but I have concocted my own using a wrist band (sweat band thing) which works fine. It has great sound - I love the various sound options!   One thing I don't like... there are different screen settings, and when you switch one to show the time or something, I wish it would show the music information when you switch songs, but it doesn't.  If you select the time to be shown, you'll see that only until you switch over to the other Display mode.   I have had some problems w/ the software... but I got songs onto the player in the end.  It's not too user friendly.   But overall, I am thoroughly enjoying it.

<Title>Sony NW-E507 Network Walkman - * * * * *
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony has a winner here!  Display is crisp and is easily seen in daylight. The Controls are easy to use and straight forward. The size and weight are minimal - you can clip in on your shirt. The sound quality is excellent - even at max sound level. The included sofware is fairly easy to use and setup. It would have been nice (hint to sony) if a standard retractable USB connector was built in - I just bought a mini-usb to USB adapter and keep in in the included bag. The FM tuner is sensitive and locks in the toughest stations. If you carefully look on the web, there is an alternate mp3 manager available that is tiny and can be run directly from the unit when plugged into USB.  The unit can also be used as a file storage device similar to a standard USB dongle.  Battery life is excellent.  Just plug into any USB to recharge.   5 Stars  Awesome!

<Title>Ipod Killer
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony's NW-E507 Digital Music Player is perfection. The player's benefits range from its sexy design to it's user friendly downloading software. I had searched for a MP3 for several months and upon finding the NW-E507 I knew I had an MP3 Player to rival my friends Ipods. First the NW-E507 holds 1gb of storage which is perfect for what I use it for. My mp3 player is used for the gym mainly. I knew in my mind that the ipod was to big for the gym and the shuffle did not have a screen which was a definite negative. the sony mp3 player has a integrated screen, which has received several compliments. The quick battery charge is great as well and so is the navagational system on MP3 player. Not a single negative i can think of. just buy it.

<Title>Sony's software
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is a well established truism that Sony's primary operating software for their mp3 players is dreadful.  However, they have had the foresight to make available a drag-n-drop "mp3 Manager" that is ingenious in its utter simplicity. (Makes you wonder why they just don't tweak their miserable Sonic software that is both user-un-friendly and, apparently, hyper-suspicious re piracy concerns.)  I have found the MP3 Manager software not only at the Sony site but at a couple other places online.  Once installed, it automatically opens when you connect your player via USB, and opens a window that permits you to delete and add music files with the greatest of ease.  Note, though, it will only work with mp3 formatted files, and won't abide, e.g., wma format.  I have not yet received my NW-E507 (but give it 4 stars based on my experience with the NW-E75 I currently own), but the software works quite well with my NW-E75 (of which I am replacing with the NW-E507 only for the greater 1 gig v. 256MB storage capacity).  I assume, based on a couple postings here, that the MP3 Manager Software works equally as well with the NW-E507 (assume and hope....).

<Title>Its a good product, but you have to know  a few things
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read several reviews for mp3. I had chosen the cheaper model of sony (the crappy circle thing). I had software issues so i returned it. They were out and I got this instead. All I am going to say is that it works very well once you know how to use it. The software is a nightmare until i realised that it was just looking for copy right protect songs, which you can easily fake using the wma format. It will convert them when transfer to the player. All you have to do is click the wma file to sonic stage, (then it makes a short cut) and transfer to the player. It will even allow you to reduce the bite rate the 48 artac format.  Another thing is that you must make your playlist first and tranfer how you want the playlist to play. once it is on the player it will allow search for artist and album so naviation isn't bad once you figure it out.

<Title>SHAME ON SONY--Save yourself the $$ and aggravation!!
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think that buying an electronic device is kind of like getting married: you should do a LOT of homework before making a commitment, based on your needs, preferences, price range (okay, well that *shouldn't* apply to *marriage*), etc. So, when I was looking for an MP3 player to use while running, I looked at a lot of reviews and compared features before finally selecting the NW-E507. I agree with those who found the software limiting, but I knew about that going into the purchase and felt that the huge memory, amazing battery life, compact size and easy functionality were a fair trade.   So . . . my first year of marriage to NW-E507 was everything that a blissful honeymoon should be. It worked exactly as it was supposed to, and I loved it and took very good care of it. Then, just a year after purchase (and long after the 90-day warranty expired), its personality changed. Well, at least the electronic equivalent of that--all of the buttons stopped working properly, it began to fast-forward sporadically, the battery wouldn't last longer than a couple of hours. It was an MP3 player possessed. I tried erasing its memory and reinstalling my files, scoured the owner's manual for troubleshooting ideas, cursed, prayed and finally decided to write a scathing review.   If I could give this product zero stars I would, because $200 (alas, I bought this when it first came out and paid retail) is WAY TOO MUCH (even $139 is too much) to pay for a poor quality product that is designed (I believe purposefully by Sony) to break so that it has to be replaced. Sorry, that's just bad customer service on Sony's part, and I will not be purchasing their products again.  So please, learn from my mistakes, vote with your dollars for a better product, and teach Sony to not be so disengenous with its customers.

<Title>un.............believ...a......ble
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll type this with what CPU time SonicStage allows. I was concerned in "going digital" that I'd spend too much time in overhead -managing which tracks to get, which to put on the player. Still I tended (or chose) to discount the many complaints about the software over the niftiness of the player. 700 tracks over 250 for a 1-gig Ipod with a radio and long battery life thrown in. Indeed the ATRAC format sounds fine and its the best mini radio I've used.   That's the 1-star. Unfortunately, the software is as much the product as the gadget itself. It's all the forementioned and more (when I got it to run -it requires XP service pack 2 which Indian support never told me). Its maddeningly slow- bringing the whole system to a grinding halt where other windows can take a minute or two to respond when its loading the player. (Don't think about doing anything else to SonicStage.) It has no end of idiosynchrosies- the why-did-it-do-thats and why-can't-I-do-this's never stop. I've wasted many evenings in the last 6 weeks trying to load it- learning just how to select the tracks so they'll end up in the right album folder and not in another, or dumped in folders called "new album" or "untitled". The tracklist for the player won't sort and can't be printed. Who knows if everything's there. Sonicstage will arbitrarily refuse to load tracks to the player with cryptic error messages (aplenty). Reimport the tracks to Sonicstage and its got no problem. And a few corrupted (screech) files have showed up that worked before.   Anyway what compelled the post was the other night when newly loaded tracks were again going to the wrong folder. There being no way to stop the transfer and in what wasn't the first white rage I killed SonicStage from the task manager. When it restarted it didn't recognise the player and said I would need to delete all files please-to-thank-you. 800 Meg. Now this is the equivalent of "Windows was improperly shut down- please reformat your hard drive". An overnight reload has it halfway back but I sure wish it said something about backups.   Again taken as software/hardware, this a consumer product that makes the Yugo look good. There are plenty of choices. I urge you to keep looking.

<Title>With normal use, condensation will damage/kill this player
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved this player when I got it, BUT, 9 months after I bought it, the unit stopped working.  Upon inspection, it looked like there was condensation inside the plastic case.  I called Sony and they told me I would have to pay something like $40 for labor even though the item was less than a year old.  They also said that the technician would inspect for moisture inside the plastic, and if they found moisture (or "signs of moisture") the $40 fee they planned to charge me would be increased.  Any moisture in the unit was not my fault: The unit never got wet- I used it for running but always kept it dry.  The moisture in the air must have caused the unit failure.  This is obviously a design flaw.    I decided not to bother with sending the unit back since they said they wouldn't fix it because of moisture in the unit- plus I was not happy at the prospect of paying about $40 to have an item repaired which was less than a year old!!!  After a week, the unit dried up and started playing again, but not all the buttons work now- Most importantly, the button which moves tracks forward doesn't work, which is a major inconvenience.    Another flaw is that when you load new data onto the player, it resets so that you lose your place.  I have to write down the track number/time I was listening to before loading new data so that I can find my place again.  Of course, that is now much more difficult because I can't move tracks forward!!!!!  Buyer beware!

<Title>Beware: Do Not Operate With Wet Fingers
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are four things I really like about this player: 1) The very long 50-hour battery life, and all on a quick charge time; 2) The great sound when it's played on the one preset level with extra-bass. The other preset levels sound tinny, so you'll likely never use them; 3) The 695 (with 4-minute songs) track storage capacity. 4) The excellent FM reception even inside a building workplace.  There are two things I didn't like, so I took 2 stars away, and gave this Sony MP3 player an overall score of 3 stars: 1) The Sony Sonic Stage software you must use to upload songs into the player is purely anti-consumer with its DRM to prevent piracy. Though, there is an easy way around it such as burning a song stored on you computer to a CD-R, then uploading that song that's now on a CD into the accompanying and mandatory SonicStage software. If most of your music you plan on uploading into this MP3 player is already on CD than it's no problem, but if most of your music is stored only on your hard-drive than you might want to forget this player unless you don't mind burning your songs onto CDs first. 2) But the REALLY big problem I have with this MP3 player is if your fingers are wet, or in anyway moist, and you press any of the operating buttons on the unit then moisture will get trapped in-between the surface and the display screen, so if you use this while exercising, or work in a cold and wet environment, only operate this unit with it inside a plastic freezer bag as I do. It's just one big design flaw that I'm surprised Sony overlooked.

<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed this device up until 3 weeks ago.  It has long battery life and a large capacity for storage.  BUT that does not matter if it just cuts off on you.  Lately, has I hit an hour mark of running, it just shuts off.  I did notice that the player looked as if it had moisture inside so i thought it was from my sweat.  After reading the other reviews, i realize this is a feature of the player--- moisture getting trapped inside....I wish I would have known this before,  I would have just gotten an IPOD.  Anyhoo, on top of that, if you run in the daylight (which i believe most of us do) you can't read the player because of the reflection against the sun.  I find myself having to hover over it or go to a dark space in order to see what songs I am changing it too....If you don't run, and just sit around with it, buy it, but if you plan on doing any activities with it (i.e. running, walking, excercise) DONT BUY IT!!!

<Title>Headphone 
<Date>Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this for my 14 year old nephew who figured everything out without taking a peek into the instructions, in a matter of minutes downloaded the software to all 3 computers, and handles  downloading ,transfering, erasing music with ease. I think it is an awesome little piece of art. The length of the 2 lines to the headphone IS supposed to be different. I didn't know myself so asked him, and was told that one side goes directly to your ear from let's say your front pocket, the other goes behind your neck then to you other ear so the thing doesn't dangle on your chest under your chin.

<Title>Finally, an MP3 player that looks cool. 
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been waiting for an appealing MP3 player to come out for years, and Sony became my savior. When I first recieved this particular mp3 player, I charged it for about five whole minutes. The thing played for nearly five hours! The battery itslef, when fully charged is good for 50 hours.The FM Tuner is a nice feature, and is only staticky where absoulutely no signal can be detected, such as in tunnels, and some hallways. Other than that, I have owned mine for about a month, and have had no other problems. It is surprisingly durable, as well. At one time while I was handling it, a passerby knocked it forcefully, but accidentally to the ground. Much to my surprise, it was still playing the same song, unsratched and unscathed. It also came with it's own clip, Usb cable, and headphones as well. I have been noticing that people have been having problems with the headphones and their unique design. One earbud wire is made longer thatn the other, so that it may be worn around the back of the neck and not be a nuisance, swinging and dangling in front of you, and tangling on things. When used correctly, the design will be much appreciated. However, the reason that I did not give five stars was also because of the headphones. Personally, I like to leave the headphones connected, and wrap them around the player when I don't use it. This prevents me from leaving them places. While most headphones have the L-shaped jack, this is a strait one, wich bent the wire strait down each time it was wrapped up. After about three weeks, and much to my surprise, the wire insulation separated at that point. It was nothing a piece of duct tape couldn't fix,or a new set of headphones, for that matter. The software is easy to use, but if this is your first MP3 player you should read the instructions first. The package also includes a free Napster Trial, which is nice for the song(s) that you just never could find. The Design of the player itself is very unique and easily accesible. After about two days of carrying it around I could operate it with one hand. All in all, if you ever plan on getting an MP3 Player, I would recommend this one.

<Content>I didn't know that until I read the spec. I also didn't know that usb 2.0 can be this slow. It's like... you're driving ferrari in freeway at 20mph! Why did Sony make this device USB 2.0 if it takes 10 sec to transfer one song, and another 10 sec to refresh the list? I now can see why iTunes is great.  After several Sony cassette player, Sony MD Plyaer, Sony CD Player, and now Sony mp3 player, I will never buy Sony again.

<Title>works indoors as long as you aren't moving fast
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this device primarily because I wanted an FM receiver.  I liked the compact size, capacity, battery (charge and recharging) but I intended to wear it while running.  First, the manual stinks and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, or stop the repeats.  Eventually I worked that out.  The ear buds caused sores in my ear canals and constantly fell out.  I replaced these with SONY $80 ear buds that aren't much better.  Then I couldn't see the display when I ventured outdoors.  The quality of the display just kept getting worse, until it died completely.  Finally, the whole thing stopped playing after 27 days.  I took it back to SONY and the manager told me that it had been abused.  He would send it back to SONY for an autopsy and let me know whether it was covered by the warranty.  I simply used it while running.  I haven't received the forensic report yet but I wouldn't recommend this product.

<Title>M y screen is cloudy!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my player for barely 2 months.  It was working great until it suddenly stopped playing.  Condensation built up inside the screen while I was using it inside and it stopped.  After a few hours, the condensation was a little better and it started playing again, but the display options don't work properly anymore.    The customer help line told me to keep it in a dry place for 1 - 2 hours and let it dry out.  It's been "drying" for a week and the screen is still spotted and cloudy.    The really cool design was the main reason I bought it and I thought a Sony was supposed to be good.  Sony did make me the wonderful offer of exchanging my almost brand new player for a refurbished player of "comparable" quality.    Still seeking satisfaction.

<Title>The best until nano showed up, still there are advantages
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>All in all, this little player is really great, with its extremely reliable battery life you're going to love that this thing will spend more time in your pocket than charging itself up. I don't know how is the ipod nano speed to charge going to be, but sony really keeps its promise: "3 minutes of charge, 3 hours of life" and the "50 hours of battery life" (against the 14 of ipod nano), I've been using it a lot and this thing lasts a least a week and more.  The sound is really good, and unless you are a music maniac the 1gb capacity should be enough to keep playing a good selection of music till you can change them in a week or so while it charges.  It comes with a clip which I find it really useful to be able to change the song quickly, but if you don't want to impress other pedestrians by having it on the belt-clip you can just put it in your pocket and you'll barely notice it.  I use to travel and that's why I love its battery life, also the FM tuner (which the ipod nano doesn't have) keeps you up to date whenever, wherever and, even when you won't be using it a lot, it's really great to have it available when you want it.  The transfer speed is not really slow, but kind of. The software that comes with it is not the best but neither the monster that everybody wants you to believe, it's really easy to use.  While ipod nano is hanging around 200 and 250 this thing looks expensive, but it is really worth it.

<Content>Great sound.  I thought 500 songs would be enough, but (how spoiled are we) I'd be happier with more.  On the other hand, it's solid state, with no little spinning thing whose MTBF I have to worry about.  Endless battery charge.  I just took it on vacation...long sessions by the pool...and I barely made a dent in the charge.  Can't see the messages in bright sun.  But I only needed to know one and could do it without seeing it.  My daughter has a little iPod and I'm not at all jealous.  I'm sure my point of failure will be well after hers.  But a friend has a big one with much, much more capacity.  I'm kind of jealous of him.  But mine will still be running long after both of theirs die.

<Title>Great 1st MP3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the blue version of this player along with a set of Fontopia MDR-EX81SL earphones and a Sony lanyard. This is my first MP3 player and was looking for a quality device, great sound quality, FM tuner, large storage capacity, long battery life, portability and "coolness factor".  I got all of these and more with the NW-E507.  I found using the included SonicStage3 software very easy to use.  Sound quality is excellent even using the ATRAC3Plus setting of 48 kbps.  At this setting, you can download 45 hours of music into the player.  You won't need to worry about recharging the battery very often as it's rated at 50 hours after connecting it via USB cable to your computer for 2 hours.  There's also a quick charge feature where you get a 3 hour power supply after charging for only 5 minutes, great for people on the go!  The form factor of this device is excellent and the controls are easily understandable.  I'm able to use only one hand when controlling the player.  The OELD display is definitely cool (as well as informative).  The OELD is bright and the information appears to "float" on the side of the player, as there isn't a visible screen.  This is my first player and I'm very happy with this device!

<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had a tough luck with Sony in the past. For example PDA that I had needed a special Memory Stick which costed like 30% more, special format for MP3 and stuff like that. When I got this device I was dissapointed at first, dunno why. After 30 minutes playing with it I fell in love with it. I got used to controls and Sonic Stage which actually lets you upoload MP3 in it's orinal state without converting to sony format ATRAC3 or wateva it is. Ability to control this player with just one hand is AMAZING. Regarding the battery life all that I can say is WOW. It charges thru USB, so whenever you want to upload a song it charges itslef up. All you people who are considering between Apple and Sony, Sony should be your choice even though it's a little more money.

<Title>Finally Sony delivers
<Date>Fri May 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In the past Sony was synonymous with superior audio products with innovative design.  Up til now their mp3 products have being disappointing and frustrating. I had my 64 meg mcp10 for 5 years now and it's time for an upgrade.  If you're like me, I don't understand the whole Ipod hype.  The product (design, and functions) does not justify the cost.  I was about to get an I-River when I heard about the new NW-E500 series. It has all the features I want and it excel in some area.    Design: Finally a mp3 player that looks more like an electronic device than a computer device.  The size is about a slim version of most jump drives. The jog dial seems odd at first but the it's a 5 min learning curve and very intuitive.  You can perform all the functions such as volume, track forward/rewind, album forwarding without looking.  In the end, the ergonomic is great.  Display The biggest gripe I have with the shuffle is the lack of a display.  The NW-E507's organic EL display is sharp and shows the artist and song title.    Battery It uses a rechargable lithium battery via your USB connection.  Surprisely, the quick charge feature does work.  They claim it's about 40 ours of playing time using standard mp3 format.  So far, it looks promising after a couple hours of playtime.  Software: I think the biggest issue I had in the past with Sony is their ATRAC format.  I had to format my mp3 to that format in order to transfer it over to the mcp10.  Well that's finally changed!!! You can transfer normal mp3, wma without any conversion.  The new Sonic stage software isn't bad but could be improve upon.   Right now I have one issue , it doesn't allow you to transfer songs from mulitple computers without deleting your existing content on the nw-e507.  urgh another Sony lame anti-pirating feature.  I'll have to look more into this.  I haven't try downloading songs from their Connect network. so I have no comments on that.  Storage: It's plug and play, shows up on your computer as a removeable device.  Summary: For $199 you get a good all around mp3 player with a fm tuner and a display.  Compare to the Shuffle, there's no comparison. Compare to the I-river... pretty much same features but better styling.  Hoepfully they offer other colors in the future.

<Title>Great player, unfriendly DRM software
<Date>Sun May 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fairly small, although it may be confused with a shiny lighter. I actually kind of like that kind of camouflage since it makes it less likely to be stolen. There is no mistaking it for a lighter once the bright OLED display comes alive.  The controls are well-thought, a Sony trademark of sorts. There is a large play/stop button, two paddles on the "shoulders" for volume, and a sliding joystick control around the headpone jack. The joystick works like a watch crown. Pushed down, it puts the device in "hold" mode. It has two other positions. To skip to next/prev song, you rotate the joystick a bit (when not in "hold" mode). The bottom hides the mini-USB port. Minor gripe: the device stops playing when the USB cable is plugged in.  The OLED display is a very nice touch and it integrates quite well with the player's design, although I wish it were a tad longer to be able to display more text without scrolling. The fixed font makes it hard to read sometimes. A proportional font would work better (probably fixable with a software upgrade).  Which brings me to the reason why I gave it only 4 stars. And why I am going to return it. There is simply too much hassle associated with putting music on the device and copying it back from it. The software insists on controlling what I can and cannot do with my own files. You can only upload mp3s by using the included SonicStage software. But, regardless of the original source, it will not let you download the files back unless you perform an "authorization" with some remote site I don't care for, presumably because it assumes you're a "thief". That, my friends, I cannot have.  Sigh. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. The mp3 player is a USB storage device, with a universal driver, you plug it in, you copy files to/from it, it plays whatever it can from your folders. It would have worked everywhere, even with a Mac or Linux, or even years after support for the actual player had lapsed, without any extra effort. But no. Not with this one. You can certainly upload files to it, it will just ignore them if you didn't put them via SonicStage. You can look at it as having two areas on the drive, one for the encoded music that it will play, and one for your files, that it will not.  To recapitulate: it is My computer. My mp3 player. My music. I find it odd that Sony thinks I will pay them money so they can POLICE my own computer. Nuh-huh. Not me. I guess I'll just have to put up with a clunkier interface of Archos, Iriver, or I don't know, Lexar, that at least give me the FREEDOM to do what I want with my own stuff.

<Title>Great digital player, FM tuner. Can't see display in sun.
<Date>Mon Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First for the good.  This player has great sound, both from the digital player and from the FM tuner.  Good FM reception well outside major cities.  The bass and treble can be adjusted for the digital but not for FM.  Music is clear from low to high volumes.  Battery life is very long.  For those who listen to FM only, Sony claims 22 hours.  Digital using Atrac is 50 hours.  My informal tests showed these numbers to be true.  Once the controls are learned (and it's a quick study), the unit is very easy to use.  Charging times are very fast.  The SonicStage software is OK.  It did everything I wanted and a little more than I expected so I have no complaints.  On to the bad.  The headphones Sony supplies are terrible.  For a $200 player, they should include something better.  I am currently using Sony headphones MDR-A34.  I paid $17 and the sound is great.  The OLED is absolutely NOT visible in sunny conditions, no matter how I turn and twist the unit.  It looks great in normal and low light conditions.  It's not a show stopper since I hardly need to look at the unit to switch songs, radio stations and the volume.  It would be nice if the unit could play while plugged in and charging.  I use it at work where I can't copy music files to the local computer but I can use the USB as a power source and external speakers instead of the headphones.  In conclusion, if Sony would include better headphones and find a way to make the OLED visible in sunlight and allow playback while plugged in, this unit would be 5++ easy.

<Content>This is a great player, supurb sound, great FM reception.  I used mine for running and after running with it two times, the shiny metal coating over the OLED display wore off.  It's still readable, but looks crappy.  I have no idea how it happened.  I'm wondering if the salt from my fingers wore it off as I turned the knob.  I'll be returning it to Sony for a replacement.  Disappointed with the quality though, so 3 stars.  Update:  What happened is when I pressed the display button, the salty sweat from my fingers got into the player causing the screen to be coated with a salty substance.  So, word of warning:  Do not operate controls with wet hands.

<Date>Mon Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I waited forever for this DAP to be released here in the US. I finally got it with a $150 gift card and sony card bonus points... so I paid a whopping $12.57 for it. If I did not get it so cheap, I would probably take it back... but this is a conditional statement...  One of the things I like about the player is the ability to display foreign languages. One of which happens to be Korean, although I have not found an official list of supported languages.  If all of my MP3s were in English, I think I would give this player 5 stars... even with the minor headache of using SonicStage... but the big problem I have with SonicStage is that it does not support Korean, even though the player does... so how do I go around this problem? I have to rename all my files to English, keeping the ID tags in Korean... this is more than what I really hoped to do... I am used to iRiver drag and drop from Win Explorer...  The only other drawback is the display that is said to be visible in any lighting? If you are outside on a sunny day... you can FAINTLY see the display...

<Title>Functionality Superior to the iPod Shuffle, But Has Issues
<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought one of these on vacation as a replacememnt for my iPod Shuffle which I had forgotten at home. Head-to-head from a functionality point the Sony wins hands-down. Hard to beat a 50-hour battery and the fact that you can actually see and navigate your playlist on the readout: an obvious and frustrating drawback on the Shuffle that Apple oddly markets as some kind of virtue.  Now the drawbacks. I used mine for running. After a mere 3 days the salt from my hands caused some real wear to the finish. Can't imagine what it will look like a month hence. Unacceptable. Also, Apple does a slick job in itegrating the iPod with the Mac.  Getting songs onto the Sony is a cumbersome and frustrating process. It's also about twice the price of a Shuffle.  So which would I choose if going in cold? I'd go with the Sony. Love the long battery life and the readout. And I'm sure I could get use to the crummy Sony software if I weren't spolied by the Apple iTunes interface.

The software is a pain in the ass!!! even though the package states it recognizes WMA, WAV, MP3, etc... it actually only works with sony's ATRAC3. the software converts all other files to this form, which seems to take forever. I had a iriver before this one and as soon as i get back from my trip I'll be selling this sony on ebay and finding a iriver, used if thats all i can find. sony can kiss my arse!!

<Content>I am very happy with the player, it is super in terms of sound and battery life however there are some serious design issues. The LCD portion has shown some damage (I am guessing due to my body heat- holding it in my palms, putting it in pocket close to my body etc.) the inside looks melted!!. It hasn't affected the performance in any way, but the disfiguration decreases its aesthetic value. The disfiguration actually hasn't even stopped yet- it seems to get worse! Also, this is VERY stupid, but the display is useless under bright daylight condition. SONY needs to re-design! I expected better from 'em. Buyers beware!

<Title>AWESOME!!!!
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading reviews I was little concerned about sonic stage software, it was a total non-issue for me.  I have purchased music from 5 major sights and ripped music from personal collection and there was NO ISSUE.  Others who encounter sonic stage issues may be trying to interchange formats and/or have other sources of music formats.  Take the time to load and learn software as it works very well and is rather painless, as you can really organize your music.   Software will install operation manual on your computer, take the time to read them as paper copy does not cover a lot of features.  GOOD FEATURES 1) 1GB - NOT 1.5GB+ when you use sonic stage software and still great sound quality. 2)Display - COOL with lots of choices ex: date, time, artist,song etc which you set. 3)Battery Life/Charging- WOW, no one beats about 50 hours per 45 min charge.(3min charge = 2hours) 4) FM radio - included, good sound with 30 present channels, no extra cost. 5)Sound Mode- 3 settings 1 factory, 2 personal sets(you set bass and treble from 0 to 3) limited but yet adds greatly to sound quaility better sound that most MP3's. 6) Volume - 2 volume control setting A)manual volume increases/decreases by 1 step intervals B)Preset volume which has low, med, and high sets(which can be changed)so volume up/down buttons jumps between 3 quick steps when using this feature. 7) AVLS-  limits volume (helps police my love for loud tunes) 8)Repeat Mode - 3 repeat modes(They are a little trickly to figure out but convenient depending on personal styles) 9) Hold - holds settings at current state so bumping of buttons does not change during play or off. 10) Shuffle - mixes it up -great.  Organize + organize + organize = sweet! Take time to organize your music on sonic stage software before transfering to E507.  The software automatically organizes by artist-album-song.   I created playlist folders with song groupings on the software and then transfered my playlist folders, well worth the effort.    The controls allow you to jump between folders in one setting and then in another setting you jump between individual songs within that folder. (Your folders will either be by Artist or playlist depending on your organization choices.)  The controls can be operated with one hand, tricky to learn but work very well. BEWARE OF SWEAT/SALTY HANDS AS CAN DAMAGE DISPLAY AS PER OTHER REVIEWS, THANKS FOR ADVICE.  POOR FEATURES 1) Ear buds - not great but already have good earphones, worth investment, for sound quality. 2) Clip - could have been better but really a non-issue, pockets work. 3) Surface can get scratched but other reviews helped avoid, THANKS, again. 4) DISPLAY + SUN = HARD TO SEE!  use hand to shade display, that works for me  E507 takes a little bit of time and effort to organize, set and learn the controls but well worth the effort, your effort or lack of effort will help to determine your view of the E507, all of these features working together create great harmony...( I know BOO HISS, just throw the eggs at next guy's review)  This is prefect for exercise and taking your music on the go.  Lives up to my expectations after all what else is expected for $100 USA without having to buy extras. And it rates pretty high on COOL scale for looks and display screen, sure beats a flat checkbook style with boring black font....

<Title>Good for old people
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To address the most talked about topics:  The software SonicStage 3.4 (which you need to download from the web the box comes with version 3.0) is easy to use and does a great job of "ripping" CDs into ATRACS3plus files which are then easy to copy to the player. Sometimes SonicStage doesn't recognize that I put a new CD into my computer's CD tray until after I exit the software and restart it. Mildly annoying.  This is my first digital music player and I didn't have any MP3 files on my computer so converting the MP3s do ATRACS3plus format wasn't an issue for me. Maybe this is player is a bad choice if you have a big collection of MP3s, but it's a good choice if all your music is on CD.  I tried to compare the 64kbps ATRACS3plus file on the player to a CD straight out of a CD player (using the same headphones) and I couldn't tell the difference. That doesn't mean there isn't a difference, it probably just means that I'm not good at discriminating how bad the 64kpbs files are--nevertheless it seems to work for me.  I estimate that this will hold about 40 CDs worth of music at 64kbps quality. And you can keep a lot more CDs worth of music on your computer hard drive and use SonicStage to swap them out--this is a relatively quick and painless process.  The display is legible outside during the day, but it looks like it will get scratched easily.  Recommended for old people like me. If you're a kid and you mostly download MP3s from the internet, you probably want something else.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own this MP3 player and it's great.  I'm unintentionally very rough on it. I have it clipped to me (it comes with a clip) 5-6 days a week during at least 50 minutes of very rigorous cardio (stairmaster & crosstrainer), 40 minutes of abs and 40 minutes of free weights.  It still looks, sounds and functions like new. I also have it on 5 days a week during 50 minute traffic trips to and from work where it's basically in my hand the whole time and I change tracks a lot.  (functions even when sweat on, doesn't melt in hand)  My brother's cat accidentally knocked it off the counter onto a brick kitchen floor from about 4 feet high... not a scratch and still works as it did when new.  (shock resistant)  And it stays in my car all day in a black gym bag that's open to sunlight all day  (heat resistent)  The track loading software is very easy... I'm as far from being technical as can be and I figured it out so anyone can. Very fast loader. (fool proof)  The 50 hr+ battery life is no joke.  Go back to my first paragraph to see how much I use this thing.  With that, I've never ran out of battery life and I rarely charge it. Also, this thing recharges at a rate of 3 hrs per minute so 17 minutes (if not less) charges the entire battery. It charges while plugged into your computer so you can load tracks or rearrange your songs while its charging. (VERY long battery life and VERY fast recharger)  I do have one complaint though but it doesn't affect functionability. The complaint is that sweat gets inside the LED case. It has absolutely no effect on the play or display, its just annoying. You'll get over this problem really fast though, it bothered me for like 10 minutes, that's it.  I've had this player since February and I've used it this way the entire time. It's totally worth buying and I guarantee you'll be very happy with it.  Sound quality is Sony/excellent.

<Content>Hardware great. Software a nighmare. Just google for "SonicStage" and you will see Sony fails to get this right.  What drove me to write this? Downloaded half a gig of Podcasts. No amount of helpfiles or Googling can let me work out how to use Podcasts via SonicStage. SS seems determined that it must be an album and to look it up online and being a PodCast it can not. In the end I gave up and the device has half the value now since it appears not to support Podcasts.

<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Believe me, I had an iaudio before but I thought the Sony HD3 was nicer looking, so I purchased it for 300 dollars.  The software was SUCH a hassle, I ended up giving it to my boyfriend and purchasing another iaudio.  In terms of software this was the worst.  I consider myself technologically savvy, but this was the worst.  It took me 3 days (with the computer on day and night) to upload 5,000 songs into the player where in my iaudio it took me less than 10 MINUTES.  And once you transfer all your music it doesn't allow you to transfer the songs to a new computer (I gave away my old - but still relatively new flat screen computer and found out I could not transfer songs from the device to my new one).  Horrible service as well.  Website very inconsistent and software crashes ALL the time.  Don't say you weren't warned.  Not worth it, no matter how sleek the player looks (and it is beautiful to watch and to hold).  There is nothing worse.  For an entire week I couldn't download sonicstage, and I was following all of the directions.  Please, stay away, far far away.  They should really be ashamed of themselves for releasing such horrible software.

<Title>Sony should be ashamed
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beautiful manufacturing, stone-age software. It looks and feels gorgeous, intuitive controls, everything you would expect from a sony, until you try to put music on it. Choose between very limited and mind-crushingly slow drag and drop functionality using "MP3 File Manager" software or lose the four or five years work that you've put into organizing your music library by using "Sonix" software. I've got a collection of over 1,500 albums. This Sony won't be playing them. I want to listen to music, not sit in front of my computer growing old waiting for this thing to download files. I'll be buying an ipod and handing over the sony to my worst enemy. Sony you should be ashamed.  UPDATE: Aug 9, 2006.  Sony should still be ashamed, but for you poor souls that actually own this thing, I recommend using google to find a piece of Sony software called Vaio Music Transfer. It's a small program that allows you to avoid the abysmal Sonix software (although you still have to install the Sonix core on your computer for this to work) and allows drag and drop addition of files at a slightly faster rate than the MP3 File Manager.  Oh, and as for my comment on getting an Ipod, scratch that. They have too many battery issues. Get yourselves an IRiver CXW-2G. You'll be a happy camper.

The overall product isn't bad, but the headphones are totally pathetic.  There is no possible way one could job long distances and expect those earbuds to stay in.  If you are planning to use this for any kind of exercise I would look elsewhere.

<Title>Great player horrible software
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Sony NW-E507 is an awesome MP3 player.  With its sleek, compact design and 50 hour battery life, the E507 is an MP3 player with a fighting chance against Apple.  Enter Sonicstage.  Sonicstage is the software that comes with the player that is sony's failure.  The software is one of the very few ways to transfer files in the ATRAC format, which is recognized by the player.  In order to use the player you must "authenticate" the player on the internet for each computer you use.  Music files from another coumpter may not be transfered if files from another computer is present.  The good news is that sony has an alternative program on their site now that removes these oppressive restrictions.  In light of this development I give this product 4 stars.  It is a solid player now.

<Title>A Competent Sony Product
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Reviews" are meant to "review" the product. It's not a place to advertise another product.   I feel there's a need to introduce myself before I review this product. The readers can then get a glimpse on what type of Digital Audio user I am, before they consider my opinion. This is the first D.A. (IE: Digital Audio) gadget I have bought. I like my gadgets to be separated (IE: Phones should only call or text, Digital Camera's should only take pictures, D.A. should only play music). I like any product that does what it says it'll do and do it for a long time. Quality over quantity. Originality is also a plus.  I bought my Sony NW-E507 at a local computer store and have had the pleasure of using it for the past week. The product came with the D.A. device, ear buds, extension to the ear buds, USB connector, small black drawstring pouch, belt clip, and software/instructions/papers and such.   I was extremely excited to open the box. The first thing I managed to pull out were the ear buds, which at first sight made me say "what the hec", and I also remember laughing. The ear buds were strangely irregular. The left ear bud is about one feet shorter than the other. I suppose it was made with the intention of your D.A. device always being on the left side of your body. I didn't care so much about the ear buds. They're always replaceable, and I didn't buy the product for the ear buds (so I saw them as a bonus, even if it does look strange). I will warn all image conscious consumers that the ear buds may compromise your look. However, if you have long hair you may be able to cover it up. I'm not a fan of ear buds in general because they hurt my ears.   The ear bud extensions came out next, and it's a little longer than one feet. It's a good extension that'll work with any headphones/ear buds. I managed to pull out the D.A. device which is the sexiest shaped gadget I have seen. It looks alien, plus it's very shiny. Recharging the Sony NW-E507 was a joy to watch, and the O-LED is extremely bright in a dim room (even brighter in a dark room).   The Sonic Stage software wasn't so difficult to deal with, at least not the way other people have described it to be. I think the problem maybe that a lot of users are not flexible (or comfortable) with using new software. I will say this, Sony products assume that a lot of their consumers are competent to some level and are capable of using different software. If you're unfamiliar with using broad ranges of software and have absolutely no patience, this may be a minor (or major) hurdle for you to cross. Once you're comfortable with using Sonic Stage it shouldn't be a problem. There are also updates on Sony's websites where they allow the "drag and drop" feature that a lot of D.A. users adore, so the Sonic Stage fiasco can be averted. The software for the Sony NW-E507 should no longer be a factor to consider when buying this product.   The device itself is very easy to control. The O-LED light in the morning is a bit washed out to see, but I still manage to see it. If you angle the device there's no doubt that the screen is readable. However, I've never tried viewing it in direct sunlight so I'm not sure what the implications of that may be. It comes with a black drawstring pouch which you can always use to shield it from the sun. Rarely do I take the device out to pick a specific song. I usually have it in the pouch hanging off my belt loop while I walk around campus.   The main reason of my purchasing the Sony NW-E507 is for the battery life. After the charge, I managed to use the device for around 15 or so hours and it only consumed one-third of the battery panel. The battery life has unbelievable stamina. Some consumers are concerned about the battery being "built in", which leads me to comment that on the bottom of the device where the port for recharging (and song loading) lies there are two screws. The battery is replaceable, though I'm not sure if you should do that on your own. It's probably best to send it in to Sony to replace if you have no clue what you're doing.   The sound quality is great, and the volume is able to reach high levels. Since the Sony NW-E507 is a flash based D.A. device, your songs will never skip because there are no moving parts. I tested this out by shaking the device to an extreme degree, and it didn't skip a beat. I find myself listening to the fm radio ALOT. The radio does become a bit fuzzy at certain spots and I'm not sure if jogging or running may cause it to be fuzzier.  The surface of the device does seem to scratch rather easily. After a weeks use of mainly having it in the carrying pouch, I've managed to find very light surface scratches (nothing deep). I'm also afraid to touch the device with oily or greasy hands. If there was one thing I could ask to improve on the next model of the Sony NW-E507 it would be a more resistant surface.   I've heard that some devices can still play music while they load, but since this is my first D.A. gadget I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or a good thing. I only load music from my own computer, and while I'm loading music into the Sony NW-E507 I can always listen to the same songs on my computer. It may be a problem if you're using a different computer that does not have your music collection? There are still ways to go around that if you try. It's not something that I would consider to be a problem.   All in all I really love this product. It's something that will last for years (if you take good care of it). I enjoy and appreciate its company. It does what it says it'll do (play music) and it does it well and it does it long (battery life). While I walk through a campus located in the middle of a city, I could not thank Sony enough for creating a device that manages to drown out the annoying cell phone users whose conversations can be heard a mile away. Sony, you are my hero.

<Title>Great buy - software problems resolved
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first saw this product, online at the (...) website, I was impressed by its compact, sleek design - especially that the screen cannot be seen unless it is displaying the track - and many features. As well as an mp3 player and FM radio, it can be used as a memory stick. The device fulfilled my expectations fairly well. The controls may not be intuitive at first, but after using the device for a few minutes I was able to get the hang of them. Using the NW-E507 as a memory stick is slightly inconvienient because of the long USB cable, but that's not its main function anyway. I am very happy with the device.  However, as many people have mentioned, you must use the Sony SonicStage program to transfer files to it. The SonicStage program is not the best program, but I have seen worse. My main beef with it is that it tries to do too much; if all it was was a utility to transfer songs, I would be fine with it. But no: it's a big program that takes a few seconds to start up and doesn't always do what I want it to do. Also, when I made a playlist to put onto my NW-E507 and transferred it, it transferred all the songs along with it, all of which were already on the player. Most likely, I was just doing something wrong, though. I don't mind the software too much. I'm just glad I don't have to play my music with it. The other slightly annoying factor is the long USB cord that comes with the player. I always have to have it coiled up on my desk when transferring songs. I suppose I could go out and buy another one, but I'm too lazy. Anyway, I am overemphasizing the things that annoy me a little, and not writing about the good stuff. It has great sound quality (no thanks to the Sony earphones), and once I get the songs on it, they are easy to find, and they will stay well-organized if I make them that way on SonicStage - not the easiest thing to do. I have just downloaded an update that I hope will allow me to transfer music directly to the NW-E507, and ... AHA! Yes, it does! So never mind all you people worried about the software. You still need to use it to change the names and stuff, but I hope the "MP3 File Manager" makes my life a little easier. (...)  Anyway, so far I have a very good impression of it. Though it may not hold as much as an Ipod, I would much rather have the NW-E507 than an Ipod.

<Content>I've enjoyed Sony Walkman players in the past, and let me tell you, this new invention is a piece of art! Unique in design, it offers everything that's needed to enjoy the music on the run! I was thinking about buying iPod Nano 1GB, which runs close to $200 if you buy it with power supply... much more if you want any kinds of accessories with it, like FM Tuner (which Sony has already built-in).   I decided to settle on Sony, which is much more affordable, and I am happy that I've made a right decision.  Since I've worked with Sonic Stage before, I know it's a bit of a weakness, in an overall perfect performance of this Sony player. As in previous reviews, I went ahead, and used the advice to download mp3 file manager which is available on Sony website.  Let me tell you... you can bypass Sonic Stage and just directly download songs from your computer to the player in original mp3 format.   I am sure the capacity diminishes due to the size of mp3, but if you want to quickly load some songs that you'll listen to on the road or in the gym, you don't have to worry about converting them to ATRAC3 format. Just directly drag and drop songs in Mp3 File Manager.  Very, very simple!  All and all, I am VERY impressed with this player!

<Content>This is the greatest mp3 player i have used so far. By far, sony and it's atrac3 is what boosts this over any other player. The only downside it a 1gb model being its largest player of this kind. Fortunately since you can use atrac3 plus, at 48kbps(no noticable change in audio) you can fit around 2.65 gb of audio. Amazing battery life, and great firmware. Feels strong and has perfect volume levels, very low to extrememly high. the oled screen is very bright in most situations. For the price and the ability to use atrac3 format, along with the look and feel: this is the best player i see to buy. Remember, when connecting the player for the first time: DON'T CLICK YES, OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE DOWNLOADED SONGS WEATHER OR NOT YOU PAID FOR THEM FROM A SERVICE. Sorry, but some people have been ranting that there is no way to get there music on. After you click no, any and all of your music will go on nicely.

THE BEST PART IS ITS SOUND QUALITY AND BATTERY LIFE.  Both sound and battery life are just awesome. few of my friends own ipod nano and their battery drain off in just 6 to 7 hours, but this little thing goes on forever(upto 40 to 45 hours). FM tuner is good, though I dont use it regularly. Display is cute, can download few more screen savers along with new firmware.  All in all its awesome product. One more great product from SONY.

<Title>Excellent mp3 player but bad earbuds
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One needs to separate three parts. First, mp3 player itself. Second, software to load the player and third, the headset.  The mp3 player is certainly very good. It is slightly larger than a ligher and can be used with just one hand. The menue is not completely intuitive that means you will need to take a look into the manual. For example, there is a function that automatically installes 30 local radio stations which is very convenient that can hardly be found be exploring the menue because it is somewhat hidden. Overall, good to navigate if you know how. The design is great but the display hard to read if the sun is shining.  The software is the first downside of the player, because you can not drag and drop the files but need to use the sony software. This is a bit anoying because one could desing it that it would work also with out, like the Rio player I used to use. However, the software is easy to use. I suggest not to import all mp3's automatically and authorize some other checks. I select always the file/files and import them. Works without problems. Then select all files and transfer them to the player. This way you can load all music files without problems. I remove one start because the transfer and the importing is slower than drag-and-drop and hence, more unconvenient.  There is only one readly bad thing about the whole package and that is the headset. The problem is not the sound which is at least ok I would even say good but the size of the buds. If this size fits good you are fine, if not you need to buy a new one. This problem could easily fixed by providing 2 or 3 sizes of foams one can move over the bud (what is normal if you buy some). I remove one star for this because I assume sony wants you to buy a new headset which costs additionally your money. It is unlikely that you will return the player only because the headset does not work for you.   Maybe one of the best features is that you charge the player via usb connection to your computer. That means, you do not need to do it intentinally but loading the player with music simulanetiously charges the battery. If you do it regularily you never run out of energy. Moreover, the energy management is great. I am not absolutely sure how many hours you can listen without charging but much longer than any player I had before.

<Title>Terrible Software and  Support 
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is brilliantly and gracefully designed. It's like holding art in your hand, the battery life last for long periods of time. I loved using the player until I could no longer bear the clumsy, time consuming, not user friendly software. The software that the player has is absolutely deplorable. I had to reload my operating system because of problems using other software after installing Sonic Stage. With one false click you were forced on to their music downloading web-site which I never wanted to use. It took forever to download my programs and I knew from using other players the time can be much faster. Now it sits pretty in a box while I use my iriver.

<Title>Player is great.
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for its looks, size and battery life. As mentioned in all the other reviews, player is great, but the sonicstage software is hard to work with. It didn't have to be this complicated, but for some reason it is. They also have MP3 file manager software to drag and drop the songs onto the player. Remember its only one way, you can't move the files away from the player. you can delete them, but can't move them away. And on the player, all the files are stored in OMG format and not mp3 or wma or whatever you originally had.  So, it all depends on your needs. If you don't care about using this as a zip drive and use it just as a player and fm tuner, then this may work for you.  if iAudio U2 had this battery life, then that would've been my first choice.  All in all, So far I like the player.

<Title>Software stinks!!!

<Content>This was my first mp3 player and if they are all this much hassel, it will be my last. First of all the software and support stink.  I kept having error messages with the software and had a tremendously hard time getting it to work with little help from the support. The Player itself is pretty, and the controls are easy to use, but the darn thing keeps locking up. Take my advice and save your money, you are just throwing down the toilet if you buy this thing.

<Title>I love my new "mp3" player
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, I have not tried to upload any mp3 files from my computer or download any mp3 files from Sony's website.  I have been downloading files from my CDs to the player.  Everything has worked without a hitch.  However, you must first "import" the songs from your CD in the software.  Naturally, the longer the song, the longer the wait.  Then, you can "transfer" the files to the player.  This doesn't take very long.  The files are not in "mp3" format.  The are in Sony's ATRAC format which to my knowledge can't be used on other devices.  However, you can choose the bit rate at which you "transfer" the files.  Higher bit rates take up more space, but yield better sound quality.  They say you can get up to 695 songs on a 1 GB player with each song averaging four minutes.  Most songs are longer than that.  I got around 500 songs when I was using the 66 Hz bit rate transfer.  The ear buds, however, are painfully lousy.  Plan on spending some change to upgrade.  I are very happy with the controls.  They do take awhile to figure out, but after that they seem to work fine.  The FM tuner is a plus (something which IPODs don't have).

<Title>Love it but...
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with all other posters that while the player is beautiful and lives up to it's battery life, the Sonic Stage program is annoying. If you want to transfer files from the player back onto your computer, you have to first delete the files from your computer and then you can transfer the files on the player back to the computer. Not to mention this limits the use of the player to your computer only.   Also, this players USB 2.0 cord is unique to itself. So if you lose this cord, or pick up the wrong one on the way to work to use with your AC Adapter, you're screwed. That annoyed me since its what happened to me!   But all in all, I like this player. It got through my work week of 46 hours with battery left over. But be aware, using the FM radio cuts the battery life from 50 hours to 22. I think that's a bit extreme myself. This players flaws probably won't stop me from using Sony products, but there are players out there with more diverse abilities. Happy Hunting!  P.S. The no moving parts concept is wonderful!

<Content>I bought it 3 months ago and I find it really great. Long battery life (I have Ipods, and sony is really better on this), simple to use, good sound. There are only few drawbacks: with the sun could be difficult to read the screen, the management of the radio is a little annoying and if you download many CDs it takes time to browse. But they are all unimportant stuff. If you want a small and comforable player, this is your choice.

<Title>If you like things simple ...DO NOT use SonicStage!!
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are like me and like things as simple as possible, do not install the enclosed CD, do not use SonicStage software, by far one of the most unfriendly players I have seen. You may fit up to 650 or so atrac3 files in this player, but you have to go through all the hassle of converting your mp3 files and once in the player they are copy protected meaning you can't do any further copying plus the quality isn't as good as that of 160kbps or 192kbps mp3 files...the solution: the most simple there is:  go to the Sony asia pacific website at:   http://www.css.ap.sony.com/consumer/template/DDSummary.aspx?Id=44358&Category=Personal+Audio  to download the NW505/507 driver (do this step first) and MP3 File Manger software which installs right on your player in seconds. Then is just a drag'n'drop game from iTunes player with no hassles whatsoever. The downside: you'll only be able to fit 80-100 songs in a 512Mb player or 160-200 songs in a 1Gb player, but if you are like me that keeps a music library in iTunes in my home PC and just uses this portable MP3 for trendy music this shouldn't be an issue and the sound quality is unbelievable!  One more tip - Plan to spend $15 more on headphones (Sony's MDR-E827G are the best) as the headphones included with the player are useless.

<Title>Software difficult to use
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player itself is relatively nice, although considering how similar these flash players are, it's way on the expensive side.  The real problem is how restrictive and difficult to use the software is.  It's slow and is always nagging you to convert from one format to another.  You can't move your music back and forth from the device easily.  There are lots of media players out there and this is close to the worst.  For that reason I would look for a player that doesn't use this Sony software.

<Title>seems to be a GOOD BUY!
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Althogh i havent recieve my NW-E507 i have done multiple hourse of research on ipods and mp3 players. Ipods look great when u buy them but ive seen kids who take care of them and theyre still scrathced up also 14 hours of battery life...definitly not enough. The Nw-E507 has 50 hourse on a full charge not other portable audio player can match that ! Now i have read many comments on this device at many different online stores and ive noticed either great comments or bad comments not just good ones. While many people say that the software is difficult to use and converting files to the required format is a pain i dissagree ive been usisng sonic stage with a different sony purhchase and have not noticed that problem...by the way if it werent for converting the files the sony 1gb wouldnt be able to hold 695 songs! why do you think the apple ipod mini 2gb only hold 500 songs. Ive also read comments complaining about EARBUDS which in some seemed to be there only not-likes of the machine...i meen come on get real none of the supplied earbuds of the portable audio players are top grade! So to rate the NW-E507 a 1 or 2 because of those reasons is absurd ! ive also noticed that not many people have complaints pertaining to the player itslef not the software or earbuds ! well i hope this comment was of help to u... im sorry if i seemed like a b**** but thats the way it goes....

<Title>Nice... could use some improvements
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player several months ago and am very happy with it.   Pros: Small (think bic lighter), nice display, fm tuner, great battery life, fast charge time, easy to use with one hand while working out.  Cons: Software isn't that great, can download an MP3 program from sony to put on player allowing drag and drop, but this only works for .mp3 not .wma.  The silvery substance in the player giving it its look has cracked in a star pattern. Ear buds uncomfortable.  Overall I would buy this again if I had to do it over again, I like the fact that I don't have to change out a battery and that it last forever.  I like that it is small and I can take it cycling, jogging and to the gym and it won't be a nuisance.

<Title>An i-shuffle with a display and a super-long battery life.
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[Update on Dec 14: Positive- FM tuner is sweet. You can preset 30 stations. Negatives- The screen is worthless in direct sunlight and the shuffle turns off when you manually select a song from the track list. If you are hard of hearing, this player may not be for you, since the max volume is not as loud as my last flash player (a AA-battery powered i-river). To be sure, I have never had to max out the volume. Still worth noting. With these caveats I would drop my rating to a four and one-half stars, but that is not an option, and five stars is closer to the mark than four stars in my opinion. I don't even use my 5gb hard-drive based h10 anymore.]  Original review: My girlfriend got the 512mb version for using at the gym and I was very impressed with it. After getting her feedback and fiddling with it myself, I decided that I wanted the 1gb version. The price tag was a bit of an issue for me but I found a good deal on a refurb and sprung for it.  I am thrilled with this purchase. Some background: my first mp3 player was iriver's first 128mb flash player. Loved that thing, but obviously storage capacity became an issue. I have since gone through an I-pod (the first pc version) and iriver's h10 player (untimely purchase since the nano came out shortly after I bought that thing!). The workhorse of a flash player (the 128mb) finally died on me (well, not really, but I need rubber bands to hold the battery in), and I've been searching for a replacement for cycling/sports/working out ever since. I have loved the design of the ipod shuffle (thin/sturdy/rechargeable battery -- rare with the smallest flash players) since it came out but never bought it because it annoyed me that you were just stuck with shuffle and no display.  Well the nw-e507 provided the answer. It has a superlong battery life that charges lightning fast. It only takes 2 or 3 minutes to charge it enough to last a few hours!!! This is a great feature when I realize I forgot to charge it right before heading out. (Fully charged it lasts a LONG time. I haven't counted but I'd say 30 hours at least.)   The sound is great (the headphones it comes with are not -- I'm using the ones that came with my original iriver). But it helps to fiddle with the bass and the treble, because the out-of-the-box settings are sort of dull. The controls are well thought out and simple to use. The player is light and feels real sturdy (though I fear that the clip it comes with won't last being attached and removed over and over again).  Then there is the maligned software. I didn't bother installing it after reading the reviews, but my girlfriend already had it installed. I've tried it out, and quite frankly, I'm not sure what the fuss is about. It seems pretty intuitive. It works well with playlists etc. Granted, it hasn't asked me to convert anything -- that seems to be a big complaint people have. I also imagine that if one is used to i-tunes or some other software it may be annoying to have to use sonicstage. But as is well documented among these reviews, the solution is quite simple --> there are available downloads that allow you to drag files from i-tunes right on to the player. (And though that gives you "reduced storage capacity," in fact, you are getting the same capacity as you would putting mp3's on any other 1gb player.)  Bottom line: if small size, light weight, good sound, simplicity (but not at the total expense of functionality -- see the i-shuffle), and a LONG battery life are virtues for you, then you might want to consider this sleek player.

<Title>Great gizmo that I was able to upload 657 songs on it
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wrote another review defending the software but now that I have the product I wanted to write a full review.  I bought the SOny 1g netman because of it's promise that it could hold 695 songs on it.    Most normal 1gig MP3 players hold about 250 songs on it, I would need to get an Ipod 4gig in order to have the same capcity and that would have been an extra $50 dollars.  First, the fine print on the 695 songs is that you use Sony Altrac3 technology at 48bit rate and this is based on 4minute song average.  The song quality is suppose to be the lowest but I haven't been able to tell.  BUt the SonicStage software has the ability to convert your music to Altrac3 (you'll have to delete out the old MP3 though) and uploading your CDs to Altrac3.  It took a weekend to do this but in the end I was able to get 657 songs loaded on my Sony 1gig Netman (I'm a fan of some classic/progressive rock groups that tend to have songs that go 10min+).  The software SonicStage was easy enough to use but the 'authentication' process was a little irritating.  Connect.com is the music download program and has a good selection of music but was disappointed when I had to go to Napster to find some more independant groups not found on Connect.  But I was able to easily import the music into Connect and convert to the Altrac3.  The headset is kinda funky but sound quality was good.  The display is brilliant until you hit sunshine then it's practically useless.  The functionality of the buttons are easy to use except that button on the back to change to shuffle mode - difficult to manuever.  My Nephew bought an Ipod (4gig) and actually saw my gizmo and liked it better especially with the amount of music it could hold.    I rate the product a 4 star only because of a few bugs (authentication, display and shuffle button) but overall I would recommend this product to anyone as long as they know that the 695 songs promised is only if you make sure you convert everything to their technology

<Title>Great!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros :  1. Long battery life up to 50 hours!!! 2. Small and light enough to carry 3. Easy to control with shuttle switch 4. Fancy design 5. AVS function which cares for your hearing ability  Cons : 1. No voice recording function 2. Clumsy detachable clip 3. A little bit expensive  What's your priority when you choose this kinda cool gadgets? The most important priority for me was battery life. NW-E507 lasts at least twice longer than existing MP3 players, which means you don't have to worry about the battery life when you listen to music. Assuming to play 4 hours a day, you don't need to recharge this for TWO weeks!!! I use NW-E507 without taking it out from my pocket because the shuttle is really easy to control. One thing that many people mentioned in previous reviews is that the inconvenience of provided software. I don't quite understand why they are saying that... It's not that complicated to use SonicStage. Once you install it, you can transfer mp3 files from your computer to NW-E507 with ease. On top of that you can shrink the size of the original mp3 files so that you can store more songs than other MP3 players with limited memory. Also, there is no problem with recognizing foreign language(such as Korean) if it's supported on NW-E507. I guess the tip for installing Sonicstage is setting the area the same as the language you want to be displayed on NW-E507. One annoying thing is the repeat button on the back of the gadget. The button is too small and hard to press when the detatchable clip is attached. I hope SONY improves this later for the forthcoming models. Overall, this is really a great player and I think this is worth $150. I hope this helps~

But, I was totally disappointed while transfering music using the sonicstage software management program that sony ships with the walkman. YOu need to be a software programmer to understand what is going on. It does not automatically transfer songs within a play-list. I had to do a lot of manual data entry. And just after I purchased the product, I called in for support and I was told that I need to download a later version of sonicstage off their website. It is a pain.

<Title>Pretty good little MP3 player
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Ipod Mini but it does not have a radio and it costs a fortune to replace the battery.  The battery on my ipod lasts about 6 hours so I can't ski all day with it.  The Sony lasts 50 hours so I can go days without recharging it.  I purchased the Sony NW-E507 because of it's size, the FM radio, and long battery life.  As another reviewer put it, you can't beat Sony for the hardwear.  It feels sturdier than the Ipods.   As for the infamous Sony softwear, I took the advice of another Amazon reviewer and downloaded a program on the Sony's Asian web site that allows for mp3 files to be dragged and dropped.  http://www.css.ap.sony.com/consumer/template/DDSummary.aspx?Id=44358&Category=Personal+Audio   The programs is a very simple; just drag and drop a mp3 file onto the program.  You do need some computer savvy. For example to make individual groups or playlists, you have to create a file with at least one mp3 file in it and drag it over to the file manager.  But the bottome line is that it works.  The drawback is it takes a while to load 280 songs (the number I was able to load on my player). I have not even bothered to load the softwear that came in the box.  The player itself is built very solidly.  Outside of the ipods, these are the only mp3 player that look good.  The controls are not as intuitive as an Ipod. Sound is good. Comes with a cheap plastic clip for your belt. I clipped mine onto an old elastic arm band from my broken Rio mp3 player and it works well. My version came with headphones with a short cord and an extension cord.  The short cord is handy when using an arm band and working out at the gym.  It did not have a separate recharger ( you can buy one at the Sony.com site). The player is charged when hooked to the computer via a USB port. This is bad if you don't take a computer with you on a long trip.  Overall happy with the purchase. Sony would do better if they capitulated to using the mp3 format.  Could also be better if it provided a recharger that didn't need a USB port, a better clip, and an arm band to use in the gym.

As soon as I plugged the player into the computer it was ready to go.  There is a drag-and-drop program so you don't have to deal with Sonic Stage.  I tried using Sonic Stage and I didn't have a problem with it at all.  None of my music had to be converted to be put on the player like some people complain about.  The sound quality is great! The volume is quite loud, I keep it at half of the maximum volume.  The earbuds that come with it suck, but I already figured that and used ones that I liked.  I wish you were allowed to put songs back onto your computer from the player.  The buttons for the search and display are tiny.  Overall this player is great and I'm very glad that I got it.

<Title>Far too cumbersome to transfer music
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that just about all the gadgets I own are made by Sony - Digial Camera, Digital Video Camera, Monitor, TVs, DVD players, etc...  I.e. I LOVE Sony products.  My love affair hit a pot hole with this device.  I received this MP3 player for a Christmas Gift, just in time for a couple long car rides.  Thinking this was a lot like my wife's SanDisk, I rushed down stairs, plugged in the USB cable and started copying over a bunch of MP3s.  After 5-10 minutes (USB 1.1 ... not 2.0) I was all done. I unplugged the player and tried to listen to the music - nope.  Surfing through the well designed interface, all I could find was a message saying "No Data".  After reading the instructions (doh!) I spent the next hour and a half installing Sony's software, scanning directories for music, organizing play lists (I already have my music organized in folders, not to mention Media Player) and transferring files.  In the end, I left the device on my desk and listened to FM radio (ugh).  I'm taking this back to the store.  I'll be buying the SanDisk Sansa 2GB - It may be ugly, but at least I can transfer music FAST.

<Title>Good sound, great style.
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got this player for Christmas and i'm happier than I thought I would be with it. The sound quality is excelent, although the ear buds it comes with are a bit awkward, and they fall out too easy. The display is really bright, and it looks amazing. The FM tuner is a nice plus. It's pretty simple to navigate too, for only having 3 lines of display. The dial at the end that you use to switch tracks and navigate is a bit loose after a while, but it's not a problem when you have it on hold as much as I do. The battery life is amazing. I had it on for an 8 hour car ride, overnight, and alot during the day, but it hadn't even gone halfway down, and it charged in 15 minutes.  The software it comes with is where most people get stuck up, but I wasn't upset with it at all. It's a tiny bit slow to transfer songs onto, but easily done. It's easy to manage. I'd deffinetly suggest you don't sign up for any of their stuff or register your player, I didn't and it runs fine. Plus you don't get any e-mails or hassle.   The bottom line, great sound, battery life, and style. Easy to use as long as you're not impatiant or...dumb, haha.

<Title>Very Satisfied
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being that I am new to MP3 players and haven't set up an entire library using WMA format it is probably a little easier for me to be pleased with this player. Like so many others I spent several weeks looking over all the MP3 players and actually going to the stores and picking them up and looking at them before making a decision on one. Part of my decision came from price and size. I really didn't need anything over 1GB and I really was holding myself to around $150 or less. I am somewhat partial to Sony for most of my electronics have been from Sony and I am pleased with all of them. Here is what led me to the purchase of the NW-E507 listed in order of importance to me:  Pros:  (1) Price $149 (2) The feel - It feels like a piece of electronics. It has a quality feel to it that you really can't grasp in the pictures. You have to hold it. It doesn't have the feel of plastic like so many others. (3) The Look - It has been described as looking like a cigarette lighter and maybe it does, but it looks classy especially with the OED display which in normal lighting you will have no problem seeing it. (4) The Sound - The sound is pretty good with the supplied earphones, but the sound is fantastic with better headphones. I am using the The Phillips Surround Sound "earbuds" which are very comfortable. (5) 1GB Storage - Which can be used for music and/or data. Sony clames that you can load up to 695 songs, which I believe is when you use their ATRAC3 format. (6) FM Player - This was a must for me. I have had this for over a week and the FM was easy to set up and the reception is great for such a small player. (7) Battery Life - Sony claims 50 hours. Haven't had it that long, but the several hours I have played it, hasn't made a dent in the batter life.  Con:  The only problem that has been mentioned several times was the OED display. It is hard to see when outside in direct sunlight, but the only time I really use it outside is on walks which I set up before going out and don't have a need to look at it again while walking.   Summary: Overall I love this player. The software (which has been the major gripe to many reviewers) was no problem at all. Very easy to navigate and keep up with my library on it. Also, if you have Version 1.0 on your player you can upgrade it now to 2.0 at "http://esupport.sony.com/perl/model-swu.pl?mdl=NWE507" , which adds another clock display and a couple more "cutsie" displays for your player. They also have Version 3.3 for SonicStage software at this same location. Downloaded both of them and no trouble installing them. One more application you can also download is the MP3 File Manager Application which lets you transfer MP3 files to the player without converting them to the ATRAC format. It is my understanding that you won't be able to get as many songs on it in WMA format, but if your songs are already in that format it might be beneficial to you. As you can tell I am very satisfied with this player.  Update: Downloaded Sony's MP3 File Manager from the above site and had NO problem moving my MP3 files over to the player. I now have numerous albums in ATRAC format and an album in MP3 file. All play perfectly and can move the MP3 files in and out without any problem and the player recognizes them. Still love everything about this player. Totally satisfied.

<Title>Nice Little Player
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got this mp3 player for my wife to use when she is working out at the gym!  I have to say that I am impressed with the sound.  The FM radio really locks on to a station and has no problem with fading, like other small FM radio's do.  I do not really care for the software for uploading the songs to the player (my Creative Labs mp3 is much easier), but the quality of the player overcomes this flaw!  I have to say, I loaded a few songs at 48kbps and I am fairly impressed with the sound reproduction at such a low quality.  It is most definitely not hi fidelity, but being able to load 2.5 times the music than that of 128kbps it sounds very nice!  I know that some do not like the ear bud headphones, but that just comes down to weather or not you like ear buds.  Some people can wear them and some can not.  I do not mind them myself.  I do like the fact the Sony put a short cord on the ear buds so that you can clip it on your arm and not have a wire hanging and an extension so that you can extend the cord so that you can clip it on your waist.  I just wish that they included an armband!

<Title>A solid little gadget!
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered the Sony NW-E507 from Amazon and I must say that I'm impressed.  I've always liked Sony quality and this player met my expectations.  Construction:  Light, but very solid.  The dial is pretty easy to control with one hand.  Some of the smaller buttons need a push with a fingernail sometimes.  Display:  The display is fascinating to look at.  Not easy to read in bright light, but can still be seen.  Battery:  Charges very quickly through your USB port.  Comes with a cable.  My notebook doesn't have to be turned on for the player to charge.  Battery life is as good as Sony claims.  Sound:  You can control bass and treble.  Volume ranges from 0 to 31.  My is usually set around 20 to 22 and I like my music fairly loud.  Software:  There's no problem with this software really.  It's easy to use.  You can import your existing MP3s with no problem at all.  It took about 20 minutes to upload 200 of my MP3s to the player.  I went ahead and downloaded the most updated version (3.3 as of now) from connect.com (Sony's music site) while I waited for delivery from Amazon.  Version 3.0 came on a CD with the player, so I didn't have to load anything since I already had version 3.3 on my notebook.  In all, a very good MP3 player from Sony.  Solid construction, good sound quality, and easy to use.

<Title>regret buying
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the E507 because of the size and the design.  I knew Sony was restrictive about what you can and cannot put on the device, but I thought I could live with it.  As it turns out, the DRM software is more of a pain in the neck than I expected.  I wish I had purchased a more user friendly player that doesn't assume you are a criminal.  The software is slow and it wastes a lot of my time to move podcasts into the memory.  Each podcast or MP3 has to be converted into a proprietary format before it can be stored on the device for playing.  I recommend avoiding this one.

<Title>Sony NW-E505 Nearly There
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review of the Sony NW-E505-507 will provide, I hope, the strengths and weaknesses of this MP3 player. Let's start with strengths: 1. Well built feels solid with its metal back and thick plastic components. 2. Small size makes it handy to carry around in your hand or pocket. 3. OLED display (only one color) is bright for indoor and full shadow areas. 4. Battery longevity is a big plus; playing MP3s the battery should last 30+ hours. Battery charges quite quickly (I guess it's because it used up very little power prior to charging). Battery is charged through the USB port of the PC. You can order an alternate charger to charge without the use of the PC, but connecting the the PC to add or delete files should be enough charge time. 5. This is a big plus for me: The play and stop button allows the unit to power off within 15 seconds but when starting the unit  the program will resume where you left off immediately. No waiting for the unit to startup. It's almost like having a perpetual pause button. 6. Sound quality is quite good (included earbuds are weak). Though, I miss a full range of equalizers this unit almost doesn't need one. You can adjust the two equalizer options but the adjustment has only +-3 settings. 7. Internal clock and/or lap meter display is handy when you don't wear a watch.  Weaknesses of this unit: 1. Because the unit requires very little power it is quite sensitive to electrical static. It's not a good idea to carry coins in the same pocket with the unit. 2. Display washes out in sunny areas even in the mildly shadowed areas. 3. Propriety Sonic Stage or MP3 Manager software is required to add MP3s to unit. The MP3s must have at least 32 bits with 44100 sample rate. A mono MP3 file with lets say 128 bits and 22100 rate will not play in the unit. SonicStage has its own compression audio scheme (ATRAC3) but it requires the original audio file to have at least 32 bits with a 44100 sample rate to convert it. You will have to find an audio file converter to pump it up to 44100 prior to downloading or converting. SonicStage will not allow transferring of MP3 or ATRAC3 files to other PCs. 4. The MP3 Manager Version 2.0 software is very rudimentary. It will add and delete files to the player but not much more. It must reside inside the player.  5. Repeat functions are very limited. It will switch itself off after the last file has played within the folder or unit.  In conclusion: I would have given the NW-E505 an almost perfect rating but requiring propriety software, an unreasonable bit rate requirement makes it hard to play audio books that may be saved in 24 bit 22100 rate settings. The display is useless in bright situations. I believe Sony has dropped the ball by not allowing easy transfer of MP3 files to and from the player and other PCs.  I would advise to update the firmware to Version 2.0 on the unit. This will provide another clock option with is much easier to read and allow you to add other wallpapers to the display if you choose to.

<Title>Sonic Stage is better than people are saying.
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, Sony requires Sonic Stage. Yes, I was mad at first (like most other reviewers) but I gave it a fair try and now I like it a lot better than what I was using before. Sonic Stage does make you disable your previous format but it takes at most 5 minutes and you can change it back to your old format at any time.  Also, while it is a hassle to burn cd's to Sonic Stage, you can easily get around it.  I rip them through a different program, then once they're in my library, I transfer them to Sonic Stage, very easy to do.  Sound quality, durability and battery life (and charging time) is off the chart... definitely worth it!!!

<Title>Software nightmares!
<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do Not Buy This! unless you are dying to balance ripped cds, with new cds to rip, and downloaded music on the same Sony software, it flat out sucks. I spend no less than an hour trying to put songs on it, and SonicStage is so bad. I wish I could just use Windows Media Player, but even after the file conversion software upgrade, I'm still looking to sell this and buy something different. looks are great, which is what prompted me to buy this, but it's function over fashion dear! Another example of Sony over-engineering and over-designing something simple.

<Content>I've got an Ipod 3g, but I was tired to go out with a big divice on the streets, subway and when I practice running, so one day my friend borrowed me this digital walkman and I felt in love with it!!! The only problem for me, is the waiting time to transform the mp3 files to atrack format, but if you are patient you'll get the best. SONY INC, please try to follow the audio formats that the most people wants.  I love my new toy.

<Title>Software Killed the Deal
<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wish I had read some of the reviews before I bought this Sony product. For the record I am a big Sony fan. My TV (Sony Vega) and all of my surround speakers are Sony. My amp is Sony. My DVD player is Sony, etc.. So I thought that I would be safe if I bought this Sony device. Wow, was I wrong. I could only get the FM functionality to work, that's it! The software was very complicated and as others have stated, as the sony software assumes you are a song pirate and forces you to validate the songs you already have on your computer.. After 3 hours of trying to get my MP3's from my IBM laptop to me Sony Network Walkman I gave up. I am returning this tomorrow.

<Title>great player if you don't mind waiting for TERRIBLE software
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All of the other reviews that complain about sofware problems are right! As a sony fan I took a gamble with this player and lost. On the surface they seem to have gotten it right: small, long battery life, good user interface, reasonably price, sony quality, etc.  BUT, What good are these features if the sofware takes 2 minutes per album to upload? What is wrong with these people? The genious that designed this software should not only be fired from Sony, but blacklisted from the industry. This player is going back to the store... and I am afraid that it might be i-Pod nano time (something I have resisted)

<Title>Great player! All you have to do is read!
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I almost did not buy this player based on the product reviews, but I decided to give it a chance anyway because its Sony. All of the complaints that I read about this product said that the sonic stage software is impossible to load songs onto the player because sony assumes that you are a music pirate. All you have to do when installing the software is read, it asks you if you want your music validated, JUST SAY NO! I think the sonic stage software is better than crappy itunes, it easier to use it does everything for you automatically once you tell it how you want it to convert your files. This is a great player I am replacing my Nano with this, I prefer the music quality its nice to actually hear some bass and it looks really nice. All you have to do is read while your installing.

<Title>Are you reviewers for real?
<Date>Sat Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[...]  I know absolutely nothing about computers or MP3s (or different download types... whatever) yet I had absolutely no problem transfering my MP3s from my computer to this Sony MP3 player.  The first thing Sonic Stage asks you is if you want it to search your entire computer for MP3 tracks & if you want them put into SonicStage so that you can transfer them to your MP3 player. If you select yes, it puts them in SS (which, by the way, you can sort them however you want very easily) & you can pick & choose which tracks you want in your player. Delete the ones you don't want (deleting in Sonic Stage gives you the option of deleting them completely from your computer or deleting them just from SonicStage).  Like I said, I know nothing about computers. I can't even make a playable MP3 CD yet... LOL!... yet, it took me not even an hour to fill up my Sony MP3 to the max.  Don't listen, it's not hard.

<Title>Nice Walkman...Authorization on Sonic Stage?
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this NW-E507 few days ago and find this walkman really nice (and I got coupon for 5 mp3--free). It's Sony, no doubt about the audio quality. The FM works even here in Asia (I bought it in U.S).  It's unique since the headphones cable only around 40 cm long, and I think it's designed to be clipped, it's small though. About SonicStage, Whenever you fail to transfer any mp3, I simply recommend you to closed the application, open it and try to transfer again and this time change the option ("yes" or "no") whenever the authorization message box appears. It works in my laptop. I found the software (Sonicstage) simple and automatically recognizes my mp3 collections...even it were created in other software. I give it 5 starts for its simplicity, unique style, fresh electroluminescent display, and 50 hours battery life...I proved it (during my long flight from U.S to here).
