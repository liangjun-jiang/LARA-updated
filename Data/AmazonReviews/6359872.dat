<Title>Little boombox with lots of surprises.  Hit the beaches with one of these.
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Coby MP-C341 boom box is the real deal.  For the price, you really can't go wrong with this product.  I can't think of a better companion to hit the beaches with this summer.  It is not only a boombox but also an alarm clock, an FM radio, external speakers for your iPod, and a direct-to-mp3 recording device.  Try getting that from other manufacturers.  Let alone for the price of $100 or less.  On the outside, it looks like a white gigantic capsule.  Something a giant would swallow when he has a headache.  Four speakers are embedded in front for pumping out your favorite tunes.  There is a 4-line orange-yellow display right in the front center; just adequate enough to display its current mode.  The slots and connectors are at the back for additional SD card, USB cable, AUX in and earphones.   You don't even need to buy the cables, they come with unit.  The only thing you need to shell out your money for is an extra SD card.  The boombox supports two digital audio formats:  WMA and MP3 up to 256 Kpbs.  As expected, it does not support DRM, so you can't play any of encrypted WMA song files.  The sound quality is what you'd expect out of a low-to-mid end speaker.  But still, pretty good.  The 256MB internal memory is hardly enough storage.  So I suggest buying an additional SD card for this little baby.  What if you already have loads of your music on your iPod already?  Well, no fear.  Use this boombox as your external speakers.  Just connect the provided audio cable from your iPod to the AUX-in jack and you're rockin'.  OK, I saved the best for last.  If you're still not impressed with this device, at least get it for its direct-to-mp3 capability.  Still have a 45's collection?  Convert those into mp3 using this device.  Connect the boombox to the audio source and hit the "Record" button.  it cannot be simpler than that.  In addition, you can also record off the built-in radio or internal microphone.  Why am I not giving it 5 stars?  Well, two minor things:  the build quality and that 4-line display (hardly enough to get any detailed information).  Want more information?  You can contact me at [...] and I'll be happy to share my experience on this device with you.

<Title>Great bang-for-the-buck buy
<Date>Tue Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading the above review from the gadgetaholic, I decided to give this little bugger a try, based on his mention of the record-from-aux feature. I, too, have a record/tape collection I'm dying to make home grown cds from. I'll admit, at first it took some trial and error runs, but at my age (crusty, and might I add this is my first player of this sort, as well) that's not unexpected. After said break-in period, I have to agree totally, the only reasons for not giving it 5 stars is that, while certainly not flimsy, I don't think it will dribble well, and the radio reception isn't the best out here in the boonies, but the point is to bring your own anyway, right? I don't know how many 1 gig cards it'll take to hold my collection, but I do know 1 gig holds a LOT! of songs. For the price, hard to beat.

<Title>Another false product information
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Doesn't matter how good or how bad a product is, I will give it zero star when I am lied to: the 4xC batteries are NOT included, and the USB port is only 1.1, not "ultra fast 2.0" as indicated in the product information.  On top of that: the player does not resume where it left off on the SD card, the alarm function on my new unit does not work (set to FM).  The saving graces: AC adapter is included, funtions as a conventional alarm clock (that is if the alarm works) with radio(FM only)/stored music/buzz/snooze button, sleep timer, plays mp3, direct mp3 encoding, option to resume at beginning of track or at the exact point where left off, and very small internal memory (256mb, imagine if larger would wait forever for the usb 1.1 to transfer), the backlit light is bright orange is as good as a night light.  But all the settings need to be done through navigating the menu, not convenient as a conventional alrm clock.  Oy vey.  But FYI.

<Title>Pleasant Surprise!!!
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With the low cost of this MP3 "Boombox" item through an alternate Amazon dealer, I was really expecting very little.......but out of the box it did more and easily then I ever expected.  I am pretty MP3 savy and this was a mojo simple plug and play.  You just drop the songs over the USB and it plays, no trouble at all.  The 256 will hold at least a good 1 1/2 hour of play anyway but the best part is that it actually plays pretty dang loud.  I was expecting a tiny tin sound but you can hear it playing three rooms away, no problem, no rattle.  It has a fairly good base sound and if your files are simple medium bit downloads or rips, the sound is good.  The FM radio has a pretty cheap reciever I guess but I didn't buy it for that.   If you want something to haul around with you, this is prefect for size and with just 4 c's in it, not much wieght.   I will update my review if this "thang" goes bad after a while.

<Title>Just what I was looking for
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for MP3 players for my 3 and 5 year olds.  Wiggles and Disney CDs don't have a long lifespan with kids that age.  I wanted them to be fairly kid proof.. no docks, moving parts, headphones, etc.    These were exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right.  The kids love them.  If I had to pick on a couple things... the LCD display could have better contrast, and they'd be much better with 512MB.

<Title>Perfect for kids...
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After wearing out two CD players from playing lullabies continuously, this machine was a godsend, and has the capability of growing up with my little one.  No moving parts, I can put the MP3s directly on an SD card or load them into the device's internal memory.  When she's older it can be an alarm clock radio or she we grab it and take it with her on a trip to take familiar songs to any hotel room.  Perfect for our needs!

<Title>Dead in the first half hour of use
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's been a long time since I've had an brand new electronic product that died within the first half hour of use. I've always stayed away from low-end brands like Coby like the plague, but I started noticing nicer-looking products from Coby while cruising through stores like Walgreens and Target, so I decided finally to give Coby a chance when my wife needed a simple MP3 boombox (no CD) that has a flash card slot, to play tunes for our baby. And it just so turns out that Coby is one of very few brands that makes such a device (strange but true, as of Dec 2007). When it arrived, things were looking good. My wife liked its appearance, and it generally felt like a semi-quality piece. So I dropped several dozen songs onto an SD card and slipped it into the Coby's CD slot. I browsed through some of the settings in the menu, which were straightforward and effective, and setup the radio with my preferred presets. All of this took 10 minutes or so. Then...after playing 3 or 4 songs, it froze. None of the buttons worked. I unplugged the device from the power socket, replugged it in, the LCD came back on, but none of the buttons were responsive. I unplugged and replugged it in several more times. No luck. It won't turn on. None of the buttons work. I'm RMA'ing back to Amazon the very same day I got it. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy. And...I will not touch Coby again.

<Title>A Great Idea... 
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My expectations were low - and it exceeded them. I give this item 4 stars for the idea: an mp3 player that actually has speakers built in, wow! No messing around with external speakers and wires, cradles or seperate sets of silly little AA batteries, etc.     I've been using my MP-C341 to listen to talk-radio podcasts at work for over 6 months now. Using rechargeable NiMH C cells, it lasts an entire shift. It's easy to carry around, and I only need to bring my MMC card back and forth to work with daily podcast updates.     There are some problems. Seeking forward and backward in an mp3 is only about 2 to 3 times faster than normal playing speed. That means, if you push the buttons slightly the wrong way, or the batteries shake loose for an instant, you're listening to a 3-hour podcast from the beginning again. Changing the batteries resets the clock and any customized settings - so don't bother.      I've never tried the FM - that's not what I bought it for, and I've got other radio's that I'm sure do that way better. The mp3 audio quality is surprisingly good though, considering it's compact size and speakers, and I've frightened unsuspecting co-workers with Mark Levin's rantings and ravings.      Unfortunately, it appears that instead of perfecting this product, Coby has discontinued this and it's successor model, MP-C351. That's too bad. With so many brands making so many different shapes and colors of seemingly identical Ipod-like players, and so much technology without a purpose, they could set themselves apart with this unique concept - as obvious and simple as it ought to be.       I'll probably buy another one of these while I still can, unless I can find something else like it - which I haven't found yet.

<Title>Great for kids - COBY MP-C341
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We had a standard boom box (CD and tape), but it stopped working and we needed a replacement.  I initially looked for a boom box that would play MP3 CD-R disks.  Besides being very difficult to find and rather expensive for what they did, my wife hated the size and color options.  I then decided to find an MP3 player that had speakers (I didn't want to have separate speakers), sleep (so it turned off for the kids) and was easy enough for the wife to set when exiting the room.  I purchased our first COBY MP-C341 on clearance from a local music store.  The COBY fit our needs very well.  The four integrated speakers sound fine for the volume we need at bed time.  It accepts standard SD cards full of music.  Comes with an A/C adapter.  1GB cards give us enough room to provide a very good selection of music.  The orange carrying strap is removable and the little clock display works nicely in the room.  Some other nice features of this unit are that it can connect up to the computer through a USB cable, record through a microphone or line-in jack AND encode to MP3 and receives FM radio.  After using the COBY in my son's room, my daughter's CD player gave out (it was mechanical and played every night.)  I ordered one from Amazon and was happily filling up another SD card with Disney and children's tunes.  About a week later, trouble hit.  The player seemed to freeze whenever the play button was pressed.  I checked the manual and found nothing describing the condition or possible remedies.  Calling COBY, I spoke with a representative fixated on a non-existent reset button.  After looking all over the unit and declaring it reset button free, she asked a colleague and had me hook up to a computer and format the internal flash memory.  Worked like a charm.  Everything is back up and running and since I never stored anything on the internal memory, no loss of music.  Down side?  Well, it does take a little to get used to all of the button clicks to start the music then set the sleep.  Once you have it down, things work very smoothly.  The biggest up side?  No more hunting for my daughter's requested music in a pile of CD's shoved in her nightstand!
