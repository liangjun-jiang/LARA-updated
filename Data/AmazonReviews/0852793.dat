<Title>WAY better than the competition!
<Date>Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first purchased the RIO sports mp3 player (the red one).  Anyway, it was a piece of junk.  I took it back and got this one!  This thing is the best! the detachable portion that holds the battery is replaceable, which means if you drop it, most likely it will fall on the detachable battery until and leave your player in tact.  I just can't say enough about this player,, in the 50 hours of use I have used it, I have not had one problem!  It has suffered swet, drops and general abuse and has held up wonderfully!

<Title>It survived a Laundry Cycle
<Date>Sat Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player looking for something light and with a good capacity hard drive. It's durable, stylish, and easy to use, and it still worked after I left it in my pocket and it went through a load of laundry! What more could u ask for??

<Title>Light-weight, stylish, versatile
<Date>Wed Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have always wanted to have a MP3 player + USB Flash drive combo. Creative Muvo was a step in that direction, but it had its drawbacks: cheap plastiky look, max memory of 128MB, no LCD.<br>Then along came Muvo NX with all these issues fixed. One of the best things you'll like about this player is that it does not require any drivers on the Windows 2K/XP (maybe other versions also but I haven't checked). So you can practically work off any computer. Just drag and drop your MP3 or WMA into the player and you are all set...<br>It sounds great and is light-weight enough to put in your shirt pocket and not feel it. At 256MB storage capacity, I can simultaneously have sufficent number of songs on the player to last me a long trip as well as have a number of work-related documents to carry between workplace and home.<br><br>You will need to get a good headset, though. The earphones that come in the box are uncomfortable and slippery and would just not stay in the ears.

<Title>Great little player- but......
<Date>Thu Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>WARNING! Please read the last paragraph.<p>I purchased this product about 35 days ago, and it was love at first sight. Sleek, ultra compact, an LCD screen and a built in voice recorder - what more could you ask for? Well, i'll get to that. <p>The LCD is a great addition to the Muvo and with it comes quite a few surprising features such as a 5 band equalizer and idle timer. The display is clear, and menu is easy to navigate using the rocker, which doubles as a track changer and fast forward. Keeping the volume controls seperate is a good idea, since they're the things you use the most. Switching on and off is painless, although controlled by the play pause button - holding it down for a time will turn it off or on, and just hitting it once will play or pause. <p>Data transfer is a breeze. You plug the stick into the nearest usb port on your computer and you can transfer songs within a second. At least on XP - i don't know about other windows versions, but i think it's the same with 2000. I'm not sure it's very useful if you have 98se2. Data transfer is slow though. Even slower than the previous model infact, but not inhibiting - it transfers and average song in 5-10 seconds, no particularly good, but I don't think many people will see it as a problem. <p>Battery life is average. One duracell ultra M3 lasted for about 2 days, with quite heavy usage.<p>The voice recorder is great, with an average range, and 8hrs of recording when the memory is empty. Perfect for Journalism - it's that good. The music sounds crystal clear, with several preset EQ levels or your own custom 5 band. <br>Using it as USB pen memory works perfectly too - you can put any type of file on it.<p>Memory. Not so good - 128mb is really not much to play around with, especially when you prefer quality over size, and the realistic number of songs you are going to fit on it is 35 - which according to me is alright for a day, but no longer - 2CD's? <p>So, overall good, but serioiusly lacking in memory and USB 2.0 compatability which is why it didn't get 5 stars. <p>However....WARNING!!!! It lasted 35 days. I dropped it once in the first week, but treated it pretty well after that, and on the 35th day - nothing. Would'nt turn on at all. Battery changed several times. Nothing. It wouldn't even work when plugged into the USB. Notice it broke 5 days after the warranty ran out. Great. So, it's cool, but beware - yours may have a fault too...(I also heard of the same problem with the orginal Muvo...)

<Title>DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this product last night. I tried it out and it worked great except the headphones. One side doesn't put out sound. Today it won't play music and takes forever to turn off. I have made sure that I wasn't just retarded. There is music on it, but it does nothing!!! Save yourself some money and get something else.

<Title>Plays tracks in alphanumeric order
<Date>Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great MP3/WMA player with one glaring deficiency: It insists on playing the songs in alphanumerical order by track title. The manual states this, customer support verified it and I couldn't find a reasonable work-around, so it went back. Sure you can manually move from one song to another as they play, but if you want to load an entire CD and listen to the songs in the order in which you're accustomed, it won't do it without interaction. In my opinion, this is a colossal design flaw. The original MuVo 64 and 128 will play the tracks in the order which you load them but not this one. If that won't bother you, the MuVo NX is the one to get.

<Title>Be careful!
<Date>Sat Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is nice and convenient unit. As you know it doubles as flash drive and makes it easier for you to move files and music from different computers. 128 MB of memory is adequate, if you looking for more then try iPod or some other hard drive based MP3 players. <p>However, only buy this from places that offer unconditional money back guarantee return policy. I bought one unit and it would not power up. In addition, the earphones were uneven in length. The right earphone was 3 times as long as left one making it awkward to listen to music. As I was exchanging the player I heard customer service representative saying how this is second one she had today with the same problem, it would not power up at all. I exchanged the faulty unit and got the one that works just fine but the earphones came uneven in length again. Somebody is sleeping at quality control department. So be careful and ready to exchange or return this product. It might be worth it to buy product replacement plan for this product if you decide to get one.<p>This is definitely useful gadget that makes life more pleasant so I will keep mine. .

<Title>Great Gadget
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>First thing first: this is a portable drive &quot;that has a MP3 playback ability&quot;<p>With that said, if you are looking for a MP3 Player, buy an actual MP3 player that is designed for that performance.<p>The unit has a USB port on it, so there aren't any undesired long plugs that needs to go around. However, since the unit package doesn't come with an USB extension, for desktop users that only have USB ports on the back of the computer might be inconvinient.<p>One review for this device suggested &quot;the headphone uneven&quot; issue. One side of the head phone is suppose to go behind your neck so that you don't have a headphone line go straight down the middle.<p>The sound issue is something that I can't understand either. I use this device on the streets of New York City, the busiest city in the world, and I didn't have any problem with the volume. I don't know how loud you might want it, but if you plug in more sophisticated headset, the sound quality will definitely improve.<p>Do not format this device. Then it will loose all MP3 playback capabilities. You can delete and drag-drop files anyway you want it, but you will need to use the program that Creative Labs provide, which is called &quot;Initializer&quot; to format the device.<p>It's a pain to use the program that they provide with, since I'm not familiar with it at all. This will force you to only listen to songs in alphabetical order OR random, in my case. So, that's a minus.<p>One definite plus. For many non-alphabat users, this unit will be great, since it's able to display East-Asian characters, such as Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. A lot of other units don't do that, but you will get that capability with this device.<p>Overall, I recommend. But I wanted a &quot;all-in-one&quot; device, which this device was perfect for. For music playing, storage, portability. Great buy.

<Title>POOR SOUND QUALITY
<Date>Sat Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>this is my third mp3 player for the last 7 months. first of all, the earphones almost deafened me because of the quality, and also what kind of sound would u get with a little piece of plastic the size of ur thumb??? in my opinion, try getting something from digitalway or iaudio because the u can get the best sound from them.
