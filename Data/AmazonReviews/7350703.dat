<Title>Small in size large in sound
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was easily able to use my computer to transfer all my favorite music to this player. The size is great and the sound! It has various sound settings and even can enhance a songs sound quality. The fact that it runs with an AA battery is a plus. The player my husband has needs to be charged via USB cord to our computer I find mine to be easier no charging, the battery lasts a long time. The only thing I can say that is even as a slight draw back is the amount of songs I am able to store - depending on file type and size about 999. Also this player does not have a radio, no picture capabilities and does not do any voice recording. I was more interested in portability and the sound quality of the music. I found both to be great with this player. If you're looking for a player that's all about music enjoyment this is it.

<Title>Doesn't support Windows Playlists
<Date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I assumed a $150+ flash player that uses Windows Media Player 10 as its transfer software would also allow playlists. However, mine did not transfer, and further reading in the manual shows what it calls 'playlists' are actually the folders where the music is recorded. This means you cannot build separate lists that include the same song without recording the song each time, gobbling up memory. Since there was no warning of this on the package, I will never again buy an audio player from Panasonic. I've wasted too much money already on a player that won't allow me to transfer customized lists of music! My attempts to contact Panasonic to question this have been unanswered.

<Title>It's fine, but...
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>...I use my player to listen to books, which brings up a strong negative.  With other players I have used, when I held down the search (>> OR &lt;&lt;) button, the forward or reverse went faster and faster the longer I held down the button.  Not so with this device.  It goes about 10x speed, and that's it.  Once I accidentally restarted a book of which I'd listened to 3 hours.  I had to push the search button down for a half hour to get back to where I was!!

<Title>incredibly great!
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Panasonic SV-MP020 review:  This mp3/wma player is absolutely amazing! The sound is incredibly great! It even has a few eq settings as well as "surround" mode, which gives your music a noticeably wider range... also has something called "remastered" which is another way it tweaks your audio files to play them beyond the fullest extent of their high fidelity.   Something very important to me is a resume function, so when you are playing your music, stop your device, and later turn it back on, it remembers where it was. The Panasonic SV-MP020 does this to the note! I've been fooling around with disc mp3 players for the last couple years and you'd be very hard pressed to find one that does this, even on the ones that claim they do. Not only is this never a problem for the Panasonic, it reloads amazingly quick when you turn it back on, doesn't go reading... reading... reading... etc. due to being a flash player no doubt.  2GB I find more than adequate for my needs. I bought this for my new/used car which has a very nice stereo, but only cassette. I now simply plug the MP020 into a cassette adaptor and I can enjoy my mp2/wma music in my car with the high quality stereo it came with. (my car being blue, I just had to get the blue one, too!) So, I basically bought it for my car, BUT, I now also bring it to my office at work and it also comes in handy in many situations. For us old fashioned long play albums people, you get around 30 wma albums on it.   Loading this thing is very simple. You just plug it into your usb port with the SUPPLIED cable, and it shows up as a drive under My Computer. Then you simply drag and drop your music on the media folder on the drive. Although I don't use it, you can also easily sync it with Windows Media Player. It does arrange your music in the order you copy it to the device, so if you need things in a particular order, you want to keep this in mind. If you're into shuffling your music, the Panasonic also does this, and quite well (playing as a good variety mixture of your 2GB).   The display is very easy to read. The entire layout is very straightforward and logical. It did take me awhile to get used to knowing how to select my album, play it, and have the device keep playing the remainder of the library from that point. It just took a bit of practice, but it's just a matter of knowing how to do this.  If all of that wasn't enough, probably the best unique thing about this player is the power supply. I was never much one to "fool with batteries", but I didn't want to fool with too many wires in my car either. The MP020 runs on a NORMAL AA battery! And, yes, it's removable and replaceable, which I hear many mp3-type players are not, which is a major factor that kept me from buying one for so long. It's advertised on the package to last a whopping 80 HOURS and I haven't timed it, but after 2 weeks of daily use now, the battery icon hasn't indicated any usage so far at all! I think it will make it's 80 hours of playback time, and I've read on line other reviews that confirm this.  So, to summarize, it's blue, it's easy to use, it's a nice size gb wise and physical size (about the size of a cigarette lighter: again, older folks like me that used to smoke back in the day, instead of carrying a lighter, you can carry 30 albums in your pocket!) and it sounds FANTASTIC! I'm extremely impressed with the sound and everything about this product.  I read many reviews on line, including this site, to help me decided what mp3/wma player to get, and I hope this review helps you. If you like the features I do mentioned here, I can't recommend this player highly enough!

<Title>A fix for book 'readers'
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use my MP020 only for 'reading' books.  Another reviewer mentioned the slow scan issue.  There is a solution for this.  If you check online you can find free, audiobook slicers.  These can slice up the file into smaller pieces, say 5-10 mins of sound.  Then if you accidentally go back to the beginning, all you have to do is jump to the proper slice and you aren't spending 30 mins seaching into a 3 hour boo boo.  (speaking from bitter experience)

<Title>If you're looking for a MP3 player that is verbose, compact, generous on storage and easy on the wallet look no father!
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased this device (the white and silver one) from a local Wal-Mart (for about $84.00). I researched various MP3 players under $200. The IPOD cannot even compare to this dream player.    * Size - It is small (About as long as a tube of lipstick) It's perfect to take along while walking running or working out [That was mine's intended use :-)].  * Resources - Runs off of 1 AA battery for up to 80 hrs (this is of course under the default factory settings. However, I have had mine since march and have not had to change the battery and I and still getting excellent playback!)   * Options - This pocket player is packed with power.   Boasting 2 Gigs worth of flash memory it can store aprox 500 MP3's depending on file size. It will also store other file types in a different folder.  It interfaces seamlessly with Windows XP. There is not a bundle of software to complicate things (Like I tunes or it's counterparts). Just plug it in to your pc's USB port (with the included adapter) and it will auto recognize and show up under 'My Computer' as another removable storage device. From there you can just copy and paste your MP3's from your pc to your device, or create folders on your device directly from windows to keep music organized. Though a little hard to access from the device it's self you are able to use the folders as play lists.   You also have the ability to remix, repeat or randomize a specific play list or all music on the player.  So if you're looking for a MP3 player that is verbose, compact, generous on storage and easy on the wallet look no father.    To learn more please read the review for the Panasonic SV-MP010 MP3 Player on C-Net.com. This review is on the 1 Gig model but other than capacity there are no differences. C-Net is a wonderful resource for technical reviews and tips.

<Title>This is the best portable mp3 player I've used!
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player all of an hour now and am very impressed by this tiny unit.  Prior to this I had a 1gb ipod shuffle which I absolutely hated and consequently gave away.  I've been looking for a decent portable player for a long time and finally settled on this one.  Obviously I can't attest to the battery life but if it gives me half of the life it's reviewed to give I'm still tickled pink (75 hours on one AA battery).  It can also be used as a data drive simultaneously based on the amount of room left... provided that you have a mini usb cable handy (if it had a built in usb connector I would marry this device).  The instruction manual takes 3 minutes to read and is easily understandable.  It took about 10 minutes per gb to load and recognizes folder structures at least 3 folders deep ( I haven't tested it to the 7 stated). The headphones aren't great but they don't suck either; I swapped them out for my favorite sony SL73's. Navigation is simple to select folders and it remembers it's place when you shut it off.  As someone else stated it only recognizes up to 999 titles and then gives an error and also wont add playlists from wmp.  Since neither of these is an issue for me I'm not bothered.  Frankly I like the fact that I can just drag and drop files and have the player play them.  I don't like using wmp or itunes or any other software.  I prefer to rip my own mp3's with a no bones ripper and just drag and drop via windows explorer.  Windows recognizes the device right away.  The backlight is a nice soft orange and is adjustable as with just about every function.  You can format the device or delete songs directly on the unit from the display menu (no computer needed).  The construction is a bit light and I could see the usb door breaking off in the future and the buttons not working if you are heavy handed and really mash them in.  Then again it's not flimsy and I don't have issues with this.  I still have my first mp3 player from 2002 by creative with a whopping 64mb of space in perfect condition and use it at least 5 times a week.  I'd highly recommend this player if you want something simple, small, takes a battery, and sells for a fair price $99 .  Thank you panasonic for yet another quality product!

<Title>Small, durable, practical
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Excellent lil' product.  Battery life unmatched, easy to transfer songs (just drag & drop).  My only problem w/ it is that it doesn't play WAV or AIFF files.  I even dropped it in a stream once while hiking.  It was full on submerged for about a second & a half.  I pulled the thing out, dried it off and it still works to this day (not recommended nor I am going to repeat that, just was pleasantly surprised).

<Title>Amazingly good sound for lower priced MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got one of these for my brother.  Not only does it come with the best sounding ear buds of any player I have ever seen (Creative, iPod, iriver, etc.), the unit itself puts out a very high quality sound.  I'm mostly an iriver fan, big time, but I was not springing iriver type bucks on a player for my brother who is hard on things.  But gee, this sucker puts out great sound.  I was amazed.  And, having tried most all major brands (I'm pretty into this stuff), these are the best sounding earbuds of their type I have ever heard (the ones that come with the player).  Yes, it's overwise very basic.  Nothing fancy.  Only a few EQ settings (but two of them are fantastic, and I wish even iriver would take a cue from whatever Panasonic did here to get the sound so right from it's EQ settings).  The only downside is, as noted by another, I do not think this supports playlists.  That's no big deal for many people.  The other is that the battery door seems exceptionally flimsy.  Bummer that.  Otherwise, fabulous deal for the money in terms of what you buy a player for (great sound you can take around with you).  I do not think there is a better sounding MP3 player for twice this money on the market.  (And there are NO better sounding ipod models than this one.)  Sound is according to taste, of course, but to me, this is a great deal.
