<Title>Outstanding MP3 player.
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I began looking into an iPod purchase over a year ago, and was almost sold on the 4th generation iPod.  I liked the colors of the mini and was okay with 4 GB of storage (though that was a tad on the small side), but the main thing that deterred me from the mini was the less-than-desirable 8-10 hour battery life.  Then the 2nd generation mini was released.  Apple seemed to fix and improve every little thing I had held against the original.  They made the colors brighter, increased the hard drive space to 6 gigs, and most importantly, at least to me, increased the battery life two-fold.  The 18 hours that Apple advertises is EXTREMELY conservative.  If you're content listening to music and don't need the backlight for more than a minute or two every hour, the battery can run for about 24-25 hours.  I can go a week and not have to worry about recharging my battery.  I could listen every waking moment of my day and never have to stop and recharge before I went to bed.  It's a wonderful thing.  The blue is very bright and pleasing to the eye--I've seen the pink and silver versions and they too are visually appeasing.  6 gigs is nothing to shake a stick at--on the contrary, I've found that 6 gigs is just about the perfect size for someone who has a vast number of interests musically but doesn't have thousands upon thousands of CD's to rip and upload.  Unless you have literally hundreds of CD's in your collection that you plan on putting on your iPod, I'd recommend the mini, since you'd more than likely end up with half the space on your regular iPod sitting unused.  Despite the fact that the iPod scratches easily, there are several cases which work extremely well...I'm partial to the ones made by Power Support, though you have to import them from Japan.  Uploading your songs is quick and easy.  Navigating the menus takes about 15 minutes to master.  There's really nothing more I can say that can do the iPod mini justice.  I will make a quick note and add that I'm not an Apple fanatic.  I think that Apples are good computers, but I'm still attached to my PCs.  However, when it comes to MP3 players, there's really no comparison; it's going to take many many years before Microsoft or any other competing company can put out any MP3 player nearly as nice as the 2nd generation iPod mini.  Also, if you have a friend that's a teacher in a school, look into the education discount on the Apple website.  It ends up being 20 or 30 dollars off.

<Title>practical and easy to use
<Date>Wed May 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>let's put it this way, if you want to store all your music in your ipod ( and when i say all your music, i mean ALL), then  this ipod mini is not for you, 'cause as you guys know, this ipod mini only holds up to 1,500 songs (6gb). Now,  that's a lot of songs if you ask me, that's an entire week of music, i love classic rock and i filled my ipod mini with all of my favorite songs, you know how cool it is for me to take this everytime i go to the beach or if i'm having some company, i can just press shuffle and enjoy without the hassle of getting up everytime, you know to change cd's??, so if you're looking for something that's not that expensive and just want to have a good time and easy to use then i recomend this little item!! Respeta a un varon!!!!!

<Content>The iPod mini is a wonderful invention - thank you Apple.  I'm a Windows user, so when Mac came out with the Windows version of iTunes, it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  The iPod mini is the best music product on the market for people who only have time to list to 1000+ songs - you never get through them all.

<Title>Awsome  little gadget
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got a silver ipod mini for my 13th b-day, and it is way cool! I was going to get an ipod shuffle, but I am so glad I went with the mini. I was frusterated at first, because I couldn't figure out how to transfer songs onto it. However, my mom finally figured it out. It sounds great! I did not use the headphones that came with it, 'cause they didn't seem very good. It can fit in my pocket, and I don't have to worry about getting to many songs on it. Way to go, Apple!

<Title>Fantastic!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I bought my iPod mini 6gb (Pink)to hold my favorite songs to listen to on the go, in the car, etc. I cannot stress enough how much fun this amazing little thing has been. This is the best thing I have ever spent my money on.  iTunes is incredibly easy to use. I was able to easily convert my songs from Windows Media Player over to Apple's iTunes with no problems. Just make sure you go to the Tools Option in the task bar on Windows Media Player, then to Options and then to the Copy tab and turn off the Copy Protect music (for all you Windows Media Users). Windows, by default, automatically protects your music to keep you from being able to use other formats.   I have around 1200 songs loaded on my iPod and still have a little over 1 gb left. I like to keep it in the shuffle mode to mix up music and listen to things I have not heard in a long time. I am actually purchasing my husband one for his birthday/Father's Day because he loves mine so much. He owns an iPod shuffle, but would prefer a mini.  The iPod mini seems sturdier than my 20gb iPod. I use a case for it occasionally. It has yet, knock on wood, to be scratched. It works superbly and right now I am getting over 24 hours on one battery charge. I find my iPod mini impossible to live without. I take it everywhere and use it for hours every day. It comes in handy when you have to wait in long lines or shopping alone, etc. I also use it in the car with the Belkin TuneBase FM modulator for the iPod mini. It works well and holds the iPod in a slot so it does not slide around the car and get scratched. It also works as a charger.   I feel you will not be disappointed with this purchase. It can be pricey for some people, but it will be well worth it in the long run. If you have a really large music collection, I recommend buying a 20, 30 or 60 gb iPod. But, if you have a smaller collection, or only want your favorite songs in one place, the iPod mini is perfect. I know most people eventually own two. A large one for the entire collection and the mini to hold your workout, driving, etc. playlists. So, good luck and have fun with it.

<Title>Convenient, easy to use, fun, and silver!
<Date>Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple 6 GB Ipod Mini is very convenient. First of all it comes with all the necessary stuff (at least mine did). A firewire cable, a belt clip, Ear buds (with extra pieces) and the Itunes CD.   The Ipod Mini is also very ez to use with the click and scroll wheel that allows you to easily move through categories of selections and through songs. Also besides being able to hold up to 1,500 songs it can help you with a variety of other things from remembering e-mail addresses to telling you the time and date (even comes with an setable alarm). It has a built in backlight too for night trips and and a few simple built in games like brick for when you become bored. And if that's not enough it's silver :)   I recommend the Ipod Mini 6 GB silver ipod not only because it's a good product but because of the battery life. After one single full charge it can keep playing for up to 18 hours which isn't bad at all. It's especially good for people who prefer quality over quantity of songs. Ipod Mini is perfect for car drives and even plane rides and it's small enough to fit well in a pocket or a bag and is very light and is guaranteed at least 25 minutes of not skipping. A very good buy.

<Title>There is a reason for the phenomenon...
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iPods change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,500 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.   In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.   About the new mini:   It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.   The Click Wheel input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.   Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.   Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...   Enjoy!

<Title>iPods... the most wanted electronics out...
<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my iPod a couple of months ago, and it is the best thing I bought beside my guitar.  I love the sleek look, also it is so easy to use and is almost like a mini organizer with music.  iTunes is the easiest and best digital music company out there.  The mini iPod comes with the USB cable, earphones, the iPod, instruction booklet, and a belt clip. Some of the features beside playing music is rating music, creating playlists on the iPod (with a touch of a button), playing games, a calendar, notes, to-do list, and much more... (I don't know how to work those things but I'm gonna learn. =] )  Overall, an iPod is the best mp3 player out there and is worth every cent. =) =] :)

<Title>THIS PRODUCT ROX 
<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No wonder the Apple iPod mini is so popular, whether it is 4GB or 6GB. 4Gb holds 1,000 songs and the 6GB holds 1,500 songs. The other mp3 players, like Zen, have really bad quality. But the iPod mini 6 GB's  quality is really good. It comes with a calendar, alarm clock, games, plus you can rate your songs (yeah, with five stars or whatever) and shuffle them or choose whichever song you would like to listen to.  Or you can simply choose a playlist. It's really easy to turn the iPod on or off; you simply press the play/pause button. If you put the iPod in your pocket, then you can simply push the lock button to prevent the iPod to turn off in the middle of a song. The iPod mini comes with a firewire, earbuds (extra black thingies in case they fall off; which mine do a lot!!!), a belt clip, a CD for iTunes, plus itself! I chose pink because I like pink. That's another plus: you can chose whatever color you like. Charging is kinda bad. Ever since the price was dropped, iPod minis stopped coming with chargers, so they take longer to charge. I bought the XtremeMac AirPlay FM Transmitter, and it's really good with my iPod mini. Plus, it also fits into my sister's iPod photo so we don't have to waste our money buying two separate Airplays.I find buying the speakers to play for the whole room to hear very silly. At a party, I unplugged the speakers from my computer and connected them to my iPod, and they worked fine. Also, buy a cover for your iPod!!!! I am very clumsy and keep dropping my iPod. I bought a Ipod Mini Flip Case for my iPod. The flip part protected my iPod from damage, and when I opened it I could use the scroll wheel. (By the way, my iPod seems to find it very funny when I put it on shuffle and it plays two songs by the same artist in a row). Over all, I am very proud of my iPod, and I think, and although my iPod was $250, it was worth every penny (actually more like dollars). Apple rox!!!!

<Content>i'm a kid who has lots of songs and wants to listen to them all the time. When youre going on a plane,car,train ride etc... you dont want to carry a ton of cds. When you have an ipod mini you dont need to. My 6gb can hold up to 1500 songs, has an 18 hour battery, and great sound. i dont need to turn it up even half way to hear it perfectly. It's small, compact, and easy to carry around. Unlike the ipod nano it doesnt break easily if you put it in your pocket too much. My sister has had her 20gb ipod regular for more than a year and so far neither of us has had any complaints to apple.

<Content>I don't write many reviews, and I know this is model isn't being manufactured anymore, but if you're thinking of buying one second hand or something, don't hesitate. It's the best mp3 player I've ever had. I've dropped it about a hundred times (no exaggeration) and it still works perfectly. For this reason alone, I implore you -GET ONE!  Other than that, it's simply great. Stores about 1100 / 1200 songs depending on bit rate etc... doesn't nearly fit all of my music... but certainly does the job. Have never experienced any problems with software jams and I'm using Windows XP. Seamless integration. Perfect. This one is actually worth the retail price. Probably more.  Have a good one!

<Title>One of the best out there,the cons really hurt it.
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an Ipod Mini 6GB since October of 2005.I was lucky to get one because they were discontinued and i refused to get a Nano.When i first got the product and opened it the installation was easy.Plug the Ipod to the computer, insert the CD and your ready to go!Adding songs to my Ipod was quick and easy with Itunes.By the time i was done adding songs it was ready to go!So i finally started listening and i was amazed at the sound this little machine contains.The sound on this is incredible but when i turned the voulme up to full i discovered the first problem with the included earbuds.When turned to full voulme the earbuds make a clicking noise.I listen to rap and r&b so i like my bass heavy but everytime it's at full volulme it clicks and its annoying because u can't hear the bass just the clicking.I found that i could get over this problem.So i was enjoying my Ipod listening to my favorite songs on it for hours and hours.My battery life was amazing i still had a full charge 3 hours later!Then Hurricane Wilma was coming so i charged my Ipod and pack songs on to it.After the power was out I listened to it some but i conserved the battery.And let me tell you, my Ipod lasted me a week and 3 days and we were out of power for 2 weeks!Thats almost the entire outage!I was amazed.All my friends in school want to listen to it but i just tell em get your own.As i experienced my Ipod for more and more months, my Apple experience started to get worse..I started finding out more and more about my Ipod.I had looked up the battery problems before i got my Ipod and i knew that once the battery is out i'd have to send the Ipod to apple.So about in December just 2 months after i got my Ipod, my Ipod's battery life started getting bad.After a few minutes of listening atleast most of my battery would be drained,not half,but most.Just enough to continue through my day though.Also my click wheel became dirty,i also found more problem with the stock earbuds.They fall out of your ear so easily,there painful,and the sound is horrible.I listen to my ipod when im sleep alot and when im laying down im constantly having to put my earbuds back in my ears because of pain or falling out.Also the battery life is 18 hours but i recently tested that my ipods max battery life is 8 hours.The same expected battery life as the first generation Mini.I was afraid my Ipod would be wearing out and i'd soon have to buy another Mp3.Recently i've been looking up other Mp3's on the market incase of my Ipod breaking.The Ipod is really the top dog and most expensive brand out there.Apple also is ripping people off if you notice but that's a entirely different review.Over all the Ipod is great,innovative,fun,and looks great.But read the title and you will know why this has a 3.The battery only lasts 500 charges as many expect but your battery life will start to go down after just a few months!Also the earbuds suck ass but can be replaced no big deal.The ipod is very expensive.For example,my 6Gb silver mini was 250$ compared to the Creative Zen 6GB which is 200$,and the battery is easily replaced.In all Ipod is great but Apple is just taking advantage of people IMO.IT is very expensive,battery can't be replaced you have to send it to Apple and 99$ to get it fixed,and compared to the others in the market it will soon be overtaken.Well this is my review i hope it is very helpful as i hope it will be to you.

<Content>Apple may be selling you a used ipod.  I found out today that the ipod I paid $299.00 for was actually refurbished.  It had been repackaged, presented and sold to me as a new ipod.   This company has a class action lawsuit against it for this, among other claims. You can view the class action lawsuit by googling "tell on apple."    Don't get cheated the way I did!

<Title>maybe, maybe not
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the ipod mini from Amazon on September 17, 2005. I used it periodically over the next few months, probably about 50 or so hours total play time. This week, I rediscovered my ipod after not using it since December. I was so excited to be able to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and music at work that I joined audible.com and started downloading all this great stuff. It's really a great toy to have around to break the tedium of the work day.   If only it worked.   After about 50 hours of lifetime use, this unit froze up in the middle of changing tracks and has been stuck on that screen for over 6 hours now. I followed all the troubleshooting stuff on Apple's web site, but to no avail. I was able to put in a support request to send the unit to Apple for replacement. They did charge me about $35 for shipping and handling, even though I am within warranty. Of course, I am not too happy about that, but I forked it over anyway. We will have to wait and see how the company does on their follow through.   If it wasn't for this one incident, I would say it is a great product, with a nice intuitive interface. Partnering the hardware with i-tunes makes for easy organizing and listening of your audio library.

<Content>The Ipod mini is great, I brought mine second hand!! Ive got the pink one, I think the colours awesome. Its got more than enough memory at 6GB. The battery life is ok, its more like 12 hours but its probably because mines a bit older. It does the job more than nicely for me. However it could be better. I like the extras, but it could have some more exciting games on it. They are pretty poor. It also could have an FM radio as sometimes I would like to change. Its easy to use and looks good so no other complaints. I recommend it!!!!

<Title>3.5 stars.  YES! It Does Play .MP3s!!!!!!
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:    I've always been hesitant to buy an ipod... or any mac product.  But this is one of the few devices that have an H20 audio case (sold here on Amazon), that enables you to swim with your ipod (a couple other ipod models have h20 cases too).  I've been a little ignorant about the ipod thinking it wouldn't play .mp3s, but it does. (It just doesn't let you transfer them to another pc).  But if you have some .mp3's on your PC from whereever, it will copy them to your ipod, and leave the one's on your pc unchanged!  This rocks as I thought it would encrypt the mp3s on my pc... it doesn't.  It has more features than I expected... the ipod wheel is pretty easy to figure out, I didn't read the manual it was soo easy.  It comes with a Calendar, To Do List, Clock, alarm and more.  I'm impressed.  Spending this much on a device, I did get a warranty added on.  It has a super interface that automatically organizes several different ways, by artist, by album, by genra, etc... and you can access your music by these different ways.  Much better than the old Creative Zen's that have no folder functions or any additional functions listed above.  Cons:  You have to connect to your PC via tha USB transfer cable in order to charge the unit.  The battery is not accessible.  You must send the unit to Apple to get it replaced (there are others on the net that do it for less).  It encrypts all music you transfer to it (on the device only, not on your PC).  It isn't compatable with many mobile music services, such as Real Rhapsody... etc.  Pretty foolish.  People are willing to pay a monthly subscription and be legal, and ipod denies them this because they want you to use itunes only.  Well, this encourages illegal downloading as the non-protected mp3 commonly downloaded will easily go onto the ipod!  >:(  Get with it ipod!  Otherwise, this is a player I would recommend.  If you're planning on getting a bigger player, 6+GB, I'd go with a different brand that has all the features of the ipod plus more... the Toshiba MES60VK, available here on amazon, has the same features as the 60GB ipod, with compatibility with subscription services AND digital FM radio!

<Content>Love this item think its one of the best user friendly MP3s around but the itunes is slow and sluggish and a pain to use some times but after you get used to the drag and drop and waiting for podcast to download its decent I wont say the best but good.  The player needs a a bit of a better battery I have the newer model but still doesnt live up to the 16 hours they claim but for the room and the money its the better one out there it really hasnt locked on me yet only a couple of times but the they also claimed this newer model had a auto volume adjustment feature which may work somewhat but it is simply not true some songs are louder and some a quiter depends on quality of mp3 but over would recommend it I hope they come out with better features in the new one and smaller
