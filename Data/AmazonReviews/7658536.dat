<Product Name>Cowon D2 4GB Portable Media Player (White)
<Title>Very versatile!

<Content>The Cowon D2 is an excellent portable player. I upgraded mine to the latest v2.53 firmware, which supports all the standard audio formats, along with FLAC, APE, OGG, and even adds welcome support for AAC, which had been dropped from earlier firmware revisions (note that AAC files must have .aac file extension - .mp4 extension is not recognized)  NB: I suggest steering clear of the v2.51 firmware, it is full of bugs...  Due to the Cowon D2's powerful sound output, it should ideally be paired to regular (ear-muff style) headphones.  The problem with using the supplied Walkman-style earbuds is that they must be operated at a lower volume setting, and this leads to a *drastic* and very noticeable reduction in audio fidelity.     The Cowon D2 works MUCH better with standard headphones.  Since they need more power to drive them, this means the volume can be set much higher (without necessarily being louder), yielding correspondingly better sound quality (I hope that makes sense).   In this respect, the Cowon D2 differs significantly from older generation MP3 players.  Prior to the Cowon D2, I had been using a 1Gb Apacer Steno MP3 player, which sounds absolutely FANTASTIC when paired with Walkman-style earbuds.  The reason being that the Apacer's power output is perfectly matched for this type of mini earphone when operated at standard volume levels, having been engineered with their use in mind...     So you can imagine my surprise when I discovered that these exact same earphones plugged into the Cowon D2 sound utterly crap.  This is due to Cowon D2 having a much higher power output compared to older generation MP3 players - meaning that you are forced to set the volume to a rather low level when using Walkman-style earphones.  Low volume setting = DRASTIC reduction in audio quality !!  So the first thing to do when you get your Cowon D2, is to DITCH the supplied earphones, and invest in a pair of regular headphones.  These will be a MUCH better match for the Cowon D2's higher power output.   Trust me, you won't look back!  I find Cowon D2's interface to be superb, and the touch-screen/LCD display very gee-whiz yet practical.  On the minus side, it does not come with a protective pouch (fortunately they can be purchased cheaply on ebay).  Although the Cowon D2 itself is worth 5 stars, I will only rate it 4 stars, due to the lack of a pouch.  And in my belief, the Cowon D2 ought to come supplied with regular headphones instead of Walkman-style earbuds.  The high power output of Cowon D2 is a very poor match for earbuds, plain and simple!

<Content>OK -I am not so much of a techie-- what I am is a librarian trying desperately to keep up on my reading -- by 'reading' audiobooks. I have a Mac at home and a PC at work and this little player allows me to download books from both Audible and NetLibrary (not Mac friendly). It has a great bookmarking feature. Took me a bit to understand the process of updating the firmware, dowloading and transferring book files, but now it is a snap. I have 'read' at least 8 books over the past 3 weeks since I purchased this. Coupled with the iRiver FM transmitter I bought this makes my 50 minute commute a dream, and a much better use of my time in the car. Additionally, I think the sound on this Cowon rivals my ipod, and the video and pix I have added look fabulous on this player.I love the fact that it also has FM radio capability. I say- don't let the unfamiliar name throw you -- this is a great little product.

<Title>Why be a Sheep??

<Content>This is for all of you who would compare this to the omnipresent iPod - It's NOT an iPod. It's something beyond said Mp3 player. To decide if you need this product, you need to look at your own self. How do you like your music? If you like your tunes laden with DRM, presented in auto-generated playlists, and you let a program called iTunes run amok on your computer, whisking away your music files from where YOU put them and tossing them in some folder you can't access directly, then save yourself the pain and go get an iPod. You won't have to deal with a lot, just a player that is compatible with a paltry 3-4 audio & video formats, has no radio, no expandable memory, no software expandability and so on...  BUT...  If you are like me, someone who refuses to go with the mindless masses, and has his own way of dealing with a 30 gigabyte music collection, listens to Uncompressed FLAC and OGG audio, and demands the best audio quality available from any Mp3 player, you'll understand the raison d'etre for the Cowon D2. Sure, the interface is not as smooth and polished as the iPod's and there are a few quirks in the D2, such as a wanton shuffle mode, but the sound of the music flowing into your ears will drown out all that noise.  More importantly, everyone else has an iPod. Why be a sheep?
