<Content>Good Overall Player, Good Price, Very easy to use, Good FM Tuner and Recorder function that few players have. Only complaints are: 1- the headphones are too big to fit my ears, the cable tends to get very tangled, there is no quick release of the headphone leash to the player  2-The armband came in a cream color that did not match in my opinion the player color, black would have been better.  
<Overall>4

<Content>It is really good for the price. The 2 GB size is great, especially with the FM radio built in. Will someone please make one with AM as well.  I do wish that it had a clip on the back in addition to the eye on the top.  You really need a rechargable battery with it. It goes through the single AAA battery fairly quickly.
