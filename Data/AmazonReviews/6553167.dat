<Title>fantastic iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased my new nano from the apple store today and this new model is absolutely amazing! The size is soooooooo small and light, absolutely amazing! The screen is crystal clear with such high resolution.  The only complaint I have is there is just a tiny bit of "lag" as you scroll around and access the menu's and your music. Especially when browsing your music with "cover flow". Its a very minor issue and it's present in all the models I played with at the store.  This is definitely the best nano revision to date!

<Title>First iPod and I'm in love
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new to the world of Apple and am so happy this is my first experience with the company.  I was amazed at the high quality of video of the new iPod Nano.  It's so clear and sharp.  The only problem I had with it so far was that it froze once in the two days I had it.  I held down the Menu and Center button down together for about 8 seconds or so and the iPod reset itself.  After that, it continued to play well.  Will see how it operates in a few weeks from now.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just got my new nano a few days ago and i don't have any complaints except for the cover flow. i'm gonna need to spend a bit of time to get that organized so every single song is under an album cover, but it's not that important, it's more for show. also, the back is the polished stainless steel, so i put clear packaging tape on it (as a cheap cover) to prevent scratches since i just throw it in my backpack. i can't find any cases that i like, but it's only been out since September 5 this will have to do until i can get a hold of a clear plastic case. i love the large screen so i won't have to squint at the screen now (unlike what i had to do with the 1st and 2nd gen of nano)  i had a sansa before for a couple of months, but i got sick of that! i guess being stuck with my ipod mini for a couple of years got me so used to it. i gave the sansa to my boyfriend and just bought the new nano! i fell in love with it right when i saw it at the apple store and just bought it right there on the spot! it really is a great upgrade if you haven't gotten the 1st or 2nd generation nano.  if you're looking for an upgrade from previous (small) ipods, then this is  it! or you can save 100 bucks more for the iTouch or 50 bucks for the regular ipod.  wow people! stop complaining about the ipod nano not having a lot of storage space! it's a NANO! not a REGULAR ipod! it's a modified version of the big ipod! get it? and plus you should know the features on the product before you buy it. i don't have a 10,000 song library and movies and videos to store on a device, but if you do then get the regular ipod. so the nano is perfect for someone who just wants some on the run music.  i was a little surprised that they changed some of the colors from the neon colors to the more "calm" colors. but if all else fails, just get the black one. i got the red one to donate 10 bucks to fight aids in africa.

<Title>Awesome Nano with added Video!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the blue Nano 8 GB 3rd generation Ipod this past Saturday at the Apple Store.  It did freeze up on me once but if you read the owners manual on [...], it tells you how to reset it.  I did as they instructed and it was working normally again.  It kept everything in memory and did not erase anything.  The video function is awesome!  You quickly forget you're watching on a 2 inch screen as the screen is so sharp, bright and clear.  Cover flow is so cool, although a bit slow but nevertheless it is a nice added feature.  Some album covers do not load in Itunes so will not download to your player properly.  This might be a glitch that Apple may address in a future software download patch (I hope).  If you are looking to purchase a Nano, I highly recommend the new third generation over the second, simply because of the added video feature and twice the memory for your money.  It is definitely worth it for the added memory alone.  Overall, more bang for your buck and a nice new cool look and interface, with an all metal construction.

<Title>I did shy away from Apple, now I came back...
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I previously owned a gen 5 iPod with 60 gig...I love it until the headphone jack went out, so I tried to fix it myself since I had it for good two years and didn't want to send it to Apple for half of what I had to pay for in the first place.  So I gave up iPod cold turkey, even when they came out with the 80 gig and 160 gig iPod, I never looked back...I also looked at other music players, they didn't feel the same...until I saw the new iPod Nano...so I ordered one as soon as possible, and yes I do have one already (ordered it straight from Apple).  It's more compact, I love the click wheel, great for people on the move, 8 gig is enough for people like me, new user interface, and the best thing about the new Nano is the video capabilities...for me it's no big deal, it's not my primary source for video playback, but it's just cool to have that feature...

<Title>Nano's keep getting better
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Nano is a nice improvement from the previous generation. The screen is big and bright, the battery life is excellent, and the music sounds good.  The video feature is nice to have, though 8 gigs and the small screen are not conducive to watching feature length movies or even TV shows. I use this feature to keep a few 1-2 minute videos of family and friends to watch now and then on the train to/from work. Plus, the new size makes it fit easily in the credit card slot of my wallet.  Also, this nano syncs nicely with Microsoft Outlook so I can quickly look up a phone number.  I give it four stars instead of five because of what I consider a design flaw--the headphone jack is on the bottom. This means that using the Nano at the gym on any of the aerobic machines requires either placing it on its side or upside down.

<Title>Too Cool Fool
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just picked mine up from CC bought it online and picked it up in the store. They didnt even have these out on the floor yet. This thing is great. Its syncs nicely and the screen is crisp and clear. I have a few tv epiosdes on here and about 300-400 songs and 100 or so pictures and about 7 movie previews from apple which is too cool. I still have 6.8 gigs of free space. The size is incredible its so small. The coverflow thing is cool even though it couldnt find some of the album covers from albums I ripped but thats a small price to pay as far as I am concerned. For the money its great and I dont need 80 gigs so this will work just fine for me.

<Title>3rd Generation Nano Freezes often (similar to the 2nd generation)
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a video iPod, and have owned previous generation iPods, all of which I have found to be excellent products. I just recently purchased my first Nano (the new 3rd generation) and love the looks, size, functions etc.- a potential excellent product. However, I noticed that my new Nano often completely freezes up; always after syncing; sometimes while charging; and sometimes while just changing songs, going to the menu, etc. The only way I found to unfreeze the player is to do a hard reset. This is quite an inconvenience and totally unacceptable. I thought maybe I had bought a lemon and would simply return the product for a working replacement. However, after some research, I have learned that this was and is a common problem with the 2nd generation Nano. I haven't found much information regarding this issue from others who purchased the 3rd generation - most likely because it was just released a week ago. I plan to return the product and wait until the problem has been corrected. Once this is done, I will only have wonderful things to say about the 3rd generation Nano.

<Content>It is exactly what I wanted. Priced little bit more, but it is worth the money.   I am already feeling that I bought this at the end of 3Gen era, cuz new iPhones and iPod touch has come up now with huge memory.  Getting a feeling that I should have gone for them with little additional money rather than this nano.   Anyhow, I liked nano 3G. It is compact, light weight, clear sound, bright picture and Videos.  And, I can synchronize my Calendar and Contacts from my Outlook too.  I have subscibed to Podcast, and audio books, I liked to listen to it while I am driving.

My JVC car deck controls the i-Pod via a convertor. 12 hours, 160+ songs at CD quality sound and it's flash drive, easily reloaded from i-Tunes. My shuffle does fine MP3 with headphones while hiking- I can't complain. Nicely done on both products.

<Content>This product is good. It acted weird after the first week I had it. The images were all scratchy and then it wouldn't play my music for some reason. Anyway, I turned it back on after a couple of days and it just went back to normal. I don't know what happened, but it hasn't given me problems since then (about 3 weeks later). Then again, I had bought a used one...maybe spending an extra $20 or so to get a new one would be worth it!?

<Content>This was an upgrade for my daughter from her Zen Nano Plus.  The Zen Nano worked very well and has been very durable so I'm not knocking it (actually, I'm inheriting it).  However, this IPOD appears to have many features that allow greater flexibility and control.  It has been much easier to download music to as well.  I hope it will prove to be durable as well.

<Title>A very good product!!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own black Ipod Nano, my first impressions are very positive.  My biggest concern before buying were colors and sound quality, this is my first ipod. I bought black ipod because I didn't like how silver looked like and wasn't sure about other colors. This black I didn't like at first but I'm getting used to and beginning to like it. Its is not glossy and shiny black like other apple products. Under normal light, it turns to gray black(lighter shade of black).  My advice is go to Best Buy or other stores that carry these nanos and check them out in person before you buy them online, if you're buying online.  Sound quality is good, more towards average. I have owned other and cheaper mp3 players, the sound quality of nano is not any better, about in the middle I would say. Its very good, but in comparison to some other cheaper players, Nano doesn't stand out at all. But this is just my experience.   I have known this before I bought it, so I bought it for couple other reasons. I was already using itunes software, and you can't beat reliability and build quality of these nanos. Just go to store, other SMALL flash players look like bricks compared to nano. And itunes software is pretty good when it comes to syncing your nano, I have used others.  I experienced one issue though, my nano froze. Just like Microsoft Windows would freeze, so did my nano. No problem, just press Menu + Select buttons to restart the nano. So far I only experienced this once, other then that, I'm very pleased with nano's performance. It's a great buy! Some people don't like new shape of this nano, but personally I think its better than older nano's. It fits into my pocket nicely.

<Content>Ok, I'm in my mid 30's and this is my first ipod I have ever bought.  I figured instead of all hundreds of CD's I have I would get an ipod and download them all and get a plug to plug them into my car.  Well, I don't have the plug yet for my car and I just got the ipod in the mail yesterday.  So I download itunes and put in some CD's and even bought a few songs but everytime I wanted to add new songs it seemed like I had to sync them all over again.  Am I going to have to do that whenever I add any new songs??

<Title>My First iPod!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first iPod ever.  Before this, I owned the Archos Jukebox 2000 which holds 20GB.  This 8gb Nano blows that other heavy hunk of junk away.  The nano is quiet, small, thin, lightweight, plays everything seamlessly, and is a breeze to use.  If you're buying your first MP3 player ever, I definitely recommend the Nano.  It is really worth every bit of the 199 I paid for it.  The screen is beautiful.  It's very bright and crisp.  Cover flow is awesome, although I don't use the cover flow as much as I use the "artist" listings.    Compared to the 2G nano, the new 3G nano has it beaten hands down.  3.5mm thin!  I mean, if you carry it in your pocket, you can hardly tell it's in there.    I really bought the new Nano to occupy me until the Touch comes out and it's doing just that.  I'm plenty occupied and satisfied!  BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT IPOD WITH GREAT FEATURES FOR THE MONEY!

<Title>Buyer beware: output to TV is now disabled... otherwise great iPod!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned two models of the 5.5G video iPods (the 30 and the 60GB models) and have been very pleased with them. I'm a teacher, and I use them for playing videos in class--so much better than DVDs! I was tickled pink when I heard that the new solid-state flash-based nano would include video; I bought it the first week because the school year was starting.  Well, I bought too soon. It seems that without disclosing the change to customers, Apple has locked the "TV Out" feature, preventing users from outputting iPod content to their TV sets. When you go to the Videos > Settings menu and bring up the "TV Out" option, toggling it on/off is now unresponsive, showing only the word "off." When locked, video content will display on the iPod's screen, but not on your TV or portable display accessory.  According to the guys on the tech support line, the only way to turn this feature on is if you connect your iPod to a device with an "Apple authentication chip" built in, or buy the soon-to-be-available Apple video cables that will work with the new iPods and will sell for a shocking $49, plus shipping and tax.  Quite a blow to this long-time hardcore Apple fan and defender. It strikes me as underhanded. Perhaps if they had made it clear in the pitch that a $50 cable would be required to play to TV, I would have still made the same choice, but as it is, I feel, you know, tricked.  That issue aside, the nano is as cute as a button, and the little screen looks great. I will refresh this review in a few weeks when I have had a chance to put it through the paces.

<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had all 3 nano versions from the 1st to the 3rd (current) generation. This new nano is incredible. I mean 8 gigabytes for only $199 with high resolution video and new user interface. It's very bright, thin and weighs only 1.76 ounces. The screen is 2" which is small for viewing long periods of video but for short stretches like 30 minutes its great. Battery life is awesome too. Only small downside is that it doesn't fit into the small little blue jean pockets any more since its wider but who cares? Definately worth it.

<Content>My 4th generation 20 GB took a dive the day before this was released.  I love the new Nano.  The size is well, very small.   The display is great, photos look good, haven't tried video yet.   Menu is almost exactly like my old ipod they just added video, and photos.   The cover flow feature?  WHO CARES! Its a music player.   I'd say the only downer is if you have an older Mac you'll have to updrade to OS X 10.4.8, I had to buy the newer OS and 10.4.8 is not much diffrent from what I had (10.3.9).  It's wierd there must be some integration of the newer OS into the new version of iTunes.

<Title>Great small Ipod, well worth the video
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nano came with a cradle adaptor, not so good earbuds that you should immediately upgrade, and the USB iPod cable, all bundled together.  The dimensions of the new video iPod Nano vary that much from the old one. The unit measures 2.8 by 2.1 by 0.3 inches, with rounded edges and a a very nice brushed metallic finish  I think the look is great and like it far more than I expected.   Cover Flow was not great on the nano. Not much CPUs to push the graphics but good enough for the size and gave a very nice color view of all my music.  Amazon would not ship the nano to my APO address in Afghanistan but I sent it to my APOBox.com address and Amazon was able to ship it fine.  I almost went for the Touch, but did not want to wait and its smaller size is better at the gym.

<Title>Still some bugs....
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this a week after it came out, and any smart buyer will tell you not to buy the first wave of new items, especially on electronics. Apple are still the kings of digital music, yet even they couldn't get ALL the bugs out at first. Here's my reviews...  1) The thing I liked about the 2nd gen. was the casing. Full aluminum, so very little chance for scratches. This reverts back to the 1st gen nano style, yet with an aluminum front. why not go all aluminum? 3 stars  2) Video playback is awesome. The larger screen is an improvement, and it is much sharper. 4 stars  3) The backlight can now be adjusted, and can be brighter or duller. 4 stars  4) The cover flow is awesome, yet if you have a lot of music, the album covers take a little time to load. 3 stars  5) The player tends to freeze a little after extensive use. This can be esily rectifeid by resetting it. 3 stars  6) The price is great. I paid 200 for my 4 gig nano, and 200 for an 8 gig nano video. 5 stars  7) Transferring files seems to go faster. 4 stars.  Over all, 4 star review. This is based on personal experience after only a few days, and even with the few gripes, I am still very satisfied.

<Title>An improvement in every way
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Video Nano has improved in every facet over the second generation Nano. As you know, the interface has Cover Flow, the display has increased pixel resolution, and the video is a welcome addition. Lastly, unknown to the public, the audio quality has improved.  The reason I give the Video Nano four stars and not five is because the improvement in audio quality is not significant enough. There is background hiss, and the second generation Nano's audio clarity was poor to begin with.   As you know, the product is excellent. However, it is NOT outstanding. Apple should focus on the basics of what makes an MP3 player outstanding. Its ability to play MUSIC for an audiophile's ears should be present, considering this Nano is the third generation of this line. Sometimes when Apple crams so much functionality into one device, it's possible to forget what is being bought in the first place. One reviewer mentioned that the iCar will be next. How about the iPhone/Fax/Microwave/Coffeebrewer?

I like the design, it's very small and light easy to carry...wonderful product from Apple....just one more thing....they should give more thing inside the product...because it a little expensive that we have to pay extra money to buy armband and something else.

<Content>I guess my review is kind of tainted because our ipod was defective.  It froze up all the time and we had to send it back.  The return process gets 5 stars from me though, as it was very easy and painless.  Disappointing also, was the fact that we lost all of our downloads which was worth $25 or so.

<Title>Incredible piece of technology!
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered this iPod for my fiance for Christmas through Amazon, who distributed it from J&R Music World.   First, as usual, Amazon made sure the shipping/billing process was easy and fast. As for the iPod Nano itself...this thing really is a remarkable piece of equipment.  I had held off on buying one of these, because I felt the exclusion of video was a bad move.  After having bought a Sansa MP3 player last year which did have video, I thought it was better than the 2nd generation Nano...which it was...until it crapped out on us. Then, the 3rd generation Nano comes out, with video, and I was sold.  The video quality on this is really quite amazing.  For the small size of the Nano itself, the screen is a very nice size, and it's super clear, bright and produces excellent color.    The audio quality is pretty much what's expected of a portable MP3 player, which is good, but won't blow you away.  The only reason(s) I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the Sansa had FM radio and a record option that would record both radio broadcast, as well as using the built-in microphone to record speech, or other sounds.  Why the 3rd generation Nano doesn't include this can only be for one reason...so we buy the 4th or 5th generation Nano. Pretty lame of Apple to prey on their huge consumer base like this...but other than that, it's a great product, and nobody builds MP3 players with the same quality as Apple. Just pick the thing up in your hands, and you can tell this is not cheaply made...it just feels nice in the hand.  It's also small enough that you can use if for exercise and never even realize you're wearing it.  Bottom line...if you're going to buy an MP3 player, either as a gift or for yourself, don't try to get cute and think other brands are going to offer a better product for less money.  I found out the hard way that Apple really is the definitive product in the MP3 field.

<Title>Another great iPod product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Apple keeps improving on their incredibly popular iPod line.  The 3rd generation Nano is smaller, has more capacity and now comes in a variety of colors.  Features, mechanics, and sound quality are the same as it's predecessor.  We'll have to see how battery longevity holds up.  This has been an issue for Apple in the past, and was the subject matter of a class action law suit that enriched a bunch of lawyers but didn't do much for the legions of iPod owners out there (including me).  Anyway, make sure you get a case when you purchase your iPod.  Every iPod I've ever had seems to scratch way too easily (like from looking at it the wrong way--LOL).  Software called MediaWidget (for Windows users) will help you do things with your iTunes library you will eventually have to, or want to do, for under $20.  This is all perfectly legal and legitimate stuff that iTunes is designed to preclude for whatever reason.    The 3rd generation Nano is the best product of its type.  The only concern I have is battery longevity, but only time will tell.

<Title>Excellent  iPod...Quality Product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Purchased this iPod right after Christmas, and have been enjoying it ever since it arrived. As someone who often commutes by subway train often, I normally like to listen to music while I am on the go. This iPod was very easy to set up, and I was able to download all of the music from my iTunes account onto my iPod quickly and easily. What I love about it the storage capacity....I have about 1300 songs on it at the moment, which is only about 4.6 GB of the 8 GB total....So, as you can see, it holds a lot of music... I also like the fact that you can store a lot of different music play lists on it, that way you can leave all of your music stored on the device (unlike my old player). The controls are very easy to use, and you can adjust the equalizer if you like more bass...I tend to be quite fussy when it comes to quality, and am a person that would have no problem giving an item a poor rating if it deserved it. Based on this point, I can say that I am extremely satisfied with this product so far, and would highly recommend this iPod.

<Content>I have about 7 or 8 different mp3 players and a pair of Bose earphones.  So I have knowledge on different features and sound quality. Although I really like the size of the Nano, I'm not impressed with the sound quality.  I've changed the equalizer and sound settings, but it doesn't seem to help much.  My Creative Zen Vision M (although bigger and heavier) blows this Nano away in terms of sound and clarity.

<Content>This is my first iPod.  I recently gave up on Creative MP3 players because I have had bad luck with the ones I tried.  So with my refund money I bought the iPod nano.  I love it!!  It is so easy to use, way easier (and faster) then the Zen.  I really like what they did with the cover flow.  I like to see the covers of all of my CDs I import. The screen is so bright and it is easy to watch a tv show on it.  The biggest change for me is having to use iTunes.  I would rather use Rhapsody, which is what I have been using forever.  But the sound quality, picture, and design of this iPod is amazing.

<Title>Apple improves the Nano and delivers an enjoyable player.
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's new nano is designed to improve upon the past models and add some functionality.  The improved video, smaller thinner body and updated firmware are enough to make it stand out.  The slighly lower price tag is also sure to help sell more units.    Pros  - Small size - so thin!!!! - Nice design - shorter, fatter form factor for more reliability   - Many color options - Silver, blue, green, black, etc. - Brighter screen with better contrast than previous generation - Great video option is a nice to have for sample TV shows, clips, etc - Very nice size option of 8GB for a video capable media player - Works with most traditional iPod accessories (except old A/V cable) - Slightly lower price tag than 2nd Generation nano - Unlike iPod classic, all flash memory means less failures and breakage - Flash memory also awesome for running / working out - Slightly better sound quality than 2nd generation - Apple reputation is highly deserved  Cons  - New design not ideal for very big hands due to smaller click wheel - Universal dock now required for video out (no more A/V cable) - Slightly shorter battery life than other iPods - No expandability or SD card slot like Sansa View or Creative Zen - iTunes software with limited native formats (MP3, AAC) - Coverflow still buggy / slow - Competing products offer more capacity and features such as FM radio & built-in voice recording - Competing players now available at 16GB flash at similar size  The Looks  First the aesthetics.  Some people will prefer the gen2 nano's longer body with the larger click wheel.  Apple shortened the body in order to limit breaks due to the former generation flexing in people's pockets and bags.  The longer nano was prone to bend (and sometimes break) when people put them in their pocket and sat down or moved around.  Another change motivated by durability is the metal face.  The old clear composite face was a magnet for smudges and scratches.  The new brushed metal face holds up nicer.  Be warned though; it does chip and scratch some more, so get a cover.   Apple does lose some points for the smaller click-wheel being awkward.  It's a trade-off.  The Sound  Sound quality is not significantly improved from previous models.  The slight improvements touted in Apple's marketing are exagerated.  However, let's be fair to Apple here.  They are not alone when it comes to high cost MP3 players with only moderate fidelity sound.  Almost no MP3 players are actually designed for audiophiles / musicians / sound engineers; i.e., the people who could tell the difference between good sound and great sound.    Keep in mind also that MP3 is a compression technology that does experience quality loss.  Particularly, with a lower bitrate your MP3 files will lose more and more of the sound integrity from the original recording.  Combine that with the fact many people rip from CDs that are not digitally mastered, and you would get inferior sound quality with any device.  Features  Other than the changes in the body design, few new features are noteworthy with this device.  There are some changes in the components and software that do make the screen brighter and allow you to do more things, including watch videos and play games.  Some complain there isn't enough memory for video.  But you can still get enough on here for a cross-country flight.  It's a nice extra even if these nanos don't have tremendous memory.  The flash memory in this device could have been a higher speed.  However, the main advantages of the flash player are still here: less risk of hardware failure associated with a hard disk drive player (better for running or working out).  The device does seem to have a slighly shorter battery life than advertised.  Perhaps there is a trade-off with the shorter form factor.  Few users will notice this as they are still likely to get a day's worth of use from a full charge.  Apple's software is still a weakness with very limited direct control over your device library and few file options.  However, most users have limited needs and will not notice.  Apple hits the minimum compatibility needs of most of the market.  And all formats can be converted using iTunes or another software.  Coverflow is little more than a gimmick.  It's still buggy and covers tend to blank out if you scroll quickly.  Cover art has been downloaded with previous software versions and most other video players, so the ability to scroll covers is not really a breakthough.  Keep in mind that the iPod actually still has less features than most competitive devices.  It doesn't have a built-in FM radio tuner, voice recorder, bluetooth, WMA support, and an SD card expansion slot.  Both the Creative Zen<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a>, which is much thicker, and the Sansa View<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a>, which is taller, have those components built in.  Additionally, the Sansa View comes in a 16GB size for the same price as the 8GB nano.  Keep in mind that the Creative Zen has been somewhat buggy, and the View doesn't have as long a track record only being released in November 2007.  Still, what the iPod nano does, it does very well.  There's also a 4GB version for $50 less.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-5738987-0477421">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a>  Overall this device is an improvement.  Apple really wins with sleek design and a wealth of accessories.  This unit is no different.  While it is not perfect, none of the competition is good enough to overtake it any time soon.

<Title>Video was a great add!
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new iPod nano I think was one of the best iPods. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable mp3 players around, and they definitely made an improvement on this one. The best add to the nano I think was the feature to be able to play video. It has a nice sized screen, which is larger than the previous one. The 8 gig hard drive is not that bad considering how small it is. I did buy a case and a couple of accessories to go with it since I didn't pay for my iPod nano. And BTW those wondering how I got it just go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1 Saw it on G4TV and it works that's all I have to say. I definately like the new interface they have for the iPod nano, overall this is pretty much the most reliable iPod.

<Title>Ipod Nano Review
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Looking at the reviews for this new Apple product, it seems like there are more good reviews than bad. I think there is a reson for that. Apple's philosophy is that is you are going to make software, you should also make hardware to run it and quite frankly I am amazed at what you get in this product for the rpice you pay.      I was pleasantly surprised to see that not only has the outward appearance of this product changed, which I find to be a very stylish form factor, but the menu system and firmware have had some incredible improvements. I think anyone who buys this product and states that Apple is out to get them or their money is an idiot. They certainly can find out all about this thing well before it comes out if they really wanted to and some people are never happy. In this product you get a beautiful well engineered mp3 player that is well thought out. Beautiful menus and features and a super easy interface. In an MP3 player I want simplicity. I want to not be able to screw with the file system. After I'm buying an MP3 player and not a swiss army knife.       Most of the other brands out there may do more or less than the Nano does or the Ipod in general, but it does not do it as well as the Ipod nor as nicely. Everytime I have ever bought an Ipod, I have always thought I had something of quality in my hand and the sales figures prove that year after year beacuse people keep buying them. So the people who put down this product are idiots because every electronic gadget will have its quirks and limitations at one point or another. Apple products are no different. I think the Ipod and especially this new Nano make listening to music so much fun. Thank you Apple!

<Title>Great devise but has some useless features
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great unit with good sound and easy to use.  But the video function is somewhat useless with the tiny little screen.  You have to spend at least another $49 to get the cable to show it on your TV (I have not bought one to validate that the cable will do the trick).  Memory too small for video anyway.  Also the cover flow comes on automatically and is an annoyance when you are trying to do something else (like set the volume).  But if you thought the old nano was a good deal, this is great.  Smaller screen with no video to make the devise like an 8GB shuffle (with a smaller screen showing the song, etc.) and would really be great.

It has games.  I was going to get the iPod touch, I would of had twice the memory.  With the video problems with the screen.  I decided to give the Nano a look.  I was amazed by the video quality. (I am not real critical on things like that)  People might differ and say that it is not so good but I think it is.  The games are realy fun I really like vortex.  I justed purchased tetris.  It even has a stopwatch. My only complaint is the controls are hard to use for the games. that is why I only gave it four stars.  I am so glad I went with the Nano instead.  I waited for years for Apple to come out with something like this.  the iPod being fat and small does not bother me at all.  The wait is finally over.  If you have not already bought this go out and buy this already.

<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My involvement with Ipods goes back to Generation 2. The Nano it replaced was quite satisfactory...but I need to upgrade my toys. IMHO this one was definately worth it. Thickness compared to it's predecessor is a push. It is far shorter, but wider. Fits perfectly in the hand. The screen is much larger, similiar operator interface, but new software that is an upgrade from the 7.4 used with the previous version. Very bright screen...vidid colors. Also shows an album cover (if applicable). All in all, I deem it quite an improvement. I believe battery life is longer also. Only downside (if you can call it that) was the VERY tight fit of the cable when disconnecting. Some may enjoy the larger screen and download photos. I will not. My use of the Nano is exclusively music. Bottom line - If you have enjoyed previous Ipods, you will love this one.

<Title>The second generation Ipod would have done the job just as well...
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It seems like, only a few months ago, Apple had just come out with the brand spanking new second generation of Ipod era. Despite this realization, yet again, Apple whips out its new and improved third generation of MP3 players. Most of us would probably see this as a money making scheme created by Apple in which they give the iPod a new look and few minor adjustments, and expect customers to willingly spend an extra 200 plus dollars for a "sleeker" version of what they already have. I, myself, fell for the iPod uproar and, despite fact that my present iPod nano was barely 5 months old, I purchased the new third generation iPod nano without a second thought. But is it really all that better from the previous one?  If you're looking for better quality as far as engineering, I see no noticeable difference here. Now, if you're all about the kicks that come with appearance and graphic design, you have come to the right place. The new look is no doubt eye catching and a complete contrast to the previous nano, and the addition of cover flow adds for a more colorful music surfing experience. I find the new movie viewing feature on the nanos to be quite unnecessary.  If you want to watch movies on your iPod, then I would suggest the iPod classic which has much more memory. A single movie takes up a good portion of the space on a 8GB iPod and that can subtract a lot from music space. If you're content with whatever iPod you have, don't waste your money. The quality is just the same. You just won't be as hip as everyone else.

It is extremely small, but still holds a lot and displays a very good picture/video.  It is substantially smaller than the 80 GB video IPOD that I have.   That is great for her.  It wouldn't be quite as good for me as it is a bit harder to use for one with very large hands.  In spite of that, this is a great deal.  It is relatively inexpensive, but has a lot of great features.    Highly recommended (except for people with big hands).  
<Overall>5
