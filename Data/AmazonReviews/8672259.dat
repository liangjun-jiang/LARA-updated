<Title>Very nice mp3 player!

<Content>Allright, the number one thing this mp3 player has is sound quality.  It's equalizer settings are phenominal, expecially the rock setting...  I have used several mp3 players in the past and this is the only one that has had sound quality up to my expectations.    The radio is excellent, it captures all the stations that are in range and plays them with amazing clarity, it's much better than the one in my car lol...  I love it's looks and light weight.  The cap comes off to reviel a usb connector, so you don't need to carry around a cable to plug it into a computer like most mp3 players.  Voice recording quality is very high compared to most mp3 players.  The battery life is extremely high, just one triple A lasts me a month.  It comes with a free AAA battery.  Things I don't like: 1. Equalizer is hard to get to from radio mode. 2. Headphones must be replaced, they have extremely poor sound quality. (Koss headphones have the best quality and I reccomend them highly) 3. Menu button is enter and the skip buttons are up and down, instead of the intuitive play button and volume buttons. 4. Equalizer is not custom, this is something that has not really hit the mp3 player market much yet, so I would not worry about it.  Unless you have the cash for the scandisk sansa.  These are all very minor complaints, if I could make the choice again, I would still pick this mp3 player.       
<Overall>5
