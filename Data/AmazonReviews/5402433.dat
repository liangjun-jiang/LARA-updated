<Content>This little player is just what we wanted. It recharges at the computer, so I am not buying batteries everyday. The download software is user friendly and my kids figured it out on their own. We are very satisfied with our Zen player and thinking of getting another.

<Title>Bad News
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Deceptive  I bought this MP3 player because the Creative Web site promised "Easy Transfer -- Simple drag and drop your data files between ZEN V and your computer.  No complicated or messy driver installations necessary."  However this does not seem to be the case.  I love Creative's MP3 Muvo player.  No software needed to load that player up with MP3s.  The Muvo shows up as a USB mass storage drive, so one just has to drag and drop his MP3s and data to the Muvo, using nothing more than Windows Explorer -- just like any other thumbdrive.  I researched the Zen V first on Creative's site, and the language implies that loading the Zen V was as simple as loading the Muvo or any thumbdrive.  However, one apparently does need software to load the Creative Zen V.  Moreover, apparently one also needs an Internet connection to install the software.  Why do I need to go to the Internet when all I want to do is load this MP3 player with my music and images?  I tried to install the software, but it wouldn't install after I told Zone Alarm not to allow the  install software to go to the Internet.    There is no language on the outside of the box that says you need to install software to use the player, or that you need an Internet connection.    I attached the unit to my computer via the USB connection to see if it would show up as a USB mass storage device, and it did not.  The "Play for Sure" icon on the back was sticker out; apparently Creative had second thoughts after they put out the product, and decided not to support that function.  Moreover, the player will not work in Windows 2000 (though it does say you need Windows XP on the box).  I also suspect that the Creative software might be phoning home, and telling the mothership what you are listening to. I see no other urgent need to go to the Internet, unless I make that decision myself.  In short, the packaging and the product is deceptive. Which is really too bad because I love the Muvo, and was eyeing the larger Zen Vision: M model.  Now I'm going to have to reconsider the Archos solutions.

<Title>Very Pleased with Zen V
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zen V about a month and so far I love it. I have downloaded books from netlibrary without a hitch. Copying books from CD's and then transferring has been more of a challenge due to each track needing to be edited manually. It bookmarks great and does remember where you left off after shutdown as long as it isn't on pause. Not sure why that is but I learned that fairly quickly. I am still learning all the extra features, but I recommend it if you want to do audiobooks.

<Title>Great, cheap, and simple to use!
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would highly recommend this player as an alternative to an Ipod.  It's much cheaper, is easy to use, and is small. I wasn't looking for an mp3 player to do my dishes, laundry, and cook for me like many of you who post reviews on this product seem to want.  This player holds hundreds of songs(who needs more on at a time?), and plays a high quality sound.

<Title>Very disappointing
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I returned this item right after I bought it.  I own two Ipods already and wanted to buy another MP3 player for the kids.  I figured I'd try another product and the price was right, but you get what you pay for.  I followed the instructions, connected the player, the device was recognized by my computer only intermittently.  The device also froze up and had to be reset.  The software would freeze up when running and crash as well.  I went to Creative's website, tried their troubleshooting help to no avail.  After a couple of frustrating hours, I've given up.  Too much effort.  I'm buying the new Nano....

<Title>GOOD little PLAYER
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Many of the negatives written about the Zen are true.  It does lock up (esp if you try to scroll too fast), you DO have to install software on your computer and learn how to use it (duh), and it's not quite as sexy as the brand name iPod, but I think for it's particular market niche it is a good little player and stands up well against the Apple products.  I for one LOVE my little Zen.  (note: resetting the Zen is easy, installing/learning the software was not difficult, and for the $200+ price tag of an iPod, I can live with the loss of prestige).       The keyword here is "little".   It is truly small (about the size of my car alarm remote) and of negligible weight, so I can comfortably and securely wear it around my neck like a necklace without special cases, pouches, armbands, or pockets built into my jacket or backpack (though all of these accessories are available for those that feel a need for them).  Because of this compact, lightweight design, I tend to carry ("wear") my Zen more often than other players and so it has become my favourite.     Secondly, the fact that it is inexpensive (I won't say "cheap") is actually a big plus for me because I am not constantly afraid of damaging it as I would be a more expensive player.   I tend to "wear" my Zen through some rugged use (workouts, hiking, traveling, skiing, etc) and it has held up perfectly so far (!), but I am not over-worried about it.  I don't use mine for audio books, so I can't speak to the "bookmarking" problem.  I mainly enjoy a large collection of my favourite music which can be nicely categorized into handy playlists, like an energetic workout list, a mellow relaxing list, by music genre, by artist, or even play an entire "album" in it's original order.  I love this feature because I can rock out when I want to, or play some quiet background pop when my Mom is in the car... LOL.  The Zen has brought a lot of additional joy to my life, hearing my favourite music, esp when sitting around waiting or traveling long distances.  Battery life is impressive.  I've gone on entire 3-day weekend trips without it quitting on me.  It charges from any USB port (cord included) and has an optional car adapter (an after market NECESSITY).     With a few minor accessories (a USB power cord, a car power adapter cord, a car "cassette" adapter, a protective silicone shell, waterproof earbuds), I have tricked my Zen out to fit very well into my life and my uses.  Perhaps I am just not a demanding customer, but I think that the Zen is a very nice little player for an excellent price.  I am very happy with mine and I would confidentally recommend it.

<Content>dont waste your money on an ipod.  the zen is really easy to use and i use limewire to download music so i didnt spend any extra money on buying music. The battery lasts a long time too which is nice, once you charge it completely the first time you only have to charge it about once every week and a half, depending on how often you use it. Its also really small and light it almost disappears in your hand, but the screen looks awesome for such a small device.  Also, fyi creative actually sued apple in 2006 for infringement of the zen patent, the case was settled for $612 million

<Title>Great player for the money
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This a a great player for a new user.  Once I learned how to navigate, I've had very few problems. The screen shows more than other players of equal size.   This device supports books from Audible, which is my primary use, although I have some albums and pictures.  This little 1GB can hold a large book, six albums, and about 20 pictures.  The screen shows the length of a downloaded book, how much time you've listened to and how much time is left.  You can use the joystick to move forward and back within the book.  This device is also supported by my public library, and I can download some books for free. If you shut down the player while a book is playing the unit will usually return to where you left off, and the bookmarking feature offers additional protection.  The unit has frozen several times when I was attempting to navigate too fast, but I've discovered that the earring post I'm always wearing becomes a great way to reset the player.   It is incredible to have an entire book in my purse!  Great little player for the money.

<Title>Three week lifespan
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had some concerns proir to purchasing this after reading reviews on the Amazon, NewEgg and other websites.  It appears you've got a 50-50 chance of getting a good one.  I took a chance and got the lemon.  I lost all confidence when I finally got though to the RCA techies, and their response was "yeah, these have issues, not really sure why".    Having to carry around a toothpick to reboot this everytime it freezes is not my idea of a quality product.  Not that I use this often, maybe an hour a day, if that but when the backlight gave out, it was time to send back.  Kudos to Amazon's return policy and I'll take the refund to purchase something else.

<Title>Very good if...
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had one of these for about a year before my little brother yanked it down from the desk and righit onto hard wood, it still worked, but the screen died, and i didnt feel like replacing it, so i just got something else. But like I said, if youve ever used an iPod or iTunes, you know that their very easy to use, and Creative isnt quite as good but their catching up. Now they may be harder to use (for the first week until you get used to them) but Creative PACKS this thing with tons of extra stuff, im too lazy to list them, but i would definately buy this over an iPod nano if you know how to work, and figure out how to use things well, but if you just want something siple to use, and iPod might be better, but if you just want to play music (and not use the extra features on the Zen V) then its a pretty simple music player.

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0691807-1803628">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Title>Price is right!
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Small, slick and sporty lookin. Included accessaries make the complete package a nice deal. Battery life is decent varying based on volume setting and so forth during usage. Headphones are superb quality and gets the job done well. I've gone jogging with it without any additional protection case and no issues of any kind. It flies all about connected to the lanyard around my neck and no pauses or skipping (of course its a flash drive) and is sturdy enough to take on the beating against my chest.   The screen is also nice size. An affiliate of mine was quite impressed by it, even though he has a Ipod Nano 1gb. The Zen V  has a slightly bigger screen than the Nano, but is thicker in size/bulk. Even though thinner the Nano is freaken much longer. Also the tiny navigation joystick may be a nuissance to some with huge thumbs/fingers. I accidently always press down on the joystick thingy.  If you intend to dump a huge library of songs into it, might want to think of the bigger size models. I haven't even thought about putting pictures in it due to storage space limitations.  Overall this player appeases me enough for the intention I bought it for. Wouldn't hesitate to buy another one for family or friends in need of a portable MP3 player.

<Title>Don't Buy This!
<Date>Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!     I bought the 2 GB model because it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with the Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. The 1 GB version is identical except for the amount of installed flash memory.  Why did I choose to buy a flash memory based MP3 player? Compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.  I bought two of the players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.  At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.  The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.  This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.  Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.  The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.  The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.  I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.  The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.  Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.  Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.  It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.  If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from sites like Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.  You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary and Audible) that make these available, to your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.  Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Title>Nice gadget But...
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to listen to audio books downloaded from my public library. They use overdrive media console which is not compatible with an Ipod.   I already own an Ipod shuffle and find the Ipod software much easier to use.  The software packaged with the ZEN is confusing... It installed several programs and icons and took over some of my existing media players.  After I sorted all the programs out, down loading an audio book worked... However You can't read the screen in bright sunlight!   Since I bought this gadget to listen to audio books while I baked in the sun it was useless!  Next I tried to listen to the books in bed... As I started to doze off, I thought I'd place a bookmark. The Zen software is tough to navigate... I had to get out of bed and get the manual to figure out the book marking feature... Aggravating!  Several times when I tried to backup and listen to a passage again the ZEN Froze up necessitating a reset, there was no opportunity to place a bookmark. I was forced to listen to the same material over and over again... Quite maddening!  The music files sounded good... But, It won't read the music files that I already had on my computer for my shuffle, so if I want to add some music I need to duplicate my efforts. It's a cool gadget if you have nothing else, but after using the Ipod software it was a disappointment.

<Title>smaller than I thought and easy to use
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my zen v and was surprised how tiny it is. It is much smaller than you might think. It's light and easy to use. I found the new joy stick to be a great idea. I didn't have any problems and I dont have tiny fingers. This is an easy player to use and is built beautifully. The quality is as good or better than iPod. I was going to get the zen v plus with video but I couldnt wait and am not that into video on a small player anyhow. The price is very low for these zen v players, especially considering that they are super high build quality. All you have to do is charge the player for a few hours before you mess around with it. So, I highly recommend this delightful player for ease of use and build quality. IMHO it's better than apple and much better than sandisk. You will be impressed. I also would like to stress that the joystick system on this player is easy to use and very simple to figure out. I have had nothing but a good experience using this. Read the manual on the cd if you can hold back from just trying to play with it to figure it out. Even though it doesnt have radio or a video function, the zen v has  a lot of options in its menu to mess around with. I am very impressed with the high quality creative is giving out along with low prices. The mp3 market has a lot of options now but the zen v plus is the best for my money. I have a lot of experience with MP3 players and this is the most impressive one yet for its size. Go to a store and check out how small it really is and how nice the player is put together and how easy the navigation is with the new joystick system. You will probably end up getting one. To be honest though, if you do check it out, you won't freak out how small it is when you get it in the mail like I did before seeing it,so flip a coin on that deal.Have fun!  I want to add some things here. First of all, I am not a creative fanboy. Secondly, I own a lot of mp3 players. Now back to the zen V. I've read a lot of bashing on this and I think it's just spin against Creative. First of all, I've had zero problems with this player. I also wanted to say the pictures are better on the screen than you might think from reading some of the reviews on the internet. Although the zen v has mainly gotten very high marks from the pro reviewers, they sometimes mention the controls as hard to use or Ive even seen one review that you cant "scroll". Well, if you hold the joystick you can lol. THey also sometimes say the picture quality isn't so great. Well,  I own a few others with picture capability and this is the best and clearest of them all!. I read about 15 reviews before I bought this little creampuff, and I have to laugh at how wrong even the few cons were.  I am not praising the zen v as the best overall small but feature filled mp3 player for any other reason than that it is. If you want video and a radio, get the v plus but the zen v is pretty darn cool. I dont even really need the pictures. I just wanted something nice. I own apples irivers, cowens, sandisks and other no name mp3 players. I am dead serious when I say this little gem is hot for good reason. Even the battery life is a little BETTER than they say it is, but if there is a slight negative its the battery life, but it's really not so bad as they say. If a new iPod came out this good, I would praise that too.  I have no love for any company that makes these little music players.  This one really deserves the praise, and the bashers will lose out as more people talk about how reliable and what a solid and nice looking sounding gem this player really is. Besides that i found out it has the latest chip powering it from Sigmatel, which runs around 200mhz. That is a powerful and award winning relatively expensive chip folks! THis is no cheapo player. From the outside to the inside its all top notch.

It's small, easy to use, looks awesome, the display is clear and I have no problems with transfering files to the player (what is often a problem with MP3-Players).   But the best thing is the sound quality. All my songs are in 192 k/bts and I have never had such a good sound as with this player and its earphones. It's amazing. The bass in Hip Hop songs, the guitar in rock songs - just perfect.  Buy this, I dougt you'll find a player as good as this one for just $80.

<Content>No Fm is built in. Furthermore, in order to change the battery you have to send the product to service, which binds you to the company with additional battery change costs.  I also found the menus complicated. You can check CNET for a detailed review. If you stil want to purchase, purchase the Zen V plus which includes radio.

<Title>Great Gift

<Content>I have now purchased as gifts 3 of the Zen V units. Great as a gift, especially with new low prices. I am a happy Zen M owner, but I'm tempted to buy one of these for myself.

<Content>player seems to work great, locks up once in a while when you are trying to go through things too fast.  but it is not a problem.
