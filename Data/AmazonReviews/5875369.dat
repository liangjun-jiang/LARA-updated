<Title>Good features at a bargain price.

<Content>I have used this unit for over five months now with no problems. The display is adequate and the navigation and use of features is pretty staight forward. I have no complaint with the sound; there are several preset equalizer selections. It has a FM radio tuner, which is a nice plus - although as you might suspect the reception is only fair and requires a strong signal.   You can also record FM programming.  The 791 also has a built in microphone and does a reasonable job of voice recording. The SD slot brings storage capacity up to 4GB. Relative to any comparable product you get more than you pay for.  Buy one.
