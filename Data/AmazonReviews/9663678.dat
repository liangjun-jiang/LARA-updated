<Content>Review from wadjus (wadjus@voila.fr):  The quality of sound and image of the cowon Q5W are simply magnificent, the device supports many audios and videos formats what is practical and nice, the menus are rather intuitive and we meet ourselves there well, there is what is needed in the box and it is indeed. I think that it's one of better PMP of moment! It's really great!!!

<Product Name>COWON Q5W 60GB Dark Navy
<Title>I'm unable to find any deficiencies!

<Content>I have owned a variety of mp3 players over the years, and therefore am not a newcomer to the field. I had good experience with the Creative Zen Extra, but when my player was "borrowed," I decided to add video to my options. I had replaced my wife's Phillips mp3 player with a Zune, which I regret, as both of these were clearly inadequate for our purposes. I embarked on an extensive "review of reviews" online, and the COWON kept coming up as being "too expensive, but worth it." So I got a Q5W.   Other than perpetual battery life, I cannot think of anything I would add to the Q5W. It has internal speakers which, considering the size, are actually as usable as those on my Sony laptop. Wireless works well, movies look good and play well, MP3 sounds good.   The unit is accessed via USB, and presents as a disk drive with numerous folders. The "drag and drop" works well. Accompanying software compresses videos adequately.   My wife and I both use MP3 players to listen to Audible.com audio productions. The Zune presents severe obstacles to such use, not the least of which it doesn't play the ".aa" files, and a laborious conversion to mp3 is necessary. Getting the files to play in the proper sequence is a headache. There is no direct access to the files on the player; it "synchronizes" with directories on the computer. Strangely enough, if I change the MP3 tags on a file, it keeps the old tags! It takes me hours to get an MP3 novel's files in the right order, using a playlist. But I digress. . .  None of the problems I have with the Zune occur with the Cowon. The "drag and drop" assures me that the files I want are on the player, and that there are no others. If I need to, I can directly modify the MP3 tags on the Cowon. The files play in alphabetical order based on the "title" MP3 tag (which I generally set as identical to the filename.)   The unit itself has a sturdy feel to it. The touch controls are easy to use, even with my large hands and wide fingers. Controls are properly labeled and generally intuitive.   Two notes: 1. download and install the latest firmware. It enables, among other things, the entry of the wireless WAP key.  2. The available screen protector's instructions are in Korean. If you don't read Korean, beware. I was unable to apply it without significant bubbles, and had to remove it. (This doesn't come with the unit; it's available elsewhere. The web site for it is entirely in Korean.)   I recommend the leather case (sold separately).   Now that my wife has taken it over, I'll have to get another one.
