<Title>Cute, but problematic
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the V Plus last month, but had to return it to Amazon.  I had the problem that seems to be common in several other reviews on CNET.  The software kept freezing in the middle of playback, and I could not do anything - restart song, go back, even turn the player off - without resetting, which requires a pin or paper clip.  Happened several times in the first week.  My files were never deleted, but it was a pain.  I was sad, but could not justify keeping it - I don't plan to carry a safety pin in my pocket when hiking.    It is too bad, there was a lot to like about the player - the small size was great, sound was pretty good with EQ adjustment and menus were easy to navigate.  I did not have much problem downloading files, and the bookmarking feature would have been nice to use since I listen to a lot of audiobooks (although I found bookmarking was not as easy to do as I thought anyway).   Sorry, Creative.  Hope the software/hardware issues will be improved in the next generation.

<Title>Tiny player that works well, is tough
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This does everything it supposed to do.  It sounds good.  It is very tough, I have dropped it several times - if this was a hard-drive based player I am sure it would be out of commission.  The software makes it easy to transfer files.  The controls are easy to use.  It has been problem free for 10 weeks.  The negatives are:  1. It charges too slow on the USB via the computer.  I bought the wall charger which works fine. 2. the ear foam comes off easily. 3. The on/off switch must be held down for about a second to work.

<Title>Really awesome player, but not that reliable
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned a 2GB V plus a couple of years ago.  It was awesome until the OLED screen died.  Creative like most other MP3 producers like Apple, San Disk, etc. do not have great warranties.  I would recommend purchasing Creative's extended warranty, offered through their website.  It extend coverage to parts and labor to 2 full years.  Besides the reliability issues, this is a really great player.  The one thing that I don't like is the FM tuner.  It doesn't work well, and I still don't understand how to preset stations.

<Title>Pleasantly Surprised
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a replacement for my trusty Rio Carbon(s) which died for the 2nd time (not sure if you can even get refurbs anymore).  I basically use the player for International travel and in the car for podcasts so it is not in constant use but I would guess it is getting used about 20 hours a month.   The capacity is about right for my usage and its solid state so you don't have the stability issues as I did with the disk based carbon.  So far I've had a lot of little pleasant surprises like the lanyard that allows me to hang this around my neck and listen to it while sleeping on the plane.  Another pleasant surprise was that the software seems to work with the IE proxy settings so I can download news at work through the firewall when I'm overseas which I really enjoy.  Its also nice and small which makes it convenient for travel, outdoor walks, etc.  The screen is big enough to watch an episode of nightly news but I wouldn't plan on much more than that.  Its hard to hold in place for a long period (because of the small size) and the video quality at this screen size is so so.  The audio quality is good but I confess that I'm not really an audiophile.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the software was pretty good.  I've lived through more than a few creative sound blaster driver disasters so I was worried about this.  It actually works well.  It is kind of clumsy in the windows vs itunes-monolith way but there's really only two programs that you end up using (an explorer extension and a podcast client).  The podcast is a big improvement over public domain software like ipodder in that it takes care of some of the tagging inconsistencies that used to drive me crazy on the Rio.  The pod/vidcasts will always end up in the same place on the player menu so you can find them.  The only complaint that I have so far is the way the UI triggers video conversion is really poorly handled (but it does work).  Finally the biggest downside is the documentation.  Its basically useless.  I will probably be spending the next few months discovering the features on my own.  All in all I am very happy with this player.  It is easily exceeding my expectations and the best part is that I didn't have to join the Apple fanboys club to have a quality MP3 player!

<Title>4 gb better sound
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not quite sure why creative doesn't just save some time and say the 4 gig sounds better than the 8 gig. Different codec or something. I've owned recording studios etc etc and listen to mp3's through a set of Sony mdr-v900's as they don't require alot of power to drive. Source is 192 kbs downloads from Yahoo music to go (which you can no longer get. Have to go with 160 kbs as best pay as you go). I'm suprisingly satisfied with the sound, having been spoiled for years with high end equipment. Unforunately I can hear he difference. But unless you're listening to a high end speaker system, ie b&w 801's w dual bryston 600w per speaker etc etc, 192 kbs seems to work.But hey, the 8 gig ain't near the 4 gig and I just wish they'd let me know to save me some time. My two cents worth -

<Title>Quite Nice!
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this thing for a few days, and so far I rather like it. It isn't perfect, of course. My main issue is that it won't automatically sort by only artist (you have to then go through album), or by folder. But using playlists pretty much fixes that. Also, I haven't been able to make any videos convert to its format yet, they're always stopped by some sort of error.  Otherwise this is a great little music player. It has a couple distinct advantages over the iPod (my previous mp3 player). First, you don't need ANY software at all to use it. With Windows XP it just installs itself once you plug it in, and you can drag and drop mp3 files to it with Windows Explorer. The software that comes with it is useful to make playlists and convert videos, but it isn't necessary to play mp3s.  Also, the joystick is nice. I find the iPod's touchpad very annoying, because it's so easy to accidentally touch (normally this suddenly raises the volume) that you ALWAYS need to keep the player on locked mode. This means that when you want to change a song you can't just reach into your pocket and push a button; you have to unlock, then carefully push forward without accidentally changing the volume (usually this involves having to take it out of the pocket), then lock again. Very annoying. The joystick on the Zen V Plus is a much better idea for a portable device. The joystick and buttons aren't too easily pushed, so lock mode is usually unnecessary.  Also, this player has a sound recorder with built-in mic, and an FM radio! Very nice.  The menus of this player are very easy to navigate, and (unlike a few players) it has buttons for volume so you don't need to go through menus to change it. It also has alot of storage space for the price.  In any case, having owned several different mp3 players (iPod, Sansa and BenQ), this is my favourite so far!

<Title>a quick death
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this as a gift from my wife just this past Christmas. It completely died mid-song while I was walking to the supermarket. And that was only the fourth or fifth time that I used it. Caveat emptor.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I shopped for a long time for a MP3 player and chose the Zen Plus V because it has the line-in record. This feature is excellent for capturing songs off old cassettes and the radio or internet sites. There is no need to use this for CDs if you have a PC since it is better to rip a CD on a PC and then load it to the Zen. The sync manager with cassettes does not separate the songs out if you just start the tape and let it play. So this is a short coming. It will separate the songs if you monitor it and stop it after each song. The sound quality for the Plus V is good. The toggle button is small as other viewers mention, but I have not found it to be a problem. I have had it lock up only one tiem on me. It was under very heavy recording usage at the time. I hit the reset button and everything restored correctly. I also bought the extended warranty because of the problems I read in the reviews with lockup. So far it has not been much of an issue. I would highly receommned this player and recorder. The line in record feature is good for people who want to transfer old cassettes and I also use it to record public presentations and speeches I do.

<Title>Great Machine - Plenty of Bookmarks
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great machine--plenty of bookmarks to keep your place. I bought this as a gift for my wife who listens to classes more than to music. I selected this player specifically because it has multiple bookmarks. She had a two-to-three day learning curve to become familiar with all the features and now she loves it.   Whenever we drive together, we play one of her classes using a Kensington FM transmitter so the Zen plays through the car speakers--it's wonderful.  Sounds great, works great, and as far as I could tell, this has more bookmarks than any other machine I could find. This MP3 player was selected as one of the top five players by CNET Review Editors.

<Title>Buggy Bloatware, Defective Hardware - How UnZenlike
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you buy this player, be prepared for a huge amount of "required" and promotional software to be installed on your system.  In the end, I wound up with a defective player, but my biggest objection to this unit was the sheer volume of useless, redundant, and trial software that got placed on my system during the installation. I bought this to play Overdrive audio books provided by my local library. Overdrive uses DRM that requires Windows Media Player. I'm no iFanboy, but my everyday audio players for commuting and the gym are those are made by the company that has ~80% of the market - and now I see why. One required program that manages my media, including Amazon MP3 purchases, beautifully. It just works.  The unit arrived along with an installation CD. Going along with the installation, I wound up with several Creative programs (media manager, transfer manager, etc.) and some promotional trial software including Audible. I thought the Audible trial installation was interesting as I already had an Audible account and software installed. In the end, I had 5 or 6 new icons on the desktop and a ton of unwanted and unneeded software. Much of it didn't work or was unnecessarily complex.   The Creative software took control as default media player without asking. It even managed to cause my PC to be deauthorized with the iTunes store. The Audible trial installation hosed my existing Audible software. In the end, the unit itself had defective memory so I just uninstalled the software, cleaned up my system and sent it all back. Four hours wasted.  I wound up replacing this unit with the Sandisk Sansa Clip. The capacity is less, but it holds 5 - 6 audiobooks and meets my intended purpose perfectly. There is no software needed other than a simple driver. Audio book files are transferred using the Overdrive console. Other means of transfer include via Windows Media Player or simply by using Windows Explorer and dragging files into the Music folder on the Clip. (Imagine that!)  Sorry Creative, but I agree with the Sandisk approach. If I buy an audio player, that's all I want. I don't need you to replace all the media management software on my system with buggy versions of your own. Oh, and besides, the Sandisk hardware wasn't shipped with defective memory.

<Title>A great mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had the 1GB Zen for almost 2 years until it got broken :( (it slipped out of my pocket getting into my car and got hit by another car...lol) and I absolutely loved it! My only problem with it is the problem everyone else seems to be having with it...that it often freezes up for no reason and you have to reset it. Mine didn't do that too often but it was still a bit of a pain. I like everything else about it though. It's easy to use (I knew how to do everything on it the day I got it) and personally I like it better than the ipod. I plan on buying this model to replace my old one! :)

<Title>Good, if you haven't been using Ipod before
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a nice gadget, but as i lost my Ipod, i thought of a cheaper options. When i got it i wasn't satisfied with the interface it had(Music quality is good). Very confusing as compared to an Ipod. I returned it and got a new Nano.  I would say buying an old Ipod can be a good option if you are a Ipod user already.

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-1822667-8009742">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My unit lasted about four days.  It performed very well until it shut down last night.  Now it refuses to boot... maybe the screen is dead.  Either way, it's a lemon.  After checking out reviews at other sights, this problem is not so uncommon.  I'm returning my unit today for a refund.

<Title>Where is the instruction book?
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this 8gig mp3 player.  Using the Zen V Media Explorer I was able to load songs and generate a playlist.  I can play the playlist.  HOWEVER, there are no instructions for anything.  I cannot even get the main menu to come up (actually, I did it once and can't do it again as I don't remember the magic set of keystrokes required).  Also, I understand it has an FM radio, but can't see how to turn it on.  There needs to be an instruction manual.  I surfed the web trying to find something like this and only ran across blogs bemoaning the same thing I am complaining about.  So, if anyone knows of online instructions or tips, please let me know at bwolfe01@yahoo.com.   Thanks.  Having vented, I must say I really like the size and quality of the player.  It seems to be really nice and, with an instruction manual, I might give it 5 stars.
