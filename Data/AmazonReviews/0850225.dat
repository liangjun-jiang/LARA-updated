<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7876944-6599335">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more! A  little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library.

<Title>Keeps on Surprising!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Where to start? I've bought a lot of different Mp3 players. In fact, you might say I'm obsessed with them. I also have friends who have Ipods. (bah!) The only good thing about Ipods is the wide variety of accessories you can get for them. This little Zen beats them all, hands down! I'll start with the list of cons since there are so few.  CONS:  Touchy buttons. (even with senitivity turned on low, but easy to get used to, and there is a hold button) Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time. (?) Has ability to record, but has no line in.  PROS: (and this will be quite a list!)  Plays WAVE,Mp3,and WMA as well. (I have everything in WMA) Bass booster option. Smart volume option. Sound quality is great. I've read complaints about the bass boost being distorted. Turn on the smart volume and the disortion goes away. Crisp clean treble as well. Smart volume also adjust for different record levels. (quite nice) 5 band graphic eq, as well as plenty of presets. 8 gigs holds tons of music and photos. Very small. (fits in pocket comfortably) Works as an external hard dirve, and lets you decide how much space to use for this. (128mb upto 4gigs) Uses a standard 2.0 USB cord. (big advantage) Charge battery while you put music or photos on it. Not only is the battery rechargeable, but also replaceable. (you can buy extras for long trips) Screen looks bright and clear from any angle. Main menu is very customizable. (options, wallpaper,and colors) Easy to navigate. Almost no gap between songs. (good for Pink Floyd albums) Built in microphone. Seems to record pretty well. Has a calender where you can store reminders and events. Not so important, but it really looks COOL! Not a bad price for all it does.  LAST WORDS: At first I didn't like the fact that you have to use software to transfer files, but now I see why. I have other Mp3 players that are plug and play. It takes them a minute or so to boot up. Not this baby. Turn it on and it's ready to go in less than 3 seconds. The software updates the player when you close the program so that it doesn't have to boot up. I'm not the kind of person who likes to read manuals, and with this player, I didn't have to. It's almost too easy to use, and yet full of features. I've also read complaints about the software. If you know how to navigate windows, then software will be easy to use, and it works well. I've only had it for 3 days, so I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting or haven't found yet. But it just keeps getting better. Has more features than I dreamed it could.  BOTTOM LINE: Buy what you want, but the Zen Micro is BETTER!

<Title>Zen Micro Photo
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this LOVELY new toy for my b-day this past weekend. My best friend has an Ipod which she seems to love but I never did like the whole having to convert my music to iTunes before getting to listen to them. Since I have a ton of music from downloading my cds onto my computer there was no WAY I was going to lose all those hours of downloading because I miss up one transfre to iTunes. My boyfriend is into all things electronic so he told me about the Zen, he had an older model that although it was a really good MP3 player the touch senstive pad would stick. NO such problems with this one. I have been playing with it since Saturday. The one problem I have is the lack of accessories for the Mico Photo, I need a armguard for the gym and there doesn't appear to be one able as of yet.

<Title>Apples are meant to be eaten...
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dont know what reviewer L. Maxey has been smoking, but hands down, the Creative Zen Micro Photo is a vastly SUPERIOR product to the Ipod...flash player or otherwise. Simply do your homework people and notice the many, many features that the Zen Photo offers compared to the Ipod. FM TUNER, RECORDER, CALENDAR, REMOVABLE, RECHARGEABLE battery (unlike iPods--where you will have to pay to have it shipped and repaired by the factory), AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you can use it with Rhapsody To Go, which offers YOU, the user, basically EVERY album in its collection (current and past)for a set monthly fee of about $14.95. None of this "PAY PER SONG" BS that iTunes forces on you. Why pay $.99 to download a song when you can load your ZEN with all the latest albums---AS MANY AS YOU WANT---for a set monthly fee??  It comes in 10 different colors to fit whatever your particular taste is, and has a sweeeeeet cool BLUE glow when its on or when you navigate the controls. This player simply offers more bang for the buck. All in all, it's pretty clear cut to me what the superior product is... go do the research and find out for yourself.

<Title>ZMP
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>SOUND QUALity: nice, very nice USER INTERFACE - took me a couple of days to dominate the touchpad but now is very easy to use and manipulate, gotta be too careful not to touch the touchpad while playing though SOME COMMENTS - so far so good, the only weird thing is that sometimes when the player goes to screensaver mode it takes longer than usual, is supposed to be real quick but sometimes it drags for some reason as if it was in slow motion, you can see that the time elapsed is affected too cause it skips a number like so: 12, 14, 16, it only happens sometimes, not all the time, no trends noticed...it froze one time already while fowarding, it happened after using fowarding several times in a row but it was an easy fix by taking out the battery and putting it back in, just hope this little gliches are not a sign of things to come....and the OLED screen is great INDOORS, outdoor however you can BARELY read the screen, I had to change my wallpaper to a black-background just so I can see a little more. SUGGESTIONS - view photos while playing music BATTERY LIFE - approx 5 hrs using SONY MDR_V6 headphones, bass/EQ on, not bad considering I tend to use fowards/rewind a lot and most of mp3 are 192kbs or 256kbs. I left it playing overnight one time and it lasted more than 10hrs.

<Title>It's Great!
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed with my new Zen Micro Photo.  The 8 GB capacity is wonderful.  I put my entire cd collection on it, and still have room.  It was very easy to figure out and is simple to use.  With a simple cable (which my husband dug out of his box of wires) I can plug it into my stereo and have my entire collection, playlists, etc. playable through the stereo.  I did buy the belkin FM transmitter for the car for it, though my husband is thinking of doing more of a hardwire solution.  The best testimony, however, is probably the fact that my husband (a luddite computer engineer who questions the benefits of new technology and thought I was crazy for wanting one)now wants his own!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player!
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no complaints with the MP3 player, although the software drives ActiveSync crazy, and I have to end the Creative drivers if I want to synchronize my PDA (this did not happen with the Creative software that came with the player, but with the "update"). Otherwise it has very good sound, good battery life, and it works with Yahoo Music to Go (being this the main reason to buy this player). Why not 5 stars? Well, the "protective pouch" sucks and having to pay extra to be able to charge it directly from an outlet also sucks. It makes no sense to have to carry a computer on vacation to charge this thing! (Hint: I took my powered USB hub w/o the laptop to charge it!)

<Title>Rockin' with Creative
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little 8 GB player is great!  I've got over 1500 songs on my player and more than 1 GB still free.    Pros:  Lots of storage. Small. Radio. Bookmarking. Drag and drop.  Color screen.  While you can drag and drop to the player I recommend using the Creative Organizer software to transfer music for its syncing ability.  Supports several subscription services like Rhapsody among others.  Cons:  Not yet compatible with Audible.com files; hopefully soon.  Does not yet support MPEG-4 files.  Both of these can be fixed with a firmware upgrade when it becomes available.  I highly recommend this player as a great alternative to those not wanting to get tied into the iPod and iTunes.  Plus, this player offers twice the storage as the 4GB iPod Nano at the same price.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a piece of garbage.  I had it for 2 weeks and the player froze up on me.  I called for technical support and was able to "jump start" the player.  I used it for another two weeks and it froze again.  I was unable to "jump start" it again by following the same steps as when I called for help.  So I called again and was told that I had to ship it to the company for diagnostic checks.  After owning this product for 5 weeks, I've been able to use it for only 2 and had to pay shipping to send it back.  The company still has not returned my unit to me.  Get an iPod - it's well worth it.

<Content>Got my daughter this for Christmas - No problems if you are sitting quietly on the couch listening to it!! DON'T buy this if you plan on jogging, bike-riding or even driving on a bumpy road!!   Broke within 45 days of easy listening - Customer service was fairly helpful with return of product however.   We have had all types of mp3's in our house including ipod's, creative and cheaper brands - Don't waste $250.00 on this one!!

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item for my 13 yr. old son.  It was a replacement for a similar unit bought at Best Buy that started freezing up a few weeks after we got it.  BB had little in stock and couldn't say when they'd get more (we could call back if we wanted to check), so we went to Amazon and had our choice of many brands, models and even colors.  Infinitely better selection than the chain stores.  The new Zen works perfect (to date!) and my son is really happy with it. We went with free shipping and it arrived in about 6 days, including a weekend.

<Title>Roomy + Feature + Style + Cost = Solid Product
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>An exhaustive research on the available MP3 players on the market yielded the Creative Micro Photo 8GB to be the chosen one. Roomy: 8GB as compared to iPod's 4GB. When I started to download, I quickly found out I filled this little toy with 5GB worth of music and photos. Many of us just don't realize how many good stuff we have in our computer. Feature-packed: a) The FM radio with 32 presets comes in handy. When I get tired of listening to my 2000+ songs, I can always switch to the radio for a change. In addition, I can record songs from the radio for my future use. b) The recording feature allows me to record a lecture or a concert. c) I may share photos with my friends anytime anyplace. Style: This toy looks great day and night with its futuristic neon type light. Just because of that, you find yourself unintentionally showing off this feature to your friends. The player is compact, feels great in hand and seems to be very sturdy (as compared to iPod's flimsy look). Cost: I paid $250. For the same price, you might get an iPod with 4GB. And iPod does not have FM radio, can't record, etc.

<Title>Almost too much music.....
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The nice thing about 8 Gigs of music is that I haven't listened to the same album in a week. The bad news is that it took me a month to rip all those CDs to WMA format. Small price to pay, I suppose. Battery life is great. The Photo display isn't great, but all the audio features rock. Haven't used the directory (which only imports from MS Outlook as far as I can tell). Well worth the purchase, anyway.

<Title>Looks cool and special. Easy to use. Great for travelling
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disclaimer: I had an iPod before switching to the Zen Micro.   Features I love =============== 1. Looks.   There are those who buy things because others got it. But there're things in life cooler than military-issued white. In fact, I got my Sony MDR-EX71 ear-buds in black because white ear-buds are so passe now.  2. Uses standard USB cable.    This might seem like a small thing, but really appreciate the fact I just need one cable when travelling to sync and charge my MP3 player, cellphone, and digital camera. No more tangling mess of cables and charges, and I can always buy a USB line almost anywhere for less than $5 if I forgot to bring one.  3. No drivers required. Works like thumb drive.     The most significant consequence is that I can plug the Zen to the USB port of any PC, and be able to use the Zen like a USB thumb drive. My previous iPod needed to install drivers, which is a luxury I don't have with other people's PCs, or office PCs where they restrict your admin rights.  4. Music Subscription.  This is the best invention since iPod itself. I have been die-hard fans of only 2-3 artists, die-hard meaning I buy every single album and singles they produce. For everyone else, there are plenty of songs I 'kinda like' but I didn't feel they were worth the money to buy.   With this subscription thingy, I get to download entire albums simply to try out entirely new songs and artists to see if I like 'em. I doesn't bother me I lose them if I stop my subscription - they are songs I probably won't pay in full in the first place. But sometimes, not buying a song doesn't mean not worthing listening to it once in a while.  5. Solid construction. The Zen has a solid metal casing that not only feels sturdy and resistant to scratches, it can actually survive a four-feet drop without injury. (I've actually tried this, though not intentionally.) Couldn't say the same about my iPod. (My experience positively confirms that an iPod cannot survive a swinging knock against the subway door while inside a shoulder bag.)  6. Ease-of-use. The menu system is customizable and intuitive just like in iPod. (In fact, I heard the patent for the iPod menus are held by Creative Labs.) Synching songs is also piece of cake. Just plug-in and either WMP or Napster can sync up my library. This is probably standard feature now after iTunes set the standard.   At the end of the day, I can always resort to drag-n-drop straight from my windows explorer, for not only my music files but also data files. (See point #2 above.)  8. Battery Life I do 10-hour shuttles from the West Coast to the Other Side of the Pond at least once a month, and the iPod used to just flat out with less than 10 hours of playing. The Zen can not only sustain the entire trip, but also the train rides to/from the airports ony each side. And I bought an extra battery in case I miss a chance to charge up in between. The "stamina" of most batteries decreases with such consecutive high mileage use, and with the iPod I wasn't able to do anything about it other than to buy a new one or send it back to the factory. With the Zen I have an immediate solution for $30 in the local Circuit City.   Features I don't like =====================  1. No dedicated volume button. Need to go back to "Now Playing" screen to adjust the volume. Can't do it while I'm tweaking other things in different menus.  2. No podcast aggregation in Windows Media Player. Ok. This is more a WMP shortcoming than the Zen's. iTunes has the best podcast browser (though not the largest selection), so I continue to use iTunes to subscribe to podcasts, and let WMP automatically detect the new files and add to my player. It can be done, but I wish it can be done in one-step, one software.  These two dislikes mean it's not perfect for me, so, four stars.

<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Has plenty of storage for most people - easy to use & upload music and pictures. Sound quality is good and battery life is average. i don't understand why anyone would pay more for an ipod. The zen is durable and I have had no problems whatsoever.   The color display of photos is excellent & the zoom feature is easy to use. I'm not sure how viable any mp3 player is for picture display due to the screen size but this is probably as good as it gets. Would recommend to any one.

<Title>Great product - if it worked
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This would be a great MP3 player if it worked. I chose it so I could download subscription music. The first problem was that the LCD display never came on most of the time until I reset the player several times in a row. Resetting the player means removing the battery. I decided I could live with that until the thing stopped working altogether. Now its just a dead MP3 player. I just hope that I can get in touch with Creative Tech Support in time to get a replacement before the warranty runs out. No luck so far.

<Title>Should have bought Creative the first time around...
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Creative Zen MicroPhoto following the demise of my highly problematic iRiver H10 5gb.  The Zen has to date proven to be far superior in terms of its bug-free functionality with windows media player and Yahoo Unlimited.  The Zen does take longer than it should to locate and start playing tracks, but it moves between tracks on the same album without any pauses, a task which used to trip up the iRiver constantly.  I have not thoroughly tested the included Creative software, but despite the Zen literature's urgings to immediately load their interface program, the player works perfectly with Yahoo and there is no need to switch music programs from whatever the owner may already be using.  I use the Zen MP8 as a bridge to load up 30-40 albums from Yahoo, then feed the sound through a Radio Shack gold-tipped headphone jack to my high-end Yamaha amp--yes, it doesn't quite sound like a CD player, but the output quality is very liveable and you have to like the fixed-price music service model of Yahoo, Rhapsody, Napster etc as opposed to iTunes.  All in all, a nice player with battery life short of the promised 14 hrs but tolerable at a real world 8-10 hrs. One piece of advice, buy a cheap pda wallet to port the device around--it does scratch.

<Title>Great Interface, very customizable, except dislike the scroll pad
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Things I liked on this player (PROS):  -Size: It's small, and easy to hold in your hand. -Storage: 8GB of music, impressive for its size, it is heavy but feels solid in your hand.  -Screen: Picture display good on this player -Folder layout/Customizable: You can add or remove which folders, options or music layout on the main menu. This is awesome because if you use more setting/folders more often, you can add those to the main menu. I also like how it sorts music into genres, album or by artist. -Sound quality is excellent. 10/10 IMO -Battery: removable and last for 16 hours.  -Creative software: I thought it was okay software, and glad I didn't have to use WMP this time around.   Things I didn't like on this player (CONS):  -Power Adapter cord: you have to purchase this item separately for $32.00. -Scrolling Pad: Even with the sensitivity on low, it's still very sensitive to control. I like all the functions on the micro photo except this option. They should have removed this option, and made the menu key the select function.  -Software: One slight disadvantage you can't preview the song before adding it to your play list or adding it to the player. (Note: you can explore the folders from the creative menu, click on a song and listen to it in that section) -No external volume control, you have to access it in the menu options. -USB cord: Its very short in length compared to other players I've used in the past. If your plug this into the back of your PC good luck getting it in a bottom slot.   Conclusion: Creative has developed a solid product here. I really like how they setup the menu layout, except I really disliked the scrolling button which doubles as a select key. I planned on replacing my smaller 1GB mp3 player with the Micro Photo 8GB player, except the touch controls are too much of a hassle for me to use. I need something with an external volume control, and a touch pad that is a little more forgiving. Consumer Reports rated this MP3 player #1 for the Micro HD players. I still see this players as being an alternative choice to having to use an iPod.   FYI to the people with broken HD MP3 players: People who keep posting reviews on Micro & HD (hard drive) MP3 players should know that all these types of players are NOT intended to be used when doing physical activities like jogging! That's the reason why they keep BREAKING on YOU; HD type MP3 players are much like your computer hard drive. They have moving parts inside that are reading to a small hard drive, if you want an MP3 which can be used when jogging for example buy a flash based player!

<Content>Bought this player in Jan 06.  Picked the Creative player after doing a bit of research on all the larger MP-3 units.  When i got the unit in the mail, it was very easy to set up and run.  The screen is nice, crisp and clear, even in bright light situations.  There are only one item that i would like to see fixed with this player and that is the controls.  The slider/selector touch pad is difficult to master and prone to erroneous inputs.  Other than that, ive been quite pleased with it.
