<Title>Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:  - Incredibly small, thin, and very light. - Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case. - High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors. - Superb sound. - Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod. - New features:   > World Clock   > Stopwatch   > Screen Lock - now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano. - with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion. - headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.  Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:  - 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible. - USB connection only. - No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation. - Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.  Accessories that you may like: - The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket. - The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.   Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>Awesome device!
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it. This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes.  The Good: 1) Size & Design - Need I say more? It is very small and looks stunning. Apple have done it again!  2) Easy-to-use Software - You use iTunes to organize your files and import them to the player. It can also be automatically synchronized to add or delete files to your player as needed. 3) Good Sound Quality - The quality from the earphones is wonderful. Bass, mids, treble: all there!  The Bad: 1) Picture Import - Pictures can only be imported by folder, so if you want to put just ONE picture into the device, you have to create a separate folder for it and then import that. 2) Scratches - Nanos, especially the black ones, get scratched VERY easily. Note this before you put it to use and perhaps purchase the necessary bag/film/other protector to keep it looking new. 3) Battery Replacements - I'm actually not sure about this, but this thing looks like it's solidly closed. Will there be a way to change the internal battery when it expires? I don't know.  This is a super player! You will love it! Buy it! :)

<Title>I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod. I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini. I love it. I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff. I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes.  The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod. So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter. The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter. With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. It exceeded my expectations. The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. Now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists. I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that. This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers.

<Title>A good product, as old as it is.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3:35 AM. Anyway, I originally bought this thing a couple of years ago. It's still functioning properly and I've never had that many problems with it, and you can't imagine how many times this thing's been beaten around! The battery life has been pretty exceptional, though I can tell it has been getting a lot worse for the couple of years I've had it. I really thought I would have to replace the battery, but that was unnecessery.   To this day, I have been using this iPod with no problems (other than some click wheel problems, but that was easily fixed), and if you don't want to spend so much on the newer ones, this one's for you. I honestly can't compare this Nano with the other two generations, but all I know is that this one is durable, reliable, and easy to use. I may be getting the latest generation of the Nano by tomorrow (Dec. 17, 2007. The new nano with video capabilites) and I'll see if I can do a quick comparison between the two when I get it. I'll post the comparison on the Nano: Black product.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges is very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 2-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 500 songs. For $50 more, you can buy the 4-gigabyte, which olds approximately 1000 songs. If you think the higher capacity could be useful to you, the $50, for an extra 2-gigabytes is a good value. However, if you're on a budget, or are not so concerned with capacity, this 2-gigabyte model will get the job done. 500 songs is a lot of music, so you will rarely find yourself in a situation, where you need more than that.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color.  This white iPod Nano will match your iMac, iBook, or other Apple products.  Furthermore, the white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  It is a good idea to protect your iPod Nano, if you're concerned about its appearance.  The chrome finish, on the back, is particularly prone to scratches.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>You've gotta hold it to believe it
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 90% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. So for the storage reason alone, I can't chuck my 20GB model just yet. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.   ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $100, you can upgrade to a Photo that has ten times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is-it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.   Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their demure size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 2-4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>best balance of usability and portability among all iPods
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my 4gb black iPod nano yesterday.  I got one because my 4G 20gb iPod was having intermittent dropouts when used with a tape-deck adapter or certain pairs of non-Apple earphones.  A few websites surmise that it's a problem with gold-plated jacks.  I'm happy to report that no such dropouts occur with the nano, even after purposely twisting and wiggling the jack.    My first day with the iPod nano has been an awesome experience.  When not in use, I walked around the whole day with it in my pocket and forgot it was there most of the time.  The screen is very bright and easy to read.  The click wheel is more sensitive than the one on my 4G iPod, but I got used to it.  Amazingly, it continued to work even when a thick clear plastic film separated the wheel from my finger.  I guess I should qualify that I'm really not sure whether the wheel is more sensitve or the GUI is just more responsive.  Synching on iPod nano over USB 2.0 seems just as fast as my 4G over Firewire 400.  For those worried about the durability of the tiny nano, please read the Ars Technica review.  They threw one out of a moving car then ran over it with the car, and it still played.

<Title>What else would you expect from Apple?
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Forgive me for coming off like an Apple fanboy, but to be honest after buying my first iBook there was no way I could go back to the PC world and the same can be said for the iPod.   As an owner of a 15GB, 512MB Shuffle, and previous mini owner I can honestly say that I like iPods, and when the nano was introduced it was hard for me not to get one. After taking it home and opening up the box (always a little more fun with Apple's more dressed up packaging) I couldn't believe my eyes. This black 2GB nano was TINY. I was a little skeptical about the size at first because it might be too small, but even as a 5'9" person with normal sized hands it was still easy to use.  The color screen is just an added bonus. I never saw the point of having a color screen for a music player but after using this  it's hard to go back to the black and white. Although the screen is small, the photos and album art look nice and vibrant thanks to the surprisingly high resolution screen.  One major reason the iPod has sold so well is because of its seamless integration with iTunes and there is no surprise here. Just plug it into the USB 2 and it's pretty much set up.  So to sum things up here's what I thought about the nano:  Positives - Looks fabulous, especially the black - Has the 30 pin dock connector like the full size iPods, meaning that it is compatible with practically all the accesories out there, which is a lot -Click wheel, although smaller, is still easy to use - The sound on iPods are underrated compared to other music players, and the nano sounds just fine especially with the right set of headphones  Negatives (although only a couple, to me they are HUGE) - Battery life, although considered average at 14 hours, could've been a LOT better considering it's a flash player. But then again not all flash players have a color screen - Apple should've known by now, but the material they use for the face of the iPod is just too fragile. Yes it makes it sleek and what-not but this thing just scuffs up too easily and considering how I payed a lot of money (especially that i'm a college student) I don't want this thing to be scratched from light use. - This is in conjunction with the previous gripe, but it's nice to see that Apple is making their own case (nano tubes), but they should've had these available the same day as the nano, because right now there are a lot of users that are already disappointed with the durability of the face of the nano.

<Content>The minute I saw it, I had to have it.  Once it arrived, I was not disappointed, far from it: it is smaller and more elegant in reality than it appears in photos.  And it sounds good, and the screen is very, very sharp.  Finally, it works with standard iPod accessories, like my Griffin Technologies Tune Juice.  If you travel extensively, the larger hard drive based iPod is probably better, but if you stay close to home, and can rotate the music on your iPod Nano, this is the ideal option.  The flash memory based Nano is quieter, and has better battery life.

<Content>I've received 2GB iPod nano today.  I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment. It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs. I don't know why. I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model). Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky. I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer. I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine. What's wrong with my iPod nano? :-(

<Title>Everything awesome except for cheap scratchable plastic face
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, it looks and works wonderful. But putting this thing into a pocket scratches the finish. The plastic is softer than a CD. They (APPLE) want you to buy colorful cases (thirtybucks) to protect it. why would I put a pink plastic case over a nice shiny black ipod nano? Well the thing does scratch easily but I refuse to that much for a set of ugly cases. So just expect scratches with even cotton pockets on your levis. Now for the good part. The thing is really small and so high tech that it could have come off the starship enterprise. The thing works great and the music sounds great. The screen is brighter than the regular ipod photo (I have the 30gig model). So other than the cheap plastic front, the rest of it is really awesome.

<Content>The day I was planning to buy an iPod mimi, was the day that iPod nano was announced. I have decided to get the nano and I am happy that I did. It is very impressive. I have transfered many songs and pictures to my nano. It is very small. I still didn't take off the plastic from the front part of the nano, I don't want it to get scratched up. I wish they had a clear case avalable at the market. I bought a black nano and don't want to use a different color case. Overall, it is nice. Only negative part is that as soon as you touch the nano, shades of your fingerprints gets traced to the nano and if you try to erase the traces with the cloth, the surface gets messy. Hopefully the battery will last a long time. [...]

<Content>This thing holds 2 GB of data. This equals about 250 songs. "What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!" Let's face it. Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine. I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data. Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher. The only thing that I see as a problem is the price. You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars. The math for the prices is not linear. The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30. Just a thought, Apple.

<Title>Compelled to review
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't write a lot of reviews, but feel obligated when there is a product, book or something that i really enjoy. While the Nano certainly doesn't need any additional support with all the positive reviews I see, I didn't feel right about enjoying it so much without sharing my experience. I was torn between the 2 and 4 gb models, and almost went to 4 for only $50, but I then equated that to spending an extra $0.25 at the movies for the extra large coke - you just don't need it! 500 songs should be plenty, especially since you can erase and replace whenever you want!  besides, if you've read the tipping point by malcolm gladwell (not a plug, but I'll be reviewing that next!), you know that after 150 songs you probably have too many songs to be familiar with anyway!!! What can I say, the ipod experience is awesome, and the size of this new unit makes it even better than I imagined. Buy one.

<Title>Apple admits to Nano duds
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue". Apple finally admits it.   So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.   To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement of your DEFECTIVE unit.   I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option

<Title>Beautiful Nano has a few Weak Spots
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The nano is beautifully engineered hardware & software; However, there are some flaws:  ** Cheap Earbuds - the included earbuds sound lousy - not even close to my old Sony MDR-E838's that I got years ago with a minidisc portable.    ** Has only canned equalizer settings to choose from.  Haven't found a way to use the custom EQ settings from iTunes.    ** Weight is over spec - advertised as 1.5 oz (42.5 g), actual is 1.75 oz (49.5 g) - not including earbuds.  Otherwise it's fantastic - integrates perfectly with iTunes.  No problems here with scratches or cracks so far.

<Title>Running with tunes again
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 4th Generation 40GB iPod for ~1 year and love it.  It holds a fair amount of my music collection and entertains me more than I can imagine. Along comes the iPod Nano and oh my word!  I've been running with the 40GB version and I'd been contemplating picking up a Shuffle.  Then Steve Jobs has to go and show me this...  I tried to order one as soon as I could find it.  Finally tracked down a 2GB black version and I use it every single day.  It has helped get me through more long runs and training than I ever imagined.  It goes with me everywhere. My only complaint is that the face & back can get scratched fairly easily.  I don't have the time to sit and baby the Nano every time I go running, so I've decided to just live with it.  It is more for function than for beauty in my case anyways. If you pick one up you won't regret it!

<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the market for an iPod for a while now and had my heart set on the U2 photo edition.... until I saw the Nano. It's unbelievably small, yet packs the same features as the traditional iPods (only thing lacking was the space). I mainly use mine in the car so it's not a porblem to change around the songs when I feel like.... but that combined with the Belkin FM transmitter makes it a dream !!

<Title>Flashy, but can't work too well... 3 1/2 stars
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw this iPod nano and LOVED it.  It was small, flashy, and had everything you would need in an mp3 player.  BUT, when I was just dreaming about having a nano (I have a blue mini and even though the nano outshines it, I still LOVE it) a girl with a locker next to me had hers in her hand.  I asked her if I could hold it and she yes.  After fantazing about how that could be MY nano, she exclaimed that it would turn off. (you have to press the play button for it to turn off.) I see it and the battery is full, so I try to turn it off for her... it wouldnt work.  So, her had to keep her nano turned on for the rest of the school day until she could reset it.  It ended up with a dead battery... The nano has faults... people who have the iPod nano notice these faults even though they put 5 STARS ***** sometimes it would freeze on them, it won't play, they notice these mistakes but are so entrapped into the nano that they don't want to admit it. Even though i have 3 stars, I would reccommend the nano to people who just love flashy and OKAY working mp3 players.  The people who would buy this iPod need to be patient. It would definely freeze on them.  But, I admit, I would love to get an iPod nano, because I'm one of those people... but just warning those impatient people out there!!! =]

<Content>I've had an i-Pod Nano for over a year, and I'm still just amazed!  What a great invention.  Wish Elvis could see them. No more taking CD's (or tapes--yes I can even remember "records") to have music. I have the 500-song capacity nano, but it's just amazing!  I can't compare it to any other mp3's or anything--I just think how great these little gadgets are! I have had NO problems with the Nano.  I do have it in a clear case so it isn't scratched. Do I need to even bother checking "I am over the age of 13"? (My next "amazing invention" is going to be a GPS.  I can't wait!)

<Title>Blaaaaa
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned a black 1st gen 2GB iPod for about a year, and I'm not happy.  I had very few problems with it until recently, the buttons on it stopped working and doing apples recommended "5 r's" did not help.  I called apples technical service line and guess what...THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO ME...unless your ipod is still under the 1 year warranty, they will not give any help, at all, none. They did however refer me to their online forums...what a joy...here I find 20 other people with he same problem I'm having, with still no answers.  I found no "authorized ipod technician" on these forums, just a bunch of frustrated customers with unanswered questions.  Apple refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem and don't seem too keen on fixing it.  If you do still plan on buying this product (and I don't recommend it) at least buy an extended service plan like I did.  When I got mine Bestbuy offered a 2 year "Product Replacement Plan" basically you can send your ipod in any time within 2 years for any problem and they will send you a voucher which is in-store credit for the cost of the ipod when you bought it + any tax, A great deal in my opinion, I think it only cost an extra $30

<Content>I got the first generation nano 2GB as a xmas present back in 2005. I thought it was great,until March 2006. I was using it one day when it just froze. It came back about 24 hours later. It froze about every 2 months after that. I am now fed up with Apple and thank god, I lost my iPod the other day. I was glad! I later went to buy.com and ordered a Zune 30GB for about $100. What a deal that is! I am trying to make a promise to myself not to buy an Apple product again. Steve Jobs can go take his iPod and iPhone and stick it up his a$$!

<Title>I should have gotten the 4gb!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My brother got me the ipod shuffle for my birthday- but luckily the nano was released within 30 days of my return by date!!!! so i got the white nano- there were 2 guys at the apple store returning the black ones because the screen was all scratched up. they ended up going with the white because it's harder to see scratches.  knock on wood- i have not experienced any defects with the nano casing or lcd screen. (in reference to the numerous lawsuits being filed)  the color screen is amazingly clear. i wear super tight ultra low rise jeans and the nano easily slips into my front pocket!   i've never owned, touched, or used an ipod previous to this gift-  but i use mac. being able to use my "magic bone" (yeah i'm one of those nerds who name inanimate objects) for ical, contacts, and notes is simply fabulous! currently i'm running jaguar so i had to use isync to synchronize my files- but it's really not a big hassle... though i may change my mind when i upgrade to tiger later on this week. i kept reading info saying you HAD to have 10.4--- NOT TRUE! you just have to do one extra step- click the options button on itunes.  if you're going to get a nano- get the 4GB!!!! I'm probably going to give my 2GB to a friend and buy the 4GB... 500 songs is really not enough... plus- i had to delete the entire song directory just so i could download some applications from a friends computer. if you plan on using the nano for data storage and music- get the 4GB!!!!  SENUTI- google it- i didn't realize til last week that you couldn't transfer music FROM the ipod nano TO your computer. This program is freeware- and works perfectly for transfering music files. using the nano with Tiger is just one step easier for syncing your ical and contacts- but i still don't think its necessary to run tiger with your nano.

<Title>Another reason to love Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple is like a a bad marriage. The husband beats the wife but the wife sticks around to take in the name of love. Thats what being an Ipod owner is. Take a product that is "popular amoung the masses" and make it one of the worst products ever to be manufactured, wrap it in white and silver and bam, commercial sussess! Why is it about this liitel Ipod that makes people spend their savings. Not only do ALL Ipods have terrible battery life, but now there are reports surfacing that the screens are some crap and that it fades or becomes almost to hard to read after like two weeks. It seems that one must handle this new Nano like a paper crane, when its supposed to be something that is easy to transport.   All in all the Nano proves that Apple is sacrificing workmanship in exchanges for trendiness. Its sad when Americans waste 200.00 for a product that will essentially do nothing but let them down. Apple shouldnt release such a defective product until it can come up with the technology to make it durable. The idea is there, but the workmanship isnt.  So if your one of those urban-wannabe-chic-metrosexual-look at me and my liitle Nano type of people, do your self a favor. Save your money and buy a Walkman cassette player.   Long live 8-Trac!

<Title>Just fascinating over and over again
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Every time I  look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities...the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be...   downsides are:   its either PC or Mac compatibility , NOT both...(and I thought i could use it as a convenient way to transfer files)  and....its princesslike behavior towards anything that touches it...the little jeanpocket Steve put it in? hm. nothing in it...but it has scratches when i took it out...a cloth to polish sunglasses (the high quality super-technical stuff that comes with Ray Bans)..scratches it too...  But this lead to the development of our nano leather sleeves...so bad things have a good outcome sometimes, you can find it by searching for a "nano sleeve" here on amazon.   Buy a nano, be happy and remember: WRAP WHAT YOU LOVE!

<Title>Killer Gadget BUT a case is a MUST!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I received my custom engraved 2GB white iPod nano yesterday and had about 4 hours playing with it and these are my ideas about it...(already have a 1 GB shuffle) 1. Packing (might not be a whole lot but it means something): Very simple yet elegant packing, box and Apple sign look so classy on it. Once you open it, the iPod is safely embedded in hard card board where it fits snuggly. Now on the back of the iPod is a *small* piece of plastic with 5 lines (yes 5 lines) that gives you the how to instructions...Now I'd like ANY of the mp3 manufacturers out there who claim to be 'iPod killers' to show me the instructions on how to use their mp3 players...please give me a break...the manual for the nano is like 10 folded pages...very simple and to the point!  2. Look and feel:  Not much to say here, everyone has seen this thing and yes it is VERY VERY small, you might think it's delicate however it's very hard and sturdy. As for the feel...this thing feels solid...not like some cheap mp3 player out there.  3. Scratchability and finger print-catchability: Personally, I have NOT removed the plastic film all along the front because from the glossiness and shine of the surface it's clear that even tiny dust particles will scratch the surface if you try and wipe it off with anything even  with your fingers or a soft cloth. Now the thing that everyone's been kinda ignoring it is the finger prints on the back, I had prepared myself by washing my hands before handling it (sounds crazy but I did it after I saw the shinyness of the back), after charging the iPod and putting some pictures on it, I held it in my hand for a little - about 30 minutes or so-(hey you know I've been patient for 3 charging hours, now's the time to play) I basically played a few songs, a few podcasts, then I was brave enough to flip the iPod over and look at the 'shiny' glossy back and oh my god, I was shocked at the amount of finger prints all over the back. This thing is a finger print MAGNET...now to clean the back I had to use a piece of cloth that came with Oakley glasses...it took me roughly 15 minutes to clean the back 'cautiously' such that the glossy back doesn't scratch while I'm cleaning the finger prints.  4. Charging: 1 hour and the battery sign was full, but since this was a first charge I left it 3 hours just to charge the battery completely.  5. Usability: For being the first iPod I have with a screen it took me roughly 2 minutes to figure out how to navigate the menus back and forth and to play songs and to view the pictures...very simple and very straight forward.  Conclusion: Great gadget but having a case for it is a MUST if you want to save the great looks, otherwise don't regret losing the looks and ending up with just the great performance. I'm personally thinking of buying the double layer iSkin Duo for the iPod nano..and till then my iPod nano is going to be wrapped in the plastic it came in in the box, I don't want to spoil the looks of my cute iPod.

<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought my nano today and i have to say, it is simply amazing. the sound quality is great, it sounds just like the speakers i use for my comp. the interface is incredibly simple, and i like the wheel feature, you just have to run your finger over it and it will move. However, the only complaint i have with the nano is that the back gets scratched up easily. BY THE WAY FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS NANO SCRATCHES EASY NANO IS MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE ORIGINAL IPOD. the back is soooo nice, but once u get fingerprints on it, it looks old. I'd recommend buying a scratch-removing cream from walmart, or any other store like that. you can also get them on ebay for about 7 bucks a tube. This is my first ipod and i simply love it!

<Content>I actually bought my Nano used (only 6 mo. old) from my brother-in-law upgrading to the iPod 80 gig. It holds all my songs but I've had to reformat as the songs began messing up - Never thought an audio file could run at higher speed. Think 45 rpm sped up to 78 rpm. Weird. I hated the iPod buds as they wouldn't stay in my ears. Wish I could delete songs direct from my iPod or at least when connected to my PC. Otherwise it helps alot with my dreary commute by train.

<Title>Needs to hold more songs and how do you put photos on it!
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod nano is OK but is not great it can hold some more song and is a huge pain to put photos on it because the camera adapter does not work with the ipod nano.If you want to get an ipod nano get the new one which can hold up to 500 songs,1,000 songsor 2,000 songs and comes in 6 colors and the colors are Blue,Pink,Black,Green,Silver and Red.(Red is only sold on [...]).

<Title>My Favorite New Toy
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Commuting to work I often wondered how this teeny-tiny gadget that I see other commuters have "plugged" in their ears work and just what was the "craze".  When I finally gotten up the nerve and purchased my iPod, after very easy registering and downloading, I now have my answer as to what everyone have "plugged" in their ears.  The sound is incredible and it is now a pleasure to know I never have to carry around a CD player with a gazillion CD's!  I'm elated that I've made it to the 21st Century -- it is a wonderful investment, especially for someone who is not savvy in computer-downloading.

<Content>you guys should really consider on getting on getting this ipod ano. It is really great. Im not a huge fan of the 2nd generation ipod nanos so i got this one because of its style and look. Also apple doesn't make this kind of ipod nano anymore so maybe in a few years it will be worth alot of money like the 3rd gen and 1st gen ipods. The sound quality is really great. also the way of findong and picking out your own song is really easy. I suggest on getting this ipod nano. This ipod nano is the 1st generation by the way. deffinetly get the 1st generation ipod it is just great

<Title>DECEPTIVE
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for my boss--it was a group gift. The price was excellent. However, when it arrived, the receipt indicated that it was not new, but a refurbished item. I was appalled as the description never indicated that.  My only recourse was to call Ritz Camera immediately. The representative informed me that all their ipods on amazon are refurbished. When I told her that it was not marked as such, she reiterated that they should be advertised that way and that it was Amazon's mistake. I was told that Ritz would send me an authorization form to make the return...plus the 25 dollar shipping I paid to expedite the item. I am still waiting for the form and it's been almost a month. I e mailed Amazon about the problem but never heard back from them. I also had to send back a sport sleeve accessory that I had purchased on Amazon as well...and also paid shipping. I again e mailed Amazon asking to be able to be credited for the shipping due to this debacle. Never heard back again. I would hesitate to do any buying from Amazon again. There is no recourse and no one to talk to if there is a problem.Buyer beware !!

<Title>Thing of Genius!
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Words can't describe how amazing this new product is. IPOD NANO! You might think that I am someone that has bought this product yesterday and don't know how garbage this is. Wrong! I bought it on the first day when it came out and it never lost my approval. Firstly, people say that it is so small that it can break easily. This is the most durable music product that I have ever owned. I dropped it from my head to the floor and from the shelf twice. It still works and looks beautiful. People get angry when this thing is scratched. What can you expect, it is to be portable, and the back is reflectant.  What I dissaprove is the lacking of a charger. You could charge it on the usb port which I do. So i leave the computer on for around four hours lol. The size is amazing. It is so portable that I can listen to it all day, which I do. The screen is crisp and clear, comparing to my cell phone with the same size. I'm suprised that it has a six lines of text on it and photo playback! The click wheel is a thing of genius. It is like two diffent sets of buttons in one. The headphones are great but get a bit tistorted while playing loud. I have 350 songs on it at this moment, but I would recommend getting the 4 gb. I am returning mine for the 4 gb. The orignal ipod cost the same much with 20gb but I'm sticking with the Nano.   Pros: Ultra Small Fast downloading (half a sec per song) shiny back lol Crisp screen clickwheel  Cons: No charger (USB PORT) Scratches easily (not a problem) Too much attention  Beware! This gathers too much attention, it could get stolen easily.  All in all, this is my best investment, and I highly recommend you getting this. 10 Stars!

<Title>Scratches way to easily
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have joined a class action lawsuit against Apple because of how easily the Nano scratches.  For those of you who think this lawsuit is stupid, worthless and for those who think the iPod nano is made exactly the same as previous iPods, you're wrong. I suggest to those who believe this to read the filing that these two law firms filed. It suggests that Apple knowingly made these iPods with thinner materials, making them easier to scratch, to lower manufacturing cost. This is why this lawsuit is not stupid or "bull". A company who makes a bad product knowingly should be held accountable!  I have five iPods; iPod mini, a 20GB iPod, an iPod shuffle, an iPod U2 Edition, & iPod nano. All of them have gone into my hoodie pocket that contains nothing else (no keys, no pens, paper, etc.). All of them are scratch free except the iPod nano. I bought the iPod nano September 15, 2005 at Best Buy and took it home where I laid the box on my desk. It stayed there until Monday morning where I took it out of the box (for the first time) and loaded all the music I wanted onto it. I was leaving for vacation that day by the way. I put the Nano in my hoodie pocket, with nothing else in there, and left for the bus. A few moments into my trip and I took the Nano out of my soft cotton made hoodie pocket and it was scratched badly enough already that it is hard to see what is on the screen.  I feel I, and everyone else who has a scratched iPod nano, am entitled to a new iPod nano from Apple, however, all I really want Apple to do is admit that they have a bad product out there and I want them to fix it for future iPod nanos (which I have no doubt they've already done). Maybe before you commit on a case such as this, you should get off your lazy ass and actually do some reading and research. Not all lawsuits are frivolous!

<Title>Worthless Software
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll start off by saying that I am biased against apple.  I bought this thing for my mom because she wanted something small and thought this looked cool.  The software for this is some of the worst I have ever used in my life.  I thought that the creative labs MediaScource was bad but I was wrong.  One thing that I could never figure out is why USB devices are so annoying to install.  You can't plug it in prior to installing the software and if you do you're SOL.  After installing and uninstalling every bit of the drivers that came with this thing I still cannot get iTunes to recognize the iPod even though Windows does.  And of course it will not function without iTunes.  Even during the installation when it tries to format the iPod it just stalls out (much to my dismay the progress bar is just on a set loop; so it does not actually show any progress).    I am not a fan of any of the MP3 player software; I personally would like to see it function like a removable storage device.  Just move whatever files you want over and it will play anything that's a supported file type (just like an MP3 CD you put in your car).  But it is especially annoying when the software you need won't recognize your device even though everything else does.

<Title>I have lotsa toys, but the Ipod Nano is awesome!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a lot of audio equipment.  My main system headphone amp is worth $1000 by itself.  I love music.  Mainly classical.  I am also a geek, and love portable audio. I have had cassettes, and have minidisc.  I have had hard drive players by Creative, Rio, Archos, eDigital, iRiver, going back to the Creative Jukebox 1.  I wanted an iPod Mini, but they are discontinued.  So I got a iPod Nano 2gb.  Had it for about a week.  IT IS AWESOME.  The best portable player I  have tried.  Interface, sound, size, screen.  Just great!  The software (iTunes) is ok.  It is not perfect, but does the job well.  Creative has a good software package, and the iRiver makes you use Windows Media Player or the like...it comes with no software.  The iPod comes with two nice bonus features.  1) Podcasts.  Sound files from sources all over the net, that can be added and updated to your iPod automatically when you connect it to PC. 2) [...].  Audible Manager does not work with the iPod, but you CAN play files you legally download with Audible Manager to your computer!  There is also online music purchasing from iTunes website.  I don't use that though.  Too bad iPod can't work with Rhapsody, my current online service.  Proponents of other brands say the fact that the iPod batteries cannot be user changed is bbbbbaaaaddddd.  I thought that.  Now I don't mind.  Apples battery service is only $60 (check their website for details).  A battery for other brands is usually $50. Little difference.  Not many accessories out for Nano yet.  I ordered a case for it online from eBay (no, don't get your ipod from eBay).  Downsides: I wish I had gotten the 4gb! You can only charge Nano with USB cable connected to your PC (cable supplied).  An optional charger from Apple is $30! There are cheaper substitutes out there, but buyer beware! The Nano scratches easily.  But I got it to listen to music with, not visually adore, though I do....  I gave the iPod Nano five stars.  It's worth it. Too me, it's only main competitor is Creative Zen Micro.  I have one of these too.  Yeah, Geek.  But the Zen will not play protected files [...] (I think it will with the update of firmware, but I did not like this update).  If you decide to purchase a player, make sure you have a good return policy.  One comment..the itunes software is strange in some functions.  Like it does not use the word "delete".  To delete something, you use "Clear".  Weird.  As usual, provided help files leave a bit to be desired.

<Title>So easy to scratch you wished it was an itch!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw it.  I loved it.  I wanted it.  I paid $250 for it.  It ordered it engraved.  I finally got it.  I loved it even more.  It looked good.  It sounded good.  It was exactly as advertised.  Until.  Until the second day.  It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever.  If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first.  Don't open the box until you get a sleeve!  Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve.  Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve.  In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it.  Well at least not as many.  At least then you'll be able to see the screen.  Apple is usually a pretty good manufacturer but I haven't a clue how this product got by their quality control department.

Once i bought it i couldn't believe how wonderful is this player, no comments about ITunes.  As everything pretty you have to take care of it so it can continue looking pretty, as the same as a car or everything else.  I didn't take off the cover from the face so it's all good, i'll get the silicone cover later, anyway is not a matter of showing it to everybody, it's a listening to music thing.

This product was purchased under the "used" category but the seller, true to their comments about it being either a return or store display item seemed accurate. The IPOD seemed brand new and there have been no problems with it. The seller said all features had been tested. I think they must have been very diligent in their assessments. Again, we've had no problems with it and our daughter was so excited about getting an IPOD for Christmas. We could not have afforded one in any other way.

<Content>I LOVE the iPod nano! Sure, there's the 4GB version but I see no need in spending more money when I can get this less expensive one that holds 500 songs.  I love the style and yes, be careful that it doesn't get scratched. For this, I recommend getting a iPod case.   The iPod 2GB nano is very small and handy. The navigation is super easy. I love that unlike other mp3 players, you can organize your songs. You don't have to click 6,000 times just to get to one song!  If you want a nice trendy mp3 player that can store a decent amount of songs AND that isn't as expensive as the recent iPods, then this is the one for you. :)

<Title>Love My Nano! Better Than I Expected!
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Upon asking for any mp3 player for my birthday, my husband went above and beyond and got me the White 2 GB iPod Nano. I've been overly impressed with its performance and durability thus far! I don't have a huge music library so the 2 GB is more than enough for my needs and I don't ever see myself using it for all of its capabilities - since I mainly wanted an mp3 player for the gym. But for the more experienced, all-inclusive iPod user this little guy does it all, and with ease! Transfer speed is faster than I would have expected, and installation was a cinch as long as you follow the directions they give you EXACTLY! If you plug in your iPod before installing iTunes you ARE going to have trouble with iTunes recognizing it.  The 4-star rating is more in relation to my issues with the iTunes software, which I found a little less than user-friendly. Simple things like right-clicking on the name of the track to rename it isn't possible (you have to click once, pause and click again). I think the design is a little overly simplistic, which leaves a need for general-use explanation. Other than little things here and there iTunes is nicely automated to sync with all of your music and picture folders.  One bone I have to pick with Apple is this...you release a great product and practically NO accessories??? This product has been out for over a month now, and the only thing available (thank goodness) is the armband. You'd think at the very least they would have also released the protective sleeves...but apple.com and even Amazon don't show it's availability for another 2 weeks or so. I can't wait for the accessories to come out since I'd love to get something to play this in my car.  Overall - great product, maybe a little pricey given the other varieties that are out there. But I think you're paying a premium for the size (or lack thereof), and flashiness of it all. I personally was glad I received the Nano as opposed to a full-sized iPod. I held my friends a few days after I got my Nano and I couldn't imagine using it at the gym with how heavy it was. I think the newest generation iPods (with video) are slightly smaller and lighter than the old ones, though.

<Title>Once again amazed by Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod Nano is (in my opinion) the best ipod that Apple has ever made. It is also one of the smallest MP3 players so it's easy to hold. Also if you have an ipod mini, this is a good upgrade. Here's some stuff you should know before buying one.  The size: Impossibly small. Thats all there is to it. And the only way you'll truly understand is if you hold one.   The screen: Perfected but very small. But what can you expect, the ipod itself is small. Besides, a 2-inch screen is fine for music, a little too small for pictures, but at least its in color. Everything looks better on a color screen!   The sound: Awesome sound! (if it didn't have good sound I probably would have rated it 3 stars) Along with the screen, the sound is also perfected. No static, no skips. Nothing to mess up your songs. Its simple, you press play and you hear music, not static. Clean, sweet, music.  The games: A great, fun, waste of time. I especially like music trivia, where they play part of one of your songs and you have to try to guess what song it is. The other games are Brick (similar to pong), solitaire (you know, the card game), and parachute. All of the games are really fun ways to occupy your time, great for when your stuck in a terminal waiting for a plane.  The photos: The photo storage is one of the main reasons I bought this ipod. The 20 GB ipod photo may store more photos, but the Nano is smaller and less expensive. It holds enough pictures for any photography geek to be satisfied with. I also enjoy the slideshows with music feature, it's fun to mess around with. I'd say, this is the second best way to occupy your time (the games are a clear first place).  The headphones: No. I do not like the headphones at all. They have a weird shape that isn't that comfortable. I use the headphones from my old MP3 player because I simply do not like them.  Downloading music: Itunes is very easy and fast. The only problem with it is, if you are one who likes hundreds of songs, you'll end up spending enough money to buy an 60 GB ipod with video, and that wouldn't be very good, would it. If this is you, limewire is only fifty bucks away.  Here's a list of accessories you might want to consider buying. 1.) Some sort of ipod Nano armband for those of you who run. It isn't fun having to carry an MP3 player when your trying to run. Trust me. 2.) An ipod Nano dock so you can connect to a computer and get songs and photos easier and faster. It won't kill your bank account, only about $30. 3.) Any earphones or headphones from Bose are great, but if Bose isn't in your budget, still buy new headphones because like I said, the ipod headphones stink. 4.) An itrip FM transmitter to listen to the radio on your ipod. They dont have their own radios like most other MP3 players do.  Overall, the ipod Nano is Apple's best MP3 player with a great screen, great sound, and a great size. This MP3 player is for anyone, kids, adults, grandparents, makes a great gift and is somewhat affordable. I hope you take my advise and buy the Ipod Nano because you will be as amazed and satisfied as I am.

<Title>It's good...yet bad
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is pretty much a shrunk down version of the ipod photo. It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows. There of course are a few problems. For one the ipod scratches like no other. If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body. Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible. Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily. My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle. All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod. I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good. I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos.

<Title>one word: AMAZING!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I got the iPod nano, 2GB in white for my sweet 16. I LOVE IT. Only my second mp3 player, but my first flash player. It looks so small in the commercial, but is TINY in your hands. I got fingerprints on the back too easily, and there is some mark on the front already, but other than that its ok. I've heard it scratches easily. It comes with some games, like solitaire, blocks, parachute, and a music game. You can sync your calendar and contacts with it, whether you use a Mac or PC. The sound is great. The earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears, so I use my own. The click wheel is fun. Kind of strange if its your first iPod, but its easy to get into. Also, you can customize the main menu, if you dont want to go through multiple menus to get to "repeat" you can just put it on the main menu. It doesn't come with an adapter, you have to plug it in to the computer to charge it, or buy an adapter. I think that kind of sucks, but when am I without my computer? Overall, its great. Everything I wanted and more.

<Title>Small But Perfectly Formed !!
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok... This might be the first iPod that I've owned but I've been an admirier of Apple's work for some time. I have several friends with various generations of the original iPod and always loved the combination of art and technology that goes into them.  I had been the owner of a Sony mp3 player for about 2 years and until this summer had no reason to think about replacing it. 256meg of memory seemed enough for me and it was small too. What more did I need really ?? However, over the summer my trusty sony got washed and so it was time to look for something to replace it.   In the run up to my birthday Apple launched the Nano and I instantly fell in love with it. I have no real need for 60 gigabytes of storage but knew that 256 meg was limiting the amount of music I could carry around with me. Even the 2gig version which held 500 songs would be fine for me. I added a Nano to my birthday wish list and waited !!  Last Friday I opened up the sleek box to feast my eyes on my Nano for the first time. Even though I'd read pages of reviews about the player, I was still amazed at the size (or lack of size) of this unit. It's just tiny !! Not so small that you'd lose it but small enough that when It's in your pocket you can forget its there. The screen is so bright and clear and the sound !!.... WOW. For such a small player, it certainly packs quite a punch in the volume department. Full volume would certainly lead to hearing damage after a short time.  The iTunes software that comes with it is easy to install and easy to use. I was soon burning my CD's onto my PC with ease. A 10-12 track CD takes around 2-3 minutes to load onto the PC but uploading those same songs onto the iPod takes a fraction of that time. Infact on day 1 I loaded about 450 songs onto my player and it can't have taken more than 5 or 6 minutes. The product specs say that the 2gig version will hold 500 songs. Well I've got about 560 on mine at the moment and there is still about 250 meg free. I'm sure that the actual storage capabilities depend on the length of the songs you're loading.  I'd read lots about the problems with early versions of the Nano with regard to failing screens and scratches etc. but guess what ??... stuff gets scratched and damaged, thats just how it is. if you;re silly enough to think that anything will stay as pristine as the day it was bought, then you're bound to be dissappointed. I will be buying a case for mine (probably an Agent18 hard case) because I want to keep it in the best shape possible. I'd reccommend others do the same, not because it will fall apart if you don't but because when you're spending $200 on something, you want to look after it !!  I'm not going to tell anyone that the iPod Nano is the best value mp3 player on the market. There are plenty of others that have it beat hands down in terms of storage and price. However, I am willing to say that It's probably the sexiest mp3 player around and has the competition beat when it comes to looks. Add to that the fact that 500+ songs is probably more than enough for most users, that the quality of the sound is excellent and that (sor far) battery life has been up there with most of the others on the market, this really is an awesome piece of kit and well worth considering if you don't need the ability to carry around 25,000 songs !!  Bottom line... if you want a great looking player that is very capable and also has some neat additional functions that most of the others don't have then get out there and get yourself a Nano. If you want something thats gonna hold thousands and thousands of songs and withstand you throwing it around all the time, look elsewhere !!  I love mine  Mark

<Title>Overall a very good mp3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought my ipod nano today and I love it. It's truly an incredible device. Despite the negativness about scratches and the screen flaws, I took my precautions in advance and I'm able to enjoy this great mp3 player. I carry in an elegant silicon case which I bought from ebay at a very reasonable price.  Pros: Excellent and ergonomic design Very small size thus very protable Excellent screen Functional buttons (the wheel works fine even though I haven't removed the plastic tape and I carry it in a silicone case) Satisfactory sound quality Cool extra features  Cons: The headphones that come with the nano need replacment, the sound quality comes out very poor No extra accesories in the box, apart from the bad headphones, the useless for most people dock adapter and the USB cable iTunes is necessary or it won't load The expensive accesories It scratches easily   Overall its a great mp3 player, that you can really enjoy if you have some things in mind: You should first buy protective case against scratces You should first buy a good pair of headphones You should treat the device with care because it's more fragile compared to other versions of ipod

<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This IPOD is just not worth it.  After trading in my older IPOD for the nano, I was shocked at how scratched this one gets.  Then, after putting it in my pocket--as advertised--the screen cracked under very, very little pressure.  This is a design flaw that is becoming well known and will lead to this product's demise.

<Title>One of my best investments.
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I have owned MP3 players that go up to $400 dollars and there is only one (and my last) that I honestly can say I couldn't imagine going on without, an iPod Nano. Why? Well a few reasons but to make it as short as possible:  Positive: 1.) Storage: With 2GB you can fit up to 500 songs and I don't know about you, but when I work out I truly go up to, at the most, 80-90 songs simply because I shuffle through them and change them often. A lot of times when I'm running at the gym there's usually that one song that gets my adreneline going and I'll listen to it a couple of times. 2.) Durability: Sadly, I have dropped my iPod Nano far too many times but if there's one thing that always impresses me, it's always just like new. Music plays great and hardly any scratches. (Remember I've dropped it numerous times now.) 3.) Easy to use: At first you might be a little confused but within minutes it's like two plus two. 4.) Light weight and convenient. 5.) Battery life: I have left my Nano uncharged for up to two days and then used it for around two hours and it STILL had life left!  6.) Good for both male/female: Yes, it's cute but I have seen men and women carrying the Nano around and there really is no labeled gender on this MP3 player.  Negative: The only bad thing about the Nano is that once in a great while it won't shut off for some reason when I want it to, but whenever I just give it a second and try it again, it powers off. This is minor and really doesn't affect the user at all.  Summary: This really has been one of my personal best investments and it is worth every cent; on sale or not. I recommend this to people who work out, are on the go, or maybe just to enjoy their music anywhere-anytime.

<Content>for a older man to use this product is amazing from a haunch that predated back in the early 70's.  back then, there was no walkman in the market and the small transistor radio has been around in the 50's. by then a small portable cassette tape decks were in the market. so the haunch that i was discussing with a friend is, " would it be nice in the future to have a pocket size 'thing' that can be carried around in your pocket with a headphone to listen to a recorded music?". my dream come true. it is small pocket size friendly, affordable, the headphone delivers good sound for its size, but the battery does not last long enough for a long trip.

<Title>The Perfect iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first iPod purchase. After months of being subjected to the horrible music they play at my gym, I decided to take action and bring my own music to work out to! I knew from the get-go that I would purchase an iPod because I am an Apple fanatic. The decision for the 2GB Nano came when I saw how teensy the player is - I can wear it in the arm band holder and hardly even know it's there. Plus it holds up to 500 songs and plays for 14 hours (way longer than I'll ever need it to play, but it's refreshing to know that I could if needed).   I haven't used the slide show feature yet, but it sounds like something that would be cool to set up to show others (honestly I can't think of when I would need to look at photos on the screen).  All in all, I would say that if you are looking for a player to carry in your pocket or purse, this one is perfect. I haven't had any problems with it and couldn't be happier. It makes going to the gym so much nicer!

<Title>Fragile... yet beautiful! A review by a non-iPodder
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that I'm coming to the iPod Nano from the world of flash MP3 players, this is my first iPod because I was waiting for Apple to make a decent flash MP3... and they've finally done it!  So here are the things I love about my iPod Nano after about a month of use:  1) Making playlists on iTunes, this is a wonderful feature that you just don't find outside the iPod world! 2) Beauty, the iPod Nano is without doubt the sexiest MP3 player alive today. Apple really knows how to make beautiful products. 3) Sound is great. 4) Love that click wheel thing, another great idea by Apple. 5) Beautiful big color display makes navigation easy and fun.  I know much of that is old hat to the iPod world, but for me coming from a world of Muvo's and iAudio these are wonderful features. Now for the bad news, why I didn't give the Nano a 5:  1) Fragile!! Doesn't Apple understand that part of the appeal of a flash player is ruggedness? I'm scared to take this thing outside or even put it in my pocket without protection.. I immediately went out and spent another $30 for a decent case which leads to 2) Where are the accessories? My iAudio's and Muvos came with cases and lanyards and armbands. iPod Nano: nothing!! The most expensive player I've bought to date and the one most in need of a protective case and I have to go and spend an extra $30 for what should have been included!  In summary, this is a wonderful product and a delight to use and behold. However, Apple does need to get a clue about durability and accessories imho!

<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yeah apple for coming out with a bigger flash drive! I give them complete kudos for teaming up with Samsung on this! Anyways...that said...I still think that it lacks some features that are available in other models that are not apple! I think that I would still tell customers that really want a sports model that the shuffle still is a better way to go! I work in the retail industry (MP3) and have seen several broken screens already...and a couple screen where half the screen goes out! That said if you are still wanting a NANO please with it also imediately get a protective case, and I would reccomended Apples additional insurance on it! They sell it for 2 years for 59.00! That being said invest in it...The battery is a internal lithium ion battery, and is roughly good for a year to a year and a half.... if it goes out on you APPLE charges about 100+ dollars to fix it! I have seen them go out as early as three months from my customers! Nothing would be worse then getting stuck six months into being the proud new parent of a IPOD with a huge service bill from APPLE to get the now exspensive hunk of junk running again...EVEN if you don't buy it from APPLE lots of retailers offer service plans on them SO DO YOUR RESEARCH! SO you don't become one of the many disenchanted ipod owners I have met....Do your research, and don't be a I-sheep!

<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the worst consumer product I have ever purchased.  I feared the worst when I opened the box and found out it does not come with a manual.  The "quick start" guide is inaccurate and useless.  There is no way to connect this very pretty paperweight to a computer in order to download music, since the installation program did not work on either of the two computers I own--dell laptop and dell desktop.  (perhaps this is a way to get you to buy an apple computer.) The online manual does not answer any questions relating to installation problems.  The telephone backup number is neither on the support website nor on any of the written material which comes with the nano and required a seperate websearch.  After finding the number, getting through to a tech person is quite difficult.  (when you say Ipod nano to the phone tree it asks you what type of macintosh you own) After a 15 minute wait, the telephone backup person was unable to solve the problem.  She then claimed that she would send me an article about how to solve the problem by email but didnt do so.  It is possible that someone with a great deal of computer experience could make this work but I have only been using a pc for 15 years and have never taken a computing course.

For this price, APPLE needs to include this as not all people who use it have a computer or always have one readily available with a USB port.

<Content>Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out  how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 players

<Content>DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan.

<Title>My 1st IPOD
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers.

<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay. This is a device that I have owned (I say have, because I am about ready to sell it to some interested buyers)... but I found something that is way better. The Sony PSP.   Yea, the Sony PSP. It plays music, it has capability to insert a 4 gig SD PSP memory chip (mine has the one gigger at the moment until I sell my nano and buy the 4 gigger on a popular auction site), it play videos in GREAT video quality, and it plays games, AND it is web ready, you can surf the web anywhere there is a HOT SPOT. Hold pictures, and you can trade pics with other PSP's or email them from the web browser. USB hook up point. Has devices that charge it from the car... I use my FM Transmitter (iRiver) to broadcast the music in my car (yes this also has a headphone jack) - and there are about 100 accesories you can get for this device, including a BOOM BOX type of thing you sit this into (like the apples) but it only cost $199, and Apples cost $359. How much would you pay for a Video iPod? That only plays minimal games? $350?   GUESS how much the PSP cost? $199.   I really loved the iPod, but I really feel like I was ripped off by Sony because I didn't know that this device did all these things. Quite frankly I would not have bought the four different iPods I bought had I known that this device did all that it did.   It is NOT as small as a nano, but not much bigger than a iPod Video device. (and news is, they are going to make that one biggger too). So if your demands are a very small expensive device that only plays music, the iPod is for you. If you want more flexability in a device.. there is not a cheaper multimedia device on the market. Simply put.   The reason I put this in the Apple Nano review? Because I would have liked to have read this before I bought my nano, here in the amazon review section (which I use all the time) and changed my mind and bought the PSP.   Sony is looking for a device that will compete with APPLE all the time, and they don't even know they already have it. They should market this more instead of making those UGLY Mp3 players that will never come close to being as cool as any MP3 player that Apple makes (I use the term MP3 loosely here, and those apple folks know what I mean). Sony wake up. Apple folks who want to play games and have multimedia action, wake up!   All said and done, this may be the product for you.  But look.  It might not be the product.  The PSP does a LOT.  Plus music.  Have fun.

<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one just like this and I love it so I bought one for my wife and she's gotten a lot of use out of her's as well!! I would certainly spend the extra money and go with the Apple because I have had little problems with their iTunes software. Also, if I were to buy another one, I would probably want a little more memory since I already have my 2 Gig practically full.

<Content>It is definitely temperamental, and I have had to talk to Apple tech support a number of times. . . for various problems, such as freezing up and not responding at all, for instance. When that happens you have to let the battery run out completely, which means you have to re-download everything that was on it when you power up again!! This has happened twice in the less than six months I have had my iPod.   I don't know if there is an MP3 device that is better - if there is I would love to know about it.

<Content>Well this is a very good ipod! I love it!!!!! I was going to get the sandisk 1gb but for 90 dollers more I would rather get an ipod! Downloading took almost a minute for 7 songs! Awsome! Itunes is easy! And even naming your songs is as easy as counting to 10! I got it as a early Christmas present! I am so lucky! The headphones are nice if you put the protecters on! Lightly place them in your ear! I am listing to my nano right now! If you really think about it Apple is not thay expensive! I mean I got a 2 bg wich holds 500 songs and 25,000 photos witch doesn't even take up a gb! If you are on vacatoin and run out of space on your digital camara, just load them on the ipod!     Pros:      excellent sound!     gorgeous color     easy use     quick charge     nice quick wheel         cons:     nothing except Apple has everything seprate!

<Title>iPod Nano
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I bought iPod Nano and I have to confess, it is absolutely perfect! The use of flash-memory was a well-thought decision, and made the Nano look like a toy MP3 player. I live in Brazil and when I showed it to my friends, they didn't believed that such a little thing could play musics and hold up to 2000 5 MP pictures. I was really lucky of not losing them.  But, I have to confess too, this thing really scratches!! I was afraid of taking it for a lot of places because of the big risk of making a horrible scratch just in front of the photo you're showing to your friends. Even a nice case cannot protect your little gadget form the dangers of nowadays. I found myself needing to put mine in a sock and have the utmost care with it. In the other hand, one friend of mine bought the white Nano and till today, there are no scratch problems.  And other thing: I don't know if this happens to all iPods or just to mine, but sometimes the Play/Pause button didn't work everytime, and to switch my Nano off, I had to be very patient. Apple should correct this.  In the end, I recommend it. But I think you'd better buy the white Nano if you don't want to live with some incovenient scratches.

<Title>nifty little gadget
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before buying i read the below reviews. GLAD I DID.however it is a FANTASTIC little gadget. despite it took me a day or so to master and im still having a little trouble with how gentle the scroll touch is.    1) the PLUG is separate! strange but true, i thought people were joking but i ordered one anyway, even though this comes with the USB cables, chamoix case etc it doesnt have an AC plug.   2) KEEP THE PLASTIC ON, i have only had this a few days and i decided to keep the screen plastic on the front and just trim the pull tab off. Like a palmtop the facia is very delicate and i have already noticed a few light scratches just from having it in my pocket. if you've already done this spend the few $ to buy the screen protectors for a palmtop and just trim it to size  3) the size. Well i tend to switch out my playlists to my mood anyway and it is fairly fast, HOWEVER, i could not fit more than a single playlist at a time so the size is a little bit limiting.   4) in case any tech savies care the new game packages such as HALO etc that are planned for the next year or so to go on the ipod probably will not fit on this AS WELL AS your music. If you want anything other than a fairly basic music player then opt for the bigger better ones.   5) THE ACTUAL SIZE: i also could not believe the size. i have seen the ads etc but when it finally arrived and i opened the case i almost couldnt find it because i thought it was just a picture that was part if the package. silly but true. it is tiny! however it also seemes very delicate because of this and im terrified of causing major damage by the slightest unintentional action such as leaving it in my bag and having somehting else bang against it.

<Title>This is the best
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Simply said, I love this Nano.  It is light-weight, easy to use, not bulky, the sound quality is excellent (especially after I got rid of the ear-buds that came with it - too big for my ears - and got a decent pair of earphones), and the color isn't white.  That said, I quickly realized that 500 songs were too few and have recently upgraded to the new iPod video.  But there are times when I really miss my Nano.  A couple of years ago, I unfortunately bought a second iPod (the Nano was my third) that was a lemon from the getgo.  It wouldn't hold a charge, and my local Apple dealer said, too bad.  I had sold my first iPod when I got the second, larger iPod/lemon. I still have it in its original box.  But I missed my music and I missed my iPod.  So when Apple came out with the Nano, it was love at first sight, and I decided to try again.  This Nano holds its charge without a problem.  For the beginner iPodder, the Nano is the perfect choice.

<Title>Great portable music player
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little gem from Apple will hold close to 500 songs.  That is close to 40 compact discs.  This is perfect for having a large variety of music at your fingetips while walking, exercising or if you just want to crank up your music without disturbing others. If you use your player for strictly walking or working out, the NANO is the best choice by far.  It is so light that you really won't notice it in you shirt pocket.    If you have an extensive CD collection (over 100 CDs) and you are going to use it primarily as a music source for your home stereo, you really should consider getting the 30 or 60 gig model. If you can't afford the NANO, check out the iPod shuffle. It too is great for portability and affordability.  WHAT SCREEN SCRATCHES? I have had my NANO for about two months now.  I walk with it every day for over an hour. There is not a single mark or scratch on my screen. I always make sure that my pocket is free from any loose change, paper clips or keys that could damage the screen. When I put it down, it is always screen side up and I don't put stuff on top of my NANO. It is just like anything else, if you take care of it, you shouldn't have any problems :)  All iPods have scratchy chrome backsides....  but who cares?   If it bothers you that much, you should buy a case.  I would rather spend the money on a nice set of earphones! Which brings me to.............  WHY ONLY FOUR STARS? I threw those horrible "toy" earbuds immediately into the garbage where they belong. They were replaced with a pair of Shure E2C "in ear" earphones. If you are a true music lover and have about a hundred extra bucks, you can get a very nice pair of earphones that will give you a high end quality of sound even at 128 kbps compression.  You can't afford that you say? Even a twenty dollar pair of Sony earphones will be a major quality improvement in your listening pleasure.     ENJOY!

<Content>I needed a rugged MP3 player for jogging and travel. So far the nano has fit the bill (I 've used the device since July 2006). The ergonomics is satisfactory, but over rated. The touch wheel doesn't always respond as expected, and the iTunes softway disapoints if you're expecting a completely intuitive user interface. I originaly had a player from Creative, it stopped working twice and had to be exchanged by the seller. Its software was at best cluggy, would work with one of my computers, but not with the other. I had to download different software for different computers...bad quality all around.

She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!

<Title>Expensive but a neat little toy
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own the Apple Nano. My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it.  Sound Quality: The sound quality was not as good as on my iRiver (my i had more clarity and a little more bass response), but the difference isn't even noticeable unless your obsessive-compuslive about sound. There is a custom EQ along with some presets to match what genre of music you like. I've never seen the Apple earbuds but most people say they are awful so you should probably pick up some better earbuds or headphones (the ones I have are the Panasonic RPHJE50's and my friend's are the cheaper Sony MDRJ10's if that helps you on your search).  Interface: Well, I must say I'm impressed. I will say that it's much easier to use than most MP3 players on the market (the iPod's interface is really the whole reason they are so popular). The artists, albums, genres, and titles are set up like most, in category forms so you can find your song. Note that 500 songs (128 kbps, trust me don't go any lower) is around 40 albums, so I would recommend stepping up to the 4 GB Nano which will hold 1,000 songs/80 albums. The software the Nano uses is iTunes (which most people are familiar with). It does pretty much any function Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or MusicMatch would do. It's easy to create playlists on iTunes and send them into your player.  Features: The Apple Nano has some features, even though it's somewhat lacking. One of the best features is it's size. This thing is small, only 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27 inches and only weighs 1.5 ounces. The player does display album art, most MP3 players will not do that. It has a nice 1.5-inch color display and a photo viewer. It works with most OSs, even my friend got it to work on Windows 98. Some websites will podcast and you can put casts on your Nano. The Nano has some nice features, however, some of the features are lacking. The battery life is only 14 hours while most MP3 players are more than this. It charges and syncs with one USB, which means you have to take both along if you have to charge it. Hopefully your computer has a USB port in the front like me, that way you won't have much of a hassle. There is no FM tuner/recording but most people don't need that feature, however I think it should be deserved for the high cost.  Durability: The durability is much better than an iPod. I've heard batterys are fine on the Nano unlike iPods. It seems pretty durable, though I would highly recommend getting a case AND a rubber thing for it for two reasons. 1) It scratches very easily, both the plastic and the LCD. 2) The Nano will probably break if you drop it on concrete or the road.  Price: Just in my opinion, the price is way too high for just a 2 GB MP3 player. I think Apple is just asking for too much. I know it's small, but that still doesn't balance the price.  Overall: The Apple 2 GB Nano is a treat anyone would enjoy. Though the price is high and it doesn't have a radio or a record feature, it's good because of its size and its ease of use. 4 stars.

<Title>This thing sucks!
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ha, just kidding. I've never had an mp3 player. I previously owned a Sony MiniDisk player, however after finding out about the hidden rootkit on my hard drive, I have desided to jump Sony's ship. Boy, am I glad I did.  + I bought the 2 gig white version. I only have 300 songs on it right now and I still have plenty of room.   + Cut the bottom half of the clear plastic that comes on the front and you have a perfect screen protector.   + while the black looks cooler, the white shows almost no fingerprints (eccept the back).  + playback is skip free (no moving parts as opposed to hard-drive or MiniDisk based music players). So, jump rope and jog to your hearts content.  + Sound quality is great, it has plenty of equalizer settings (I use neutral)   - beware of the ear phones, many people find that they hurt your ears. Not me so much, however the sound quality is abysmal. Expect to spend some money on new headphones.  + the screen while small, is perfect for checking the cd that's playin. You can't see the details, but if you've ever seen the cd cover, a glance and you'll recognize what's playin.  + I haven't put any pictures on it but, if you don't have a picture of the cd case you can drag any picture you want into the artwork box. I have pictures of my wife, cats and other things I've picked up around the web (pictures that is).  -/+ I haven't had any battery problems since I have been adding new music almost every other day. So, I guess we'll see. I am worried about the $100 it will cost to change the battery but, by then I'm sure I'll have some new gadget.  - only because it's sooo expensive. I like to take it to the gym; it doesn't come with a case or lanyard so I have to hold it in my hand or put it in the cup holder on the treadmill. When I use free weights, I find myself compulsively checking it. (...).  +itunes is great. I used Sony's Sonic Stage previously (at the time I thought it was great), it sVcks compared to itunes. With Sonic you have to "check songs back in" and you can only take them out a preset # of times. What a joke! With itunes I can burn my entire music collection to dvd and send them to anyone.  -Watch out for that guy eye'n you on the train. These things are the Nike Air Jordans of 2006 and showing them around the wrong people could just get yer azz kicked. jay%^)

<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I agree with most of what everyone has said. The Nano is great for the gym and the casual music listener. But my god, look at the thing wrong and it scratches. I'm very careful with my things but when the cord from the provided headphones can scratch the screen that's pretty sad. Mine already has several scratches and I've only used it twice. I eventually put the sticker from the original box back on the screen. This thing definitely requires protection.

<Content>I have had my nano for about 2 1/2 months and i was very impressed initially. The sound is amazing and the color screen is awesome...until it gets scratched up. My best advice is to buy a case with your nano and put it in there as soon as it is out of the box. Also about a week ago my nano started going berserk and shuffling through songs really fast whenever i touched play. To fix this i had to clear the drive and reload all of my songs. Pain in the a$$. Overall it is a good product, just be sure to buy a case and a 2 year protection plan

I reccomend this ipod to all music lovers.  The one downside is that it scratches. But you can get a case for an extremely low price. If you travel alot, then I'd reccomend the charger.

<Title>iPod nano is pretty good
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my nano about two weeks ago from [...]. I got it customed engraved with my name on it. Everyone says they scratch easily, but I left the film on the front and not on the back and mine is fine. You just have to be extremely careful with it. My case hasn't arrived yet, but it hopefully will soon. The click wheel is great and handy to use when you want to listen to a specific song. The battery dies kind of quickly when you play games, even with the backlight off. The backlight also runs the battery down quite quickly, but if you don't have the backlight on very often, the battery lasts for a while. iTunes is pretty simple to use, but I haven't gotten the chance to download online yet. The screen is very beautiful in color. If you are a cautious, responsible person then this is the right mp3 player for you. But if you aren't a very careful person, I would recommend you get the iPod mini if you can still find one. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I hope this helps customize your overall decision on which iPod to get.

<Content>With the current state of low-cost electronic technology, the prices for these things is a rip-off.  Also Amazon's inability to deliver them until the middle of January (order placed Dec. 6)makes one wonder if Amazon is looking out for their customers.

<Title>Problems? Whatever!
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's funny sometimes, how when people review products here, they seem to nitpick. But anways...  I got a Nano for Christmas, and have been not only pleased, but was extremely excited. Who doesn't want a sleek liitle black piece of joy that knows all their favourite songs and even has pictures of they're friends to boot!? I honestly, never had much of want for one, but as soon as I heard I was getting one, it all changed.   For some, having all your music in your coat pocket, may not sound appealing. But, as an eplieptic, I've never had a drivers liscense. So with that said, it's such a relief now, to know that I dont have to carry around all those cd cases and that walkman. Having an Ipod frees you to relax and enjoy the journey, and not have to lug around "luggage", just so you can have something to listen to on your way home. And btw, 2 Gigs isn't really that bad. I only have a 2G, and it suits my music library fine. Yeah, if I had the choice I would take the 4G, but don't worry if you only got the 2, as it's more than you think it is. I guess if you have an extensive library (thousands of songs, that you listen to on a regular basis), then you're gonna want a regular sized iPod anyways.  So, enough with the novel... Is the iPod Nano worth buying? Yeah! You bet it is! And if you are already using iTunes on your Pc or Mac, then you'll be all the more prepared for the whole process. Loading songs into the iPod is extremely easy, just select and drag. And don't listen to all the hoopla about all the Adobe software you need to put your pictures on your iPod. It's simply a case of creating a folder on your computer that keeps those pictures, then selecting that folder in iTunes.   As I said, it's an EXTREMELY easy system to work with. The click wheel may take a a few minutes to get the hang of, but it really is not a problem either. And don't let all the reviewers put you off with all the talk about how bad the earphones are. They sound nice and clear! Unfortunately they aren't COMPLETELY comfortable. once again, COMPLETELY... as in, they aren't bad, just a slight annoyance. You do get two sets of foam earbuds to fix that, and I am still experimenting with those, so I don't really have a full opinion on that.  Also i'm hearing alot about the problems with the screen, case and click wheel scratching. Sure, if you keep it out of a case for too long, it's exposed and it's gonna get scratched. Sure! That's common sense! One of the things some people seem to oddly forget is how Apple packs the Nano with a clear plastic cover when it's shipped. So, no real need, unless it gets torn or dirty (etc.), to have to go out and buy screen covers. I have also bought a silicone case for it as well (the DLO Jam Jacket works well... just make sure not to bend the plastic screen cover). It gives you access to all your connections (USB and earphones), and your Hold button. And it keeps the case nice and protected from regular wear and tear.  I also bought what Apple calls "iPod Socks". I only found one set in the three or four stores where I went to to buy my iPod stuff.. but they are nice to have (Amazon sells them also). In one pack you'll get six socks and they're all in different colors. I do recommend those! They're great! But, on the other hand, Apple's "Nano Tubes" have been getting alot of slack for supposedly scratching the case's surface. I had bought a set (of 5, in different colors), but have left them in the package, and am contemplating returning them, as to keep my precious Nano out of harms way.  So, once again, is it worth it? You bet!

<Content>i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have. yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far. all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds). i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap.

<Title>Truly Awesome !!!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 2GB iPod Nano is a truly awesome music media device, it has a very cool and trend setting design, has a color backlit LCD display, plays a variety of digital compressed music file formats including MP3, and can be used to store and view PC files such image files. The circular touch controls and LCD display are intuitive and easy to use. It is fully PC or Mac compatible but not both at the same time since you must format the Nano's flash drive file system to use either PC or Mac. Along with the main device the package includes the very impressive iTunes and Quicktime media software on CD, a set of earbud headphones, a thin fabric based carrying pouch, and a combination USB data and power chord. The internal battery provides up to fourteen hours of music listening.  I recently got one of these 2GB black iPod Nano players as a Christmas gift. If you are new to these devices or unfamiliar with the latest iPod or new MP3 players on the market it is ok because I haven't owned a portable music storage device since having a small Sony Walkman cassette player very many years ago. The advances in micro computer technology over the past decade have introduced a new breed of amazing portable audio/video/storage devices. The latest of these is the flash memory based iPod Nano portable music and photo device. Improvements in flash memory technology have allowed Apple to develop a super small version of their popular iPod brand with no micro hard drive which means no moving parts to break, skip free listening, and extended battery life in an insanely small package. The first question that you might be curious to know is "How good is the sound ?". If you are an audiophile like me I am difficult to please with anything but the best quality but surprisingly this iPod Nano device did not disappoint me.  I understand that like most MP3 digital music players the iPod Nano uses a compressed digital source to create its audio signal. You can only expect "near CD quality" from any of these devices and with that in mind don't plan on hearing audiophile sounds coming from these. However, for a tiny portable device you can expect very good sound quality similar to a good computer based sound system.  The included earbud headphones are one of the weakest components in the included iPod Nano package bundle while the iTunes software really surprised me.  The problem with the supplied earbud headphones was that after a few minutes of sitting inside my ears they began to physically irritate and hurt my ears. Their sound quality was ok but overall they left much to be desired. Instead of using the earbuds I ended up using a small pair of the old style, over the head and over the ears headphones that came with an inexpensive ($29) portable Sony AM/FM/TV band audio Walkman that I had recently purchased for using at football games.  This is only a temporary solution and I will be looking to purchase a high sound quality brand of mini headphones with a similar design as my Sony brand. If the supplied iPod earbuds don't work for you then expect to spend from fifteen to one hundred dollars for a better set of low power compliant replacement headphones that use the mini-stereo jack.   The biggest surprise in the iPod Nano package was the quality of and ease of use of the iTunes software.  The iTunes music player along with Quicktime video player is basically Apple's answer to the Microsoft Media Player.  If you already own a newer Mac computer running a 10.x OS then you are already familiar with Apple's intuitive design, ease of use, and built in iPod integration.  For Windows XP users like me you will be in for a treat. After giving up on playing MP3 and other media formats on my PC I have started listening to MP3 music again. Apple has thought through almost every aspect of their media software and have created one of most impressive programs for the PC that I have used. The iTunes program also nicely integrates with the Apple iTunes website where you may purchase and download thousands of songs for your listening pleasure. Connecting your iPod to its supplied USB connection chord automatically launches the previously installed iTunes software and automatically syncs and transfers your iTunes file and song play list to the iPod device's file and song play list. The Nano's USB chord is the only method used to supply power to recharge the Nano's internal battery. You must purchase a separate USB power adapter ($29) if you want to recharge the iPod without using a computer with a USB port.  One of the biggest gripes about the Nano is how easily its shiny finish and display window scratches and this has actually generated a class action lawsuit against Apple claiming it to be a major design flaw. Apple claims that the scratch problem only effects a small percentage of Nano devices and that the problem is no worse than with previous versions of iPod devices. My suggestion is that you immediately purchase a protective cover or case along with your Nano so that you can protect it from this problem. Purchase a very high quality cover for the Nano such as a protective leather case from Pacific Design ($34.99) or a fully water proof, dirt proof, shock and drop proof enclosure from OtterBox ($39.95). Also, I do not recommend putting the iPod Nano in your pants pocket or along with keys or other gadgets since the color LCD display has been reported by some owners to crack or break under moderate force.    PROS: It is a compact, state of the art, digital media storage, image viewer and music playback device in an unbelievably tiny package It has a trend setting design, great sound quality, no moving parts, sharp and clear LCD color display, decent battery life, and includes the excellent iTunes and Quicktime software for integrating with your PC or Mac. It stores up to 500 songs for 2GB model and up to 1000 songs for the 4GB model.  CONS: It is fragile and scratch prone compared to previous iPods or other MP3 players. Many expensive accessories must be purchased to protect and fully utilize the Nano media device including a high quality protective case, better headphones, and an external power charger. The storage capacity may be limiting for some people. Although it can display images it does not play video media.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Expect to spend at least $100 or more for your extra accessories in addition to the original cost of Apple's iPod Nano package. If you are a previous iPod or MP3 music device owner you may want to consider the 4GB iPod Nano instead. After you invest more money for the essential Nano accessories that extra $50 for the 4GB Nano model to double the storage capacity is going to seem like a bargain. Because of the fragility of this device I would not recommend it for younger children and instead go with a less expensive iPod Shuffle and also take note of my volume level advice. As with any MP3 player users should keep the volume at medium or low settings and try not to use it for much longer than one hour (up to two hours maximum) per day since using music devices such as these with the in ear style headphones for long periods of time at higher volume levels can cause permanent hearing loss (this is especially a problem when using the earbud style of headphones). If you want to use your iPod in loud environments such as when traveling on a train or bus consider purchasing a set of compact noise cancelling headphones. There are also serious safety risks associated with using any music device such as an iPod with headphones while running, biking, or driving a motor vehicle on a public roadway.   THE BOTTOM LINE:  Apple's current version of the iPod Nano is one of the most truly awesome music and media players available and its sound quality, design, and software are state of the art but when adding in the extra cost of essential accessories and the device's questionable durability I am only able to give it a value rating of FOUR out of FIVE STARS.

<Title>I love my 2GB White iPod Nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the review I have been LONGING to make- one for a gorgous, beautiful white iPod nano! I got it for Christmas from my parents. I love my nano, I call it my ba"nana". (Nano, Nana) Its sitting next to me right now... I love it.   Unlike the iPod mini that my cousin got for Christmas, my iPod nano came charged and ready for action! When I opened the package, I took out my nano and quickly figured out how to turn it on and off! (But, playing with friends assortment of ipods, minis, nanos, videos, photos, and normal, didn't hurt a bit) This iPod is easy to learn how to use- EVEN IF you don't have prior experience!  My Computer if so old so I can't download songs from it. My mom is bringing her laptop home so I can download all my songs!So, all yesterdy, I played games on my iPod nano.  If you are thinking of getting a nano, GET ONE! but, get a 2GB White iPod Nano!   iPod addict, M@NDY

<Content>I ordered my "In Stock" Nano 2gb before Christmas, and paid $15 extra for next day delivery (to make sure it would arrive by my daughter's birthday on the 27th).  As of Dec 26th the delivery date's been updated to December 30th.  Classic deceptive marketing. The local retailer down the street now has a slew of them in-stock, so I'll buy mine there, and return Amazon's when it finally arrives. So much for quality of service.

<Title>Give Honor To Whom Honor Is Due
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I seldomly if ever give any reviews a five star rating. But I have to give honor where honor is due. Considering the fact that all of the the BEST BUYS  CIRCUIT CITY's and Comp USA in my area have sold out of all of their Ipods, shuffle, nano, etc. Apple must be doing something right. I must admit though I can appreciate a good gadget I have not been lusting over the ipod nano, I just recently decided to get it. I do admire the size of the nano but I also like the size of the shuffle. It was the color display that sold me. I can just see myself now surfing through the ipod shuffle frantically unable to find the song that I had in mind to listen to (not a good thing), so I decided to go with the nano. The ability to import 500 songs is also a plus although it will probably take years before I reach that capacity. I also like the thought of putting pictures on my nano. I have seven very adorable nieces. The headphones in my opinion are pretty comfortable and attractive (I'm from the old school when head-phones use to look like ear-muffs).  I don't have any prior experiece with ipods so I didn't quite know how to import my music right off the bat but I'm a swift sister and a smart cookie so I grasped it pretty quickly.

<Title>LOVIN IT!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this as a present for christmas. I had read and heard about it, but it's so true...you really dont believe how small it is til you actually hold it in your hand. Then you say to yourself..."is this possible?" Well it is, and it's quite the little gadget. Let me first say that (obviously) it is very compact and easy to slide into your pocket to carry around, which is nice for life on the move. Secondly, it is SOOO easy to transfer songs onto your ipod. If you don't already have a library on iTunes, the software is all included. Once you have all your songs on a playlist, it automatically transfers them for you, its great.  The only tiny downsides to the 2GB are that it only holds around the area of 500 songs, for some this may be perfect, but if you have a larger archive (like myself) the 4GB is definately for you.  oh and also the Black does tend to show scratches easily..but no need for me to get too critical...  This is an amazing device and trust me, you wont be disappointed!

<Title>Very Useful, but a Bit Pricey...
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod is a well-designed compressed music file player with easy-to-use resident software. Forget about the photo angle - the images are just too small to be useful. The iPod nano is all about music.  It's hard to get away from the fact that it's expensive for what it is and you're chained to Apple's software (iTunes) to get the job done. But it does that job very well indeed. Legal internet intrusion, obvious and not so obvious, is way out of hand these days so I'm glad I've iTunes set up on a computer that is never online. (I buy CDs and copy directly to the hard drive using preferred software.)  ITunes is now only available as a 36MBish download, so too bad if you don't connect or don't have broadband. Doubtless Apple wants us all to visit its site on a regular basis and be uniquely identified and enticed to buy. Arguably, copying entire CDs or just our favourite tracks is the best approach for those who are definitely serious about their music rather than those who collect a mass of Chart songs and listen to them as if the whole process is some kind of fashion statement. Arguably!  Music on the move doesn't appeal to a lot of people. The headphones aren't great, background sound can be a nuisance, and there are health concerns over sound levels. Thankfully the iPod gives us the option to dock it with something substantial like Monitor Audio's excellent I-deck or smaller portable players such as Koda's Imoves. Or you can simply connect your player to your hi-fi with the appropriate lead.  I originally bought a 2GB iPod and quickly filled it. I have quite a collection of homemade compilation CDs that hold all my favourite tracks from the last 35 years and along with a few special complete albums they very neatly filled the 1.8GB capacity with 404 songs (the Yes album "Relayer" included). So I bought a 4GB iPod to take me much further with new rock releases and classical and Irish music too, and I much prefer the choice of 2 iPods.  To have all your favourite music residing in a couple of tiny players is a real boon. It's the most efficient way of managing and listening to music. Put them in Exspect EX410 cases - very well made.

<Title>Great player....but a little pricey
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to upgrade from a 64MB player, so this was a BIG change.  It is definitely a good buy, but I believe Apple could come down on the price a bit. It is very easy to use, but if you're not used to iPods, the click wheel can be a little tricky at first. It doesn't come with a charger so the only way to charge it is to plug it in to a computer; you can, however, purchase one.  Overall, this is a good player, but if you're looking for a bargain-look elsewhere.   Also, all you who are complaining about not being able to fit enough music on you 2GB iPod...it's a 2GB iPod- you knew what you were buying!

<Content>I had a really hard time justifying the purchase of an MP3 player that cost this much (yeah, I'm a tightwad), especially one made by Apple. >:)  Now that I've got it... I FRIGGIN LOVE it! I have an audio port in my car stereo so it works out great. I don't even carry CDs around anymore. It's easy to use, very small and looks pretty cool too.  My only complaint would be that you are expected to use iTunes with it. There are hacks that you can find on the net that allow you to play MP3s without having them converted to the proprietary format. I got used to iTunes... it's not so bad. I've since made it my default MP3 player and have actually grown fond of it.  **shrugs** Just my .02 worth.

<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my second mp3 player, after owning a Creative 30GB Creative Zen for 2.5 yrs. I needed something small (vs the hard drive) and sleek.  This Nano has AWESOME sound, and I just love the size.   The minus :  - Yup, I should have bought the 4 GB Nano as it was a downgrade from my 30 gb mp3 player to this little one. So I had to select the songs that I REALY love to go into this little thing.   - iTunes are not as user friendly as Creative Software. Too many steps to properly classify the songs in my playlists. Have to have more patience to add songs hence, the 4 stars.  I still will not give up my Creative Nomad, it gives me longer listening pleasure at work. So Nano is my companion for when I commute to work.   No regrets buying the Nano...whoever's thinking about it, get the 4GB one!

<Title>Apple's small wonder
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most other reviews have touched on the major points of the iPod nano, so I just want to make a few observations:  -Yes, the iPod nano is almost disturbingly tiny, and you'll definitely want to get a case of some sort to keep it in lest you lose it or accidentally swallow it.  -Yes, the 4 GB version is probably a better buy if this is going to be your only MP3 player.   But if you have another, larger one the 2 GB will do just fine if you just use it for the gym, the bus ride home, etc.      -The headphone jack on the nano is on the bottom, as opposed to the top- that doesn't make much sense to me, but you get used to it.  The "hold" switch is very tiny as well.  -The sound is great.  -I was surprised at how well photos turn up- the screen is about the same size as the screen on my digital camera, but photo resolution on the nano is *amazing.* Although, a zoom feature would have been nice.  -While the sticker for this iPod says $199, expect to pay *much* more for essential accessories.  My older 20 GB iPod came with an AC charger, but newer models don't- there's $30-40 right there.  And virtually all cases for this are outlandishly expensive- I paid $29 for a sport sleeve with an armband for gym use, and that was one of the cheaper ones.  And it's not just Apple gouging customers- most third party accessories are just as expensive.  I've complained a lot, but when all is said and done, the iPod nano is a really cool product.  (By the way, I'd recommend white over black, because as another reviewer said, white hides scratches and smudges better.)

<Title>Whoa!!! Coolest  Mp3 player  you can find on the market.
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As I said it, it is the COOLEST MP3 player in the market. It can hold up to 500 songs. (Average: 4 minutes each song ).This includes earphones, USB charger for iPod, iTunes CD, and instructions manual. The cool things about this iPod are: -Very small and very light. -Easy to charge. - Easy to download music. - It has games. - It's in color. - High quality sound.(Incredible) - 14 hours of music playback. - Can hold photos. Now the only bad thing: - It is very fragile, so if you are  not careful with your things, buy another iPod.If you have butterfingers and drop it, its screen will break. I really recommend this iPod, and if you buy it, you will need to be very careful. Definitely worth buying.

<Title>Really Nice!
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really wanted this iPod for Christmas and I was extremely happy when I saw it. The black is so, well, black, and tha back of it is a mirror. I was very satisfied with it. The sound comes through very clear, and if you get an iTunes giftcard it is alot of fun to buy songs from the iTunes store. For the most part, the nano is supremely perfect. There is only a few minor dislikes about it :  1. The back of the iPod nano gets fingerprints on it very easily, so hopefully there will be cases soon. 2.When you play brick, the click wheel does not move that well.  Those are the only things that would cause a small problem, but they are easy to overcome. Buy a cover and get better hand coordination! I hope you like it as much as I do!! ;)

<Title>Good, but...
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I haven't had the iPod Nano long (since Christmas actually), but -so far- it's been a great MP3 player.  I got the white one because I read how easily scratches and how easily fingerprints show up on the black one.  It does mark quite easily on the mirrored back, but a cover should fix that problem.  I do find the Click Wheel a little confusing because I can't really use it simply to select items like Music or Photos (I have to move my finger really slow to make sure the highlighted area on the screen even moves down, or up, to my intended selection).  Overall, though, I am satisfied with the purchase.

<Title>An Upgrade Is Wise
<Date>Sun Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was not sure I got such a great deal with a 1 G iPod, so I returned it and for $50 more got the same thing only with twice the memory (2 G). Because I still feel the ear buds are `tinny' sounding and inconvenient, I bought a nice lightweight pair of snug headphones.  Solved that problem.  As for the small size problem, I ended up leaving it in my jeans and washing it!  Guess what!  It still works, which is a major kudos to Apple from a PC person.  So, I purchased a protecting case, which makes it a little larger.  Now, I also get 500 songs instead of less than 250.   You'll still need to buy a magnifying glass to read the serial number, but this idiot found out that the number is on the outside of the box!  Lessons can be learned!

<Title>Size doesn't matter
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first, I didn't want to buy a nano, since I was afraid that it wouldn't be as good as a regular iPod, and that it would break easily. The nano has taken away those fears, it's actually better than a regular iPod in some ways. It's easier to fit in my pocket(storage of choice on the go), and the sound quality was even better than some I've heard for iPods'. Plus, after using it for a while, it seems very sturdy for something that size and width. I recommend this product whole-heartedly, it deserves the highest stars. Happy shopping!

<Title>Very Good
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I am not a kid. I recieved my Ipod nano as a gift last christmas and have had it for 9 months now and I can say I am pleased with it. There have been no problems so far with it. Its a great gift except its fragile and scratches easily. Installing Itunes on my computer was a sinch and transferring songs onto it was very easy. But I do have a problem with the battery life, it does not last long but I have an answer to everyone's problems: The backlight on the IPod drains the power when its turned on, so to make the battery last longer, just simply shut the backlight off. The headphones that came with it broke so instead I bought a pair of Philips headphones that go over my head.  The IPod nano is good for long car trips and I take mine with me everywhere I go.

<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod 2 months ago and I love it! At first, it didn't charge all the way but after a visit to the Apple website troubleshooting I got it running. It sucks that its doesn't have an FM tuner, video, or a very big capacity, but it works for people like me. I travel a lot and was always tired of lugging my CD player and CD case around. Just make sure you keep and eye on it-it can get lost pretty easily. I definetly recommend the white-my best friend got a black one and her fingerprints show up all over! A good buy, but not the best price. You might want to compare the prices at different stores before you go out and buy it.

<Title>Not Perfect, But Beats the Rest
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my iPod on the 29th of December after waiting for only 3 days. (I ordered on Christmas.) The first thing you realize when you open it is, in fact, it is a lot smaller than anything you've ever seen. But after using for only a couple of hours, it feels custom made for your hand. It's the perfect size. The color screen is easily readable and crisp, even at its 1.5 inch size. The headphones are actually very good, with the possible exception of the fact that even with the Bass Booster EQ on, there is still a little bass lacking.     Paired with iTunes, the iPod is incredibly easy to use. The organization of the music proves priceless when trying to find one out of 500 songs. The scroll wheel is very accurate, sometimes even too accurate. Occasionally it is possible to pass what you're looking for, but not very often. The only problems I've had with iTunes is importing my CDs into it, but that's because there's so many scratches on them.     But even the iPod has a couple of faults. One is the battery life. It takes a couple sets of completely draining the battery and recharging it to get to the 14 hours you should have, but then power hangs there every time you recharge. My other main quibble is that when you are playing the tracks, there is a tiny gap of silence between tracks, especially when the tracks blend into each other. The scratching isn't all that much of an issue at this point, even only using the case it comes with. So, despite these few minor complaints, I award the iPod nano 5 stars...for not being perfect, but for beating all the rest.  Edit: I've now had the ipod for over a week. The scratching has indeed started, although I don't have anything too horrible on my iPod yet. I still rate it at 5 stars.

The only reason why i got an Ipod was b/c i was tired of seeing my LITTLE brother with his all the time (he has the shuffle, which is cool, too.).  It was annoying.  I am glad I got this.  It rocks.

<Title>Good product, but it isn't perfect
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod Nano is the perfect MP3 combination of looks, charm and functionality, but it lacks real durability.  Don't get me wrong, I think this thing is pretty amazing--its size, its screen, etc.  My complaints come in the fact its LCD screen scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I mean, you'd think Apple would've developed a less scratchable screen by now, right?  The TouchWheel is an amazing invention, but sometimes it is so sensitive it becomes hard to navigate through the menu (the slighest quiver in your finger could move the highlighted bar someplace else in an instant).  It's a good product, definitely, but it ain't perfect.

<Title>Decent product, EXCEPT...
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of researching about the iPod Nano before I put it on my Christmas list.  Though the black one definitely looked cooler, I read that they showed scratches and fingerprints more than the plain colorless model--so I decided to go for the white.  It is an ingenious design, sexy and sleek, but it lacks true durability.  The LCD screen is as easily scratched as Jessica Simpson is easily notorious for saying something blonde--a downfall for the overall superb Nano.  (So far) the iPod Nano has proven its worth save for the too high-price for a 2GB model, scratchable screen and outrageous prices for separate accessories (please, do lanyard headphones really cost $40??).  Now Apple just needs to fix those things and the iPod Nano could be THE perfect MP3 player!

<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really awesome, i've never had an ipod before, so if there are any features that were available on previous ipods that are not included in this ipod, i am not aware of them.  included with the ipod are:   Ipod nano      itunes and ipod insataller software      USB cord to connect and charge the ipod      earbuds (headphones)      ipod nano dock converter, to change universal docks to ipod nano docks    thin gray protector case. I would reccomend getting another case to really protect the ipod, that you can use while playing the ipod     instructions  sadly the ipod nano does not include a charger that you can plug into the wall...the main reason for me giving the ipod 4 stars. in order to charge the ipod, you must leave the ipod plugged into your computer through the USB port, with the computer on which ends up staying on all night in order to just charge an ipod...a waste of energy if you ask me. if you havn't heard it enough the screen gets scratched really easily.   If you can, order the ipod through apple.com, because they will engrave it for free.

<Content>I received this for my birthday and turned out to be the only one in my school with it until Christmas cam and EVERYONE got it. This iPod has very good sound quality and its screen is very clear. It is easy to carry around and if you have a case, don't be afraid that you'll lose it. It is easy to use and the roller thing is very sensitive to everything. Because it is so litte, it sometimes gets lost. It also scratches very easily. On the first day, it was all in scratches and looked really bad until Christmas cam and my brother got me a case from Target. Now it is safe and free from scratches. I am happy to have gotten this for my birthday.

<Title>Great iPod Update
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first iPod was a 3rd generation 10GB version that I bought before the iPod craze took off.  I held off buying new revisions because they didn't seem that much different from my original iPod.  But when the Nano was announced, I was amazed that Apple had developed a flash player in such a tiny form.  I knew it was time to get a new one.    First, the Nano is incredibly tiny.  It is thin, light, and so small that it feels fragile.  Pictures do not accurately portray how small it is, you need to actually hold one to understand why people are so amazed by it.  The small size is ideal for people who might be taking it with them to the gym or to other activities.  It doesn't weigh you down and is a great companion.  While the small size is impressive and beneficial, it does feel fragile and probably requires more care than other iPods.  I personally treat all my electronic goodies very well, but for less careful people I could see the potential for some damage to the Nano.    Second, the sound is great, just like previous iPods.  Apple did not sacrifice sound quality while shrinking down the size of the Nano.    Third, it's got great battery life, I'm not sure if I get the 14 hours Apple claims, but it's still more than enough for me.  Also, it has a great color screen, but the small size isn't that impressive when showing off photos or album covers.  But at least you can store photos and album covers if you wanted to.    Any negative to the Nano might be the fact that it is more susceptible to scratches.  During a recent visit to the Apple store I noticed all the display Nanos were very scratched while video iPods were not so much.  However, like I said above, I keep very good care of my electronic devices so my Nano has no scratches even though I've used it almost daily for a month.  I basically use two iPod socks, one inside the other to cover the nano and it's been fine.  I don't put it in a pocket with keys, I don't stuff it into a bag, I just take reasonable precautions considering it's such a tiny device.  I've accepted the fact that it will eventually get scratches so I did buy a white one because scratches are less noticeable compared to the black nano.    Although scratches are a potential problem, the incredible size, looks, and ease of use of the Nano make this a great item to purchase.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>The iPod "Nana  nana na na!" - you bought into the hype
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is OK, but not really worth the hefty price.  It is a glorified USB flash drive with a control button and display screen.  I researched several players and became convinced that the Creative Zen was the way to go - better value, better player.  Alas, my son just had to have the iPod.  The Pros: -Easy to use. -Not quite as delicate as people say. -Decent, but not outstanding, battery life. -Plenty of accessories available.  The Cons: -Way, way overpriced.  Even the cases are overpriced. -Very little storage (at 2GB or 4GB) for the price tag.  The storage is adequate, just a poor value. -iTunes......what a chore.  Yes, its fairly simple to use, but its just not as easy as a straight copy of music files off a hard drive or CD.  Now, of course, if downloading songs for a buck a pop is something you are into - then buy the iPod , but if you want to use common, free software to upload your music - go for a Creative Zen - just about any model.    Bottom line, unless you can afford to go for one of the video iPods (and want video), this device is all hype and offers little in the way of value, features, or performance that can be had from other brands for much, much less.

<Title>Get to know it and you'll love it!
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod was actually not my 1st choice. I have an Apple computer so logically this had to be the best MP3 player for me. The thing is that I dislike the fuss about iPods. I sigh seeing this human wave at train stations in the morning 1 out of 2 wearing the very recognizable (and thief magnet for the same price) white earphones with that irritating look on their face saying 'I'm so cool I have an iPod'.  The Nano eventually got into my life when my boyfriend got me one for Xmas while I was still hunting for the perfect MP3 player (and what a hassle when you have an Apple computer but don't want an iPod). After a few pbs I must say I absolutely love it and I'm convinced it's one of the best MP3 players on the market.  I read a lot about people slagging it off usually about battery life, scratches and non-replaceable battery. I would say that it's neither true nor wrong. Once you know about this incredible piece of technology you'll be a happy customer. So here's my list of good and bad:  Bad:  - The volume is controlled from the wheel. If it's in your pocket it can easily goes up and down and this is very annoying. I would have rather have an independent volume control on the side. - Apple doesn't provide with enough information on how to use it on the documentation coming along. A visit on the Apple website is almost compulsory - Picture transfer: Took me about a week before I knew how to do it. Technically I could but the pix wouldn't show on my Nano. Only because I searched in the Apple discussions I eventually found why In short you will need to transfer your pix before you transfer you music. - Earphones: No matter how cool you think you are wearing these, first they are very average. Second you'll be spotted right away by thieves. I would suggest that you buy earphones with a remote volume control. This is especiallly useful if your -like me- iPod fully protected. - Scratches: It does get scratched very quickly. But that's the same with a lot of other MP3s or even mobile phones. Get a case, full stop. You're spoilt for choice and this will also let you personalize your iPod. But I agree this adds up to the price of your MP3 player. - Still pricey compared to other MP3 players but DO compare and you will realize that's worth your money - If you listen to a mix or albums with no gaps between songs (like 'Dark side of the moon' by Pink Floyd), the Nano pauses for a quarter of a second. Ruins mixes a bit!  Good:  - Light, sexy, sleek design - Battery charge when fully discharged takes about 3 hours. A few words about the battery. Again pay a visit to the Apple website on how to get the most of your battery. The time given is an average. A lot of factors influence the length the battery runs. As an example, I start using mine at 7am on shuffle mode, listen to it for most of the day til 7pm. It usually goes totally flat at 8pm. To me this is excellent (compared to my boyfriend's Archos). - Apple has an excellent replacement program if your battery has come to its end of life (after 300/400 charge cycles) or if it happens that your battery is defective. - Colour screen is tiny but pictures are crisp and clear. You can also have the cd cover showing while the song plays. I realy like that feature. - Extremely easy to use, not just an MP3 player (see specs). - For Apple users, AAC files are the best format. Smaller than MP3s and better quality.

<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple's iPod Nano is a great product, although not perfect: using its features is not always intuitive, but with some effort, one can master its functions. I especially like the automatic-update feature whenever it is connected to iTunes. I purchased a cheap MP3 player awhile ago and it is completely useless. It is gathering dust until I find the manufacturer and make him eat it. I recommend the iPod to any serious lover of music (and audio books, photos, etc.).

<Content>If I can prevent one person from going through Apple hell I will be happy. My 3 month old Ipod locks up after every use, requiring rehooking it up to the computer and also recharging since it locks in the on position and drains battery.  I called customer service (always a 15 minute wait) and was told that my Ipod was out of warranty--yet it's only 3 months old!  She finally agreed I was in warranty period, told me she would send packaging for Ipod return.  14 days later I still have not received packaging, I call back and am told again I'm out of warranty. Now I'm asked to fax proof of purchase and wait up to 5 days to hear from them.  But they won't mail me package for return until after that call.  I can see I won't have the I pod for a couple of weeks more. I asked if I could return it to the Apple store.  Not without an appointment with a "Mac Genius".  Called the store.  Recording says I can't get an appointment over the phone. This is not worth any product.

<Title>Tiny and convenient
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my nano from Best Buy a few months ago and I love it. It's so small that it first perfectly in my pocket...even in it's case. I use it for jogging in the morning or listening to music at work. The battery lasts literally all day and it doesn't take long to charge. The only peeve I have is that on occasion it doesn't want to turn off when I try to hold down the button. That's only happened twice though. I think it's well worth getting and it's nice and small so it doesn't take up any room in my purse or my backpack.

<Title>Nice but price is a drawback
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So much has already been written about the iPod that I need not mention about its sound quality and other functions. I will just suggest anyone who wants to buy an iPod to go to Apple's website and checkout the 'refurbished' iPods too. They go at a real low price but are still backed by Apple's 1 year warranty. Although I haven't bought one for myself, but consider this, 2 gigs nano for 199 $, and a 30 gig 'refurbished' iPod with video playback and Apple's warranty, 199$. And since they are refurbished by Apple itself, one shouldn't worry about the quality. Give it a thougth guys.

<Title>Great Product!,Scratches easily.
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved the 2GB iPod nano for Christmas from my dad. The day I got it, I was extremely excited. The nano is very small and the sound quality is amazing. I still haven't figured out exactly how to put photos on, because the instructions that come with the nano are not detailed, and basically tell you to follow the directions that come up when you put in the cd, no mention of pictures. So, the website helps a lot. On the down side, the iPod scratches EXTREMELY easily, but what would you expect, so do the other iPods. So a must buy to go along with the nano is a case. ( Mine STILL hasn't arrived!) But the cases look good, as well. Overall I give the nano 4 stars.

<Title>why I pod sucks
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Last year, against my better judgment, I let my teenage daughter buy a mini-I-pod (since this is a service related complaint, it applies to all apple mp-3 players). I had advised her not to do it. I knew that the hard-drive was fragile, and the words "fragile" and "teenager" are not normally a good mix. I also didn't like the battery. But my daughter wanted to use I-tunes. Plus she thought the other models were nerdy. In order to protect us against normal teenage behavior, I paid for the extended warranty, which is 60 dollars, or about a third of the price of the I-pod.  Our mistake.  Technically, it is OK other than the battery issue (the battery cannot be replaced). But the service is insultingly bad, the worst service I've ever experienced from a retail company.  We first learned of the service problems when my daughter had a sound problem that turned out to be multiple headphone failure, not Apple's fault. I tried calling the local store, but they are not accessible by phone. The phone links to a central tech support line, which on high use hours may require 30 minutes or more on hold. So we took it into the store, which has a tech support section (the "genius bar" or "Conceirge service"). But you cannot get walk-in service. To get to talk to a tech support employee you have to make an appointment on line. You cannot make an appointment in advance unless you pay 100 dollars for "Procare" service (I don't know any other retail operation that requires you to pay 100 dollars to make an appointment for service). Otherwise, appointments are available only on a same day basis, first come, first serve, assuming their server works (more on that later). In order to make an appointment after normal working hours (so you don't have to take a day off to service an I-pod), you have to wait until all the earlier appointments are full, but not wait too long or the "genius bar" will be full. I thought of just making 20 appointments and filling up the day-that might work, although it inconveniences everyone else.   Our big problem came when my daughter's battery died after about 10 months of use. This is not a problem that can be resolved by the "genius bar". You have to call the central number for technical support, which will send you a shipping package with a DHL label (our mailing label was missing the proper return address), which you then have to deliver to the DHL mailer.  We did this, and after over a week with no response, I called the central tech support unit. It took me 20 minutes to get a service rep. He checked the computer, then put me on hold for another five minutes. When he came back, he told me that they found a small dent in the unit, and that voided the warranty, but for 210 dollars they could send me a new machine. I asked to speak to his supervisor, which just got me another 15 minutes on hold and a lecture on how this small dent eliminated their obligation to repair the machine. I told them that we had not noticed any damage when we returned it, and it could have been damaged after shipment. I reminded them that I had purchased an extended warranty, and that if they were voiding this during the original period of the warranty, I would demand a full refund of the warranty price. Nothing dissuaded them from their position.  We had them ship the machine back (DHL packages require a signed receipt, and had we not been home when it arrived we would have had to make a trip to DHL to pick it up). I tried to make a service appointment, but their server was down for a week (and this is a computer company?). My wife and I finally walked in and demanded to see the manager. The manager and sales rep were actually sympathetic and friendly, but the tech supervisor looked at the I-Pod (with a very small dent in the upper right hand corner), and lectured us on how that voided the warranty and they could never allow for a return. My wife and I (both of us were now furious, both at the time we had to waste on this and the 300 plus dollars we had invested in this machine, accessories and I-tunes) then had full scale tantrums, yelling and screaming until their techie, lecturing us on how to use their equipment properly and warning us that this is a once in a life-time exemption that would apply to any future purchases (I told him that was no problem--I would promise to never buy an apple product again) gave us a new mini-ipod--otherwise we would have driven every customer out of the store.   What I don't understand is from a purely business point of view, this makes no sense. If they voided our warranty, they would have to refund our extended warranty contract (we are still in the period of the original warranty), which is 60 bucks. That is probably more than the cost to them of the item, which is now discontinued anyway. Instead, they have permanently alienated a family who already owns two I pods (we had to buy one for our younger daughter so she could use her sister's I-tunes) worth over 600 bucks w/accessories, and a household with 2 computers and 3 mp-3 players.  I remember when Apple advertised themselves as the David fighting the IBM Goliath. Now that they have a near monopoly on a product, they are the big, unfeeling company. Their business model seems to be modeled after an elite club for those worthy of their great product. But no other retail business gives this kind of shoddy service (other than other quasi-monopolies like cable companies). There are other Mp-3 players available that you can buy from normal retail outlets, and if they die these companies will accept them back even if they have a small dent in the right hand corner.  So why buy apple?

<Title>It's what the people want
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod Mini was discontinued because they made a brand new flash memory 2 GB Ipod Nano. The old Ipod Minis had hard drives, which usually skipped once in a while, or it wore out, no way to replace it, making it work again. If the hard drive dies, there goes your Ipod. Flash memory is just a memory stick inside, it can't jump or anything, and it can be very small. That is why the Ipod Nano is so small. That is the only reason why I like the Ipod shuffle.  If you like to hold a lot of music, but not "a lot" of music, the Ipod nano is right for you. It holds up to almost 1000 songs and you can delete the songs if you want to. On the color screen, it shows the song that you are playing, how long it has been playing, and how much longer the song is.   Of course, the Ipod Nano, like all other Ipods, have games on it, they are really interesting, for an Ipod. It would be better if there were better choices. I was just surprised by what games were on there.   Itunes, is the fortunate things for the Ipods and not for the MP3 players, which is not really fair. It is cool that you can go online, pick a song, and just put it on your playlist. Then, you can put it on your Ipod.  It is really easy to start up. You just put in a disk, or software, and you put in basic information, and you can choose certain things if you want them. Just so you know, this software will install Quicktime on your computer, just so you know if you didn't want it.  I was always wondering if there was no such thing as the Ipod Mini with the hard drive, and the Ipod Nano would still be called an Ipod Nano. I would think it would be called the Ipod Nano, at least in my opinion.  The Ipod Nano is very enjoying, and it was worth the money if you want to go out and spend your money on it.

<Content>I bought my self the iPod Nano 2GB for Xmast, it's the first iPod i've owned, I thought that 2GB with space for 500 songs would be more than enough, however I was wrong. I regret that for $50.00 more I could have bought the 4GB with capacity for 1,000 songs. The nano is great, save for the screen that can be scratched very easily, even if you try to cleanit with a soft wet cloth. My recommendation is that if you want one, don't bother with the 2GB and buy the 4GB instead and get a case to protect it, it'll be worth the extra $$$.

<Title>I love my iPod!
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to own a 1GB iPod Shuffle, but I recently got a black 2GB iPod Nano for my 19th birthday. After having a Shuffle, the Nano is a BIG improvement.  Pros and cons of the Nano: (in my opinion)  Pros: 01. The screen - after having a Shuffle with no screen, now having one is great. It makes accessing my music so much easier. And it's a colour screen, so everything looks cool. 02. The capacity - I know there's a 4GB version but I got this for a gift, so I didn't get to choose the size. I have over 1000 songs on my computer only listen to like 500, so this size is perfect. Again, after having a Shuffle the upgrade is great. 03. The size - of course. This thing is as light as a feather and just as thin. 04. The fact that it charges through the computer - you don't need a dock to charge it, it plugs into a USB port. Very easy for me. 05. The sound is crisp and clear - I'm still using the same earphones as I used with my Shuffle (I gave the new earphones and the Shuffle to my Mum), and it sounds as good as ever. 06. All the little extras - apart from the music, you can store photos, play games, have contacts, a clock and various other things.  Cons: 01. The black version of the Nano gets smudged VERY easily. I've only had it for less then a week and already there is fingerprints all over it. 02. The fact that the battery slowly drains - you can't actually turn a Nano off. You just put it to sleep and the battery very slowly drains. This is going to annoy me as I sometimes don't use my iPod for weeks and then I'll go to turn it on and the battery is flat.  The cons are just trivalities - as I'm going to buy some covers and it only takes three hours to charge the Nano they don't really bother me.  It comes packaged with a CD-ROM with iTunes on it (I already had it), earphones, little buds for the earphones, a small instruction booklet and Apple stickers.  Overall, the Nano is a nifty little piece of technology that I'm glad I own. I love listening to music while I'm sitting on the bus, so to have the Nano and 500 songs of my collection at my fingertips is perfect. 5 stars.

<Title>I'm Not an Owner, I'm Just Very Opinionated
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello, fellow Amazon customers.  I'm the proud owner of a nearly 18 month old iPod mini.  Some people should get Nanos, and some people just shouldn't.  I'm here to tell you my reasons, and hopefully help you decide whether the Nano is right for you.  If you are prone to breaking things, then this model is not for you.  My twelve-year-old cousin got a Nano for his birthday, and within a month, the screen was broken.  The music would still play, but the screen had a crack on it like broken glass that prevented him from properly using the features.  Luckily, my cousin had a warranty.  If you already have a perefctly functioning iPod and just want a new one because Nanos are popular right now, please hold back.  Just think, in the space of a few years, Apple has come out with the original iPod, the Mini, the Shuffle, the Video, and now the Nano.  Who knows what they will have to offer soon that may surpass even the Nano?  Holding out may prove advantageous.    If you are a diehard music fanatic with thousands of songs in your collection, then this is obviously not the iPod for you.  Consider the Video or the iPods with larger amounts of memory.  However, if you are a newcomer to the realm of the iPods and want something aestitically attractive and compact, and if you don't have an extensive music library, then the Nano is probably for you.  Although you have to get the more expensive 6GB model for the 1,000 songs promised on the ever-so-trendy commercials.  Another benefit of getting an iPod at the peak of its popularity is the omnipresence of cases available, from the practical to the downright garish.  Happy listening. :)

Her nano is much smaller and lighter than my video and she can take it with her during her daily work outdoors. An H2O case and armband complete the secure portability of this really terrific device. As always, Amazon delivered it quickly and without a hitch. Ipod Nano, Audible and Amazon are highly recommended.

<Title>Sweet player, but is pricey and lacks an FM tuner + recording abilities
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent functionality and features. Plays songs clearly and the size is phenomenal. The thing even has games on it (including solitare) that you can play while listening to music on it. Read other glowing reviews for the great features (since there are many), but I want to get to a possible cheaper alternative and also some of the downfalls of this device that other players offer.  The price and that there are no FM tuner or voice recording features are what pull down my rating. Yes, I cannot deny the iPod Nano is an amazing piece of technology, but seriously, these things cost a lot and there are other players that will due for most people at cheaper prices and with features the iPod Nano doesn't offer. Unless you are in need of keeping an enormous amount of music with you and/or need lots of room for multiple "books on tape" (converted to MP3s), a 1GB MP3 player is probably really what an individual needs. For a great 1GB player, check out the Creative Zen Nano Plus*. *This device has an FM tuner, it will record the radio onto the player, it has a voice recorder, an input for recording CDs directly to the player, and its height and length are less than that of the iPod Nano (but the Nano is thinner).  Summary: great player and design, but also check out the Creative Zen Nano Plus and other players for alternative features that may be of interest plus a lower price. Also, if you do decide to get an iPod, get a white one since scratches don't show as much (they show up on the black one more).

<Title>Great MP3 player.........when it works
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now don't get me wrong, the apple iPod Nano is a great mp3 player, but it has a few flaws. First of all, it does scratch very easily as you have probably heard already, and second, my nano's screen has been freezing alot lately. It will freeze, so then I will have to let the battery drain completely so that it "dies", then I have to let it charge up again. It will let me listen to music for a little while and then the screen will freeze again. I'm going to return mine and see if it can be fixed as soon as possible. I don't know if this problem is just on mine, or if it is a frequent problem with other iPod Nanos. The iPod Nano does have very good sound quality and the light up screen is very good also. If this is a problem with just mine, and all the others work fine, this is a definite buy; and if many of the iPod Nano's have this problem, I'd be looking for a different mp3 player that wouldn't lock up.

THE NANO CAN ALSO DO THIS.  Then, the look. You dont wanna be carrying an ungly device around with you 24/7. THE NANO IS SO FAB THAT YOU'LL WANNA TAKE IT OUT IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NOT LET THEM LAY A FINGER ON IT -SERIOUSLY.  Pros: Looks fabulous Sounds like any MP3 player should Can stock up decent amounts of your favorite music Nice little extras here and there Stock images as well as music  Cons: .Very fragile .You cant keep your eyes of it .The black version scratches very easily -so be carefull with it! .Battery life may not be decent for hardocre/all day music listeners, but this isnt a problem for me as I charge it every night .Cant think of more  This little gadget may not be for everyone, but it defently is for me!!

<Title>Great Product! Great Sound! Likes to smudge!
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm bought this item, opened it (nice box) and there it was, this little... "Thing". The Ipod Nano is a very good mp3 player. Music, Games, Pictures. Its great! That cool little clickwheel can be a little sensitive from time to time. No big deal. Ihated carrying around a cd player, and tons of cd's. This is so much easier, especially for me going back and forth from school. Nice color screen, extremely thin, and looks great. But be aware, as soon as you admire the beauty look at the back. The Metalic back would work great for the police and CSI. This thing attracts smudges and finger prints like a light attracts bugs! Get a cleaning cloth, then buy a skin or a case! I havent seen any scratches... yet. You can notice it less on the white version. The black is still the coolest because it sets apart from the other white ones... it makes it uniqe. Sound Quality is great! There is definatly bass.  Pros: Great sound Looks great Nice black color Metalic Back Games, something fun to do Cool click wheel Nice color screen  Cons: SMUDGES LIKE CRAZY! (just buy a skin or case)  other than that no problems. Great product for people on the go and don't want to spend $400 on a Ipod Video, and don't need the extra features, just music.  BUY!

<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a 2gb ipod nano and I love it! Here's a list of pros and cons-  Pros- very small + portible       stylish (for those who really care)       holds a good amount of songs (500 or 1000)       great quality sound       bright and legible screen       fun games and features  Cons- more fragile than a mini       sumdges EXTREMELY easily (something that drives me   insane, even thouh I have a case)         all in all, this is THE BEST mp3 player for a person with a $250 or less budget and cares more about size than capacity. When I took my new nano out of its box my mother gaped at it and said, "That's it!? I paid how much for what?!" (One must hold a nano to appericiate its size)She has since gotten over her shock.

<Title>iPod nano = LOVE
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my iPod nano on Christmas 2005. I recieved a 2GB version in black. For me, the 2GB isn't a problem.. for some people, it is! If you're one of those crazy-into-music gotta have 1,000 songs kind of person, then get the 4GB. But if you're laid back.. listens to music whenever.. can listen to the same song and still love it kind of person, the 2GB is for you.    (Knock Wood) I have had no problem with any scratches or smudges on my black nano. I bought a "nano fling" from the Apple Store, and it is working out great. The color screen is great, the sound is great, I love my nano.    Unfortunatley, there are always pros/cons in the nano. One of the problems with it is that you cannot delete a song from the nano unless you want to delete all of the songs. I'm sure this is true with every iPod, but it is a real pain for me.    Overall, I love my nano and will never get rid of it. It is a perfect little toy that I love to play with. I reccommend the black nano, but if you get mad over little smudges or scratches, get the white nano.

<Title>A great product !
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am so in love with this thing!  After bad experiences with Sandisk and iriver players, I finally wised up.  I am kicking myself for ever wasting time and money on anything else.  The interface is so elegant and intuitive it puts the others to shame.  I can do anything I need to do without even looking at the player.    The sound is excellent of course, but I am not getting near the 14-hour battery life advertised.  That may be more because of the way I use it, though.  It's still plenty adequate.  I bought an after-market AC charger for about $6 that seems to work just as well as the $30 charger Apple should have included.  One of the best products I have ever purchased!

<Content>I bought the Nano for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it! At first she was concerned because she had heard that the quality of sound from the ear buds was not great, but she is quite pleased with them. She even let her dear old dad check them out, and now I want one! She had no problems getting music on to it. Since it charges through the USB port, it makes maintaining it quite simple.

<Title>Geez, how did they make it so small?
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is just incredibly small!  I upgraded (or downgraded, depending on how you look at it) from a 4th Gen. 20GB iPod and the first thing that pleased me was that I can easily carry this in my pocket.  Very easily; I can even keep my cell phone and iPod in the same pocket without squeezing either one in.  As for features, this is my first color screen iPod, so I liked the color display along with the album art.  You can keep photos also, but the screen is awfully tiny to really view them comfortably.  The case I'm using with my iPod is the Agent 18 shield, which is basically a clear plastic shell that encases the iPod.  It's one of the cheapest cases you can buy, but it works very well.  I would recommend that, as iPods (especially the BLACK ones) are prone to scratching.  My only BIG complaint as a long-time iPod user is that Apple no longer supplies the AC adapter as standard; it's a $29 addition.  I didn't mind Apple ditching the remote and dock as standard accessories earlier, but I wish they didn't ditch the AC adapter as well.  It would be  better to have included the adapter instead of the cheap worthless "case".  Overall, it's a very functional iPod.  Now I'm waiting for Apple to come out with a video iPod that runs on flash memory instead of a hard drive; that certainly will be my next iPod after this one.

<Title>iPod is neat, iTunes is awful
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In keeping with Apple's tradition of placing form over function, the iPod Nano is yet another masterpiece of industrial design. The minimalist controls, the sleek and elegant shape of the case, and the carefully crafted user interface will please the most people.  But the iPod is not without its flaws. In order to keep the controls and user interface simple on the device, Apple pushed almost all functionality over to their iTunes application. Without iTunes, the iPod is practically worthless.   When I tried to set up my iPod, I first had to install the included iTunes/Quicktime CD-ROM. Apple bundles Quicktime and iTunes together, so you cannot install one without the other. When I tried to install the application, there was some kind of error that damaged my computer's registry. So not only was I unable to use iTunes, I couldn't visit any websites that used Quicktime. Worse, the damage somehow affected some drivers so that my PC wouldn't recognize my HP Personal Media Drive. After hours of troubleshooting, I had to reinstall my operating system. I then tried to reinstall iTunes, but there was another kind of error, so iTunes wouldn't install properly. I could sync my existing music library with the iPod, but it wouldn't access the iTunes music store.  This iPod has been more trouble than it is worth. If iTunes worked properly, it would be outstanding. But serious problems installing iTunes has completely undermined my faith in iTunes, my iPod, and Apple. Worse, songs purchased from the iTunes store is in a proprietary format, and will only work on your computer or on an iPod. So if you decide to part with your iPod, the songs that you've purchased from ITunes will not be portable, unless you convert them to MP3 or some other format. The entire thing seems company-storish. You need iTunes to run your iPod, and you need your iPod to play music purchased from iTunes. A very clever business model indeed, Steve Jobs.  4 stars for the iPod itself 0 stars for iTunes

<Title>Very good product
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, it's like this. First off, I didn't want to go with an Ipod because I thought of it as just an over advertised MP3 player, which happened to be more expensive than other players. After trying 3 different brands (Rio Carbon, Samsung YP-z5qs, and a Sansa e250, I began to think that perhaps, this product was really a nice product to go with.  Compared to my previous MP3 players, the sound quality is way lot better. ITunes is so easy to deal with when it comes to create playlists, transferring songs, and managing your music in general.  What I DON'T like about this product, and it's not a big deal, is the fact that the songs have to be converted to AAC format. Since I had bought some songs from Nampster, and VCast (just trying to do things the right way and pay for my music, so my favorite artists won't starve to death), I can't convert those songs I paid for into AAC files, because they are protected.  Overall this seems a superior product compared to my previous players, but I consider such an inconvenience having to convert my already MP3, or WMA files into AAC, so I can transfer them to my IPOD, not to mention that I am using more free space on my computer (I don't want to delete my WMA files, because I can burn my CDs on that format and play them in my car stereo.  As I mentioned before, the player seems very nice, but it looks very fragile also, so I would recommend you to get the extended warranty, (just to keep it safe)

<Title>Had a hard time 
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Ipod Nano from work as a Christmas gift. I was ecstatic as I was thinking of purchasing one on my own.  Ok, now reality comes in, its taken me 6 months to get the thing working and download music. I work on computers every day for my job so I'm not computer illiterate. First, I tried to get it loaded with the Ipod disk onto my own computer at home, and it crashed my computer. I do not have the newest, faster computer out there, its a hand me down from my dad. Nor was I going to spend $1,000 to get a better computer just to work my Ipod. My computer is still dead to this day. (Thanks Apple & sorry dad!) Second, I tried to load it on my boyfriend's computer to no avail, the disk would not load onto his computer (we both do not have Apple computers perhaps that is the magic bullet).  Third, I gave it to my dad as I was ready to throw it against the wall from frustration.  My dad after hours of frustration was able to load the disk onto his computer and then was able to download songs from my CDs to the Ipod.  He also has cable internet and a bigger computer which seemed to help a lot with the downloading of music.  I am happy with the sound from the Ipod.  And once you learn how to navigate the controls for your songs its really easy and fun.  Also I like the color screen. The earbuds they provided did not fit in my ears (apparently we are not all built the same)and I had to buy some other headphones.  The battery life is NOT 14 hours, its more like 4 hours. Another complaint is that the plug that inserts into the Ipod from the earbuds does not play into both earbuds I have to pull the insert out a little in order to get music in both ears.    All in all this has been a hellish experience and I don't think I'll be getting another Ipod.

<Content>I bought this for my daughter for her birthday in June. She loves it. I have barely touched it. She set it up and I have not had to help her at all. She is [...] This is simple to get music onto and simple to use. We did purchase a skin for it after reading so many reviews about scratches. It makes it look really cool, and it is a different color from her friends' so that's great.   I do agree about battery life not being anywhere near 14 hours. It seems she charges it almost every day and she does not use it nonstop. For the steep price I think it should have come with a charger because I don't like having it hooked to the computer so often, but that is minor.

<Title>Unbelievably Small!!
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all i must say i was impressed when i opened the box and sow how small it was. Its about as thin as a NO.2 pencil and until you hold it in your hands its hard to explain how small its is. The click wheel is really cool and is easy to scroll through songs and such. It also comes with a couple of simple games than can keep you entertained for a small while. The color screen is also great. Displays album art very well and displays pictures well also. The iTunes software is really easy to use and organizes your music very well.  There were only a couple of things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. Fisrt of all the scratches and finger prints show up very well on the black version so id recomend getting some of those silicone cases and also protect the screen. I rarely take mine out of the one i got for it. Secondly the battery is exactly the best ive seen but its good enough for me. Third, the headphone jack is on the bottom, not exactly a big problem but i find it weird having it on the bottom.   In conclusion this is an awesome mp3 player you can take anywhere. Although 500 songs arent quite enough for me its still a great buy. If you have a large music library i recomend getting the 4GB version which is only 50 bucks more, and ill probly do that after a while.

<Title>Ode to my favorite bookmark
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my little iPod Nano, which keeps me company on my too-frequent flights, in airports, while running or working out, on walks across town -- and now, thanks to a surprisingly good mini-speaker system I got for Christmas -- I even use it as a tiny stereo in my home office.  It's not the perfect MP3 player, if such a thing is even possible. Some users criticize it for not having much memory compared to the larger iPods -- absolutely true. And there are complaints about it scratching easily -- again, true, though in my case they are very slight and certainly nothing that is distracting. At least one review complained that the earphone jack is at the bottom of the unit. Again, true, and it can be annoying (because of that, I must load the iPod upside down into the mini-speaker system), but it's necessary because the player's thin profile didn't allow enough space for both a screen and a headphone jack on top.  But look at it! It's like a jewel -- delicate, balanced, beautiful. When I first got mine, I found myself staring at it for no reason at all. The sound is as round and powerful as from any previous iPod I've owned, and yet it's pretty and small enough that it makes my RAZR V3 mobile phone look like an old SUV when they're placed next to each other. And the Nano is so slim that on a recent trip I realized I had inadvertently started using it as a bookmark while trudging across a foreign airport rushing from one flight to another.  But it's not for everyone, obviously. It won't hold your entire music collection. And although it will hold photos, the smallish screen will make actually studying the images of loved ones while far from them less enjoyable than it should be -- and forget photos of scenery, which just become a collection of colorful smudges, like a tiny Monet. But I still believe I still believe the Nano is a great victory of design and function, even by the standards of a company known for such triumphs.  A few random thoughts:  * The choice between the black and white Nano should be based purely on your personal taste, as the functionality and cost are exactly the same. But one thing to keep in mind is that with the black unit, the headphones are still white and that can seem aesthetically jarring if you notice that kind of thing.  * Get the Nano from a vendor that will laser your name and some other information on the back. It's a cool feature.  * I own the 2GB model, which I bought because the 4GB Nano was sold out at the time. I thought I would regret not buying the larger one, but I don't. Neither would allow me to just keep every song I own on it, and so I get into a mindset of transferring play lists that reflect my mood while the Nano recharging. Once you're accustomed to that, limiting yourself to either 500 or 1,000 songs isn't tough. I use my Nano all the time and am forever switching songs back and forth from iTunes, and yet I don't think it's ever been more than 2/3 full.  * Battery life isn't great and it gets worse over time. But it also charges quickly. And if you have a phone that uses the small USB ports as I have you can buy an adaptor that actually allows you to (slowly, slowly) charge the iPod from the cel phone's battery -- something I've done a few times when I was more interested in listening to what Bob Dylan had to say than I was in whoever might call.  * A suggestion to Apple's designers: since the unusual position of the headphone jack requires us to use the device upside down sometimes, why not include a menu feature that gives user the option to flip the screen, making it into an iPod with the jack on top and screen on the bottom?

<Title>I Love Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The nano is easily the best MP3 player out there.  The lightness keeps the player from being too bulky when carrying it on a walk or while working out.  The sound quality is fantastic, the colors are brilliant, seeing the album covers is a great touch, and since it is flash based there are no moving parts inside to get broken unlike the larger, more fragile video ipods.  Prices are such that it's probably a better deal than the 1 GB shuffle, considering what you're getting for that extra cash. Then again, by using some search sites like Blingo (http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=9KDZjMGhAFMnE4lxCmpSxaygFPs) you could end up with one for free just for using their search engine.  The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the nano scratches so easily.  But maybe that's just the price you pay for getting such a gorgeous and buffed player for your audio files.

I will turn it off only to come back several hours later to find that its turned itself back on!!  I thought that my cats would lay down on it and accidently turn it back on but I put it in a cabinat where they can't get to it and it still did it....whenever I shut it off it just wont keep itself off, so I have to either let it drain itself compleatly or keep my computer on all the time to keep it charged.

<Title>Excellent product but...
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall I am really impressed with the ipod nano.  This is my first mp3 player and I'm amazed at the ease of use.  Anyone who complains about the ipods being difficult to operate are most likely computer illiterate and technologically challenged.  I had no problems.  I simply followed the directions and once it was fully charged, I had all of my favorite songs on the Ipod from my personal cd collection.  My downloaded tracks from Musicmatch are a different story.  The itunes software will not convert copy protected tracks, which include any tracks that you download from other music websites like musicmatch or napster.  That really stinks!  It should be possible to burn my musicmatch tracks to a CD and then rip the CD into itunes, but I've heard the sound quality is diminished.  And I don't care much for the itunes software.  Musicmatch is much more user friendly and presents your music library so it's easier to see.  For example, musicmatch minimizes my music collection by the artist's name and then if I want to see what tracks are available for a particular artist, I simply click in the icon next to the band name and it opens up the band's list of songs.  The itunes software on the other hand lists EVERY single track you have and there is no way to minimize so only the artist names are showing... if you can, I don't see anywhere on the screen where this option is available (fortunately on the ipod itself, you can choose how you want the songs displayed either by artist, album, or each individual track... another reason I don't understand why the itunes software on the computer doesn't have that option.)  Creating a song list on musicmatch is also easier and more convienent than itunes.    Advantages:  compact, stylish, great sound quality, excellent color screen, easy to use. Disadvantages:  for downloaded music, it only accepts itunes' tracks and the itunes software is really subpar and obsolete compared to other free software.

<Title>Impossible to live without
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>it took me a long time to get and ipod nano. and now that i do, i don't ever want to part with it. It's fantastic. it's so incredibly small, i couldn't believe when i first saw. it fits on my hand, on any pocket, sometimes i even forget it's there. i was scared of breaking it but it's very resistent and it has impressed me.  i love all the space it offers. i made the transition from a 128mb pendrive to a 2gb ipod. there's no comparison. at first, i didn't had enough music to fill it so i had to ask friends for music reccomendations. i also used amazon's recomendations system.  i love all it's functions. i can read books or fics or even classwork. i can have all the lyrics to the songs. i can put thousands of photos.  especially icons, who show all their color and majesty on the ipod screen.   i can make a million playlist for all diferent moods and whatever. i can order by album,artist,genre,composer, whatever i want.  if suddenly i want to listen to only a couple of songs, i can make playlists on the go. i can listen to audiobooks and put them all there. not just a few chapters at a time.  i can listen to my whole library or just one playlist. put it in random or normal. shuffle all my playlist. or the artist. or the songs.  i can play when i'm bored. use it as a hard-drive to transport things. keep my calendar.  there's three things i always need. my cell phone, my camera and my ipod.

<Title>Another great Apple product
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I am not an Apple computer user, as 90% of the world aren't. However, I am continually impressed by their quality products and innovation. The Ipod Nano is yet another example. Easy to use, perfect size, and all in a nice looking package.  I typically use my Ipod at the gym. It is absolutely perfect in that environment. Get yourself an Ipod armband and you're all set. With it's light weight, you won't even notice it. I have a couple hundred songs on it right now, which is more than enough for an hour workout.   The only negative that I've found in the 1+ month I've owned it is that it can scratch easily. Definitely get a case with screen protection before you even remove it from the box.   I definitely recommend this product.

<Title>Likely the best portable music listening device ever!
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Smaller than a cell phone, lighter than a man's wallet, as easy to use as instant Coffee. This is THE coolest iPod to come from Apple. The iPods are famous for their non-skipping, long lasting, and easy to use interface. This is no different. It's everything you love about the iPod then add more nice features and shrink it... twice. It's robust interface and no moving parts coupled with long battery life and even cleaner sound than the original iPod, this is definitely a winner. I can't tell you how many times people stare at it when I take it out to play with it.  The Good: * Very cool * Color screen * Very thin .27 inches * Small: 3.5 inches by 1.6 inches (62% smaller than the iPod Mini) * Long battery life: Tested mine at over 12 hours * Fast transfer of data: ~4 minutes to fill the 2 Gigs and ~8 minutes to fill the 4 Gig. * Synchs with Microsoft Outlook * Games * Workout features like lap time * World clock * Screen lock to prevent thieves from using a stolen Nano * Equalizer for the sound * Photos * Loads album image  The Bad: * Very limited accessories at this time * No voice recorder * Can't zoom or pan video * Chrome at the back picks up fingerprints easily * Non-adjustable EQ * Did crash on me once * Album image only available if you purchased the song from iTunes. Uploading your CD doesn't work. * Will likely be out of date in a few months as Apple quickly revs on the iPod product

<Title>There is a reason Apple is #1 
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Fantastic.  The screen is crisp and clear.  I bought this for my wife.  I have an Ipod Mini.  I think the sound from the Nano is actually better, it is "richer".  You may ask why I didn't give it 5 stars?  My Mini was about $200 and is 4 gig.  The Nano is about $200 for the 2 gig or $250 for the 4 gig.  If you are considering this item, I would recommend that you spend the extra money and buy the 4 gig model, rather than the 2 gig.  I have a number of podcasts, which use up a lot of space, my wife doesn't.  So, the 2 gig seems to fit her needs just fine.  But, I think most people would be happier with the 4 gig model.  Hat's off to Apple for putting together this fantastic product!!

<Title>Scratches easily
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got the nano for xmas.  Found out very quickly that it scratches VERY easily.  Purchased a skin for it at bestskinsever.com for $5.  Its the best investment ever.  Its very durable and protects your entire ipod and you can't even see it. It takes a little patience to put it on but is worth the effort.  If you are planning on purchasing a nano its a must! The only thing that irritated me about it was that it doesn't come with a users manual.  You need to read it on line or print it out (its 58pgs long).  Their customer service people were not very helpful and sort of rude.  And it was a pain to have to figure out how to transfer songs that are not compatible with the Ipod.  Other then that I love it.

<Content>I bought an iPod Nano the first week of December, by the end of the first week, the screen was ruined and I was forced to take it back and get a new one. It has been about a month and a half now, and the new iPod I received is also now not working. I do not recommend one to anyone, as the agony it has caused is not worth it. Rather than buying someone an iPod I would recommend instead buying them a cd player that you can use .mp3 CDs with.

<Title>ROCKS! -literally
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i love this ipod. i've had it for about a month and i love it to death. i suggest that if you buy it, you should get a protective case for it, because the other people i know who had one said that it broke and got all scratched up because it didn't have a case, and about 50 other guys said that too. i have a few friends who have one and a case and they say there's not a thing wrong with it. on thing i wanna say is that you should get the 4 gb. of course it holds more songs, but another reason is how long will you e putting songs on it? if you only put some songs on your ipod, it's okay to get this, but if you put entire albums on it you should get the 4 gb. remember, you get whatcha pay for.  songs you should definetly download: sugar, we're going down from fall out boy, ready fuels by anberlin, and reinventing your exit from underoath. they're all good!

<Title>A great little device that makes a marvelous gift for any music lover...
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really liked the iPod nano a lot. Sure it's a bit pricey, given that you can get more storage for about the same money. However, the small size, beautiful large display, quiet operation and intuitive user interface makes it an overall winner, especially as a gift.  I originally was considering the larger unit with more storage, but when I received this and saw how small, light and convenient it was... I knew I made the right choice for me. With that said, if storage is your main concern, this sleek modern model might not be the way to go. However, it's very cool technology and flash memory is fundamentally different than a drive... so it cost more. It's also more rugged.  If you're not sure which one to get, why not get them both and return one or give the one you don't like away. Who wouldn't want to receive either one that enjoys music?  Also, the headphones had a much better sound that I ever expected. I was totally pleased.  It's a drawback that you have to buy from the iTunes store. However, I think Apple has the comparable models beat by a mile for the time being.

<Title>Awesome Gadget!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am here to write a review now that I have bought and recieved the ipod nano from apple.com. This is an amazing device. I was the person who wrote the review about how the two guys put their ipod nano through its paces by throwing it out of a moving car for example. If you get it from apple, you can get the back of your ipod engraved for free. I have already put many albums of music on mine, and the sound quality is amazing for such a little gadget. The screen is very clear and crisp and the click wheel is amazingly easy to use. I did end up getting the 4GB instead of the 2GB, I wanted to make sure I could fit all of my music onto it. I would also recommend getting a case for the ipod nano. I've fallen in love with mine and I would like it to last a very long time. So, all in all, I definitely recommend the 4GB white ipod nano. You will not be dissappointed!!!!

<Content>I'll have to say Apple did a nice job on this one. They made it incredibly small. I would buy a case for it because it gets scrached easily. The headphones are okay but they don't stay in your ears real well. I have to tell you that some USB ports are powerful enough to charge the ipod. I had to go to best buy 3 times to get mine reset. Get a wall charger instead. They work a lot better.

The head phones that came with it are not the greatest but for running there perfect! I bought A better pair of sony headphones for when I'm just relaxing at home. apple in my opinion hit A home run!

<Title>In a word - "Wow". 
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a Windows disciple, admittedly before I owned this Nano I thought the word "Apple" was a dirty word. My how my perspective has changed.  I had a Sony MiniDisc player where basically you could import mp3s onto these small cartridges (which would fit about 50 songs). While not perfect, it transitioned me from a portable CD player I had been using. Then reading all the reviews I have, I decided it was time to trade up to an iPOD. I don't have a huge music collection, so I didn't see the need for a $300 standard iPOD when a $200 nano which holds 500 songs would do just fine and in a smaller package. I bought the 2GB black Nano.  Once I brought it home, I discovered it was recommended that one charges it to full power before attempting to load any songs onto it. That took me a little over 3 hours since there was no charge in the Nano once I unpacked it - no problem. I waited this long, right?  Then when I loaded the CDROM software (iPOD and iTUNES), and hooked up the Nano to my PC (new within the last year), it was saying there were no drivers installed for the USB-connected hardware. Huh? I read the installation instructions a little closer and discovered you HAVE to have a USB 2.0 port. I discovered that my PC only has 1 of its 4 ports to that standard (unfortunately it was in the very back of my computer behind the  heavy desk). Ok, connected to that port, then everything was gravy. I've used iTUNES for quite some time so all my songs were already loaded, and once I hooked up the Nano the rest was cake. It took about 5 minutes or so to load about 280 songs. Not too shabby.  The sound quality is excellent. I don't think the earphones are as uncomfortable as everybody seems to think they are. I bought the black nano figuring that if I were to switch out headphones, finding a comfortable pair in black would match better than with a white Nano. To be honest, I don't think the white earphones supplied look bad with the black nano either. Pretty stylish, actually.  I made sure that before I opened the box, that I had also purchased a nice case for the iPOD as well as I had read that they scratch easily. The Nano will never see the outside of its Belkin leather case ($18 at WalMart), so I'm not worried about scratches. The posts from individuals saying that they merely dropped their Nano a few feet and they literally "snapped in 2 pieces"? That's garbage. I've seen reviews online by professionals who ran them over with a car and it didn't break them. That is not to say I'm going to go out of my way to damage it either however.   Was a little disappointed that the Nano didn't come with an AC Adaptor charger. As it is, you can only recharge the Nano via USB to your desktop (won't work on laptop). You want an adaptor,  you need to shell out another $30.   Anyway, am very happy so far with the Nano. I don't think you need anything more than a 2GB nano in terms of storage when you think about the fact that I loaded over 200 totally new songs today and that is 13.5 hours of music. The max charge you'll get on a fully charged Nano is 14 hours. Kind of puts things in perspective doesn't it?  Happy shopping...  kstagg

<Title>The iPod will change the way you listen to music
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>How anybody would not love an iPod is simply unbelieveable to me. Not only can it hold one's entire music library in their pocket, but the sound is amazingly crisp, and is far superior to any mp3 player on the market. On top of all that, you can customize your own playlists without having to burn a CD, and unlike burned CDs, you can edit the playlist again after it's already been made. All of this considered, the iPod is a far superior teachnology to compact disks.  As I don't have a very extensive music library, the 2 GB model was the way to go for me. It holds roughly 500 4 minute songs, and at the moment I only have about 190 songs on it. That being said, if you are a person who has the huge crate full of Cds in your closet, I would advise you to either go with the 4 GB model or the 30 GB model with video capability.  A couple of common misconceptions about the iPod nano need to be cleared up. First off, you do NOT have to buy all of the music from the iTunes store at a dollar a pop. All you have to do is pop the Cd into the computer and transfer it into iTunes. This means you can even just borrow that Cd you've been wanting from the library and put it on your iPod, and not even have to pay a dime! iTunes also converts nearly every type of audio imaginable. So if you have a huge collection on music on Winmap, Windows Media player, Musicmatch Jukebox etc., iTunes will automattically convert your entire music library to the correct format. iTunes is capable of converting wma, wav, and mp3 files, just to name a few.  Also, iPod nano CAN hold photos. I haven't any on mine, but it  does have the capablity.  Reccomneded accessories:  1. Kensington Stereo Dock - Docking station that charges your ipod and can play it through a home stereo system. It even has a remote control, batteries and all of the connections needed. THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE APPLE MODEL. It may be exactly the same price ($39.99), but Apple makes you go out and buy YET ANOTHER connector to hook it up to your home stereo, so you end up spending $70 instead of $40. The Apple one doesn't even a remote for that price! I use this all the time to play my iPod through my guitar amp!  2. Different headphones - Many people fins the "earbud" headphones that the iPod comes with to be comfortable, but I absolutely hate them. I ended up getting a pair of Stenheiser headphones that go over the top of your head.  All in all, The iPod is the best portable music player on the market today, and besides the headphones, there are really no drawbacks. Just remeber not to buy Apple branded accesories. They are overpriced, and not as good as what you can get from 3rd parties.  Sound 11/10 Portability 11/10 Headphones 1/10 AUGHH!!! Do I hate those earbuds! Headphones are cheap though, so it's not a big deal. Ease of user interface 10/10 Value 8/10  Overall 9.5/10

<Content>Amazing functionality and beautful design doesn't last long. Within one week the ipod is so scratched that you'll think you're keeping razorblades in your pocket. The battery stopped holding its charge after 6 months. Spoke to an apple agent they told me send it back we'll repair it no problem. Just pay the $30 for shipping. My repair was declined. If you have ipod problems good luck dealing with apple's customer service. So small you can take it anywhere. Just make sure you don't put it in your pocket, or car, or anywhere else it could touch something.

<Title>Half the Screen Broke After 4 Months
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have the iPod Nano for 4 months. I use it everyday. It is scratched front and back beyond recognition. I thought people were hyping this scratching thingie.  Sadly, it is true.  In comparsion, I drop my cell phone and pull it in and out from my jeans 1000 of times for the past years. I don't see my cell phone scratch like the Nano; nor my cell phone stops working after 4 months.  I can put up with the scratching but after 4 months of use, the screen finally stops working.  Half of the screen is blank now. Sadly, the iPod Video seems to scratch easily just like the Nano.  I'm really trying very hard to like the Nano.  2 Meg is big for everything. The color of the screen is beautiful.  iTune is easy to use.  But for 200 bucks, the Nano should not be cheaply built.   I also have a Creative Muvo N200. It is many times better than the Nano. When my Nano stops working completely (very soon for sure), I will be saving my money for the Zen Micro.  I am also saving my money for the new Power Book Pro; but after seeing how my cheesy Nano begins to fail, I am having a second thought about the Power Book Pro now.  No way I will fork up 2 grands for something that is cheaply built.

<Title>Selling Nano! Read if interested:
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am selling my 2GB iPod nano between 99-150$ im not sure what the exact price will be yet, but that range is for sure.  The reason why i am selling it is because i need an upgrade and i need more space for music.  Now, don't think that the Nano can't store enough of your music; it can! It stores around 500 songs.  You can also put pictures on it, podcasts, and audiobooks.  The iPod is in good shape, the only scratches are on the back and it isn't that bad.  There were scratches on the screen, but i managed to get rid of them with a scratch remover and polish i got off eBay that works VERY well.  The scratch is completely gone so you won't be annoyed when looking at the screen.  You may also ask about the scratch remover's price as i will be selling it as well, if you want to try and get rid of scratches on the back.  To keep the screen from scratching, i bought plastic screen protector material from Staples.  It sticks to the screen and protects it really good.  I don't have any scratches on the screen and have had the protector on for about 2 months.  I have all of the contents that came in the box which includes: iPod Nano 2GB, Earbuds w/ 2 sets of covers, Apple iTunes software CD, Quickstart guides, and the USB cable.  I do not have any accessories.  If you are serious in buying an iPod Nano for a great price or want more information, EMAIL ME AT: HarrdRawker617@hotmail.com &lt;-- that is exactly how u spell it, the 2 r's are not typos.

<Title>What tha......Can't Believe It
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Man I have been wanting a nano for a minute and today I finally broke down and brought the black 2 GB Nano. I have second generation  6 GB iPod Mini Green but technology moves on she has served me well and plus the mini's plain grey and blue backlit lcd was getting tired she will be retired. I picked the 2 GB Nano because I realized that when i had the 6 GB mini i didn't even listen to half the songs on there so i said 500 songs  is enough for me. The Nano is sooooo tight it's so light and thin it feels kinda flimsy but I will get a thick case for it. The fancy  case that comes with it is not strong enough to protect it in my pocket. I'm also kinda upset that it does not sync via firewire like my ipod mini it needs usb 2.0 but oh well my 500 Mhz iBook's usb 1.1 worked just as good. It took about 9 minutes or so to  sync some songs from itunes  not that bad some people complained to death about how slow usb 1.1 is but it really is not that terrible. In conclusion Im satisfied with my Nano

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great iPod.  I'ts small, it holds about 500 songs, and it doesn't cost $400 like other iPods.  If you're thinking about getting an mp3 player, save yourself the hassle and get a nano.  They're so good, I wrote this review while listening to mine.  But, you should invest in a good skin(seriously, they don't cost much), because these iPods scratch VERY easily(or, at least that's what i've read, but I've never seen it, because i applied a skin immediately).  But, make sure to write down the serial number before you put your skin on, unless your skin is clear(I found that out the hard way), as you need the serial number during registration.  Setup is easy, organizing your music is a snap, and iTunes, Itunes Music Store, and any Ipod work seamlessly.  Over all, this is the one to get.

<Title>WOW!!
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe I almost bought a shuffle instead of the nano.  having seen one a co-worker has, i thought it would suffice.  but having the ability to scroll and select playlists is what i really needed.  I even wondered about the scratching comments everyone seems to mention.  when i got my nano yesterday, i see where the scratching could come in to play.  since i haven't used and apple pc since college in the mid-1990's, i didn't know what to expect as far as the setting up itunes and downloading, but it was very easy.

<Title>lot of work and little reward
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved the nano as a gift on Christmas.  I have a large CD collection so I didn't have to bother with the music store. It took a good 20hrs over a week to copy the songs I wanted to the computer  and then transfer them to the nano.    Then I went out and purchased the proper cables to hook it up to my stereo. I also purchased the fm transmitter for my car and the power adapters for my car and home. Also got a rubber case to prevent it from scratching.   Didn't drop it, or let the battery die. Plugged it into the charger, turned it off and went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning on February 13th it would not respond its completely dead. It was plugged into a surge protector with my cell phone and computer. They both work fine but the nano is dead.   I guess the battery burned out. Yet there is no way to replace it without returning it to the manufacturer. I will try to return it to the store for a replacement but I hope this isn't a reoccuring problem.

<Title>Not Ready for Prime time.  Many problems
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was happy to receive my iPod for my Birthday.  But soon the first issue came up: it freezes if you mix podcasts with music and loses funcionality.  OK, so you just have to reinitialize it to get it working, but what if you are on a trip?  You are stuck without listening for a while.  This software glitch has not yet been addressed by Apple.  After 3 weeks, my unit became locked in the HOLD position, meaning that none of the buttons work and the ipod becomes a paperweight.  This seems to be a common problem, but no fix has come out, other than to return the item.  Since I work for the Foreign Service out of the country, this option isn?t available because APPLE refuses to use the US Postal Service and relies on FEDEX or some such thing.  So now the only thing I can do is hold it until I travel to the US again (maybe a year).    They should have waited on the NANO before shipping.

<Title>Save some money
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my 2GB Nano three months ago. I wish that I could get a refund. I definitely do not recommend this product. Other Apple MP3's may be better, but the Nano leaves a lot to be desired.  WHEN the player works, it works well. The problem is that the Nano freezes up. My Nano was fine until I started downloading update software. There have been TOO MANY updates for the Nano and Itunes. After spending 200 dollars on this player, a person should not have to spend so much time on a computer downloading updates and trying to keep the player working. I have spent way too much time on the Apple website trying to fix problems. I have had to call customer service. I have had to send my unit back for service. They sent the unit back, I did everthing exactly as they suggested, and my unit still freezes up. I used it this morning for the first time since it was returned and it froze up after playing ten songs. I am left to belive that I either have a bad player or Apple has a problem with the Nano. Go to their website and get on their discussion page to see for yourself.  I do not have any agenda. The Apple people have tried to help me. I am satisfied with the support, but the unit leaves much to be desired. I have nine more months of warranty. I hope my problem is solved by then.  The Nano should be entertaining. Mine is work.  I hope your luck is better than mine.  Joe

<Content>I haven't had any problems with the iPod Nano.  I've had it for two weeks now.  Do not believe the 14 hour music playback time.  I can't believe how far off it is.  Maybe it neglected to say whether the blacklight was on or off?  Playback is around 5 hours.  I play on average an hour of music a day.  I think on the 4th day, the iPod's battery meter hit the reds.  That 14 hour is mostlikely based off no backlight.  Very misleading if you ask me.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  It works perfectly and so does the iTunes software.  There are also other alternative programs out there to load music to your iPod.  You do not have to use iTunes.  I don't remember some of the programs but it should be easy to find via Google.  Some of the reviewers on here need to learn how to read their manual.  I can't believe some people are saying they can't figure out how to delete songs.  For protection, I recommend the Contour Design Clear case for this one. It fits snuggly on the Nano.  With this case, you can use your earphones to wear your iPod around your neck.  Pretty cool and convienent.

<Content>alright i will start with my complants, i just got my ipod yesterday i was very excited till i started downloading song, it took me 2 hours to find out how to delete songs. after i found that out i got some songs in there but i releasied that it still counted the song i deleted maybe it is something i did but i can only put like 100 songs now another problem is that i was listing to some music last night and when i clicked a song it just started scrolling though all my music and would stop at certain songs and play that one. i got furious after that so i had to delet all my songs see if that would do anything. it did and now i guess i am satisfied with my ipod, because i only have bout 70 songs id actully listing to.   the good part of this ipod is it great sound. i was amazed at it's great voulme very loud for such small equipement.  it look is it's best part of the ipod to me so small (altohugh i get scared i might break it, it is as skinny as 2 gram crackers so i am sure it could break as easy as them too)   the headphones are rather uncomfortable to my ears when i take them out my ears hurt like crap but overall their good.  when u get the box i find this funny but u get 2 stickers that i thought u put on the ipod but their way to big, so i use em else where. what could of made this better if they made a delete button "in" the ipod so u can delete songs without having to connect to the computer (if their is on them i am wrighting this for nothing, this is my first ipod)

<Title>Ipod Nano- 2G
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now if you're hauling around an old CD player with a big CD case and all your doing in scrathing the disks and losing them. Well then the Ipod Nano is for you. Its width the size of a pencil width, and it able to hold up to 500 songs, i think you just got yourself 3 CD players but in something that doesnt skip on songs if you're running, and is extremly tiny. I have 70 songs on my Ipod already. If you already have a song on a CD that you want in your ipod, just insert the CD into the computer and put in on the ipod. Theres also a music store so you can shop for songs, albums, and TV shows( if you have the ipod that plays videos) for resonable prices. So no more hauling around the bulky CD players man, just grab your ipod and go.

<Title>Awesome ! 
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my ipod nano about two weeks ago (or so).  I was really debating whether or not I really wanted/needed one.  I absolutely *love it*.  I couldn't believe how small it actually was.  You read the reviews and see the pictures online, but it's nothing until you actually hold it in your hands.  It's tiny, but the clickwheel is still very easily accessible and easy to use.    I bought the 2GB nano because 500 songs is *plenty* for me.  I've uploaded all the songs I wanted from my CD collection and I have plenty of space left on my nano.  I could never fill up 4GB, and even if I could, do I REALLY need more than 500 songs? Nope!  Like everyone else I read the amazon.com reviews about the ipod nano black, because that was my color preference.  Everything I read said NOT to get the black nano, but being the rebel I am, I did it anyway.  It's GREAT.  Very stylish.  And as for the "scratching easily", I've kept the plastic cover on the ipod, and it won't come off until my cases that I've just ordered arrive.  My nano is scratch-free and beautiful.    Another tip?  If you order from Apple.com and you're a student, you can get the ipod nano for $180 with free shipping AND free engraving.  I love having my name engraved on the back- that was a bonus.  Otherwise, I've ordered tons of things off Amazon and they are reliable and quick.  Hope this helped! :)

<Title>Apple (Almost) Changes the World Instead of Selling Sugared Water
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With so much fanfare surrounding the iPod Nano, this review seems almost unnecessary.  Once again, Apple has created a fabulous product.  While Steve Jobs hasn't necessarily changed the world with the Nano, he has raised the bar for mp3 players.  In fact, I would argue that the iPod has been a disruptive technology with the growth of podcasts and legal music downloads.  Yet, despite the iPod ecosystems, the real beauty of the iPod is its ease of use.  In my case, I had two very specific purposes for my iPod.  I needed a robust device to listen to music while working out and also have the ability to categorize educational materials such as Spanish lessons.  This dual function required a rugged device that could store multiple playlists for different activities.  The iPod has performed well in this regard.  Combined with its playlist ability, the Nano has very easy to navigate menus, allowing the user to quickly switch between different types of content.  My one major concern about the Nano, its solid-state control knob, turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  Generally, I prefer hard switches that mechanically connect electrical contacts.  Yet, the membrane rotary knob is very user friendly.  Combining the small form factor with tremendous storage and ease of use, the iPod is a fabulous mp3 player.  Pros Great Interface Ecosystems Light and thin Ease of navigation Streamlined data cable/battery charging cable   Cons  No FM Radio Expensive accessories    PS - The title refers to a famous quote said Steve Jobs when he was trying to recruit Sculley, who was then head of Pepsi, as the CEO of Apple.

<Title>I made a big mistake
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've always had iAUDIO/COWON players in the past but was pulled in to the ipod because everyone else had one. Boy what a mistake I made when I bought this ipod.  Anyone thinking about buying an ipod because everyone else has one please do not do it.  First off you NEED itunes on your pc and you need the program just to load the songs on it. Where is my iAUDIO/COWON players you don't need any program or software at all installed on your pc. You can just drag and drop straight into your player and it will play any format you put in it where ipod will not.    And say you have a couple different mp3 players well you can't just put songs from your ipod and put them on a non ipod player they will not work. Where is with my iAUDIO/COWON you can put them on anything you want.    Another thing the sound quality of the ipod is no where near as good as the iAUDIO/COWON players, this even bothered me more than the other stuff.   In the end I sold this ipod to my nephew...he was happy to buy it at a very reduced price. He said everyone in school has an ipod and if you had something other than an ipod you just weren't as cool.      From now on my motto is "Why buy something everyone else has, why not buy something better".

<Content>For all those  people who can't stop telling lies about how their ipod practically broke in half after a few days' use, you need to rethink your assessment of the ipod's durability. I went to a website to research the ipod nano because I was really getting sick of all the waaaaay exaggerated reviews. What I found was amazing. Two engineers bought an ipod nano and wanted to test its durability. First, they drop it while jogging- only a few minor scratches. Then, they drop it while riding a bike slow and then fast- only more scratches and the music is still playing. Next they drop it while in a moving car at 30mph and 50mph- the screen is shot, but the music is playing and they were able to navigate songs easily. Now, prepare to be amazed. They RUN OVER IT with a car...twice! Music is still playing. Then they dropped it from about 9 feet, same story. Then they threw it up into the air about 40 feet high and let it slam onto the pavement. This is where the ipod finally died, sadly. So, enough exaggerating. This is a very durable piece of technology and I will be purchasing one for myself in the near future. I was worried that it would be total crap after opening the box because of what most of these reviews said. But after researching different sources, I feel confident that the ipod nano is reliable and durable.  P.S. These two guys had pictures documenting their experiments. A picture would show the ipod falling from the sky and how it looked after the drop, for instance. So their report was not bogus.

<Title>THIS THING IS AMAZING!
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod nano 2GB white is amazing! First off, get the 2GB because who honestly is going to fill up a mp3 player with 1000 songs and acutally listen to all of them? And second, GET THE WHITE! Everyone I know who has a black has scratches all over it and mine is perfectly looking good as new. Plus, white is Apple's signature. Now let's move onto performance. I had a Sony MINI DISC player before this and it SUCKED. The nano is about 10 times better and a really good thing about the nano is the size. A whole bunch of losers say that they snapped their nano's in half right away but that just means that they were being careless. The nano slips into any pocket even when you have a case on it. The 2GB nano holds 500 songs and that is plenty for someone who wasnts a nice friendly color screen, a great operating system and of course some music with out having to have their entire music collection with them at all times. I would say I have gotten about 10 hours of battery life out of mine which is pretty good. I only have to charge it once a week. As for iTunes, I like it just as much as the nano! Buying music is as simple as that and the drag and drop feature is great for moving your music all around. I guess the photos are pretty cool but it doesn't make sense to whip out your mp3 player and show someone a miniscule photo of something, even though the resolution is great. The games on the nano are WAY better than that of the minis. When I first got the nano I didn't know if I wanted to keep it or get a video. Then one day after school I had my nano in my pocket and my friend wanted to show me something on her iPod video. THE THING WAS HUGE! it was way too wide for me and I much rather like the small slim body of the nano. SOUND QUALITY IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD EVEN WITH THE HEADPHONES THEY GIVE YOU! My sister also has a Sony MINI DISC player and when she heard my iPod she couldn't believe the sound quality and we are both people who could never tell the difference! So overall I sugest this iPod to ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY! and it is so great and so easy to use and I love it!

<Title>Cute.
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my iPod nano as a gift from my uncle in December. Lucky for me, I got a leather case (it has this magnetic flap thing.. very protective) as well so my iPod has not suffered any breakage or major scratchage, although it is easy to believe that others have.  If you get one of these, definitely get a good case for it.  It's extremely thin and just by the looks of it, you can tell that it's not exactly the most durable thing in the world.  It's definitely very nice-looking, but that doesn't matter too much if you have to get a case. If you don't have a case, expect scratches.  If you have a lot of music, 2gb is probably not enough for you.. it can store around 500 songs.  Technically, the space is a little less than 2GB because some of the space is used for the actual ipod functions (?), i think. (some reviewers were commenting on this earlier)  The color screen is nice but not really necessary, in my opinion.  I don't bother putting photos on it because I never look at them, and looking at them makes the battery run out faster.  So that feature of having like a slideshow going while your music is playing, is pretty much useless to me.  Games are nice if you get bored, but the screen is small and your eyes will probably die if you play solitare too long.  Battery life's decent but will probably worsen over time  iTunes is easy to use, although it messes up sometimes and needs to close.  kind of annoying, could be because of my computer.  the earbuds will make your ears hurt if you use this regularly, so i suggest getting new headphones.  the volume goes up pretty high too..  the way the volume is controlled by the wheel isn't so great because although it's easy to control, it's a little too easy.  too many times i've had curious friends twirl with the wheel and BAM i'm like deaf for a couple seconds. k maybe not, but it is painful.    Uses USB instead of Firewire.. which is good cause you won't need a firewire port.. but it's slower.  Personally, USB is fast enough for me.  all in all, i do think it's a bit too pricey, but it's cute and works great.

<Title>Deserves much of the hype but there's room for improvement
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this iPod Nano (my first iPod ever) for a month now. Bought right here from this Amazon page. I'd always resisted iPods as overpriced, 'overdesigned' toys for the fashion victim but the Nano's size and clickwheel interface finally won me over to the Apple camp (for music players). Mine is black, but the included pouch and earphones are still white, so bear in mind if you're planning on using the included 'phones.  The interface is brilliant and the screen, while tiny, is of surprising quality; I'll never see my expensive Nokia mobile phone with the same eyes again - it's got a cheap, cheesy LCD in comparison. One 'user interface' problem: if you're macOS or windows user you'll have to use iTunes. I hate iTunes, but then again I use Linux and there are some 'alternative' iPod interfaces for that platform. They're not very 'polished' (whatever that really means) but I don't hate them so they're OK for me. ;-)  There are no moving parts so battery life is more than adequate. I can use mine for days, like my Nokia. However, the Nano doesn't come with a wall charger so you'll need to charge it using the included USB cable. That's a bit of a hassle because 1. you need a PC to do that and 2. it takes a long time (I reckon) to charge the iPod. Get an overpriced wall charger from Apple and you'll be happy.  I can't comment on the iPod's propensity to get scratched because I haven't removed the screen plastic yet. Can't comment on LCD fragility either - this has been so hyped I tend to baby my iPod, and my guess is you'll do it as well.  As for sound quality - and that's what really matters - the iPod is great if you get decent headphones or attach it to a small amp (I recommend Sonic Impact's T-Amp and a pair of JBL monitors). Don't judge the iPod using the standard earphones or you'll be disappointed!  All in all, the iPod Nano is expensive for what it is - $189-$199 for a 2GB mp3 player is a bit too much these days. But the elegant user interface and small size kinda compensate the extra cost. Then again, it's an Apple product so most people who buy it would happily pay $250 for it and then spend countless hours justifying themselves in online fora and places like Amazon.com. I should know, I owned two Macs I got smarter...

So what if you can play solitare on an Ipod? I would suggest buying a Creative MP3, they are quality MP3 players that will get more bang for you buck!

<Date>Thu Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for my birthday. The sound is good and it's easy to load music.Yet the screen is small and the ipod itself scratches easily so get a cover too.Plus the dial button is very sensitive to touch.You have to touch lightly or the dial goes crazy.

<Title>iPod Nano - Alotta Hype
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an iPod in April, and I was VERY excited. i had recently returned my old MP3 player and got the iPod nano for the same price. I went home, and after figuring out the library, I was ready to go.  After a week however, my iPod began to "freeze" and the battery lasted 5 hours at most. The entire back was COVERED in scratches. One day, I put my iPod in my bookbag for only 10 minutes, being very careful with it, and it was in a side pocket. There was only a few THIN notebooks in my bookbag. When i took it out... my screen was CRACKED. from the inside. I was so angry. I tried to take it back, and apparently there was a "dent" in it and they would not replace it.   The iPod nano's are extremely non-durable. I do NOT recommend buying one if you are even SLIGHTLY rough on such electronics.

<Title>Bad for jogging, short battery life
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The user interface is thought out well for people in a stationary position, but is useless for jogging.     It is impossible to switch songs or change the volume while moving.  You bump the click wheel the wrong way and end up cranking up the volume when you just wanted to skip to the next song.  Several times the next song would come on and be too loud (despite using the automatic volume normalizing feature in iTunes), I would hit the click wheel and get stuck on the main menu page.  So I'd have to take my headphones out, wait for the menu to disappear, only then would I be able to turn the volume back down.  They really should have a "jogging mode" that just isolates the click wheel to have four "regions" that you just have to touch for changing songs and adjusting volume, much like the Shuffle has...which is what I'm buying instead.  The battery life was pretty dismal too, but that has already been discussed in other reviews.

<Title>Control Freak
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What can be said about the Apple iPod that hasn't already been said?  The diminutive Nano is another step in the evolution.  The thing that has surprised me the most is how much control the iPod gives you over your music collection.  Even if you burn your own CDs with your favorite songs, what if you get tired of a certain song, or realize you didn't like it as much as you thought?  The iPod gives you the continuing abilty to delete and add, fine tuning your library so that it is always what you want to hear.  It's got me thinking about car and home stereo adapters.

<Title>The ultimate music player
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a fantastic product, designed to perfection, slick to look at, easy and smooth to operate, and just as slim and light as advertised.  I started smiling the moment I opened the Amazon cardboard box and took out the amazingly designed iPod packaging, and that smile hardly came off my face for the next couple of days while loaded it up with music and carried it around - to work, to the Gym, and back home in front on my computer.  The only reason I gave it 4 starts rather then 5 is the price - as always, Apple products are somewhat overpriced - but don't let that keep you from getting one for yourself.

<Content>I got the iPod nano 2gb as a congratulation gift from my aunt for getting into a good high school. It works great but the only thing i have to complain about is the battery. the battery life will keep getting shorter after a couple of charges. if it gets real short before the 1 year waranty ends apple will send you a new ipod nano. but if the waranty expires, you have to buy another ipod.  Pro -Small. I mean REALLY SMALL!!! -You can download MAD songs. -MAD EASY TO DOWNLOAD -The price is pretty affordable. Cons -The battery -The accesaries cost about $30. Otherwise, the ipod nano is da shit

<Content>Ipods are like the king of the mp3's.They have good storage, great looking peices of equipment, and they soffisticated.The only problem with these ipod nano's, that can also hold photo's,(which i think is very ingenius!), is that they can snap very easily.I know friends that have had these and they have snapped in two halfs, just from dropping them or something.Other than that a great little product that should bring apple some serious money!

<Content>Excelent package, the black box, neatly sealed, you just cant wait to open it, but at the same time not wanting to wreck the box.  Excelent sound, you can even install a linux distro and be able to view videos.  Pros: Linux Capable Sound Quality SIZE Screen  Cons Scratches easily Fixed EQ, can't change any of them Should have gotten white, scratches show less. No video capable unless you go to ipodlinux  For the price, you cant go wrong. Between the 1gb and the 2gb for the difference get the 2gb nano version.

<Title>Its fun to start with.
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my first ipod for my birthday about two weeks ago. It's really fun and cute. But the first day I brought it around to everyone, i had many people tell me that they would lose it really quickly. I brushed them off, thinking that if they had one, they would be careful like me.  I lost my ipod last friday and you couldn't believe the kind of terror I felt when I had no idea where it was and i had to leave to go on vacation. I tore through my house when i got back, and even cleaned my room, something I hadn't done in a long time. You could not imagine the relief i felt when my friend found it yesterday at her house.  The point is, it's cute, music is great, everyone loves color. But its small. This is not really accepted until the box arrives and you take it out of its box. BE CAREFUL! Your Ipod Nano is like a baby. Babies are cute too, but you wouldn't leave them around just anywhere. You might not be able to find them.

<Content>after checking my reviews status online, i noticed that many people did not find my review articulate. i am now here to redo it. i got this for my bday and am listening to it right now!! again you must expierence to the sound to understand the magnitude of it. SOOOOOOOOOOO SMALLLL!!!!! wow!!! i have a special case that is flexible yet easy to grip. not too bad but very expensive!! a little case for a nano is $20.00!!!!! man! and one thing i mst clear up, for all of u customers  that think that it has everything you need you are DEAD WRONG!!!!! it DOES NOT come with a charger!!! you must purchase for aprox. $30.00!  and itunes!! oh itunes!!! it is great and all but can be complex!!! my friend and i started @ 7:00 and got the first song @ 8:30!!! no we are not slow! there are no detailed instructions on getting music from your library to your actual ipod!! must figure out on your own!!!!! it is easy once you figure it out (as long as that takes) if you dont frustrate easily you will enjoy yourself!!! it is great when you get the songs that you like.worth the money!!! one other thing, you do need a member ship to download. lukily it is free. but you get a personal ipod page.  a thing that is great for us kids is the prepaid cards. you need a membership but no credit card. i used one myself!!!! great buy!!!!!

<Title>Great Sound
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my ipod nano!  It has great sound, it's easy to use and the portability is fabulous!  The downloaded music is put into various categories which makes it easy to satisfy your musical mood.  The shuffle feature is great because it's like listening to the radio except there are no commercials and you are guarenteed to love every selection!  The only problem I have encounted is that the text is small so you may need glasses to pick specfic artists or categories!  It holds approx. 500 songs, less depending on their length or if you have a lot of photos.  I think anyone would love this ipod, especially if you just need a little music any time of day!

<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Not only did iTunes fail to work/update properly and freeze my computer on several occasions, but my LCD is *wrecked* now after keeping it in a small change-purse type of bag (alone, to avoid scratches) in my purse. I guess it knocked against something, but I can't pinpoint an occasion where it would have.  I can't get a refund or repairs with the LCD damage (despite it only being 3 months old), and while it still plays, I can't see if I'm on the menu or the songs - so it drives me crazy.  It was really fun while I had it though, despite getting scratched a lot. All I can say is READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If you think this might happen to you, decide.... is it worth it to pay 200 dollars for 3 months use?

<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i really really want a ipod nano! i've read a bunch of the reviews on this site and it sounds pretty good!   my first mp3 player was a Creative Zen Micro. It was great... til a few weeks ago. i've only had it for less than a year and its busted. i read the reviews for the zen micro and about 5 people had the same problem. the head phone jack is broken and now the sound is horrible. but it was a good price. $199 for 5GB. the nano is 2GB for $199. a lot of people hav a problem with that but i think it's just because the nano is really thin and stylish and the zen micro is big and bulky.   can't wait til i get one!!! they're soooo cute! but the ipod nano tubes are kinda expensive... o well. they're cute!  so if you dont know if you wana get the ipod nano or the zen micro i'd say get the nano. its a lot more stylish and way thinner. but the zen micro comes in 10 colors, which is cool. but i'd still say get the nano!!  hope this helps!

<Content>This generation of ipods is by far the best. Who cares about the ipod video when you can't even upload dvd's you own. The sound quality is superb. Even better, you don't have the lag that comes with all ipods that have hard drives.(Everything other than the ipod suffle and nano) Having had the 40gb fourth generation ipod, I have come to learn that you don't need to waste $399.99 when by the time you fill it up, it would be broken(mine broke within two years and I only had about 250 songs in my library)Finally, the Ipod nano is much more reliable because there are no moving parts which means no skipping!!

<Content>The nano is really small. The reviews and pictures show it as being very small, yet they are no comparison to how small a nano is when  it is held in your hand. Opening the box to my nano, my heart throbbed as a saw the tiny white object. Taking it out of the box and holding it in my hand, I realized just how small the nano is. I only got the 2GB because of my small budget, but for anyone who has a slightly larger budget, I reccomend the 4GB Model: Twice the storage for $50 more. As for filling up my nano, it was hard for me. Apple bases their 500/1000 songs on 4 minutes a song. Most of my songs, as well as those of most other americans, are not that long. That's my review of the iPod nano, the best choice for the casual listener of music who wants to listen to it in style.

<Content>i have recently purchased the ipod nano 2GB for myself. i am only fourteen years old, and decided to spend my babysitting money on this costly item. i dont listen to music all the time, but when i put music on, i get addicted. my brother recived the black ipod nano 4GB himself for his birthday. the 2GB can hold about 500 songs, depending if your songs are longer than four minutes or so. the 4GB nano can hold around 1,000 songs. since i dont listen to music as often as my brother, i chose to save money by purchasing the 2 gig, but if you like music a lot, definitly go with the four gig. warning! the black ipod nano is not as good as the white ipod nano. everyone knows that these ipods are notorius for getting scratched, which is why i recommend a case. if you are on a budget, check on eBay for ipod cases. i purchased a set of 5 for $13.00 which included an armband and a lanyard. when the black ipod scratches, they show up white, and it looks very bad. if you keep your white ipod clean, the scratches will only be able to be seen in the light. i highly recommend buying a silicone case and a screen protector too. just so you know, most silicone cases (which are the cases that everyone has for their ipod) usually go for $20.00 or more a piece! my brother was very upset that he had to go out and get a case for this much, and even more upset when he found the deal i did. thank you for your time, and i hope you enjoy your ipod nano!

<Content>i love the nano!!! white is better because the scratches do not show up as easily. a case will be needed to prevent scratches! i couldnt believe how small the ipod was when i took it in my hand. i imagined it would be small, because of that commerical, but i never really thought it would be this tiny! its very nice and compact. great features. if you are trying to decide whether or not to purchase this ipod, i would say go for it. i was most pleased with it. i will recommend getting new earphones. these did not last me long, and if you are excersing, they fall out too easily. also, if you do exercise, like taking jogs or just working out, i recommend an armband. it is most useful, but make sure you get a case with a special armband feature!!! if you listen to a lot of songs, i also recommend the 4GB ipod. you can store 1,000 songs on there, only 500 on this ipod, and 240 on the 1GB ipod. i am very happy i purchased this item. it is a great gift for anyone. there is a stopwatch feature on this compact item, and a few games too, such as solitare. the battery lasts about 14 hours... but after awhile, it will get rundown. most stores offer insurance on these kinds of things.

<Content>I use my ipod nano to go walking and I am so pleased with how small and light it is. No more heavy and bulky walkmans.  And the best part is, you chose whatever music you love. It is also very easy to use, and even while walking at a fast pace I can easily skip or repeat a song, make it louder or softer.  It can scratch easily so I bought a case to keep it in, which allows me to still access the controls. This is the smallest most amazing piece of technology. I highly recommend it!

<Title>too fragile!
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my opinion, ipods aren't very good to have. My friend had an ipod and he treated it like a laptop. He bought a case for it, kept it out of the sun, never dropped, scratched or shook it, and looked after it. When he tried charging it overnight, hewoke up the next morning and it had gone to sleep. It wouldn't turn on again, and the screen was cracked. He took it back to the shop, and explained how he treated it, and what happened. The manager said it had been dropped, and didn't believe him when he said it was brand new and he took good care of it. He has sent it into Apple and has asked for a refund. He is still waiting to hear from them. Two of my other friends have them, and so does my uncle and my music teacher, and they haven't had trouble with them, but there have been a lot of problems with other people's ipods.   And, I'll bet at least half the people who own ipods only have them because they're cool and the 'in' thing to have. Apple has done a good job of marketing them, but in some cases have cut the corners.   If you want an ipod, why don't you get an iriver instead? The model I have has 5gb, can store photos, has an fm radio, fm recorder and voice recorder. Three things ipods don't have. They have a colour screen and they are at least $100 cheaper than an ipod nano. There has been no problems with mine, nor with the people I know who have them. They aren't the 'in' thing, but you get more for less.  Plus, nanos are pencil thin and I'll bet would snap easily!

Downloads are a snap, burning my old CDs was easy and the service at the Apple Store on Michigan Ave was exceptional.

<Title>Most Useful Thing I Have Ever Bought
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is so amazing here is a list of some of the amazing things about it: 1)It's so small: It can be concealed so easily 2)It can do so many things: It can hold 500 songs and it can show you all of the song's CD cover pictures along with the lyrics. What else do u need to know about the song? 3)The calendar feature is AMAZING: It will automatically upload your Microsoft Outlookcalendar to your Ipod. So you can make a little alarm go off 15 minutes+ before your calendar event. So now i'm never late for tests, meetings, and due dates. 4)If I'm ever bored watching a lame movie for extra credit i can just put on my ipod, listen to some music, and play some games with it. Nobody will even notice you doing it because it's so small. PERFECT! 5)You can also upload COLOR photo's to it from your computer! And make little slideshows on it! AMAZING! 6)Also you can upload .txt files to the "Notes" folder in your ipod which can be helpful in many ways. 7)Many other features in this Ipod help me SO MUCH in everyday life.  One bad thing i've heard about Ipod Nanos is that it can be scratched easily...So when i bought mine, I also bought a little leather case with it and i've had my Ipod for over a month now and it is in PERFECT condition!  EVERYBODY should have an Ipod Nano, it makes life OH SO MUCH more entertaining! BUY IT! IT'S GREAT!

<Title>Pleasantly surprised
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned other MP3 players with similar storage capacities (most notably the relatively bulky RaveMP player).  I was a little hesitant about the nano because everything Apple seems to be over-priced, however, I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased the nano.  It has excellent sound quality (and volume capability), with surprisingly sturdy construction for such a small piece of equipment.  I run marathons, so it's important to have a reliable MP3 player.  The RaveMP was a good player, but the nano's construction, sound quality, customizable playlists, and it's ability to play MP4 music blows the Rave away.  Battery life is also around 12-14 hours (depending on volume and viewing options), and stores pictures as well as music.  I would've liked to have an arm-band that fully covers the nano against the elements (running in the Northwest can get a little soggy), but the one I did purchase covers most of it, holds the player snuggly against my upper-arm, and runs about $30.  I am hoping an arm-band similar to the full-size ipod is available soon.  I have friends with ipods, and found them to be a little heavy and bulky for running, but the nano seems to be the perfect size and it's viewing options and storage capacity makes it superior to the ipod shuffle in every way. Well worth the investment, but be careful not to leave it laying around, it'll disappear quick.

<Title>Best MP3 player in the world!!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I didn't realize why everyone was crazy about the ipod nano until I got it.  it small size is portable and convenient. it stores 2gb worth of music (500 songs). I only stored 55 songs so far.  you don't have to carry your cds anymore. everything fits on ipod. if you think you need more than 500 songs then get ipod nano 4gb, it's only $50 more.  amazon has the best deals on ipods. this is coming from a bargain hunter.

<Title>Lovely, Functional, but...............
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Nano. Everything a mp3 player should be is what the Nano is and then some. It is small so it doesn't draw that much attention when I am standing at the bus stop. It is fuctional because it isn't bogged down with "bells and whistles" it plays music, keeps time (clock and calendar) and holds pictures. Overall it is the best mp3 player I have ever had (I had many).  However, the battery life isn't as long lasting. The battery is usually zapped after 8 hrs of play (at least the one I have does) with the backlight off and volume about half way. I would have given 4 or 5 stars but the battery is my biggest issue.   If you get one check it out and if the battery isn't functioning as advertised, request that Apple fix it. You have about 90 days from the day of purchase to have it fixed at no charge to you.

<Title>Love the Nano!!
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I usually read all the reviews before I buy and I am really glad Amazon has a review guide. It really is a big help when deciding on a product. The Nano is what people said...a great product and I really enjoy it.   The only thing I would add was that I was concerned about the scratches that everyone spoke of, but I didn't find that to be a problem. I bought a nice case and it really doesn't come out of the case. I also left the clear plastic on the view window that it came in...I cut it so it just covers the view window.   The back is a shiny metallic-like surface and very nice to look at and the small scratches it does get are kind of the way it is. I mean cars are like that too...so shiny and nice and then they get these scratches, so I guess I am not as bothered as some were by this. I sort of expect things like that. Overall a great transaction and product. Amazon and Nano rock!!!!

<Title>Great for what I needed, Jobsite/Gym audio.
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had mine for about 6 weeks now and have been very pleased.  I didn't give it 5 stars for a few small reasons I'll get to later.   I am a carpenter and when I buy something I intend to actually use it out in the world, so I find the level of vitriol about the scratching on the surface pretty amusing.  Yes, it does scuff up easily, or at least very visibly.  I think "scatch" makes you think of a deep gouge, and I have not had that problem.  I *did* immediately go out and buy a clear sticker/protector for the screen and a little leather case for it from belkin that I am real happy with.    Some people complain about cases making it so big it defeats the purpose of a nano, but mine still fits easily into the front pocket of my jeans. (I'm about 5'11").  I would probably buy the 4gb if I had it to do over again, but I think these ipods are kind of like motorcycles, you always want the one just a *little* bigger than yours.    I use mine to listen to music at work and for running, and 2gb/500 songs is plenty for that.  It actually is good not to have all my music on this thing, as it makes me go back and add and subtract songs, which always leads to "Oh, I forgot all about that song!"    The small size is great for me, as I'm wearing a toolbelt all day already.  It has also performed really well considering it is in a dusty environment all day, every day.  I have dropped it a few times from about 4 feet (In the leather case) and have had no problems.  This was the reason I went with a flash memory player with no moving parts; it has to be able to take a little abuse.  So far, so good.  The only cons are small:  I wish it had a better manual, it can do quite a few things but you need to google around to find them all, the apple site is not well organized.  There are some little  things I am sure I should be able to do with player but just haven't found the info , which is annoying.  The IKEA directions-style, spare-as-heck manual is, yes, cool to look at, but a boring old pamphlet of features and menu listings would have been much more useful.   Selfishly, I also wish the accessories, earbuds, etc., came in black, as I have turned them all dirty grey anyway by taking it to work.  It would also make it less of a pickpocket target here in NYC.  I have been generally really happy with it, and after buying a car adapter and FM radio adapter thingy (check prices at your local big box store before buying accessories), I have been using this as my primary source of audio, especially podcasts, which now allow me to get NPR, the BBC, etc. on my own timetable.

<Title>Didn't Know What to Expect

<Content>I'm used to Vacuum Tube Home stereo enjoying the richness and sound stage, i.e. musicallity.  Bought the ipod for my hours on my indoor bike and for runs. Couldn't get the "earbuds" to stay put so I purchased Shure "buds"... Great sound and since I have learned the art of Playlists, I can record a 30 minute, 60 minute or what ever I choose and take along the modal sounds of Miles or Coltrane, the voices of Ella, Frank and others all lifted for my CD and record collections. I've even downloaded from the Music Store--easy. Still learning how to use it for pod casts, etc. My AKG Headphones even work in the little ipod. Great product and welcome new learning for a "tube addict".

<Content>Perfect for first-time iPod buyers!  Easy to use; excellent size for an active person whether running, hiking or traveling anywhere in the world.  Important to note: if you want to use your iPod while traveling without computer access, you will need a wall adapter charger (just plug it into an outlet while waiting for your flight. You can listen to your tunes while charging). The optional arm band is a good add-on for easy handsfree usage. Only disappointed that it didn't have more playtime with charges and sometimes it had the tendency to skip.

<Title>iPod Nano 2GB
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Lots of people write reviews of this product just to see it on amazon, even if they don't have an iPod, so I'd like you to know that I have this exact iPod and have had it for about a month.  Pros: Design: Small, thin, sleek with a nice chrome back Flash Memory: For those of you who don't know the difference between a flash-drive and a hard-drive, flash drives are smaller, more durable, and have less of a chance of freezing up, but hard drives can hold way more space. This iPod Nano has flash memory. Good headphones: Nice, good-looking and comfortable. Sound quality: Not the best, but good. Controls: Easy to learn, and fun to use. Games: Surprisingly fun. It comes with "Breakout" or what they call "Brick". "Parachute", which is shooting people parachuting in the army. "Solitaire", and the strangely fun "Music Quiz". I have heard rumors of apple making games to download to iPod from the internet. Photos: Good feature and album art displays. You can browse pictures while listening to music iTunes: Perhaps the best music software Bright color screen: Beautiful screen Accessories: They are everywhere Screen Lock: Nice feature, but basically useless.  Cons: Durability: Screen scratches easily. I recommend either getting a case or keeping the plastic on it Design: Blemishes show up on the black version very easily No voice recording: Many Mp3 player have that. It's the 21st century No FM radio: once again, many Mp3 player have that. It's the 21st century Battery Life: good if you just play music, but if you do alot of navigating, it could be better. No dedicated volume: Not good if your buried in the menus, but a minor flaw. Headphone jack is on the bottom: I think it was put there because the screen was in the way for the top. Could come in more colors: The Zen Micro comes in 10 colors Last and most certainly least, False advertising: Not exactly 2 gigs, it is about 1.83. It wouldn't bother me that much if it was 1.95 or 96, but it was hard enough for me to choose which 1.60 out of my 3.60 gigs to not put on this, put I found out I had to choose 0.17 more gigs, but I got over that. The advertising rates 500 song, but I filled mine up at about 330 (alot of my songs are past 10 minutes and go all the way up to 30 minutes).  Overall I am very pleased with the iPod Nano. I would have got the Zen Micro (about the same price, but over twice the memory), but it isn't sold in stores and I didn't want to use a credit card. I think the Nano is the best sold in stores, but if your looking for the best anywhere, checkout the Zen Micro.

<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK FOLKS, ENOUGH WITH THE "I GOT THE IPOD (OR CD OR DVD OR APPAREL OR WHATEVER) FOR FREE" SCHEME!!! Isn't there a way to complain to Amazon.com and get the person or persons behind it completely wiped from Amazon?? I mean, once was enough, but every other message posted seems to be from an "I Got It For Free!" scheme!! ENOUGH YOU IDIOTS, OBVIOUSLY LIKE ANY SALE SCHEME YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET IT FREE--ENOUGH!! Anyway, the iPod Nano is a brilliant piece of technology; I think Apple exaggerates about battery life, after about 10 minutes of play on mine the battery icon starts shrinking, and it scratches easily (can be taken care of with a cover of course). I suggest a 4GB, I didn't think I had that many songs I liked listening to so I purchased the 2GB but I guess I was wrong. Overall, 4/5.

<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Have really come to love the IPod Nano I got. Am not the sort of guy who listens to music all day long and hence 2 GB suffices for me. For people who want really huge storage capacity, I guess the IPod Nano wouldn't make much sense. The Nano is sleek and fits in your pocket pretty easily and its size is probably its biggest gain. Besides the user interface is really cool.  The only thing I have against the IPod in general is that the ear phones aren't that great and hence I ended up buying Bose headphones. Now that's the best of both worlds ;)
