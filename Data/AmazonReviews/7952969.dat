<Content>This is my first Mp3 player but I am dissappointed. After dropping accidently 2 times the radio doesn't work and the order of songs is wacked. The sound quality is good but the backlight is annoying and the led screen doesn't always display the correct info from windows Media Player. The SD card doesn't even notice 1/4 of the songs I Put in and I am unhappy.

<Content>Initally, I enjoyed using this player but after a month or so the player wouldn't work. I reloaded the firmware as directed by on-line support without success.  The player turns itself off rather than playing the selected file. Now what?
