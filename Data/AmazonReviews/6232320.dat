<Title>a great product but...
<Date>Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player for when I go to the gym or beach.  Something that if I dropped it in the parking lot I wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss.  This was the player for me.  What they didn't tell you is that the software and Windows XP don't play well together.  I tried downloading different drivers and such from their website.  I just made a bigger mess than I had before.  Long and short...I had to borrow a friends computer running Windows Me to get things to work.  Once it did, I loved my little gadget.  It was just a long process to get there.

<Title>OK for short use but not good for the long haul
<Date>Sun Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>We've had two Rio 600 MP3 players for over a year now, and while they are generally good units, there are several problems that are worth noting.<p>First, with 32MB, we can fit around 10 songs onto the MP3 player. While this is great for a daily selection on the bus or in the car, when we've taken trips those 10 songs get old REALLY quickly. So depending on how you're going to use it, that limit may be fine or may drive you crazy.<p>Next, as much as we've tried to be very careful with our units, they drop sometimes. They fall out of pockets, or down the stairs, or your hands slip while using them. Sure, I don't expect the units to last if you drop them onto concrete from 30 feet. But even the smallest drop seems to damage pins and switches. We have numerous problems with our Rios, from buttons not working to bizarre behavior, from even slight mishaps.<p>The headphones aren't really a big deal to us because we probably have 20 sets of headphones around the house. Most people who enjoy music have headphones already - getting a set with their MP3 is the least of their worries. Yes, the default headphones are barely adequate, but that is hardly a reason to choose or not choose a MP3 player.<p>We found the software to be quite good - and plus, just about every other MP3 software package we use also sees the Rio. So even if you don't like the software that comes with the Rio, you're hardly stuck for options.<p>The main issues we have really come down to its small memory size and its flimsy quality. Sure, you can buy more memory for it. But it's probably far wiser to buy a higher quality unit that already comes with more memory, and have it last you many years.

<Content>It was a dark and stormy night...lightning flashed in the diamond multimedia building. They had just created the ultimate mp3 player...the rio 600!! DUM DUM DUUUUUUUM. Ok i know i shouldn't be writing a review if i dont own this product but i can't help it. Courier messed up my shipping type, now the device will be here on monday. But from what i've heard the rio 600 is an awesome simple device yet has a few defects. <br>Pros:Large backlit lcd display<br>     USB support<br>     upgradable firmware and memory (future proof)<br>     Changeble sexy faceplates<br>     Ajustable equalizer<br>Cons: Only 32mb of memory<br>      Bad customer service<br>      Memory is only upgradeble by means of special (expensive) unreleased "backpacks"<p>All in all im looking forward to my rio arriving on monday

<Title>average mp3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Rio 600 32 MB is an average MP3 player. <br>Its got more Cons than Pros!!!<br>Cons:<br>-Rio Audio Manager software is sooo useless, even amateurs can write better software than this. <br>-The buttons(play/pause,stop,next track etc) are soo difficult to use since they dont have the feel of a button at all. They are more like a dial which is really stupid.<br>-Earplugs given with this product is soo stupid and get entangled all the time.<p>Pros:<br>+Low battery consumption(about 9-10Hrs on a single battery)<p>+Windows Media player 9.0 detects this player immediately and is easy to transfer files(takes 10 secs to transfer a song)<br>+Supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) which has better compression at 64kbps.<p>Also I see most people pointing out that 32MB is too low to listen to a lot of songs but thats all you can do when you have a 32 MB player. Its not the fault of RIO mp3 player.

<Title>could be happier with it
<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was so excited to buy my first mp3 player about a year ago, however I should have done a little more research first.  I was happy with all the features, the display, etc., but there are a few issues worth noting with this.  First of all, the battery doesn't last anywhere near the 11 hours it says.  If I leave it for any length of time without using it, the battery dies as well.  Then there is the memory issue.  I realize that is an issue with any 32 MB mp3 player, however, the memory backpack things are impossible to find; though the wonderful people at the store I purchased it at assured me I could order them online, that was not the case.  I suspect the reason they didn't have them at the store was that this model was on its way out. The website currently makes no acknowledgement of the memory &quot;backpacks&quot;, and while they do still have software updates for the 600 model, they don't sell it anymore.  I have not been able to find them ANYWHERE.  If you want more than 10 songs, do not buy this.

<Title>Most horrible thing I ever bought
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This was a horrible and udderly usless piece of junk.  When I first got mine (the first one i got) it worked for about 3 days. Then it just stopped working and i just heard static when i wanted the song to play.  Along with that, the software didn't work (i have a PC).  I tried countless times to upgrade on its site, called costumer support(which was very inconsiderate and didn't care if it got fixed or not), and did everything possible to fix it.  Then I got another one, thinking this one was just a bad one.  I was wrong.  Same problems with the software, and it worked for 5 days, then i just got static again.<br>       All in all, don't buy this one and get an archos or something (archos work very well.)even if it is a little more money.

<Title>Horrible battery life, cheap quality plastic design
<Date>Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was not impressed with this MP3 player at all. First of all, im not sure if mine was defective but it would only go 2-3 hours of playing time before the battery would flat out die. I tried upgrading the firmware or calibrating the battery beforehand. This brings me to the quality of the design, when I try and get to the battery compartment. You have to remove the entire back cover and then open this other flimsy door to get to the one AA battery. Try and squeeze the battery in the small space while so worried that the small plastic holders are going to break off. One you got that in, you have to carefully position the back cover to fit back on with the metal contacts in place. Whew.<p>Goods:<br>-Nice blue backlight<br>-Small Light Design<br>-Somewhat easy menu system.<br>-Easy to copy songs using iTunes on mac [no experience with pc software]<br>-Fast/Easy USB.<p>Bads:<br>-Cheap flimsy plastic case<br>-Extremely short battery life<br>-Hard to replace batteries [Afraid of breaking something while squeezing that AA in an extremely small plastic holder thing.<br>-Horrible customer service when trying to get it fixed. They keep saying to flash the memory upgrade firmware I have done all that with no avail!<br>-Doesnt use any traditional upgrade memory method [compact flash or smart media] It needs some kind of special backpack to strap on the back for only another 32MB of memory.<p>In conclusion, I would not recommend the Rio 600, even though it was quite cheap. Spend about $20 more for a Creative Labs' Nomad IIc. It has double the memory and easy to expand.

<Title>excellent product- rio 600
<Date>Thu Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was very pleased with the Rio 600. Before recieving it, i was worried it wouldn't turn out so well because i had checked online reviews about it and said that it doesn't work, etc. However, for me it worked great! I took it on a field trip, it worked perfectly. very easy to change the battery. the battery can wear out fast, but don't keep the backlighting on so much, and remember to turn it off. by doing that, the battery lasted for three days for me. the rio-600 is a bit larger than other rio models, but yet, its still very compact. i did not use the headphones provided and the sound quality was pretty good. i didn't use the software either, but easily got mp3 files uploaded through real player. its very easy to download file from there, just add in rio- 600 as your audio device, and then copy files from there. rio-600 has little memory, but i still got it to download six files. i heard you can also add a memory card which lets it have up to 320 mb of memory! overall, i'm a satisfied owner of the rio-600.

<Title>If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player
<Date>Sun Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months.  (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack).  After the first three months, it simply stopped working.  Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.<p>Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement.  i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again.  I wish I had believed other reviews about this product.  If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing.  if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio.  You get what you pay for... (paid $70)

<Title>Great new mp3 player, VERY upgradeable
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The diamond rio 600 is a great player.  It doesn't feel fragile like the previous rio models and has very good sound quality with the earphones that come with it.  Apparently, you can switch faceplates so your rio will have  different colors but there isn't really any point to doing that because the  original color is just fine.  The worst feature of the rio 600 is that it  only comes with 32mb of memory which translates to around 6 or 7 good  quality songs.  The software it comes with gives you the option of reducing  the bitrate of the songs, allowing you to fit more songs on.  However, I  would not recommend doing this because this causes the background music to  make a &quot;squeak&quot; type noise that is very irritating.  Of course,  you can also purchase additional memory in &quot;backpacks&quot; of 32, 64,  and a whopping 340mb in addition to the 32mb of internal memory.  Unlike  the rio 500, you can actually increase the volume to a level that blocks  out most of the background noise.  I would definitely recommend this  product to a friend as it has a very low price and with the large memory  upgrades, you aren't likely to want to buy another mp3 player for a very  long time.

<Content>I like the device but have a couple complaints: not enough memory 32 is just too small and I can't find the upgrade modules yet. No belt clip, a case is extra $$ I'm hoping the fm tuner remote and extra memory modules  will be out soon and be affordable. (can`t be too soon for me). I use a Mac  and already use the included soundjam software, the usb download was fast  and software easy to use, I just need more memory!  The price was  reasonable as well, but we'll see when I add-in the extras I want.

<Title>Great player, for a great price.
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ever since listining to my friends mp3 player ive wanted one, but the price of quality players quickly detoured me.  My eyes lit up when I can across this player on rio's site, and the price, $169 practicly made my  eyes bulge out of my head.  The usb cable is great for quick downloads.   Also the memory backpacks are cheaper then flash cards, and you can upgrade  it to 340 megs with them.  The sound is great, it has a great interface  which makes it easy to change the settings.  Also if you want to spend an  extra $20 you can get a remote control that unlocks the ability to use the  fm tuner (havn't got that yet). It's asteticly pleasing, but if you don't  like the blue you can buy many different faceplates to customize the look.   Its very light and it fits perfectly in your hand, the lcd display is easy  to read and if your in the dark its backlit.  This is a great player for  anyone.

<Title>Good....good for beginners
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ok, I like this player. i like it alot. to tell you the truth this player is the first one ive ever owned, and because of the fact that you can upgrade, might be my last. The sound is quite clear, no problems there. To  me the actual best part of this player was the software, i love the  software almost more then the actual player. its very easy to use and cool.  The only bad parts in my opinion is th play/pause/forward/backward/stop  buttons are all on one little disk, they can be a little dificult at times.  also if you want to upgrade your memory to somthing higer, you have to by  new little &quot;backpackes&quot; that have to go on the back, in my  opinion it would have been easier if they used flash cards.  over all the  Rio 600 is a well rounded player with many cool hip accesories, like a diff  color plates. you can also get an FM tuner extra. Worth the money in my  opinion.

<Title>something that you should know
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>For me and others the rio 600 was a long awaited electronic device.  Sadly my first rio was a dud.  It cracked and poped and sped up and slowed down unexpectedly.  It also thought every song was under a minute and half even  though it was not.  After playing just a small part of the song it would go  onto the next song even though the first one wasn't done.  Example: the  player says the song lasts 3:44 it ends at only 1:30 into the song.  I then  spent an hour talking with diamond over the phone and they told me it was a  dud. So I took it back after working with it for 5 hours.  The new one acts  the same way so I tried it on another computer and it plays the whole song  now but it still sounds like Rice Crispies.  The USB port is squirly and  causes the songs to have big glitches but the computer version of the mp3  has no problems the computer version should be identical to the rios  version.  This prouduct is just begging for a recall.  Be smart don't  invest in a rio till this one gets a recall.

It's easy to use, the RealJukebox software is reliable and easy, and it does come with a case and belt clip.  I bought it 4 months ago.  I use WMA format and can store most full length cds.  Storage capacity is not a problem, because I'll typically load a new cd into it practically everyday.  It only takes a matter of minutes!  I got 2 rechargeable AA batteries for it and so now battery life is not a problem.  I use it with sony earbud headphones for better sound quality.

<Date>Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I got this player as a gift and was SO excited about it. I read some bad reviews and went, "whatever." MY personal experience was that it was a really good player at the beginning, good software [once I figured out how to use it...took me awhile as I'm not very technically inclined], and looked great. Then, the buttons got really hard to push/broke entirely...fast forward to now: it's practically un-usable. The thing sits on my bookshelf 24/7/365...which stinks. What ticks me off worse is that I wrote various e-mails to the company about a replacement or refund and received really stinky customer service e-mails back...vague and super unhelpful. The player also eats up the AA batteries pretty fast. I really don't recommend this player...don't get me wrong...buy an MP3 player [the idea rocks!] but make sure you get one from a more reliable company and one that got better Amazon.com reviews!

<Content>Since i work at an electronics store, i get to test and play with these things. I personally own a 32 and 64 MB Rio 600. For the 32MB one, i get several people returning their rio 600's all the time. A few of those, their unit never worked at all, but to most they returned it about 2 months in use or more. I have had my Rio 600 32mb for 1 year and 3 months now, and it is still in great shape, and works like a charm. Why is this? It hasnt broke in 2 months because i have taken extremely good care of it. Most people's players die because they bend a small part in the hardware, such as in the batteries. So when i do anything with the batteries, i am EXTRA CAREFUL. Treat it like you are inserting batteries in a 2000 year old artifact that will crumble if you are the least bit rough on it. Don't try to insert the batteries in a hurry, either. Just be real careful, and try not to drop it. Also, be careful when insterting/taking out the usb cable and headphones also, to avoid bending anything. <br>Player Pros/Cons<br>Pros:<br>-Nice Appearance<br>-Good Interface and fast connection speed<br>-One battery thank god<br>-Lasts long if you take good care of it<br>Cons:<br>-32MB isnt enough, expensive expansion<br>-Batteries dont last long and battery indicator is wrong<br>-You have to take good care of it<p>Enjoy

I can also have a lot of diffrent songs without having to buy all those CD's. What also great about it is that it doest skip. I run and jog with it and it doesn't miss a beat. The clip clips right on to me so I don't have to hold it. Also the download time is really fast. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it holds a fair amount of music it could be a little bigger but it is still a great product.

Using the WMA format it sounds just fine.  <p>It is not easily expanded, but if that is what you are after get a mini-disc so that expansion is as simple as buying additional, low cost, discs.

<Title>A familiar tale: It's great while it lasts
<Date>Sun Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I will echo what seems to be a common refrain: after a while, the Rio 600 just quit working for no apparent reason. If you turn the volume up all the way, you can hear a faint clicking and popping rendition of what would be the bass line if you could hear the music.<p>I got this unit free as a promotion when I bought some networking equipment. I thought it was a neat little gadget, and it worked as promised in the beginning. The software could be more intuitive, but it got the music onto the player. The earphones hurt my ears, so I replaced them with an inexpensive pair of Koss earbuds from Wal-Mart, and that worked great. I was very pleased with the sound quality of this little unit. 32 MB is really not quite enough memory, however; you could expect to get 30 to 40 minutes worth of music loaded. If you're planning on using it a lot, rechargeable batteries would be a good idea (although if it breaks fast enough, that won't matter). I tried it out for running and for downloading short clips to practice on my guitar, but the bottom line was that it was never quite convenient enough for me to use regularly. <p>So it sat in a drawer for many months until my wife's portable CD player started to skip. I loaded up a playlist for her, and the first time she tried it out while running, the abovementioned problem occurred. Judging from the other reviews, this is a non-repairable problem, so it looks like we'll toss the Rio 600 and try something else. <p>Nice try, SonicBlue, but at this point the most valuable parts of the unit are the Koss earbuds and the AA battery.

<Title>Rio 600's most significant feature improvement is....
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>WMA SUPPORT!   I can't seem to stress this enough! There is one and only one reason I decided to give up on my old Rio500(after multiple failures which are too many to list here) and go with the Rio600 ,it's WMA support.  Without it...32megs of memory would certainly not get the job done but with  it...32megs of memory is in essence just as good as 64megs. of memory (the  Rio500) of a player that only supports MP3.<p>Now before all you MP3  &quot;Loyalist&quot; have a cow...hear me out.  I kept reading the claims  of Microsoft and their WMA encoding format as being capable of delivering  sound quality just as good if not better than MP3@128kbps at half the file  size...WMA encoded at 64kbps.  Well, after testing the various encoding  rates of MP3 and not being able to tolerate anything less than 128kbps  (didn't even consider MP3@64Kbps...ouch!)...I really doubted the claims of  Microsoft and WMA.<p>However, anything that promises to double my music  playing time without having to spend mega dollars through memory expansion  and still maintain &quot;near&quot; CD quality sound is certainly worth a  try.  So that is what I did.  I converted several of my MP3's@128kbps to  WMA@64kbps and then did a  &quot;side by side&quot; sound comparison of the  two for any given song.  Folks...I was hard pressed to hear any difference  in quality.  And in those few instances where while listening very hard...I  thought there was a small difference...it certainly was not enough to  matter.  Wow! was I thrilled with the possibilities of WMA.  So, when  Diamond announced support for this format with their new line of  players...I knew that I would purchase the Rio600 as soon as possible.<p>I  couldn't help but shake my head as I read one reviewer call the WMA support  as ...&quot;meaningless&quot; because it is not an &quot;open&quot; format  like MP3. Well, when you are downloading to the player...what does it  matter?   I have all my music still preserved as MP3's on CD-R's ready for  conversion to any other format that may  exceed the memory saving space of  WMA.<p>Besides the WMA support...this player has so much more going for it  than the earlier Rio's and all other players out there.  I'm afraid I will  be running out of room to go into detail but I just felt with all the  complaints about the measly 32megs. of memory with the Rio600...it seems  that most people have not attempted or are not aware of the true advantage  of WMA...CD quality sound and half the size of MP3 means<p>twice the  music!<p>You really owe it to yourself to try it out.

<Title>this rio rocks!
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>if you are trying to decide between the 600 and other players, your search has ended here. The rio is not only incredibly lightweight but is very small. The software this player comes with is AWESOME it's very easy to use  and even reads mp3's from zip disks. If you are thinking about getting a  player with flash memory think again not only does the rio come with memory  but you can soon buy a 32 megabyte expansion for 50 bucks!  try buying a  32 meg flash card at 50 bucks!  the diamond comes with headphones that are  very comfy and great software, plus a usb cable. I downloaded a 4 meagabyte  song in 5 secconds!  The usb is not only fast but as soon as i plugged it  in it immediatly detected the player. i just can't say enough about this  player i would give it 15 stars if amazon would let me!  trust me, if you  buy this player you won't be dissapointed. p.s.s the sound this baby makes  is just like a cd, forget what that other guy said about crackles, it's  crystal clear!

<Title>Rio600 review...part II.
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ok, my last review had more to do with &quot;championing&quot; theadvantages of the WMA format over MP3 (since the Rio600 supports WMA). But I would like to know add my thoughts and review of the player and what I believe are it's biggest improvement (besides WMA support) over the previous Rio's, particularly the Rio500.<p>Style-No doubt about it, the Rio600 blows away the previous Rio's in the style category. Of course I realize that this is a subjective trait but the Rio600 is quite an &quot;eye catcher&quot; IMHO.<p>Feel-The case coating material (I believe it is teflon or some other &quot;rubber&quot; based compound) gives the player a real nice feel while holding it in the palm of your hand.  Also, that &quot;odd&quot; shape is really quite ergonomically sound.<p>Functionality-Big improvement here as well.  The &quot;joy pad&quot; (as Diamond calls it) is far better than the small individual &quot;function&quot; buttons of the Rio500. Once you put your finger on it, you are able to easily engage all the major playback options (play/pause, forward, backward and stop) without looking at the player. With the Rio500, you have to either take the player out of it's clip carrying case or just guess whether or not your finger is on the correct button for whatever play back option you are trying to engage.  I am able to keep the Rio600 in it's case (I purchased a &quot;generic&quot; Neosporin cell phone clip case and it fits like a glove and works great) while just reaching down, putting my finger on the joy pad and from there it is quite simple to know where all the play back options are. Also, the playback buttons on the Rio500 were &quot;above&quot; the case surface.  This made it somewhat necessary to engage the &quot;hold&quot; button on top.  With the Rio600, the rim of the joy pad is &quot;flush&quot; with the case surface and then gradually is &quot;indented&quot; into the surface in a &quot;cone like&quot; geometry.  So, if you bump the player into a piece of equipment, it is far more unlikely that the playback features will be altered thus making the use of the hold button unnecessary. Again, not engaging the &quot;hold&quot; button then makes it possible to easily engage all the other playback options with the joy pad while actively exercising, etc.  This also makes the need for a add on remote less useful.<p>Navigation-Once again...much better than the Rio500.  The thumbwheel of the Rio500 is not intuitive in the least.  When I purchased the Rio500, the instructions (if you could call it that) that came with it were pretty pathetic.  No where did it mention how to access the &quot;submenu&quot; options using the thumbwheel.  I found that out after &quot;technical support call #1&quot; (with many, many more to come over the next several months). The Rio600 is very intuitive and very easy to figure out.  How can you not understand it with a dedicated button labeled &quot;menu&quot;? Once you hit this button, a row of folder tabs rise from the button of the LCD screen.  Very similar to your toolbar in Windows if you have the &quot;auto hide&quot; option chosen.  Now here is where it does require a little technical intuition on the users part.  You use the joy pad to navigate from one folder tab to the other.  You hit the center button of the joy pad to choose your option.  You are able to move in all 4 directions and choose the various options with the joy pad.  Again, much better than the thumbwheel of the Rio500. Generally, the whole LCD display is far more pleasing than the Rio500.<p>USB Interface and Transfer-Well, hooking up the player end of the USB cable takes a little more effort than the Rio500 but it may be worth.  It appears to be much faster than the Rio500 in the transfer rate.  Also, if the player is off (in the sleep mode that is)...once you hook up the USB cable the player comes to life and turns on.  This seems to indicate that unlike the Rio500, the USB is actually supplying the power during transfer.  Big advantage if this is indeed the case...much less drain on the battery.<p>Bottom line...easily a big improvement over the Rio500!  And with future accessories (particularly the memory/rechargeable upgrade back packs), this player will even be better.  I was going to hold out for the Rio800 but since I was having so many problems with my Rio500 (can you say 4 returned and 5 failed units! ), I decided to grab this as soon as possible.  I can honestly say that for $100.00 dollars less than the Rio500...this player has made me one happy consumer.  If you think that I am forgetting the fact that this is only a 32meg. player vs. the Rio500's 64megs...please read my initial post about the WMA format support and what this essentially means in terms of total playing time.  Also, a few have said that this player is having problems with MP3 playback.  I can not speak to this since I only use WMA music files on this player and they all have worked flawlessly.<p>Hoped this information helps,<p>Drew

<Title>Diamond Rio facts
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've been wanting an mp3 player for a while now and I have been tracking the different kinds ever since they came out.  I almost bought a Rio 500, until I heard of the Rio 600. Though there are a couple of reviews that say  it's a bad product (doesn't play whole song, sound is bad)I have not  encountered any of these problems. It plays the whole song without  skipping, and the sound is quite impressive, especially the base it can  offer. The software is satisfactory, and though it only comes with 32  megabytes of memory, the WMA support it offers still allows me to put about  16 songs on it. This compared to a 300 dollar Nomad II without WMA support  kind of seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, the Rio 600 doesn't have  voice recording capability, at least not out of the box. Of course, if the  mp3 you're recording has problems, then obviously the Rio, or any other mp3  player is not going to play it well. Make sure you have a good enough  computer to do USB transfers. All that aside, the Rio 600 has been very  good for me so far.

<Title>its aiight....
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The device itself is alright, menu options are cool, sound quality is good, and its compact size and rad earphones are very good.  The main drawback is that the buttons are kinda jacked. You're supposed to be able to hold and skip back or forward for 'X' amount of seconds, but the  button's circular-disc design limits the control of your search.  The  button can jam on you causing the whole thing to freeze, in which case you  gotta slide the battery/memory pack out and back in to reset the device.   To avoid this you should try and use the circular control button for track  search only.  <p>The software that comes with it isn't all that great.   Nothing really new has been put on there.  In fact, if you want better  sound and rips you should get MusicMatch Jukebox, and if you want better  visuals you should get Sonique, both of which are freewares.  The only  thing you really need from Rio Audio Manager is its upload ability which is  very fast.<p>Overall, this has been a mediocre purchase.  If you're looking  for an Mp3 portable player, you might want to look into something with more  memory since the additional memory backpacks(available later this summer)  may boost the overall price of the Rio 600 [considerably].

<Title>Rio 600 Pros and Cons
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Here's my assessment of things I like and don't like about the Rio 600:<p>Pros:<p>*Small, lightweight *No Skipping *Decent sound quality (the above apply to pretty much any portable MP3 player) *WMA Support *USB interface for fast transfer of songs *Future support for 340MB IBM  Microdrive *Possible future AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) support *Low  price<p>Cons: *Rio Audio Manager software is extremely cumbersome to use  *Supplied earphones do not sound good and will have to be replaced *You  cannot distinctly discern by touch what button you're pushing on the round  pad.  You'll end up stopping or pausing tracks when you want to skip to the  next track. *Only 32MB RAM standard with no upgrades available at this time  *Larger than previous model Rio 500 *No belt clip *No recording for FM  tuner<p>The Rio 600 is your basic MP3 player.  WMA support is nice, but  because of Digital Rights Management, the WMA format is difficult to deal  with and I'm not going to convert all my MP3s to WMA.  Someone should have  tested the Rio 600's button pad for usability.  You can't feel what button  you're pushing and because the Rio 600's body is curvy, it's hard to  discern up/down/left/right without looking at it.  You also have to use  your fingernail to push the tiny center button or you'll accidentally press  on of the up/down/left/right buttons as well.<p>As of right now, I would  recommend the Rio 600 over any other MP3 player currently available, not so  much because it's so good in itself, but it's good when you compare it to  the others.  The things I most wish it had right now are memory packs and  better software.  I'm not sure how much the memory pack upgrades will cost,  but I'm hoping that a 32MB memory pack will not put it in the ballpark of a  Rio 800 which will come with 64MB standard and have recording  support.<p>The Rio 600 is cheap, but if you get the Rio 600, plan on  spending more money on headphones and a memory upgrade, unless you want to  deal with the WMA format.  Faceplates allow you to change the color of the  Rio, but the standard metallic blue is stylish enough for me.

<Title>Welcome to the Next Level
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>S3 has heightened the standard for entry-level MP3 players with an inexpensive player that includes USB, Mac-compatibilty, and expandibility.  <p>Mac users rejoice, finally S3 (Diamond) has given us an inexpensive MP3  player compatible with the Mac. I own a PC at home, but I'm a Mac user in  my office. <p>While the Windows software rocks, the Mac's Soundjam software  leaves a lot to be desired. At Mac World companies like MusciMatch were  promising plug-ins for their MP3 players to allow 600 users to manage their  portable players, so maybe someone will develop a better interface.  However, I'm happy to have a player that works without any glitches on both  OS 8.6 and 9.04. <p>My main qualms with the harware is the on/off switch  because it also controls the ability to turn off the buttons when you stash  it in a pocket. In addition, I don't like the ear-buds packed with the  system.  Plus, don't trust the machine's battery monitor.  When the  batteries inch below 40%, grab an extra one in the event that it  prematurely dies -- I had this problem in the subway the other day.  In  addition, I reccomend Duracell Ultras for the 600, and a good pair of Sony  earphones.    <p>I can't wait for the memory upgrades. While other critics  pan S3's choice to stop using standard flash memory formats, I praise S3  because the company chose the new form factor, so they could use IBM's  smartdrive technology, which are basically small hard drives.  The price of  a 300 mb smart drive is the same as 64 mb of standard flash memory.  Hmm,  60 minutes of music, or 5 hours of music?  Unfortunately the smartdrive  backpacks won't be available until Christmas.  <p>This player is ideal for  both Windows and Mac users because of S3's embrace of smartdrive  technology.  However, if you already have a player, but are looking at  nextgen models with USB, wait until Christmas when the smartdrive  technology is available.

<Title>S3 Rio 600 review
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Rio 600 is a very good product. It has a low price $169.99, very good  sound quality,and, is above all easy to use. I did at first experience a  few problems with the whole song not playing, but after a few painless  calls to service and support, all the problems were fixed. The software is  fairly easy to use and because of the USB connectivity, downloads only take  a few seconds. You can also swap the blue faceplate for other faceplates  that are available at riostuff.com. This player is definitely a fashion  statement. The reason I'm giving this player 3 stars is it's meager  on-board memory. There are memory back packs available to boost it's  on-board memory,but it would have been a lot easier if it just supported  Compact Flash cards. But, if its combination of low price, stylishness, and  ease of use has won you over, just use WMA files like Drew said to  compensate for its slightly lacking memory.

<Content>The Rio 600 was a five-star product for the first three months; 3 stars for the next three, after the power slider broke --fortunately it remained in the "on" position :) ; and after six months, it stopped working altogether.  <p>Pros:<br>-Stylish<br>-Backlit display <br>-Good sound quality at low volumes, can get very loud (I usually listened at the volume setting of 3 out of 20, given a quiet room--but YMMV depending on the earphones)<br>-Neoprene belt case at least is rugged :P<p>Cons:<br>-Poor build quality <br>-Poor design decisions<br>-Proprietary memory expansion<br>-Rioport software works only with CDs as far as I know<p>When I first received the Rio 600 I was thrilled.  It felt nice and solid in the hand, the backlit LCD looked great with lots of track information, and the sound quality seemed pretty good.  I even grew to like the included earphones, which I found to be perfect for the gym and bike riding, unlike earbuds.  (For folks who like that type but hate getting their hair pinched, Sony makes the MDR-W08, which is all plastic). <p>I picked up a 64MB backpack (at a ridiculous price per MB, compared to CF, SM or SD cards) but the Rio600 was one of the few players to natively support Audible.com content, so I felt it was worth it.<p>A few months after I got it, the power slider became stuck in the "On" position.  I gave it a tug and it broke, sliding around freely.  The player stayed on, however, and since it will go into standby on its own, I didn't mind _too_ much. <p>But I really hated their design decision to use a d-pad button layout, instead of separate buttons for play/pause, ff, previous.  I can't count the times I tried to hit pause and went to the next track, or worse yet, hit previous and went to the beginning of the audiobook.  I'd rather have something you can operate easily by feel.<p>Then the d-pad quit working entirely (the play/pause button seems to be stuck) and I'm now in the market for a new player :(  I hate to say it, but since I have a 64MB paperweight, I'm thinking about giving the Rio 600 another try. It really was nice while it lasted.   <p>Then I press the d-pad on my broken unit (nope, still hard as a rock) and decide to look for something better.

<Content>Quite simply - I have two of them - and for the money - you cannot beat the musical experience.It's true you'll need to probably add the 64mb module to increase the amount of music stored - but you can buy the backpack modules on EBAY used if you'd like. And yes - Windows Media program is definately the transfer program to use. But it works FINE with Windows XP - it recognizes the Rio the second you plug it in. Downloads are fast and easy !<p>The headphones do have to be replaced for extended listening. Try finding a decent set that ships with ANY portable out there.

<Content>One of the best things about MP3 players is that you can easily put on whatever type of sound interests you most - whether it's jazz music, old time rock n' roll, or even bird songs! It's perfect not only for music, but also for any hobby that involves sound! For one great price you can get yourself an easily customizeable, greatly dynamic bird song system / language training system / etc. that doubles as a portable jukebox!<p>I love the Rio 600 - I have 2 of them - and they're super easy to load music on and off of. Just rip your favorite CDs, rearrange them into your own personal play sets, and load them onto the Rio. Want to learn a new language? Load up a set of phrases. Going birdwatching at the beach? Stick 20 beach bird songs on there, and there's plenty of room left for some music too!<p>The Rio has been very sturdy for me - we've dragged them everywhere, dropped them, thrown them, and it keeps on running strong. <p>Highly, highly recommended!

It comes with a carrying case that you can clip on to anything!  The software is easy to use. The sound quality is great! I have never been more happier in my life with this product. It is true, you do need to buy better headphones. You would with any other brand too!  None of the companies give good headphones with their product. It does need more memory, but prices on that are going down.  For the price, its the best Mp3 Player around. Take it from a Telecommunications major at one of the best colleges around.

I don't find the lack of a belt hook to bad as I use a bum bag anyway.  When I do want music, I can download either .wma or .mp3 files from my home library.  <p>My two dislikes are 1) the included headphones -- YECK! and the fact that you can't expand it with smart media cards -- you need to overpay Sonic Blue for &quot;backpacks&quot;.

<Title>Very nice player!
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is a very nice little MP3 player.  It has very simplenavigation and has a nice look also.  The 32 MB of built in memory is fine.  If you ever need more though, just get a memory backpack!  The software is easy to use and works very well.  The USB makes the transfers very quickly.  The Rio 600 also supports WMA files which is a nice addition to an MP3 player.  My ONLY complaints about this player is that 1. Some of the buttons and the switch on top feel kind of cheap and 2. I'm afraid that I might break the little guy. It actually would be pretty hard to break but I still like to be very careful with it :) The backlit LCD is nice and bright.  Most of all, the player works flawlessly.  The sound quality is great even at 60 KBPS.  I have never had a problem with the Rio 600.  If you want a small, lightweight, reliable, and sleek looking MP3 player, the Rio 600 is for you.

<Title>Premature Termination of Tracks
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>At least two other reviewers here have posted about the problem of some  Rio 600 units abrupting ending the play of a track before reaching the  tend.  Despite these warnings, and consoled by the large number of positive  reviews, I took the chance and bought a unit from the local store of a  large national clicks and mortar electronics chain.  Sure enough, my unit  exhibited the same behavior; of the three MP3 tracks I tested, ranging from  six to eighteen minutes, all would end after less than a third of the track  had been played.  A repeat download of one MP3 did work, so the problem  seems sporadic.  Despite a nice design, the execution is flawed.  Who wants  a well-designed can opener that opens a can only part way?  I returned the  unit.

<Title>Good Player...need extras to become great.

<Content>Diamond is planning on selling extra memory packs (it doesn't use flash or  any othe standard memory), and a remote/radio tuner soon. Once these are  available it will be a great player.

<Title>A rock-solid value for a great product!
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the Rio 600 yesterday, and it was my first mp3 player, even  though I have accumulated mp3's on the Mac for many months.  All around, I  have been extremely impressed with this player.  It works seamlessly with  my Mac, even through an add-on USB card.  The limited edition of SoundJam  MP, included with the player, is as Mac-friendly an app as you can get,  complete with full drag-n-drop capability and a clear visual interface.   The controls on the player are straightforward and intuitive, and it's easy  to navigate the player's menus.  The bright blue backlight makes it easy to  see what's playing, regardless of the lighting conditions.  Even though it  only comes with 32 megs of storage, I can still pack on a little over a  half-hour without losing sound quality.  My one request to S3 (the  manufacturer) is that they speed the shipment of accessories like bigger  memory &quot;backpacks&quot; and that they sell a version of the Rio 600  with 64 megs as well.  Overall, I could not have asked for a much better  player.  What a bargain at $170!!

<Title>Rio 600
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Great product, exellent sound.  I also own a sony MD portable player, after I bought the Rio 600, I havn't used it once.  My only complaint is  with the Rio's software package, if you already have a large collection of  MP3's I had a difficult time loading them into the Rio's database.  Found  it much easier to use the plug-in with MusicMatch Jukebox to download  tracks into the Rio 600.

<Title>so far 2 rio600's both trash
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>My first rio600 waas improperly put together... The thing is light-weight  plastic to begin with, but this one was not sealed properly and the  on-hold-off button could just fall out unretained. Back to the store for a  replacement.<p>The second one is having all of the problems others have  reported: (1) the introduction of painfully loud pops and crackles into the  music, and (2) the inability to play MP3 files to completion. <p>Anyone  heard anything from S3 about these problems? I sent them a support email  from their webpage, but no answer so far...<p>So far this product looks  like a rush job to fill the super-low-end market. <p>Others seem to like  it, so maybe I've just been unlucky. But the premature song termination  problem seems reasonably wide-spread.<p>I recommend buying this one from  someplace you won't have any trouble returning it to if you have  problems!<p>Marc

<Title>Wow!
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I was a little nervous about buying a player with only 32MB of memory, but  since the Rio 600 supports WMA files it acts like a 64MB player.  It's very  cool to be able to have a playlist with both MP3 and WMA files, and the  software makes it VERY easy to do that.  <p>The one AA battery seems to  last forever.  The box says 10 hours, but I think I'm getting at least 11  or 12.<p>Great player and the best looking one on the market!  My brother  wants me to trade for his Sony player - No deal!!

<Title>Rio 600 Rocks!!!
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>After extensive research (and using reviews listed here), I bought the Rio  600 this past weekend and it rocks. The software to load new music is  basically &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; and the sound quality is awesome. My  only complaint is the 32 MB fills up real fast and I can't wait to buy the  340MB backup. If you're looking to make your co-workers jealous, this is  the toy to get.

<Title>Easily the best portable, but there's room for improvement
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Diamond Rio 600 is a paradox.  It's twice as good as anything currently on the market, but half as much as you need.   There's something  very right about each of the three components of the system--headphones,  body and software--and yet there are serious deficiencies with each  part.<p>The Rio's headphones are  marginally tinny at any volume, and  stressed at higher volumes, but good enough for a portable you'll probably  use in a noisy environment anyway.  To be sure, other headphones will be  needed to fully realize the sound possibilities of the Rio, but the ones  included give you at least the beginnings of great sound.   Their rather  odd, around-the-ear construction is both sensible and awkward.  They're  perfect for using while working out, because they never fall out,  regardless of how vigorously one behaves.  But they're hard to get used to  because they do take a comparatively longer time to put in than other  headphones.   Serious audiophiles will dismiss them outright; those of us  just looking for workout music will probably get used to their oddness.   <p>The body of the Rio is its clear strength.  It's about the size of a  pager-but lighter.  Of all the portable music solutions I shopped--CD,  cassette, and digital alike-this one is the very best in terms of  size/quality ratio.  It's the best thing I've ever used for working out.   It's also the best device currently available in terms of expandability.   Though on the surface it seems to have less memory than the Rio 500, and  than many other newer .mp3 players, it has the capacity for adding on 340  mb.  Also, the fact that it takes the .wma (Windows Media) format  effectively means that you can store what would be the equivalent of 64mb  of songs in the .mp3 format <p>There are some reservations, though.  First,  its small size means that the battery is tucked away in a pretty  inaccessible place.  It's somewhat tricky seating a new battery.  It's not  impossible, mind you, and it's worth the effort given the benefit of the  unit's small size, but it's still frustrating on occasion.  Second, while a  battery does actually give 10 hours of use, the unit's battery life  estimator is never accurate.  It deducts time too slowly at the start of a  battery, so that by the time you get to 6 hours of apparent time left, you  actually have only 1 or 2 hours.  It's not a huge problem, once you figure  it out, but it can be infuriating at first.  Third, the unit doesn't come  with a belt clip holder or an FM tuner.  They're both available, but  they're extra.  I can understand the FM tuner being extra, but it seems  ridiculous for a portable music player to come without the means to make it  truly portable.<p>Finally, there's the software.  Easily the weakest  element of the Diamond Rio 600, it's only a *little* more than a way to add  on $20 to the price of the unit.   It's entirely too difficult to install  and get running.  I installed the version off the included CD.  When I got  it running, it linked me to rioport.com, which informed me there was an  update available.  This update, however, was really only for the Rio 300  and 500, and so it failed to recognize the Rio 600 as being present.  So I  uninstalled the update and tried again with the CD version.  Then after a  mere 50 rips, it told me I had to pay to "unlock" the program.  So I tried  to unlock, but the software never allowed me to get to the "pay" screen.  I  then reinstalled the update and miraculously was allowed to unlock the  program.  But this version still didn't recognize the Rio 600.  So I  uninstalled the update and reinstalled the original.  Finally, everything  worked.  Hardly an encouraging start.  Then, I instructed the program to  search my hard drives and come up with a database of playable media.  This  it did, but it found a lot of `junk' files I wanted to delete.   Unbelievably, the program doesn't allow you to group delete, so I had to  individually delete each file I didn't want.  Finally, after hours of time  and $20, I got the software set up and ready to use.  But then came another  one of those little Rio paradoxes.  One of the strengths of the software is  that it allows you to read a CD at a variety of different compressions.   You can decide to fit more of your songs on the Rio and sacrifice a little  quality.   The problem is that you might want a song at the highest quality  to burn a CD (which the software also does) but at a lower one to send to  the Rio.   The result is that you practically have to read each CD twice.    That's a lot of hard disk space to dedicate to your music library.   Hopefully updates will include some sort of converter, so that you only  have to scan CDs once.  <p>On balance, I highly recommend the Rio,  especially if you're just looking for workout music.  Be warned, however,  that it won't be quite the effortless pathway to great music that the  merchandising proclaims, and that the Rio is based on modularity.  It has  the greatest potential of any current .mp3 player--it can be worn  comfortably, has the largest potential memory, can play FM music, and can  even be used on your car's lighter--but you're going to have to pay for  each added function.
