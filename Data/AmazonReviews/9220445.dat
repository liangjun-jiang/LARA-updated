<Title>Tech service & Customer Service SUCK
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was foolish enough to buy two of these units for my two grand-daughters and both units combined gave less than three hours of service before crapping out. Units were returned two times and have still not been repaired and returned. I received absolutely no satisfaction from Philips customer service and have now bought the girls I-Pod Nanos. I strongly advise people to not purchase these or other Philips products !!!

<Title>Good mp3 player
<Date>Wed Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a good mp3 player i dont know what the two reviews are so negative about it. It works just like a ipod it organizes your songs just like a ipod. The radio is good too it gets this station in that is always hard to get in. But i only payed 30.00 dollars for it at target so i really cant complain. The only thing i dont like about it is that it has bad battery life. I guess i understand if you played retail for it. It is a good mp3 player but not worth $120.00

<Title>Not all it's cracked up to be...
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the third MP3 player i've owned over the past 8 years and they have come a long way. But i bought this one knowing i use them while I run and need something with big capacity and ease of use.  The best thing about this MP3 player is that it is built for use whil ebeing active. The arm band is great and the earphones are adequate. There is a enough space for a handful of albums - enough for even those long marathong training runs.  My biggest problems have been ease of use - including reading the screen while on the go. I have been playing around with it and have just found out how to use the playlist feature. The manual is no help in this department because you have to use windows media player to manage the memory. It would be much better if it had its own program to do this, making it easier to do. - But even more bothersome is the fact that the screen is hard to read while on the go. Because it's mounted on your arm when you are running/walking/biking, it is hard to check the screen on the go because of its placement and contast of the sceen. On the product specs it talked about how it was easy to read - this is not true.  For variety, it would be nice to have a beltclip so you could use it mounted on your waist as well. But this is not included.  Overall, it's a good product with adequate memory. Hopefully the sweat won't short it out too soon and it'll last a while...

<Title>Great Player, Easy to use while running, Poor Battery 
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3. I works well when I run. The only downfall is that it runs on 1 AAA battery. I have to replace that battery about every 3 runs. I wish it plugged into the computer or had an adapter like my phone so I didn't go through so many. In this day and age that is how it should be.
