<Title>Good buy

<Content>I bought the white colored one. But, apart from the color nothing is different. Here is my review of the white one - copy-pasted.  My first digital music player, so I am biased. :) But, I like everything about it. Sound quality is very good. Tends to be bigger in size than an Ipod. The buttons are slightly hard. The user interface/experience is good. The thing that I like the most about it is that it plays FM radio, has an autoscanner for FM and its easy to switch between FM stations. Can play through precharged battery or directly through the AC mains (There is an adaptor included for conversion to DC). Doesn't look as cool as an ipod, but for $99, its a great buy.  
<Overall>5
