<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!   
<Overall>3
