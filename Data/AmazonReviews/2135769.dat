<Title>Barely Works
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Good: -memory appears like a flash drive and will hold songs from WM Player -a single song will play on this player -battery lasts about 6 to 8 hours -Windows Media Player can convert song files to Sansa; if you don't have WMP, there is no software from Sandisk that will load them.  Bad: -Beyond playing a song, player can't do much more -Playlists can only be installed on the fixed 2GB memory, non-removable -Added micro SD card appears as another player, not additional memory -Added memory is limited to 2 GB Micro SD (NOT Micro SDHC) -Total memory cannot be more than 2 GB plus 2 GB, always separated -Playlists cannot play from both memories, only the fixed internal 2GB -If two playlists contain the same song, the song will be added twice -Sound quality is minimal -Sound volume at max is about medium compared to other players -Available operator's manual/website has little or no information -Player is physically very weak, won't play at temperatures below 50 F  Overall, if you are looking to play more than 500 songs or if you want to have multiple playlists without duplicate songs in memory, this ain't it!

<Title>Well, I got it going...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it as a less expensive option to the iPod Nano for my 12-year old daughter.  No music software came with it, though an add for Rhapsody was included.  Took me a while before I realized I could use Windows Media Player - d'oh!  Not very intuitive but downloaded version 11 which is a definite improvement over 10.    And it works!  My daughter "Ripped" music from her CDs and it plays and sounds very nice.    Initial concerns with it freezing in the on position.  Couldn't find any reset technique in the instructions or on the Sandisk website, so we just let it run down the battery.  Haven't run any firmware update - afraid to now that it works.    Bottom line: If money's an issue, this is a reasonable option, but parental unit must be somewhat tech-savvy.  If you can spare an extra $75, go with iPod Nano.

<Title>Great alternative to 2GB iPod Nano
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great and cheaper alternative to the 2GB iPod Nano. I like the fact that it is expandable using Micro SD cards and has voice recording capabilities.  The unit is also easy to use, I figured out most of the functions in an hour (hint: get familiar with the menu options and visit Sandisk's site for some videos on using this unit).  The unit's functions are accessable with one hand after you are familiar with them.  Tip: To turn off the Sansa, press MENU once and then press and hold MENU for 2 seconds  You can use the supplied software to put your music on it but I found using Windows Media Player 11 is the easiest way to do so.  I have not used Rhapsody to buy and upload any music to my Sansa yet.  Sound quality is excellant using the supplied earbuds, I had slightly mixed results with the sound quality using my car's cassette deck (the songs ripped at higher bit rates sounded better).  I am hoping that Sandisk (and others) develope a more complete set of accessories for this unit like a docking unit and a case.

<Title>Fantastic form factor and excellent Mp3 performance
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit to supplement my 40gb 4th gen iPod.  My iPod is fantastic, but it is not easy to take everywhere due to its larger size.  I wanted a smaller MP3 player I could take and listen to at work, gym, and when shopping at the stores/running errands.  After weeks of research and some earlier purchases which were returned, I think this unit is going to fit the bill perfectly.  This unit has a lot of nifty features: -mp3 player -FM radio -voice recorder -photo viewer  The MP3 player and FM radio sounds excellent, very close to my iPod with decent headsets. I didn't use the standard headsets with the unit - instead I purchased Panasonic necklace fashion headsets with better frequency response.  This unit hangs unnoticed from my neck with the Panasonic headsets, and the sound quality is fantastic.  The FM radio reception is pretty good, although it does not pick up some stations as strongly as a dedicated radio with antennas.  The voice recorder has excellent clarity, but the menu could be better. Once you record a quick note, you have to switch back to the main menu, click to music, then voice recorder, then select the recording to hear the recording.  And there is no way to delete the recording except on the computer.  I wanted the voice recorder to record reminders and to-do's but this voice recorder is not as easy to use as my dedicated digital audio recorder.  The photo viewer seems no better than the photo viewer on most camera cellphones, and I doubt I'll be using it much.  The main purpose is to play music and listen to FM radio.  The unit seems very sturdy and the buttons seem to be very sold.  Overall it has a high quality construction feel, and the compact dimensions of the unit lend it to being taken everywhere to be used.  I love my iPod, but I think I will be using this unit a lot more than my iPod simply because it easier to carry around, has FM radio, and excellent performance for the sub-$100 price.  My friends strongly recommend I buy the Sansa e250 unit over this one.  But after much research, playing with the e250 unit in the store, I decided that I like the form factor of this unit better than the e250 unit with the awkward click wheel.  The click wheel felt quite stiff and not very smooth when I tried the demo unit in the store.  I'm used to the slick wheel of the iPod, and didn't want a unit that poorly duplicated the wheel.  The buttons on the c250 work perfectly fine without a wheel.    The e250 is also wider and longer than this unit, making it a bit less suitable as an alternative to my iPod.  edit: I also discovered that this player does not have a clock.  Due to a recent sale, I switched to the Sansa e260 player, which has 2 very important (to me) features:  date / clock, and the ability to delete voice recordings.   For those on the fence about buying a Sansa cXXX player or a eXXX player, I think the eXXX is the better player, despite its slightly larger size.  There are more accessories available for the eXXX than the cXXX, and the clock / voice recorder are more useful.

<Content>I'm writing a pre-purchase review. I have no idea whether to purchase this item or not because the dimensions CAN'T be accurate! How can the product weigh a whole pound more than it's own shipping weight?? And who'd want to carry a 2 POUND MP3 player? Why does the product dimensions say the thing is 9 inches long? That can't be accurate when everyone else is saying it's so small...well, how small??  Someone help me out here!   Concerned MP3er

<Title>No Audio Books
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this player with one MAJOR exception: it is not supported by Audible.com so you cannot have your audio books on it. All the comparable Sansa players are supported, so I bought this with the expectation of being able to listen to Audible content like any other SanDisk product. However none of the c200 series players are supported and Audible says this is because SanDisk has not provided them with the tech specs necessary. SanDisk was non-responsive to my inquiry as to when they would get this done like their other products - a generic thanks for your inquiry but no info. Bottom line - if you want just music this is a great choice. If you need versatility of also having audio books, buy something else.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this with my 8 year old daughter who wanted to spend her Christmas money on a player. She couldn't afford an i-pod, and this was a great solution. Easy for her to use, includes a decent FM radio, and a voice recorder so she can record herself. I was able to get her going and transferred her small CD collection quickly and easily. The screen is a tad small, so I might not use this for a photo album, but so is the nano's screen. I own an i-pod nano and had I known, I would have bought this just for the radio if nothing else. I haven't downloaded with Rhapsody or Napster yet, so I can't comment on that aspect yet. It will be interesting to see the differences between i-tunes and these. Bottom line: Consider this player for kids or yourself. A very good value.

<Title>Best MP3 player I've used
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my c250 for almost a year and it's never given me any trouble at all.  I took it on a six-week cross-country bicycle ride last summer and the thing is bomb-proof.  I didn't even have the protective case, but I think I may purchase that now.  Great battery life too.    I can't really explain the negative reviews this player has gotten, my experience has been great.  I find the display easy to read and I've had no issues with XP compatibility.  I had an iAudio player by Cowon before and it was always freezing up, requiring a firmware update.  The Sansa has been trouble free.

<Content>I bought this Sansa almost a year ago. I was happy with it at first, but I'm beginning to discover it's more of a headache.  I'm not a technical wizard, but I'm no slouch either.  I found it extremely easy to download the music onto the player, but I have run into trouble.  I can't get the music OFF of the player and download new music.  I've sat down at my computer three times to try to acomplish this with no success.  I end up giving up and walking away.  I think I'm going to suck it up and buy an ipod.

<Title>Tester
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sound is great, navigation easy, good quality voice recording.  There are two major problems:  1. The title and artist name of some songs is not copied to the player. They are simply "lost" for some songs, without any detectable reason. 2. After copying, recording and deleting files in the player does not correctly release the memory space. The result is that you have less and less space for new songs and recordings. The only way I found to correct the problem is to format and reload the songs, but that re-creates the problem described in #1. I am not sure if a new firmware would resolve it. I opted to return the player.

<Title>Disappointing MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this item to use it for DRM-protected audio books. Felt a little flimsy and cheap when taken out of the box. After the installation, this supposedly plug and play device caused my computer to keep disconnecting and then reconnecting with the player. Two updates later I was able to transfer some files. Everything worked fine, however not with audio book playback. Unlike an Ipod, the player doesn't remember where I previously paused the current track after turning it back on. Also, when fast forwarding for longer than a minute of the track, the player switches to fast-fast forward, however re-starts the song when the fast-forward button is released!!! Really annoying. So between a cheap feel, poorly written and documented software and everyday problems with the interface I returned the item after 12 hours of trial.

<Title>Which to buy?
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am writing a pre-purchase review.  I am trying to decide between the sansa c-250 and the sansa e-250.  I have read a few comments in the reviews here, but am still undecided.  I don't think there is a big difference in size, but the e-250 may be easier to hold in one hand and operate while driving.  But, the C is cheaper, and cost is an issue for me.  Is the E really worth the extra $$?  Update:  I bought the e250 instead of the c250 and I'm very satisfied.  However, if you only want to put music on the player, as I do, the c is probably all you need.  Especially for the money, but I knew my wife would eventually want an ipod and the e resembled the ipod, so I knew when she saw it she would want the e over the ipod.  She already had a player that resembled the c and now, yes, she has already asked me if I'm going to get her an e250.

<Title>one big fault  -- otherwise quite great for the price
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The contrast level on the display is so low no matter how one adjusts the brightness and backlight that you will have a hard time seeing what feature/song you are selecting.  Its genuinely bizarre that they used a very light-blue field against a white backround. Text is black so at least you can see that clearly.  Other than that, the sound is good for such a cheap player and it has a built-in equalizer to adjust the sound to your own liking.  It will operate in MSC mode, which simply means that you can load music files into the player directly from the My Computer icon.  No software of any sort needed at all to load songs into the player. You lose the ability to make playlists in MSC mode but personally I prefer the speed and simplicity of MSC mode.  You cannot use MSC mode to play digitally-protected music.  Again not an issue for me. If you are looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is worth considering.

The jump from song to song is a little slower if your used to a zune or an ipod but if you your new to the mp3 player market this is one fine tiny option.

<Content>This is a reasonably decent device, spoiled by a lousy interface. When you try to navigate in album mode, or in any other mode other than 'songs', it mixes up the album order.  I have my mp3 albums named so that when you sort the songs in alphabetical order, the songs will be in the correct order within the album.  The Sansa device sorts the songs by the write time of the song to the player, making it impossible to play an album in the correct order.  Compared to my iRiver player, this is junk.

<Content>i'm impressed with this model. its my very 1st mp3 player (unless you count my sony mp3 disc walkman witch i got tired of) and its easy to use. plus i love the photos and voice recorder features. putting in a microSD card was no problem, so i made it up to 4GBs. a few cons, however:  -the voice recoder will only use the unit's flash card to store recordings and your computer probably won't be able to play the file (mine won't) -battery life is short, but i bought a portable charger for it and charge it daily regardless if i use it. -the instruction manual is so bad i wouldn't even bother to read it after 5secs. its seriously a joke how non-informative it is on the product.  -there is no information about the warranty, witch is confusing.

<Content>I bought mine (the red one) at BestBuy .. It was one sale & I did pay less than this.. But its so worth having! I didnt need one with a video player or whatever.. .Just to put some cd's in it & & my spanish stuff to learn.. so I got it..    Its wonderful & I highly recommend this to anyone! For yourself, or a gift (unless your a teen & you HAVE to out-do everyone else for your stupid status..lol.)    This is perfect! Only 2GB, doesnt hold a whole library of stuff-- but really, are you gonna listen to every CD you own at once, or in 1 day--NO!..    Get it.. you'll love it too!

<Title>Trouble being read via Windows XP
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I own another Sansa player (older model - 4GB version). It's worked perfectly for over a year.  This one cannot be recognized on my home computer running Windows XP. I've gone through multiple workarounds and nothing has worked. It is recognized fine on my office PC. So, I was able to load music there, but it is a pain as the home computer is where my music is.  I emailed "support" via their website. Two weeks - no reply. Emailed back -- calling attention to zero replies. Four days -- no reply.

<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The display resolution and contrast on this unit is so poor you can't read or navigate the menus. There are no controls for contrast and the choice of colors for the selection and battery level are virtually unreadable in sunlight or in darkness.  Functionally the player works fine but I don't recommend this unit because of the unreadable display.

<Content>I bought this for my wife for christmas. she's not really all that techy but even she can figure out how to put her songs on this one. Works super easy with WMP 11, I like the interface better than that of my iPod.  Build quality is a little cheap but for the money you can't beat it. It also locked up a couple of times and had to be plugged in in order to reset it. I have updated the firmware (highly recommendable) and haven't had a problem since. For those with charging complaints, the iPod style charger works just fine with the USB cord for this guy.

<Content>This is a great little MP3 Player, as long as your main usage consists of listening to music.  The sound is fine, and it even has an expandable microSD card slot with which you can add up to 2GB (for now at least).

<Title>Small product large sound
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hesitant about buying an MP3 player because I am relatively inept when it comes to electronic devices. After researching different MP3 players I decided to take a chance on the SanDisk because of its reasonable price plus I had read that it was compatible with Windows Media Player (WMP). I had downloaded dozens of CDs onto the WMP and now needed something small and pocket sized that was inconspicuous to use at work. My profession affords me with occasional down time so I wanted a small MP3 player with ear plugs that would help me pass the time by dusting off a few musical neural networks encoded in the 60's.  First of all I was surprised at how simple transferring songs was using the WMP and the Sandisk. You first open up the WMP and once the computer recognizes the "device" you click on the icon, which allows the WMP to connect with the SanDisk. Then you can either right click on selected songs and select "add to synch" or you can right click on the CD title and add the entire contents of the CD to the sync list.  The WMP shows you how much room you have left on the Sandisk after each input. Pretty simple. The real surprise occurred when I placed the ear plugs in and listened to my old archaic music. I'm not crazy about ear plugs (can't use headphones at work), but the ones that come with the player are not uncomfortable. The sound quality of the SanDisk is extremely impressive for such a small device. Although the player comes with an equalizer I did not even find it necessary to adjust the sounds. I give this product 5 stars for the musical portion of the SanDisk. I cannot comment on the other options that this product has, but I am obviously impressed enough to leave a review on this item. I should mention that the device comes with a CD that I downloaded and it appears to assist in using the other features of the SanDisk MP3 player, but as mentioned I bought the player solely for listening to music and am simply commenting on the musical portion of the SanDisk Sansa c250 MP3 player.  I hope that this helps you in deciding which player to buy. I am very satisfied with this product.

<Title>Works Fine

<Content>I bought this looking for an inexpensive mp3 player I could use while jogging. It works fine, the sound quality is good and I like the fact it has fm radio and that it supports secure WMA's. The photos on this were completely useless so if you want to use this mp3 player to show off your pics don't buy it because you won't be satisfied with the results. I gave it 4 stars because the battery only charges through your usb connection, unless of course you buy an extra accessory, and because it could have come with better earphones (had to use a different pair to jog).

<Title>I love my little player!
<Date>Tue Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My boyfriend bought me this player at Radio Shack so I can use it when I go on vacation next month and I'm already in love with it. It can only be charged via your computer's USB port, though. To charge with an outlet, you have to buy the Powerduo from Griffin. It comes with a car charger too. I don't use the FM radio very often, but I like that the option is there for whenever I feel like it. The voice recorder is useful as well. This is my first MP3 player and I was relieved at how easy it was to figure out. It also accepts WMA files. I highly recommend this player if you don't feel like spending an arm and a leg on an Ipod. I also recommend it for people who are looking for their first MP3 player. Very great for the price.

<Title>Don't buy this
<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player because it allowed for an external microSD card.  It's not good for listening to if you're walking.  I put it in my pocket and the slightest bump made it freeze.  The only way to get it to work again was to take the battery out.  It also skips occasionally for no apparent reason.  It's supposed to be capable of viewing photographs, but the screen is so small it's not worth it.  The description didn't say that it can only be charged by plugging it into a computer.  Perhaps there's an adapter, but I didn't see anything for one.  This MP3 player is so small that it actually fell out of my pocket and I lost it after having it for only a few days.  I didn't have any kind of warranty or anything, so it was $100 to listen to music for a week.  I decided never to have such a small MP3 player again and now have an 80g Ipod, which works great and is small enough to be portable but big enough not to lose it.

About a week ago, i squated down with it in my pocket, at work, and the left side speaker stopped working. I tried just about everything to get it to work, but to no avail. So, now i only have one side to listen to my songs. As long as i can hear something, I really dont want to go through the hassle of trying to return it for another. Just a word to the wise, dont squat with it in your pocket.

<Title>Lots of potential, but is is wasted
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A great little player and recorder when it works.  I am on my third unit as the first two had major issues and would freeze on start up.  The problem seems to be in the way that the unit handles either malformed mp3s or mp3s that are encoded with abr/vbr options.  The player just doesn't recognize them and will get stuck because it doesn't know to skip things that it cannot see.  Lately my player has been not displaying the main internal memory when I connect it to the computer.  It will only show the small 16MB partition that you can use in an emergency to restore firmware to the unit.  Perhaps that is a bit of an omen that I should pay attention to.  It only likes certain kinds of mini-SD cards.  Take a look around on the net before purchasing a 2GB mini card to expand the memory of the unit.  Can be very slow to start up if you use it in MSC mode instead of MTP.  The unit is a great size.  Comfortable to hold and use.  Audio recording is excellent and perfect for taping classes.  Battery life is good considering the size as well.  If it were not for the firmware issues, then this would be a first rate product instead of a brick waiting to happen.

<Content>This is the first MP3 player I've gotten for myself.  I mainly use it to listen to podcasts and love how easy it is to get my tunes and podcasts onto the player.  I also have an FM transmitter/charger for it, so it gets used almost every day when I'm commuting and also when I walk.  Made the mistake of getting my daughter an iPod Nano last year for Christmas and it was nothing but a pain.  It ended up being stolen out of her locker recently, but this time she'll be getting a Sansa 6 GB player for Christmas to replace the iPod--I'm sure it will be lots fewer headaches for both of us.  Now that her brother just let me  know he wants an MP3 player for Christmas too, I'm back to Amazon to order a Sansa for him also.

<Content>One of my pet peeves with the ipod is that it doesn't have built in radio. I always thought if you gonna pay so much money to play your own music you can atleast enjoy FM radio. But as an alternative device, I see that the sandisk player is great with MP3's and radio which should be good enough for a music lover that desires a portable device. (the memory card option is also a nice touch) Though the screen resolution isn't that great and making an organized playlist is yet to be discovered...this device is great. I recommend for those of us that don't have "ipod money".

<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I upgraded from an ipod shuffle. Load in the Sansa disc for a new music library. You can't drag over from Itunes, but shows you how to drag over the same music out of Windows Media Music. I ordered this item for me from my wife from Amazon for $40 on the Black Friday sale. 2GB was worth it. I had my music ready to go Christmas Day. While it charged I learned not only of the Window media, but also that it held photos. I quckly dragged some of those in also. I'm not a fan of earbuds. The music sounds great thru them, but I plan to replace them with headphones. The screen is visually appealing. The menu toook a little time to figure out. I can now do anything so small, that the makers designed as an option that often goes un-used or over-looked. This only enhances the experience. It does have FM stereo which I forgot. I tune it to my Sirius Satellite Radio for commercial free music. I can then push the Record button on the MP3 and add a song that I don't have in my library. I use the lanyard because there is no clip. It often tangles with the earbuds when storing. A clip would have been best. It does come with about 4 songs and pictures in memory.

<Title>Nice Entry-Level MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great little MP3 player for someone just starting out with one.  It's easy to figure out and use.  I didn't notice the trouble with viewing the screen that others have mentioned, in fact the color screen is nice for something so small.  It got this for my 10-year-old son, and he loves being able to show his favorite pictures as well as listen to his music.  I did have some trouble figuring out how to load the songs on it.  Bear in mind I am not a techie-type.  It's not really that hard, I just got a little confused by the software required for photo conversion, and the fact that there are several ways to load music to it.  I got it quickly enough and loaded songs easily after that.    What I did have trouble with though was using a music service.  There were coupons for both Napster and Rhapsody included, and this is supposed to be an authorized player to work with both services, but I couldn't transfer songs from either one to the player. I tried going through all the troubleshooting steps, and still couldn't get it to work, even with SanDisk tech support help.  I was finally advised to return the player for a new one, but still have the same problems, so I don't think they will be resolved.  I don't understand why they included music service coupons that aren't useable with this player.  This is probably not the player for someone looking for a lot of features, or someone used to a nicer player, but it's great for someone starting out or someone upgrading from a simpler, b&w display player.  It's also probably not the player for someone who likes using a music service. I do think it's a great little player for the price.

<Content>Sound quality is excellent, easy to download music on to it and it has all the standard features for playing songs such as, shuffle, repeat, making a playlist, ffwd and such. You can listen to FM radio, which is great. What this can do that an iPod can't is record voice and radio. The only drawbacks are, you have to hook it up to the computer in order to charge it or delete songs. You can only have one playlist at a time. In order to hook it up to anything other than a computer, you'll need to buy a different cable. But overall I love my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.

<Content>This player is slightly different than the e250: a bit smaller, and seems to spec out the same.  The sound is excellent, I've auditioned it with my favorite Sony headphones as well as with a few in-ear 'buds'. Navigation is good, I think the only function I'd like to see is a 'stop' buton... but pause certainly does the same thing for my purposes.  I haven't yet figured out how to set-up my own album names, so I've just been loading raw tracks, but the player comes with sample titles and they're organized properly, so obviously it can be done.  The c250 is a great value, I shopped several players before deciding it had the best features for the price. I highly recommend it!

<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I'm very happy with it. I've read several complaints that the sound quality isn't very good with the earbuds that come with the player, but everything sounds great to me. Again, this is my first player so I have nothing to compare it to.  I have Windows 2000 and Media Player 9 so I can't sync my music, but I can still transfer everything over very easily from Windows Explorer and with the player in MSC mode. And I can't have playlists (other than the default GoList), but I found something else that works for me. For example, I have 3 or 4 CDs by different artists that I like to fall asleep to, so I just changed the Genre data (before copying them to my computer) in WMP9 for those CDs to "Sleep".  When I turn on the player, my new genre shows up and I can play all the songs, just like in a playlist. It works perfectly for my purposes.  I do have a couple of complaints about the c250--the lowest volume setting is too loud for my liking. Also, when you power the player up again it remembers the song you were listening to, but not the volume level--it starts out right in the middle, which is pretty loud. Hopefully some future firmware updates will fix that problem.  All in all though, I love my Sansa c250 (especially for the price) and am very glad I bought it.
