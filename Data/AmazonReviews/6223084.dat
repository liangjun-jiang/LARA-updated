<Title>hunk of garbage, proprietary spamware junk. 
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>its supposed to be an mp3 player.  you put files on it and they play.  whats so hard about that.  Sony has made this as difficult as possible to do.  all your mp3 files have to be run through their program before they get onto the machine, they get renamed and re-formated to some propriatary file system, and if the mp3 is not formated with author, title, date, time serial number etc exactly as sony likes it this system screws around with the file so you can't find it on the mp3 player.  this is a disgusting hunk of over-engineered junk.

<Title>i think this item is great
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this item at circuit city for $90. its 2 gig memory gives me lots of space for all of the things i need. it's battery life is amazing, i've never once seen it go below the full mark. it's design is very sleek and i love the way it looks. the sound quality is great and as long as you don't have giant sausage fingers the buttons are just fine. the ear pieces didn't work out for me but no ear pieces i've ever tried have. the software, SonicStage, is a relatively easy program to use. it's a little slow at times but it gets the job done. anything you dont understand can be looked up in the Help section and it's very easy. i dont know why people say it's so horrible, anyone with a face can use that program and for the price this is a great mp3 player, hands down. i use it every day for hours at a time and i think it's wonderful. i highly recommend this product to anyone who even half knows their way around a computer.

<Title>The manual does NOT match the product
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On page 44 of the manual, the instructions say to go to the MENU and there will be a selection of "FM AUTO PRESET".  There is no such selection.  Obviously, if the product does NOT match the user's guide, then either the software in the product is incorrect or the manual is incorrect.    A call to Sony yields nothing.  They just offered to send me another (incorrect) manual.  They are not interested in actually helping you use the unit or interested in correcting the manual.  It's not their responsiblility.  Well, who's responsibility is it?  Apparently, all that hype back in the 1980's about Japan's "quality control" was just that--hype.  If they can't make the software match the manual, then they need to fire their Q.A. people or get smarter tech writers who can actually make a product manual match the actual product functionality.

<Title>Good player - rotten software
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Plays ok, good tuner, but...  Trying to get an audio book loaded was a pain. First try, wound up with the mini chapters loaded in almost random order. Used another ripper, copied them to the player and it would not play the files. Loaded those files through their software and got everything in order, but it removed the names and changed the MP3s to their pet format. Should never buy a MP3 player from a company that sells CDs.

<Title>It Won't Play MP3's
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this today and I am returning it tomorrow.  It claims to be an MP3 player, but you can not load mp3's onto it.  You must put Sonicstage on your PC, transfer all of your mp3's to that program, and then convert all of those files to ATRAC (?) format on the player.  This thing is horrible.

<Content>I like the size and convenience of the player.  I often don't do the mainstream thing, so I didn't want an iPod or iPod-like player.  The minimalism of the controls appeal to me.  And they are quite easy to use.  However, like many other people, I am quite displeased with the Sony Sonicstage software that you need to transfer files.  I accidently clicked on the 'connect [to the internet]' button, but canceled the process before it had gone too far.  I finished transfering my files and then turned off my computer.  But when I started it again I didn't have access to my ActiveX controls (which control all my desktop items), my security settings were changed so that I couldn't get ActiveX back, and all my WindowsME registry settings for HKEY...USER were gone.  I've reinstalled WindowsXP on a new hard drive.  I have my old drive, with all the files thankfully still intact, set as a slave.  And I plan on installing VMWare and loading up a new virtual operating system.  I'll reinstall Sonicstage on that virtual OS, so in case it destructively changes my settings I can just re-add the virtual machine again.  Unfortunately having a virtual machine meas I need another copy of WindowsXP.  I give the player a 5-star rating.  But the software to transfer files gets a 1; I'd give it a 0 if it was a choice.  I plan on sending Sony a copy of this review.  Because the software, because they're attempting to make it copywrite-protected, screws with the operating system.

<Title>Simply awesome
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This the greatest little MP3 player ever! It leaves Ipods for dead, way cooler and way smaller and the battery life rocks. The controls are a little tricky to get used to but once you have it down it all makes sense. I don't know what all the fuss is over sonic stage, it's not bad at all and it DOES NOT force you to convert your mp3s to atrac, you can transfer and play them just as they are. The FM tuner is another great feature that ipods wish they had and another reason to get this mp3 player.

<Title>Decent MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I got this mp3 player I was really amazed by its design and light weight. It's easy to use and if you pass through the Sonic Stage utility through which you has to upload your music to the device, you'll be just enjoying listening to your favourite song. I really appreciate that the battery life claimed by producer is almost the same as the one you'll be reaching in reality. In fact I found only one disadvantage of this machine. When you select to sort songs by artist and album, you can then see on the display only the name of the song or the name of the album either, but never the name of the artist during playback. And if the capacity is 2GB, you easily come to several songs or albums with similar names... Than it's hard to skip to song or album you want to listen at the moment without mistake. If you could get use to this incompletion, you can easily live with this mp3 player...

<Title>You HAVE to use their software
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You HAVE to use their lousy SonicStage software to transfer songs to it. That is just stupid. Well, not just stupid, arrogant also.  I was attracted to this thing becasue of it's size, battery life (which is exaggerated by at least 50%), radio tuner, and most of all its support of AAC encoded files. Apple's products have no radio tuners, and if you've chosen AAC as your audio codec, you haven't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your AAC files.  Kudos to Sony for allowing it to play AAC audio files, it's about time someone besides Apple implemented this MPEG standardized codec in their "MP3" players, but why force poorly written software (SonicStage) down our throats? Why force any software down our throats? With almost all flash based mp3 players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system; you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop. Then also you can use them from Windows, Macs, Linux, whatever.  And why are they still pushing ATRAC codecs? It's a waste of their time and money, and the world does not need Sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs. It's by no means superior to the standardized MPEG AAC codec or Microsoft's proprietary (although basically free) WMA codecs. Dear Sony, your codec is not significant, it is not a player in the audio codec world, and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us. The same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies, e.g. betamax and Memory Sticks. You just make the world more complicated, in the end you lose, and your market share goes to zero. (Although I did think MiniDiscs were a good idea.)  It's a good piece of hardware, but in order to use it you have to jump through Sony's hoops. Just say no.

<Title>El mejor MP3
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>En mi opinion el mejor mp3. La calidad de sonido es sorprendente (todo lo qeu esperaba de un producto sony), y para mi... esto es lo que mas vale en un reproductor mp3, al fin y al cabo... para eso lo queremos no? para escuchar musica.   El programa que viene incluido para grabar las canciones en el mp3 (sonic stage) no es tan dificil de usar, el unico punto que no me gusta es que no marca las canciones que ya pasaste al mp3, lo cual me parece un tanto tedioso en caso de que kieras actualizar tu coleccion.  Gran capacidad de almacenamiento gracias al sistema de compresion de sony (atrac), las canciones pesan menos y tienen una mejor calidad de sonido que en mp3 (claro si las conviertes del cd a ATRAC directamente, si pasas de mp3 a ATRAC obviamente escucharas la misma calidad de sonido).  Tiene sport timer para los que lo usan, o bien lo puedes usar como "sleep" ya que la musica se detiene al acabarse el tiempo que le pongas.  El aspecto de este mp3 es increible, es muy peque�o, del tama�o de un pendrive(se peude usar como pendrive tambien). Lo unico malo es que es bastante propenso a los rayones, pero bueno es el precio que tenemos que pagar por una apaciencia tan buena.  La duracion de la bateria es asombrosa, 28 horas segun la caja, realmente no lo he probado como comprenderan pasar 28 horas seguidas escuchando musica es algo complicado jajaja tiene una funcion de cargado rapido, lo conectas a un puerto USB y en 3 minutos tienes 3 horas de duracion. la pila se carga completamente en alrededor de 30 minutos depende de cuanta bateria le quedaba antes de la carga. Lo unico molesto es tener que encender el computador cuando esta apagado solo para cargar el mp3, pero esto se compensa al poder cargar tu mp3 en cualquier parte sin llevar ningun aditamento extra, solo necesitas una computadora (en todos lados hay una).  Recomiendo este reproductor a quien quiera escuchar musica con una alta calidad de sonido. Si no eres un gran amante de la musica y de los detalles en ella hay opciones mucho mas baratas que este reproductor. Un reproductor caro pero con una altisima calidad (yo lo compre en una rebaja de amazon a 65$ por suerte), el mejor MP3 en cuanto a calidad de sonido que hay (probe varios antes de comprar este, incluso mejor que los creative en mi opinion pero ambos son MUY buenos).  PD: sony ya soluciono el problema de que no se podia ver el artista de la cancion, al darle al boton home podemos cambiar entre el titulo de la cancion, el artista y el album.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this product for christmas, I have charged it once since then, have listened to it on 3 - 1 hour rides,  1 - 4 hour ride and 1 - 2 1/2 hour ride, and the batteries are still full. that is 9 and a half hours nearly non stop and the battery bar hasn't even moved.  I can put about 1,200 songs on it, and I still have room, and I even have some 20 minute songs on there. The earphones are kind of uncomfortable.  The wristband allows it to be carried easily around, although it can become uncomfortable after long periods of time, because it tends to loosen up after a while. As for the no artist name previously mentioned.....you can manually imput the artist name so I don't know why you're complaining. The sound output is great, better than an Ipod, me and several friends have compared them. All in all I highly reccomend this product, it's only flaw being it's size, allows it to be misplaced very easily.

<Title>Good design, Bad implimentation 
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was initially impressed with small cool design and digital display of the Sony NW-E005 until I received mine.  Unlike every other USB hard drive with the Sony drive you can't simply drag and drop your existing MP3 and WMA music files to it.  You must first load the Sony software, and then it goes through and converts all of you music files to Sony proprietary format.  Now every time you want to add more music you need to download it then convert it.  The software is not user friendly and converting file formats is simply a waste of time.  I guess the Sony Music people got their hands a hold of this and wanted add protection for themselves and avoid losing licensing fees.  Very annoying!!

<Title>I Loved The Player  But The  Software Was A Nightmare
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software to this MP3 player made it too much work. Anything that freezes up my computer has to go.   Here's my experience.  I purchased this player on February 23rd and returned it to the store on March 8th. I was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. I installed the software with no problem, but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. I just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. I did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. It had a very nice sound, easy to use and wonderful to carry around. I listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge.  Fast Foward Week 2  I wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. I opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as I did at first. First, the program began running really slow and then froze. I ctr/alt delete and started over. It worked for a second and then froze again. I rebooted and it did the same thing. I came back to it the next day and it did it again. I uninstalled it (so I thought), and it continued to freeze. It doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. I know this because I didn't have to "re-authorize" my computer to use it again. I had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. There are lots of hidden files.  In conclusion, had it not been for my experience with the software I would have kept the player.

<Content>I just got this today and it is a nice little MP3 player.  Unlike the old Apple Shuffle I had (that died), this unit has some heft to it, which is nice.  I've heard that the menu system is tricky to figure out, but I found it very easy and intuitive.  The SonicStage software is quirky, but I've never been a fan of needing software to add songs (like iTunes).

<Title>No durability
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine since Nov 2006.    At first I *loved* it!  It charged fast, was just the right size, was easy to use.    I have to say that the software kind of sucked, but it wasn't that bad.  Just don't expect any marathon sessions of loading music on.  After I'd load about 3-4 albums, it'd crash and I'd have to restart the software.  But I only load things once a week, if that, so I'm not to concerned.  Now, though, my player no longer charges unless I hold it in the USB port.  If I let go of it, it disconnects from the computer.  At first, I thought it was my port, but 4 ports later, it's the player.  I think it's been dropped maybe twice in the past 5 months, so I'm not sure if that was it or some other wierd flaw.    The case lets dust in, so now my display is very hard to read.    If you'll be using it outdoors a lot, forget reading the display at all.  Sunlight makes anything displayed virtually unreadable.  All in all, I thought I'd get longer thatn 5 months out of it before something major went wrong with it.  Sony's tech support was mostly useless.  They asked if I'd tried a different USB cord with it to make sure it wasn't the cord.  Um...my player plugs directly in?  And this was after I'd told them the make and model.  They'll replace it with a refurb model for $30, but that also means I have to go for god knows how long without any tunes at work or in the gym.  I have a work around to make it charge right now.  So, pretty much, I'm going to use it until it drops, then get an Ipod or maybe a Sandisk.

<Content>What were they thinking? Or Are they thinking at all? Sonic Stage is a piece of crap. It freezes, hangs and very very user friendly???? Since you need their software to load the music, I would stay away from this player as far away as possible.   Pros: Nice sound quality.  Cons: Everything else.   My recommendation is go for Creative USB players. It's very good quality and better battary life. With Creative players, you just drag and drop files and you done with it.  I see why Sony is failing in MP3 players market.

I'm an ipod user and was very difficult to transfer music to the walkman. I would recommend sony to place the holder on the usb cap instead of the back of the walkman and to include a lanyard with it. I've lost the cab twice!!!

<Title>Not a true MP3 player!
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first bought it I did what one does with an MP3 player: I plugged it in the USB port and from windows explorer dragged a few MP3s onto it. Immediately I learned that the product description was deceptive and this "MP3 player" does not play MP3s, rather the music needs to be digested first with a special Sony software.   I am always cautious about installing on a computer something that isn't necessary there and am especially wary about installing anything "Sony" after their notorious rootkit spyware/virus affair.   My search for a better alternative to the SonicStage lead me to a nice little Java application called "NW-E00x Mp3 File Manager" created by one Patrick Balleux. You may find all links and information via Google, just paste there "NW-E00x Mp3 File Manager" with the quotation marks.   The NW-E00x Mp3 File Manager is not the most intuitive to use, but it is still much easier and a lot less cumbersome than the SonicStage, and the nice things about it are that it installs inside the player, it is freeware and, unlike SonicStage, it will let you move songs back and forth from the player, plus it works with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. Oddly, some MP3 files need to have their ID3s removed before transfer in order to be playable on the Sony NW-E005. To remove ID3s I used another little freeware called "Multi ID3 Tag Editor."   Overall, Sony couldn't have made a product that is daintier and more unnerving at the same time. In this price range there are plenty other good players that don't require extra software to install and waste of time on them. I would advise looking for a different player, and most definitely one with MP3 drag-and-drop capability.   Pros:  1. Cute looks and small size.  2. Room for plenty of music = 2 GB.  3. FM radio.   Cons:  1. Software.  2. Software.  3. Software.  4. Contrary to its description it DOES NOT play any MP3 files. Sony wants your MP3s CONVERTED with big, bad and ugly software.

<Title>Taking it back
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I hate this thing. They can take their sonic stage and well, you know.  Beware, if you happen to have a computer with Windows Vista, and install the copy of sonictrash that comes with the player, the system will not boot, and you will have to use the restore utility to remove it.  They advertise it as an MP3 player, but you have to convert the songs to their format to load them, and only their software will do it. Since theirs won't run on my system I cannot use it at all. Supposedly, there is a Vista compatible version of SonicAnnoyance, but you have to download special drivers, plus the program, and after havign to fix the mess the disk that came with the player made of my system, I think I'll pass.  I'm taking mine back, and getting an MP3 player I can copy songs directly to, without the sonicstupidity.

I can't see the screen in the daytime because it's too bright.   The drive also cannot read Korean so the titles and artists come up funny.

<Title>Great player, many problems with SonicStage
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I also installed the SonicStage software, registered the product, etc. SonicStage locks up my computer and causes me to have to reboot to use the computer.  It never transferred one song across to the MP3 player and instead gave several Windows - No Disk errors.  It hung up for a long time even when it appeared to be transferring one song.  I tried installing the software on another computer and it worked!  I can only attribute the problem to my computer's Anti-Virus, Firewall or Spyware software with is CA (Computer Associates).  I can't figure out if that is the exact problem.  Also SonicStage seems to interfere with my Winamp software.  I really like the features of the player itself.  I love it's small compact size and that it can fit easily into a pocket.  It has a lot of cool features and holds a charge for longer than most MP3 players.  You really have to read the PDF manual to fully understand all the operating features.  The only thing I was disappointed about is the number of songs it holds.  I only have about 450 songs on mine -- it's full!  I have to delete a song to add another.  I wish I could use Windows Media Player instead of SonicStage.

<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>here are my reasons why i love it  1. I paid $50 for this 2GB mp3 player in Staples Store. Try to beat it with iPod or any other player. MP3 player is a tool which lasts 8 months max simply because I use it every single day. Why would I pay $200 when I can pay $50  2. I don't use SonicStoge, I use simple JAVA app stored on the mp3 player and load music from anywhere (everybody has java).  3. I use this mp3 player as flash drive if I need to (it saved my a** few times when I had important powerpoint presentation at work, but network in the cnference room was down)  4. it lasts forever on the internal battery which charges in 15 minutes  5. the sound is really good, the interface works great. It took me few days to get used to it, but it's worth it.  6. this player is so sleek and tiny. I keep it on my pocket all the time.    issues? none. seriously none, I love this mp3 player.

<Title>Great little music player
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 4 Sony Minidisc players (2 older units and 2 Hi-MD units) so when the wife wanted a smaller music player, Sony was the first one I looked into.  This unit supports the same file format (ATRAC) as the minidisc players so there was no need for me to re-encode all the CDs in my collection to MP3 (it will play MP3s as well).  This is a very nice music player, very lightweight and it has great sound.

<Title>A bit dissapointed, but still glad to have it
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because, to me, the Walkman brand has meant the finest portable audio (from my past experience with cassettes and CDs). I got this several months ago, and I'm not thrilled. It was $150 in the store, on sale for $120, and while I'm glad to have this and use it so much that it's probably worth the money, I question if it was the right buy.  I mostly use this for podcasts; however, I have listened to some music, and I will say that the audio quality is great! Also, it is conveniently small and feels VERY comfortable in my hand. While holding it right, all of the buttons can be easily pushed with my thumb and index finger. The buttons are small, but I have no problems with them.  The FM tuner sounds GREAT with local stations, but for most stations in different cities, I can't pick them up at all, even though I can pick them up with my car radio. - But for the size, I didn't expect to be able to.  Now the negative: Sony tried to minimize the number of buttons, so that makes navigation through the tracks, settings, and playlists a bit cumbersome.  Also, I am VERY disappointed with the display. I can barely read it if I'm outside during daylight hours, even on a cloudy day. -And on a bright summer day around noon - forget it! Plus, the title crawls too slowly, so it's very annoying trying to read it. This is more of an issue with podcasts though, which tend to have long titles.  Next, the earbuds are very comfortable. The cord length is okay, but it looks weird with one side longer than the other.  After about 4 months, one side went completely dead (and I don't recall any excessive tugging). Not an expensive replacement, but come on, Sony!  One really big pain in the neck is the fact that I have to use the included SonicStage software to add/remove songs. I use different computers all of the time, and I had to install the CD onto all of them. I'm pretty good with software programs, but this one was not really easy to figure out. Though, once I got used to it and had it installed on all of the computers I use, it seems to be pretty handy. Still, I wish I could just copy and paste tracks into the device like most USB storage devices.  Finally, the serial number sticker is peeling off, and that's annoying.  Overall, this device sounds great and works well, but the software and hardware can be a bit cumbersome until you get used to them. I haven't used other comparable devices, so I can't say for sure if I made the right decision. However, I'm very glad to have this device, and I use it all of the time.  Lastly, the serial number sticker is beginning to peel off

<Title>Great MP3 Player for Me
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I spent a lot of time researching MP3 players before I decided on the Sony NW-E005F.  I've used it for about 2 months and I'm very pleased with my decision.  I was looking for something that is lightweight, small, reliable, good for audio books or podcasts, has a long battery life, has decent sound quality, and has a fairly easy to use music transfer program.  The NW-E005 has pleased me in all of these categories.  Here are the pros and cons, which should summarize its functionality.  Pros: 1. Lightweight and small - It's the size of a jump drive, and just slightly heavier.  2. Reliable - I've had zero glitches in the 2 months that I've owned the MP3 player.  3. Good for audio books - When you want to turn the MP3 player off, you simply stop the book or podcast.  When you turn it back on by pressing play, the song resumes where you left off.  4. Excellent battery life - This is my #1 favorite feature.  Sony claims the battery life is 30 hours.  I haven't tested this, but I haven't needed to!  The amount of time taken to transfer songs a couple of times a week is sufficient to keep the battery full.  I rarely need to intentionally charge the battery.  5. Sound quality - The sound quality is good as far as I can tell.  I'm not an audio buff, but I don't have any problems with the sound quality.  Cons: 1. Song searching - The 1 line text display makes it somewhat difficult to scroll through your songs to find the one you want.  This is only a slight inconvenience and if you don't have a lot of songs, it won't be a big deal.  Alternatively, you can search by artist, album, or song title.  That can speed things up.  2. Fast forward speed - I listen to 40 minute long podcasts.  The fast forward function is fairly slow.  I just did a test, and it took me 1 minute to fast forward to the 11th minute of a podcast.  If you only plan to listen to 4-minute songs, this won't be a problem.  3. Slow scrolling - The display only fits about 12 characters, and it takes a while to start scrolling.  If you have song titles that are only different at the end, this can be a problem.  If you know all of your songs by the first 12 or so characters, you won't have a problem.  Other notes: 1. SonicStage - I find SonicStage to be a pretty nice program.  I'm sure there's much nicer programs out there (like iTunes), but SonicStage doesn't upset me like other reviewers claim.  It's not entirely true that you must use it.  I was able to find a free program on the web to transfer songs, but I actually liked SonicStage better.  You can't use windows explorer to transfer songs.  2. Radio - I don't use the radio.  When I first bought it, I tried out the FM tuner and found the reception to be decent, but I don't have anything to compare to.  Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons for how I use my MP3 player (weightlifting, running, car rides, and podcasts).  The battery life is AMAZING!

<Title>Great Sound!
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was shopping around for an MP3 player. First, I thought of giving iPod Nano (2 GB) a try. But when I found this sleek looking Sony NW-E005 2 GB for half the price of a Nano, I gave it a try. So far I like it. I paid $59 plus tax at Circuit City. Unlike Nano and Shuffle, NW-E005 has a FM radio. I can preset my favorite stations. I can save MP3 files on it or I can convert my MP3 files to ATRAC format while transferring, which saves lots of space while keeping the quality of sound intact. When I compared the quality of sound with Shuffle, Sony outperforms Shuffle. To me, quality of sound is more important than any other features an MP3 player has to offer. This player has pre-set equalizers. It also gives me the ability to custom set the equalizers. Another important feature is it offers the ability to create my own playlist. Unlike Shuffle, I can create my playlist in the order I like using SonicStage (provided with this player) and then import it to the player. Yes, there are few things that this player lacks, but overall, this player is worth the price.

<Title>Not recommended
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the product one month. It does play the music that I put on it, but I would not buy again.  First, it only works with the special software that comes with it, which limits it to connecting to one computer. You cannot simply copy MP3 files to the unit, so it is really false advertising to call it an MP3 player.  Another thing: in daylight, I cannot read the display at all. It is very dim.

<Title>Just what I wanted!
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have wanted an MP3 player for months--this one in particular, but I never bought it because I wanted to actually play with it before purchasing it sight-unseen, and no one around had a 'floor model' I could try out, until I found out we had SonyStyle store in my city.  I have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time!  1. Sound quality is great--on high quality songs.  I do have some songs that crackle, but it's because the source CD was scratched or something I guess.  They crackled on Winamp before.  2. Controls are very easy to use if you take the time to figure them out.  Don't expect to just sit down and intuitively know how to use the thing--read the manual, that's why they give you one. :)  3. Yes, you DO have to use SonicStage to load music, and sure, it takes a few minutes.  But there is no way you could fit as many songs into 2G of memory without the program.  And if you install and use it properly, it's not as crappy as people are saying.  If you don't like the idea of having to use special software to condense and manage your music, buy a different player.  Simple as that. This point was not a deal-breaker for me by any means.  4. Incredible battery power.  I've been using it almost nonstop for two days now, and I'm down to 75% battery power.  Not bad, given my PDA will start beeping after 4 hours of active use.  There are 3 different power save settings--normal, super, and off.  Right now, it's off, and still going strong.  But the animation you get in normal mode is kindof neat, too.  5. The FM tuner is better than I expected!  I listen to a station from a non-local station, that fades in out as I drive around town.  I can't even pick it up on my portable radio/CD/cassette player at home or at work.  You the cord on the headphones acts as the antenna, so you can't coil it and expect to get a crystal reception, but I am still impressed.  6. The only thing I don't care for is that the display only shows either song title, or album.  NOT the artist.  Simple fix, though--go back into Sonic Stage and rename all the albums to the artist name.  Who really cares what album a song came from anyway, unless you're a huge audiophile? In which case, you've probably get a more hi-tech unit than this already!  All in all, this unit was exactly what I wanted--nothing more, nothing less.  I don't need video, I don't need a color display, and I wanted something small enough to slip in my pocket.  This fits the bill.  I have, however, heard bad things about Sony headphones, so I am in the market for a better set than the painful cheapies that came with the unit.  =D

<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What a horrid product.When I found out I'd have to "register" online just to use this product, (after downloading ALL the software) I bundled this up and sent it back to Amazon. My husband has another MP3 Player, and I had his up and running and LOADED with some of his favorites in about 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes after taking THIS product out of the box, I was still loading software. What a pain. This is useless.  I wanted to listen to my music, and instead spent six hours and two tylenols trying to get this mess to work. I gave up, boxed it up, and sent it back. This is smaller than hubby's MP3 player, but I'm going to get the same he has. I'd actually like to be able to use a product right out of the box. IMPOSSIBLE with this flash walkman!  I would have given it NEGATIVE five stars if possible!

<Title>Easily portable and easy to charge
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I work in a hospital and travel frequently, so I wanted something small enough to take to work and easy to charge while on the road. This MP3 player has exceded on both counts. It travels to work with me daily, and it's small enough to carry discretely even in dress pants. Even better, I'm able to charge it anywhere there is a computer, ranging from the hospital call room to random internet cafes in Central America--without having to carry a USB cable or docking station. In addition, the battery life has been excellent. On my last trip (3 weeks overseas with constant use on buses, trains, at night, etc) I only had to charge it once. The downside (of course) is the Sony software, which is not very intuitive. Having said that, the new version is MUCH better than the older ones. It still has a clumsy interface, but it installed easily, has never frozen on me, and transfers files smoothly. It takes about 3 minutes per CD. One inconvenience is that I had to burn my iTunes files onto CD in order to transfer them, but someone smarter than me probably knows how to sidestep this process.

<Content>I got this player close to a year ago.  I really like it, holds lots of music, good sound quality etc.  The downfalls are that you cannot see the display when in sunlight - like if you're outside for a run or a walk.   The other thing you should be aware of is the sony software.  I received an email from them last week stating that they are moving away from their ATRAC files.  Will still be able to use their software to organize.  I'm not sure of what that means long term for my MP3 player.

<Title>Sleek with a few negative things
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using Sony sonicstage for more than a year with the NW-HD5 and the black bean. I do not have a problem with the software. It is faster than itunes to rip cd's and the altrac quality is very good. In blind listening tests with 3 people everyone said the Sony sounded better at 64kbps that an Ipod at 128 kbps.  I bought the new NW-E005 because I loved my bean but 1GB was limiting. The NW-005 is very small and sleek. A problem with it is because it is so shinny it always has fingerprints on it. It also looks like it will scratch easily. Another problem is because it has so few buttons you have to go through the menu to change most things. Another annoying thing is when you are listening to play lists it does not show you the artists name. Also the battery life is below par for a Sony devise. There is no way you will get what Sony states. Sony USA is also not selling many accessories for the devise. They sell a clip overseas for about $20 that should have been included. Sony also should have included a soft case to protect it. For $129 for 2GB it's a pretty good deal

<Title>Great little product with plenty of space
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got a Sony MP3 player back with the Mini-Disc player and them moved on to the 1gig MP3 player because of the promise to hold 695 songs (4min songs compressed to Sony's Altrac3 at 48bits).  Sure enough I was able to get just over 600 songs on that player (hey, I had about 12 songs that were 10+minutes).  It was easy to use and even the Sony software was pretty easy to use once I figured it out.  So when this product came out with the promise of 1350 songs on a 2gig HD, I thought - why not, only $130.  Even a 4gig Ipod couldn't hold that many songs and those run around $250 dollars.  Pros:  I found that this had the same high quality sound even at 48bit Altrac3 compression.  Friends with IPODs could not distinguish any noticible difference in sound quality.  This thing is even smaller than the 1gig Sony I previously owned and I was able to get 1244 songs on the unit.  (again, I've got a slew of 10+ minute songs which would limit me getting anywhere close to 1350 as the unit stated).  I also liked the fact that there was no additional cable to charge the unit.  If the battery runs down just plug it into any computer USB port and it'll recharge in about 10-15 minutes fully.  I even have a USB adapter for my car so I can charge while I'm on the go.  The unit also includes a 5-band equalizer and an FM radio that gets great reception.  They also improved the headphones just a bit.  It's still that quirky earbuds where one side is clearly longer than the otherside; however, they added a few feet to the length so you don't have to worry about using an extender if you want to toss your Sony in your pocket and head out.  CONS:  Sonic Stage is still a bit quirky to use; although now having owned Sony MP3 players of some sort for 3+ years.  When you have 6000+ songs uploaded into your system, you can't just push songs over on your MP3 player from the list.  You really need to create the groups first and then transfer.  Controls:  I have no problems with the controls but they are tiny and could be a problem for anyone who has any kind of problems with manipulating small buttons  Display:  WHERE THE HECK IS THE BAND NAME??!!!  The other quirks I could live with but why the heck is there no band display available to view.  I have plenty of songs on my MP3 player from lesser bands not normally recognized.  It would be nice to see the band name on the display.  Hopefully Sony will put out a firmware update to fix this problem.  It's the main reason I gave it 4stars instead of 5.   Carrying Case - there is no carrying case for this player, not even a velvet bag.  There is an armband carrying available for purchase but sony isn't releasing it until Sept 15th.  I would have rather paid an extra $10 for this device just so I would have a carrying bag.  Personally, I think Sony has some great products in the MP3 market and with Altrac3 compression, they can give you smaller product with less storage space and STILL allow for more songs to be loaded on it.  Why would I want to spend twice as much for a 4gig Ipod that holds 1000 songs when I can get a Sony for half that price and have 1300 songs instead

WHAT TO DO? Someone told me to download an MP3 File manager...it's supposed to install this software in the player, and then u can transfer files from any computer. Otherwise u need the stupid sonic stage!!! that's the BIGGEST CON! I RECCOMEND U BUY THIS!!! Totally SATISFIED!!! ;)

<Title>AWESOME!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product when I was in New Zealand for holiday.   I love the size because it fits anywhere and it's totally portable. I love the 2 gig aspect of it. I have a 20g MP3 player from Sony with a 30 hour playback making that my main purpose to even purchase a Sony MP3 player. At first, Sonic Stage was annoying but I have gotten use to it and I have seen it improved from version 2.0. Still could use some work though.  The ATRAC function is incredible. Sony has managed to compress music down to 48k and still sound identical to IPODS 128k. Also allows more room for your MP3 player.  I love the USB portion of the device. Even though I expect it to be at least 30-40 hours battery life from previous SONY MP3 players, the ability to just plug your device into any USB port in a computer makes up for the 28 hour battery life and it only take a few minutes to recharge your MP3 player.  I also love that it acts as a thumb drive. I use my MP3 player to download files, save my school papers, and transfer pictures. I don't know if it was designed for that but I use it as a multipurpose thumbdrive/mp3 player while I am on campus.   I also bought this white rubber suit for my MP3 player so it wouldn't scratch because I have banged up my previous player by sliding it, dropping it, banging it, and even falling on it during sports activities. I haven't seen any rubber suit online but it is a SONY product because it has its logo on it. I have tried the Sony Style website but it doesn't list it. You might find it at a SONY store because that where I purchased mine in New Zealand.   It's also extremely durable. I have dropped mine all the time and crush the hell out of it and it still works. Mine is not scratch because of the rubber protective suit but it does scratch fairly easy because my friend purchased one in the states and her is completely scratched but it works.  The display is hard and even impossible to see during daylight. I wouldn't say it doesn't work in bright lighting because it works inside office buildings and classrooms perfectly. I think it's the lighting of the sun that makes it impossible to see.  The FM function is awesome. In Auckland New Zealand and Denver CO, you can pick up many stations and they are very clear and reliable. I don't know how it works outside an urban area but the FM function is nice with preset controls.  The controls are okay. You can choose to have your music organize by two setting at a time. For example: You can have your music displayed with artist/track or artist/albums. Either way you will scroll lots unless you organize your stuff in a playlist on Sonic Stage. It makes it much better that way!  Overall, this product is great. I gave it a five star because it has done more then function as an mp3 player and all its features are extremely easy to use. Sonic Stage is not being factor in but if it was I would have given it a total score of 4 stars. Enjoy it! Cheers!

Every time I tried to listen to the songs, suddenly appears on the screen "file error", I called Sony and they told me that they will replace the unit with an "furbished" one.   I decided not to bother with sending the unit back since they said they wouldn't replace it with a new one - plus I was not happy at the prospect of paying more $$$ to have an item replaced which was less than a year old!!!   I was hesitant to buy an Ipod, but I think I will buy one, really, really disapointed with Sony.

<Title>Shame on Sony
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is among the worst MP3 players I've ever used, in terms of its restrictive functionality. Unlike most products from other manufactures, this guy prohibits playing any files copied directly by dragging on Windows Explorer, and all music files are forced to be transferred with its badly designed SonicStage instead, which converts file format to one which other computers wouldn't read as part of Sony's anti-privacy policy at the expense of users' convenience that serves us no purpose. The software seems to not support UNICODE also, meaning it will not copy music files if their filename/tags are in multiple languages.  When used as USB thumb drive, its file transfer rate is as slow as 2.5MB/s, pretty bad if you buy it for file storage function.  As said by the name of product, it's Sony Music Player, never a MP3 Player. If you're looking for one that plays MP3 files directly as most similar products do without harass, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.

<Title>Unfriendly GUI , small LCD, difficult navigation.
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Right now I have 3 mp3 players each serving different needs;  this device is closest to my iRiver digital player. I was looking for something similar but with more space and a better FM tuner.  Unfortunately, this sony device fails miserably in comparison when considering ease-of-use, transfer speeds, navigation.    It took me 20 minutes to figure out how to drag\drop files to this device from the unfriendly 'SonicStage' software which must be used.  Once downloaded to the device I couldn't navigate through playlists....only one track at a time. If its possible I couldn't quickly figure it out.  Also, navigating through tracks is slow because the LED is too small to see what track is playing and the controls are too cumbersome for my normal sized (if not slightly small) fingers.   I then tried downloading my free songs from their 'Connect' music store and encountered at least 5 errors before moving on.  One file successfully downloaded but crashes the 'SonicStage' software.  In all this product is a loser....for something similar I suggest trying the iriver.

<Content>I can't believe I didn't read the customer reviews before buy this product, it's really the worst I saw, ever, and I think I wont see a worst one in the future. As an another customer said, this is not a MP3 player, I don't know how to call it. With any device, similar price, cheaper, any, you can open the package and start to listen music, any kind of music, but this... it's a Sony. You CANNOT copy music (drag and drop) with Windows Explorer or another friendly software, you MUST copy all your music with the incredible heavy, slow, unfriendly and antinatural SonicStage, I never saw a worst program.  Thus, if you don't carry your own laptop with this soft, you never recharge de player until find another victim. They said you can copy music in its proprietary format (Atrac) or original format (MP3, WMA), but you can't, all tracks are converted to the unpopular Atrac format.  Who knows, who uses this format? The button to transfer tracks in its original formats doesn't work, then I downloaded an upgrade of SonicStage to go to version 4.2, but it still doesn't work. In any device in the world (and another planet) you can organise music in folders and then navigate within them, but this... it's a Sony, you CANNOT decide where you save the tracks, you can only save in the place it wants. I downloaded an upgrade of firmware to go to version 2.01 but nothing changed, it still working in its particular way. Mr. Sony, what were you thinking when designed this device?  Do you use drugs or alcohol?  Or both? It's my fault, I should read the reviews, or waited for one review, but I feel I was stolen. I'm from Argentina and it's very hard to return the product from here, but the conclusion for all is: this product is candidate to return, DO NOT BUY IT.
