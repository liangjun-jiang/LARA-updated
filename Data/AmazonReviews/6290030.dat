<Title>A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the forge 256 mb for christmas, and I was at first excited about using the player. The design is sleek and modern, and the player seemed to abound with many useful features.      Setting it up, I found it easy to use, with a very intuitive interface and setup. It was able to easily integrate with a 1 GB sd memory card I bought, and I was able to successfully fill it up to its maximum capacity.       Unfortunately, success was only temporary. The radio tuner is completely useless. The unit was not able to pick up the strongest station in my area, and I live in a major metropolitan area. As such, the fm record feature is completely worthless. The whole player is made of a cheap plastic, the chrome ring being only cosmetic. The player will load songs fine. But when actual use is attempted, the slightest bump will cause the player to shut down. Booting up again, the rio logo dislays, only for the unit to shut down again. Apparently it has something to do with the battery compartment design. It's slightly to large, and a little plastic piece on the positive end prevents a proper connection. It gets stuck in a shut-down mode, and an internal settings-saving battery will keep it in this mode, even if the AAA battery is removed. The stopwatch is okay, but the small buttons make it difficult to use.          The shortcomings of this product are a result of the physical design of the hardware itself. No patch, firmware upgrade, or settings change will ever fix these flaws. Within a few weeks, the Rio Forge 256 mb will be reduced to paperweight, though it could possibly find use as A FREAKING HOCKEY PUCK! I am very disapointed in Rio, and will tell anyone to stay as far away from this product as they possibly can. I am hoping that I can return it, but I've already wasted at least $60 bucks on a sd card I have no use for.       If you're looking for flash-based players, there are plenty of others on the market. Unforunately, the Rios are the only prominent ones I can find with an sd expansion slot. Maybe another player, like the cali or chiba would work. I haven't tried those, but I can tell you that iriver has an excellent line of products. I've boughten both an Ihp-140 hard-drive player and one of their mp3-cd players. Both of these function flawlessly. Their flash-based players are more compact, although they do not have expanasion slots. Ultimately, if 128, 256, or 512 mb is enough for you, go with the iriver (or wait and see what the flash-based ipod is like). If you need more and still still need the shock-resistance of a completely solid-state device, go with an alternative rio model. (Just be sure to read the reviews BEFORE YOU BUY OR START USING.) If I had read the other reviews, I would have returned the Rio Forge before I even opened the box.

<Title>Simply doesn't work after first download
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player completely froze while loading music. After that it wouldn't even power on. I couldn't get anyone at technical service. I am returning this piece of garbage. I have never been so displeased with an electronic product in my life. I urge you all to stay away.

<Title>Flash memory doesn't work
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great player for mp3s, but the FM tuner is worthless because you can't get any stations and the sound quality is poor.  I also trashed 2 512mb sd cards trying to upgrade the memory.   Called Rio support last June and told them. They said they would get back to me, and that there was a problem with memory cards and this unit. Still have not gotten back to me and it is January 2005 as of this writing.  Don't buy this unit unless you are looking for an MP3 flash player ONLY and are willing to accept the limited memory that ships with the unit. You can't expect sd cards to work.  I like the ease of use and the advantages of flash memory, also the arm band, which allows me to run with it and not have to worry about damaging a hard drive.

<Title>Good while it worked..
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like another Rio I owned, this thing broke down within two weeks.  The sound and design are pretty impressive and the unit is quite stylish and comfortable to hold and operate while running.  I don't use the FM tuner so the apparent inadequacies in that department don't matter to me.  However, after I left the Rio in my car overnight during a sub-zero spell here in Chicago, the thing will no longer turn on.  Thankfully this happened while I can still return the stupid thing.  Do not buy Rios!  When I had my 128mp unit I did try calling customer service and after getting the complete runaround and no help I threw the unit away.

<Title>Defective product
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player as a gift for my husband for xmas.  After 1 week of use, the darn thing won't even power up.  No lights, no display, no nothing!!!  It seems that other reviewers of this product have had the same problem too.  Looks like this is a known problem, see Document 5823 under support options at http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/rioaudio/  Unfortunately because I did my xmas shopping too early I cannot return this product because the last refund date has already passed.  Going to try my hand with the warranty...and looks like it's only a 90 day warranty at that...which is almost passed as well.  I don't recommend this purchase at all.  It's a waste of money.

<Title>Okay purchase if no memory card added
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Rio Forge specifically for the gym and because of its FM Tuner.  My gym has television sets up with an FM tuner so you can hear the audio side.  However, the tuner has NEVER worked at the gym and I can only get one regular radio station to work inside the building.  Also after adding a 512MB memory card to the RIO, I have had non-stop problems with the RIO shutting off at the start-up.  Rio's customer service has been quick in responding to my emails, but their suggestions haven't worked.  It seems like I need to reformat my RIO every week, and also need to change batteries every week to "trick" the RIO into working.    The RIO did work fine before the memory card was added, but if it is going to be advertised with an expandable memory slot, it should work when used.  It's been a lot of hassle since I bought it, and I'm regretting my choice of MP3 players.  I would stay away from this product until something more stable comes out.

<Title>Negatives outweigh the Positives
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This was my second MP3 player, yet I am ready for my third.  At first I thought this was better then the Creative Labs Nomad II, that I had.  It has more memory, better arm band, and the sound is pretty good.  Yet after a month of using it I now see the negatives outweigh the positives.  The FM radio is alright.  I live close to town and the radio would still cut in and out as I turn my body or move my arm.  The software would not let me place the songs in the order that I want them to be.  It has arrow icons to move up or down, yet it would not let me highlight a song and move it around.  Perhaps I am using it wrong, yet there is no trouble shoot guide that states what I am doing wrong.  The top problem that I noticed is that if I bump it in the gym or even tap it, the player will shut off and restart.  So I exchanged it for another one and it did the same thing with a light tap.  I am so disappointed with this, because it should have been much better then the Nomad II.  I give this 2 stars and I am being generous.

<Title>Please save your money.. ZERO stars!
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I should have read the reviews before I got this.. I exchanged my Xmas gift for this one, and it has already stopped working; only after 6 weeks. I used to love this product, but the Rio Forge 256 has recenlty disappointed me along with their customer "support" As an daily runner, I thought this "rugged design"  would last... I haven't even dropped this... but it stopped working. I am completely outraged at a company which would put out an expensive product knowing it will stop working. I am in the process of trying to return it... however, I applied for a mail in rebate; so I have no UPC code. Maybe the BBB can help me out.   angry in NJ...

<Title>It makes me want to curse.
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's silver, it's sexy, and the sound quality is AMAZING.  When it works.  That's all this player has going for it.  I was hesitant, based on all the reviews.  I bought one anyway and enjoyed it for almost a month.  Did a couple of downloads, yada yada yada.  One day after attempting to record something from the radio, the internal memory assumed some unknown format.  I could not find any instructions anywhere on how to re-format the device.  Formatting issues caused by a feature of the device raised a big red flag, so I decided to return it to the store (thankfully I still had a couple days left before the 30-day period).  Unfortunately, I returned it for another Forge.  This time, the player crashed after a few hours of use.  I'm done with the Forge.  I am exchanging this piece of crap for the iRiver 512MB player.     I would give this zero stars if that was possible.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Thu Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite reading all the reviews on poor quality, I still purchased the Rio forge. I have owned a Rio mp3 player in some form since they first came to market. I felt it was a good purchase based on my good experiences with their products in the past.  However, almost a day after the warranty ending the player died. The replacement from Rio would be more than just buying a new one. When the Forge was working, it has various problems from shutting off when it hit a deleted song to not starting up at all until you pulled the battery.  It is not worth the money when there are so many alternatives out there. It has cool features, but features doesn't mean a thing if the product will not last past 3 months.

<Title>Makes a Nice Paperweight
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you're looking for a nifty, futuristic-looking paperweight, this item is the one for you. All you have to do is buy it and use it. It will die on you, sometime not long after the too-short 90-day warrantee expires, leaving you with no way to make it right. You will receive absolutely no help from Rio customer service. So, Voila! You have a paperweight.  That is what happened to me. The Forge was nice enough while it worked, which was for about 8 months. Then, it suddenly and unexpectedly completely died. Nothing brings it back to life; Rio customer service very helpfully tells me that it seems my device needs to be relaced--which they won't do, since it's beyond the warrantee.  If you're looking for a paperweight, though, it would be much more cost-effective to get and paint a rock.

<Title>It is a good little player for sports activity. 
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I actually bought two of these players - one for my wife and myself.  At first we had a lot of the problems that people talked about here.  I flashed the players and formatted them and the SD memory I put in and only use the RIO supplied software.  Everything has been fine wtih both players.  I use AAA rechargeable batteries also.  They seem to work better and last longer.  I was initally using the players with MusicMatch or MS Media player.  I had lot's of problems with the players shutting down. Use the RIO software.  It is only a matter of time before you see 2GB or 4GB SD cards.    One reservation on this player is that i heard that RIO has gotten out of the business of MP3 players. I think that is why they are practically giving these away now.   I cycle with the player and it is just great for that purpose.  I like the fact that you can upgrade the memory with an SD Card.  I have a 256 card in there now but plan to take it up to 1 GB.  In that case I should have probably about a 250 song capacity.  Not as good as a nano-pod but i am not locked into Apple Music and do not have to trash the music i have already purchased online.  I do not like the idea of being forever married to Apple Music.  Their players are the best right now, but I think the proprietary nature is a real flaw.

<Title>Overall Very Good Player
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Forge is a very good flash mp3 player. Pros- 1) easy drag and drop or included Rio music manager 2) firm to hold 3) informative LCD / user friendly interface 4) good quality headphones 5) expansion slot 6) easy to create playlists 7) Radio 8) Radio Recorder 9) Custom Equalizer 10) Stopwatch 11) Supports Audiobooks 12) Superb Sound Quality  Cons- 1) no cover / chrome bezel easily gets scratched 2) no OGG or .FLAC support 3) headphones although sound good are weak 4) battery cover flimsy 5) Music manager software is alright 6) Mediocre Radio Reception 7) No Voice recording 8) armband is made for body builders and is a bit fussy to put the player in  Overall, Rio Forge is a very good mp3 player, especially due to  its expansion capabilities. For the price there is no better mp3 player. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is becuase the stainless steel in the front is easily scratched.

<Title>Don't buy it ...No  matter what 
<Date>Wed Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought 1 Rio at Best Buy, and had it about a week.  I liked the armband, for working out.  I went to buy one for my husband, and when Best Buy did not have any in stock, I bought one online.  The day my husband's arrived, my died.  I was able to return it to Best Buy, since I had it less than 30 days.  3 days later, my husband's died, and I am having a heck of a time trying to get dealtrain (the company I purchased from through Amazon)or Rio to refund my money.  Stay away from this product!!!

<Title>great....for awhile...then crap....
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this was my first flash-based mp3 player, and i did a ton of research.  so i decided on the rio sport 256 mb because of the price, design, and the fact that it was a refurb (which i assumed would fix some of its problems).  i assumed wrongly.  as described by other owners, the player began to shut itself off during my workout sessions.  i've concluded that the battery, during minor bumps, loses contact with metal connections, thereby shutting it off.  note that when this happens, the player resets.  so if you were on song number 76, you'll have to scroll to get back there.  since i'm not a bookmarking freak, this was quite annoying.  also, my up volume button is sticking.  it's a shame, because the player was really nice.  headphones are good, i liked the fact that the player isn't shaped like a pack of gum, and the ability to add an SD card was cool.  that said, i prefer stable functionality over design, but man is it nice when you can have both.  so, i'm currently in the process of returning mine after owning it for less than 3 months (bought in Sept 2005).  i think i'll try a Creative MuVo now, and see how that goes.  oh, and since i detest the itunes software, that rules out apple products.  though, from what i've seen, they are plagued with their own problems too.  happy hunting, folks.

<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Rio Forge MP3 Player from Amazon about a month ago.  Worked fine until one night I tried to connect it to my computer for a new music download.  I plugged the usb cable into the unit and...  nothing. The MP3 player would not show connection status.  It actually showed nothing at all.  I unplugged the cable and tried to power up the player itself.  Nada.  I changed the battery...  nothing.  The player is now D.O.A. I am not even going to try for a repair.  I will write it off as a bad learning experience.

<Title>OK after 9 months use, but some problems
<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a refurbished Forge 256 in late May 2005, taking a chance in spite of the poor reviews because I wanted the expandable memory feature.   As of early March `06 it is still working, except now the playlist doesn't show anything that is on the expansion card.  It worked for months but I did something that corrupted the card formatting.  RIO's tech support sent me info on how to reformat the card but it seems to be Windows only and I use a Mac.  So, for now, the card is in there serving no useful purpose.  I wonder if some of the Forge's problems may be related to the expansion card feature.  Perhaps it is difficult to integrate.  I puzzled about why this desirable feature would be so rare in flash players, maybe this is why.  The only other problem I've had that others report is that it does often shut down when bumped (thus forgetting the current song).  It is annoying but I have learned to avoid bumping it most of the time.  One other problem, there seems to be a bug in the RIO Mac iTunes plugin that often causes the Mac to not shut down or wake from sleep normally after the Forge has been attached.  Aside from these 3 problems I have been happy with the unit.

<Title>Rio Forge is junk
<Date>Mon Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got one of these for Christmas, and it worked fine until the battery went dead in it. When I replaced the battery it kept telling me it needed to be reformatted. I followed the advice on the website and nothing worked. I called tech support and they walked me through it, but it still would not work. Then they told me the memory was corrupted (and from what they said it was a common problem) and had to be replaced. But since my wife had bought it well in advance of Christmas it was past the 90 day warranty. That's right only 90 factory warranty. Seems they acknowledge these things are only good for a month or so then give out on you sometime within the first 6 months or less. They offered to sell me a new one for around $20 dollars more than you can buy one on through this or any other website.   No wonder there are so many refurbished models for sell....
