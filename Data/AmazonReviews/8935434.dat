<Title>Good, but with caveats
<Date>Tue Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Samsung YH-820MC and related family of iPod-competitors represent a nice attempt, but are not quite ready for prime time. Too bad, really, because with some improvements this could be a solid little iPod-killer. Obviously, this model was rushed to market to capitalize on the iPod craze, and it wasn't really consumer-tested extensively enough. Samsung is shooting themselves in the foot, because with better software and an easier, more feature-rich interface, it would be an excellent little player/recorder.  First the positives: Good sound... not super-powerful, but nice. There are several standard EQ settings (all presets, and fairly decent), and there is a surround-simulator (WOW) and BassBoost. A truly nice feature is that you can also change the player's tonal output to match speakers, earphone, headphone or carpack. The shuffle and repeat play are good, and volume is easily controlled through membrane-keys on the unit's faceplate. The screen is bright and clear, big enough to read without being overwhelming. The unit's size is perfect... it fits well in the palm of the hand, and controls are thumb-reachable like the iPod. It's slightly longer than a pack of gum, and very slim and light. Battery life is realistically 4-5 hours, and charging takes only about 2-3 hours. The unit has a built-in lithium battery, but it may be user-replacable. The proprietary connector includes a red/green LED to indicate the charging and USB interface status.  Now, the negatives, and there are plenty of them to report.  Generally, the biggest and most disappointing problem with the unit is that it *requires* you to use Napster-to-Go for everything. That in itself isn't so bad, except that you also *must* be online to do anything at all with your library (or indeed to even connect to the unit). So, even if, like me, you have no interest in buying music online (sorry, I'm not a pop fan), and you simply want to copy your own mp3 files to the player, you have to sign-in to Napster. This makes all your transfers even slower, as it is communicating god-knows-what about your music library to god-knows who over the net, and possibly adding digital-rights management to the files you already own. Add to the mix a slow connection like my dial-up, and you're in for a long haul just to copy your own music to your own player. Sorry, but this is just too limiting and basically obnoxious. If I own the music I want to hear, I shouldn't have to go home, log on to the internet, wait for Napster to start up and sign me in, and sift through annoying napster pop-up ads... only  to add or change my player's library. Also, I can't use the player at work, since I cannot install or use Napster on my office machine.   Some other problems that bothered me were that the player's controls are clunky. The play/pause/power button often has to be pressed twice to respond, while the back and next buttons are overly sensitive. This made my life difficult when listening to long audio files (I listen to jazz, opera and classical pieces which can be quite long). An accidental brush of the next key skips immediately to the next file, and I'd lose my place in an hour 1/2-long file. Ditto with trying to scan forward or back using these keys... if you don't press hard enough and hold, it would register the command as a skip back or skip next instead. Scanning through files is slow (and constant speed, but it does have a auto scan-lock feature so you won't be losing feeling in your thumb). You'll find that the unit's HOLD switch is absolutely essential.  The interface is workable, but a little clunky. They have tried to make it intuitive, but have omitted any help function to guide you if you get confused. The manual (as per usual in the electronics industry today) is for kindergarden-users only ("to play a file, press PLAY," The End). Only after poking around did I discover that I could access limited file functions (delete, add to playlist, et cetera, but for voice recordings  only). The volume level auto-resets between boot-ups. I often had the volume cranked to hear some mp3s I had recorded at low levels, and the next time I used the unit, the volume would "normalize" to 50% level. This may be a feature, so as to save your ears from being blasted unexpectedly.   Other users have mentioned long boot-up times. This is certainly true, 20 seconds roughly. While this is annoying, it is not uncommon for nearly all the mp3 hard drive players I have tried. I found it worse that it took a long time to shut down. It is easier to simply set the "power off" timer to 30 seconds, then when want to I turn it off I simply hit the pause button.   Another problem is with using the device as a  portable USB drive. You have to use the proprietary connector, and any music files you transfer this way are not playable. They are not updated in the unit's playlists, accessible only through Napster (See my "for geeks only" note below for a technical work-around for this problem). There is also no seperate USB-mini port. You have to use the proprietary connector. Even though the unit will function on battery/USB power, I found that the unit's operational speed was increased greatly when the power adapter was also connected.   Recording is a breeze, and is acutally a little too easy. There is a record button on the side of the unit, which when depressed for more than 2 seconds, sets the unit to recording. To my surprise, I accidentally recorded a lot of stuff without realizing it, because the button is in a spot that makes it easy to hit it by mistake. The soft-touch button is small and you may not notice when it is pressed. Several times, I found that I had activated the record when I pulled the unit in or out of the belt clip. The line-in recordings work well, and let you encode directly to mp3 (max 160 kbps, 44 Mhz). The voice recording always defaults to 32 kbps, but the mic is clear and sensitive. There is a 3-hour (180 minute) file limit to any recording.  Line-in recordings are done through the included patch cable (mini stereo male > micro stereo male). Record levels are decent and controllable on the fly. You can use line-level or headphone-level as input. Headphone-level sources are trickier, since the volume of the output device can overmodulate the record levels.   Lastly, the unit claims to be Windows Media compatible, but it is NOT (despite the manufacturer's claims above). WMP 10 (with the most updated drivers) does not even recognize it, even if the system can see the unit as a USB drive. Tech support at Microsoft also says they have no plans for including this unit in their "Plays For Sure" device interface feature. Interestingly, the package for the Samsung states that one of the system requirements is to have Windows Media Player installed. Why, if the unit isn't recognized by WMP? The answer is that when this model was previewed during the Comsumer Electronics Show last year, it was announced to be WMP compatible... but that must have changed, and perhaps MS rejected the unit as a supportable player. The Samsung's package also mentions nothing of requiring the use of Napster (it only says that it is "Napster compatible"). This means that it must have been a last-minute change of interface software to get around losing WMP certification. So, isn't that false advertising?   As a consumer, I feel angry that I am only told after the purchase that I also have to use software that requires me to register and be bombarded with ads... and I can't use anything else. Neither ITunes nor MusicMatch can recognize the unit, either. It's like buying a TV, and then once you get home you find out that it will only work with one cable company's signal, and you can't even play your DVDs on it without subscribing to that cable service. Deceptive and underhanded, to say the least.  Many of the interface problems can be fixed if only Samsung makes the attempt. The firmware release is 3.01, so I am holding out hope that they are going to continue to improve the functioning of the unit. It still has a chance of being a reasonable iPod-turnative. Dropping the Napster requirement and adding Microsoft WMP compatibility is an absolute MUST (especially since they already advertise it as being so).  Samsung is also seemingly too concerned with appeasing the RIAA to care to make things easy or usable for the consumer.   Are you are listening, Samsung?    Note: For Geeks Only If you are more of a techie, you can overcome the Napster problem by downloading gUSB.exe, a freely-available USB utility for Windows XP (available here: http://winamp.com/plugins/details.php?id=139125). Once installed on your computer, this makes the Samsung's entire drive accessible through the Windows File Explorer. You can then transfer music directly to the (hidden) system folder SYSTEM/MUSIC on the Samsung's drive. But, that in itself won't make the files playable... you then have to run the Samsung's Windows Utility (included with the unit) and select "rebuild the library." This will read the files in the Music folder and add them to the unit's track listing. Likewise, if you delete or rename anything in the Music folder, you have to re-run the utility to re-update the track listing. This is sometimes time consuming, but is still faster than using the Napster software (and you don't have to be online to do it). This also works for the line-in and voice recordings as well. But beware, without using the Samsung utility afterwards, the unit will not operate correctly and will freeze up, requiring a hard-reset (there is a pinhole reset button on the back of the unit). With the gUSB utility, you can also play the files directly from the Samsung's Music folder through any Windows mp3 player (WMP, Winamp, MusicMatch, et cetera). Be very careful not to delete any of the other folders on the unit, otherwise you will have to reformat the unit through the Samsung utility. Also, like any XP drive, you have to "safely remove hardware" or "eject" the disk before disconnecting to avoid losing data and having to reformat.

<Title>Better than iPod Mini
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Smaller than the iPod mini and has a color screen and relatively easy navigation. A little slow to boot up initially, but this is not a detrimental issue. Definitely glad I researched this before plunging into the iCult. I'm not sure what Bill Waff was speaking of below, but the player is indeed WMP compatible and you do not need to be online to manage your library.

<Title>Stinky MP3 Player
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Long story short.....I purchased two of these players, one for my wife and one for me.  My wifes player was defective so I exchanged it for a new one.  Three uses later with her new player and the hard drive crashed.  I returned her second one with my player and got a refund.  I bucked up a few more dollars for an ipod mini and it was worth every penny.  The difference is amazing.  With the Samsung the time it takes to transfer music is painfully slow compared to the ipod.  Just spend the extra $50 on an ipod and save yourself the trouble.  Two defective players out of three....No thanks.  Don't buy this player.

<Title>A fair player
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pro1:  Decent sound with EQ off or on WOW.  You can alter the SRS level, the bass level and the treble/mid (focus) level.  Compared with the parametric EQ on a Rio Karma, optimized for Sony MDRex71 phones, the sound is fine enough, though still a tiny bit short for me.  Also, the sound can saturate and distort easily on low volume when using WOW/SRS or preset EQ settings.  Pro2: It's fairly thin and light for having a color screen.    Pro3: Display is nice, bright and colorful.  Pro4: buttons don't have huge gaps that allow dust under the screen or in other places (at least not yet)  Pro5: recording, mic and line in do work good enough.  Pro6: photo viewer--though I haven't tried it yet.  Con1: While it can act as an USB storage device, the non-standard cable forces you to haul it around.  The cable is also the power cord, though it has a separate AC/DC end for plugging into the wall (also non-standard).  Con2: No bookmarks for multiple saved positions.  With 5GB this should be a given (I want to have several playlists each with their own bookmark).  It does resume position, but only the last one.  Con3: Battery life, due to color screen I presume, is low.  Con4: Startup is slow.  My 20gb Karma starts play in about 5-7 seconds from pushing ON.  The yepp 5gb yh-820mc takes at least twice or more time.  Con5: A playlist can be created on the player, but I see no way to make multiple ones with the included software.  The whole method of playlist creation is a bit confusing too.  Con6: playback options are limited, in terms of selection by album, artist, genre, etc.  A lot of players now let you choose by age, date, etc as well.  Con7: No FM radio, no text reader (the smaller flash player has these)  Con8: mic recordings are only set to 8khz, 32kbps.

<Title>Good Alternative for Ipod
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my unit after trying two different units in home.  I tried the Creative Labs Jukebox(40GB) and then tried another Creative Labs unit.  I stayed with this one because it gave me zero problems.  I like the color screen that the unit has.  Nice and easy software to uplaod photo's to and from the unit.  The player comes bundled with Napster software but the software is not necessary to use th player.  If you read the users manual you will realize that you can also use Windows Media PLayer to transfer music to and from the unit.  It is a fairly fast transfer to the unit if you have USB 2.0.  If you dont have USB 2.0 and are wanting to use the player it is going to be a slow slow process for you.  I filled up the player to full capacity in less than three hours(dont know exact time....I walked away and went to do some other things around the house).  Unlike the Ipod you can delete track by track listing instead of having to erase the whole players memory.  Found that a very cool feature.  I have switched out songs a few times and never experienced one problem in doing so.  When the player gets to full capacity it does run slow(they even tell you this in the manual).  This is a drawback to going with a hard drive based unit in general.  Every HD unit has this problem so if you think you will avoid it by going wiht an Ipod think again.  While using the player I found a few minor problems.  The menu system likes to move slow and seems to get stuck at times.  If you excersise patience when you player this shouldnt present any problems.  I can't seem to get the two second gap in between tracks out.  I listen to techno and this does bother me but I will get over it.  I recommend this player to anyone who wants a better deal than the Ipod.

<Title>No problems here! Great MP3 player
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been using my YH820 for about 2 months now. I think it is a great value for the money.  Pros: 5 Gb for $200. For now, that is a good deal and certainly a value when you consider the other features the 820 provides  Unlike previous reviewers, I had absolutely no problems getting my unit to synch with Windows Media Player. Select your files and send them to your Synch list, then Synch now, and the files get pushed over. I didn't load NAPSTER, as I don't want 3rd party apps cluttering my PC. Originally I didn't load the Samsung software either, but then I had problems getting the JPGs to show correctly after a direct file transfer via filesystem (not saying that it can't be done, its just easier with the native Samsung software)   Accessible via file system (technical saavy required)  Battery life is satisfactory, about 6-7 hours.  Color LCD and ability to display JPGs and slide shows  Unit has a Line-in, and is capable of recording/ripping from external sources (have a portable CD player, and you dont need a pc to rip songs to your device)  SAMSUNG claims that the software and features are upgradeable on the player, as well as 3rd party apps, but I have yet to see any released software or updates.  CONS  Color LCd, still too small to really enjoy the pictures  Proprietary USB connection integrated into charger. Would have liked a standard micro USB connector.  LOOOONG start up time  Hard drive is formatted with FAT32. Over time, this will prove to be a problem as the file system degenerates.  Takes way too long to synch/xfer files.  My first synch was 4.5 GB and took hours.  Overall, I think its great for the price and as a bonus, you get to view pictures (would have been nice to be able to watch WMV's) and record.  I bought it and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Very solid player; after firmware upgrade. 
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: 1.Like the buttons better on the Samsung  then the Creative Labs Zen micro.  The Samsung has a nice pad and I rarely make mistakes with my selections. You always had to put the Zen on hold so that your pants pockets do not change tracks.  Touch pad was way to sensitive and I found myself changing tracks/selections even when handling the device. If the Zen had a similar control method it would have been a keeper.  Stayed away from the iriver H10 for this very reason. 2.The unit plays very loud.  3.The form factor is great.  It has a mix of aluminum and plastic and is very pocketable.  4.The player is compatible with music services that offer music to go (Janus compatible).  This is not the case out of the box.  Samsung had released a firmware upgrade a week ago that makes it compatible with Yahoo unlimited, Napster to go and Rhapsody to go. The three services and CNET.com do not make mention that this player is compatible.  Which is a shame because I would have skipped over this player.  5.Unit has a nice color screen which make menu selections easy to do.  6.The player is a great value.  A 1gb flash player can set you back $150.  I bought this player for $199 at Sams club and it's even cheaper on Amazon and ebay.  7.Firmware upgrade added Janus music support and fixed a few problems.  Before the upgrade it would take 25 to 27 seconds for the unit to boot up and the menu/track selections were not as responsive.  After the upgrade it now takes 15 to 18 seconds and the music selection is faster.   8.Can do line-in and mic recordings. Quality of line recording is good.  9.Did not experience any lockups as reported around the internet on this unit.  So far it has been a solid player especially after the firmware update.   Cons: 1.Battery power is terrible when using the backlight/color display.   2.Unit uses a propritary cable instead of the mini cable.  3.Usb and power cable is consolidated into one.  If I want to charge the unit without having it hooked up to the usb port I have to unplug the cable from the back of my computer.  With the Zen it came with a usb to ac charger and the usb port charged the player when hooked up to the computer. The Samsung left me for dead when I forgot to bring my charger to work.   4.It took a firmware update to get the unit compatible with the music to go sevices.  Go to software updates instead of firmware to get the appropiate firmware. The Zen had the same problem out of the box.  5.Non user replacable battery.  Looks pretty simple to open though.  6.There is no audio sync function (track splitting)when recording via line in with this player.  The input is captured as one continuous mp3.  I have a samsung flash player that handles this function better than this player (choice of 1,3 and 5 second delay and will stop when no sound is present).   7.No custom eq with this unit.  You can select from a few presets.  8.Can not create a new playlist within the player.  So far I can add new playlists using Rhapsody and Napster.  There is one playlist which you can add tracks to.   So far I rate this player higher than the rest of the Micro hard drive players that I have experience with.  I have tried these player first hand and here are the major reasons why I did not go for competition.    Ipod mini - I tunes do not support the music to go which I love so far in Yahoo unlimited and Rhapsody.  This is the main reason for skipping over this player.    Creative Labs Zen - Touch pad is too sensitive.  It was pretty cool during the first day but I got real fustrated when the player would navigate all over the place while handling it.   Iriver H10 - The cost was higher and it has that touch pad in the middle.  The Ipod comes close to being usable but I prefer traditional tactile feedback buttons.   Conclusion: If it wasn't for the firmware upgrade this player would have rated 3 stars.  Maybe with additional firmware upgrades it can get close to a five but it still will have the usb/power cable issue.

<Title>Could be better
<Date>Fri Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an amazing little gadget but falls short, the appealing features include the 5 GB storage, beautiful, trendy fit and finish, very convenient size, affordable price and the fact that it's also a photo viewer.  But the drawbacks will become apparent after a few hours with it, it takes very long to start-up, the navigation is not quick (there is a lag), it doesn't have an FM tuner, the photo viewer feature is really an after thought right now (the pictures are very grainy that is, it just doesn't have the resolution and you can't adjust the time interval between slides), the unit feels delicate and it won't handle rough use and the finish will get scratched in no time (wish it came with a case like that for a cell phone, mine came with a belt clip holder, wish the unit had a loop to hang), I didn't have any issues with software, it worked just fine with Windows Media Player, I didn't have to use Napster.  However the problem I had with it was that the unit would turn itself off for no apparent reason, I mean I will be navigating and it will turn itself off. I called Samsung customer support, they said I probably had a defective file on it and they asked me to reformat and try again, anyway that didn't fix the problem, the unit with no files on it would still shut itself off while navigating.  I think Samsung is getting there but it probably rushed this one to the market. It's an innovative, stylish product and I really liked it to begin with and I wanted it to work.

<Title>Napster is terrible
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall this isn't a bad MP3 player.  The sounds is great and I have no real problem with the controls.  However, for full functionality, the system requires you to use Napster.  You can add or remove tracks with Media Player, but you can't add playlists this way, which is a big drawback.  Napster is just about the WORST program I've ever used.  It is slow, unstable, it requires an internet connection, it has popup ads, and it hogs processor time.  It doesn't even minimize properly.  The box should contain an outright warning that you have to use this terrible program.  Until there is an alternative software, stay away.

<Title>Nice player, but needs more development from Samsung - HDD PROBLEMS!
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>UPDATE: After 3.5 weeks the HDD has died! Now when I turn it on I get an error message saying that the device cannot initialize the HDD and it then automatically turns the player off making it absolutely useless! I have to say I am very disappointed and Samsung had better be prepared to standby their product and replace this. Clearly Samsung needs to review the HDDs that it is putting in these, since at least 2 other reviews here mention the HDD dying. BE WARNED - if you buy this player make sure to keep the receipt for warranty purposes!   ----------------------------- I have only had this for about a week, but so far I like it a lot. It is a huge improvement over carrying my CD walkman to and from University everyday!  A few things could be improved (see below), but this unit does the job well.   Sound quality seems very good and there are multiple preset EQ settings that you can switch between to get it sounding just right. The "WOW" setting can be adjusted to increase the surround effect, "Truebass", and the 'focus' of the sound; which effectively lets you change the EQ settings to how you like them.  Initially I thought I would have to use the Napster software to load any of my own MP3s onto the device, but it turns out that Windows Media Player 10 does the job perfectly without needing to be connected to the internet. The documentation included with the player does not mention using Windows Media Player for this purpose and gives the impression that you have to use Napster. I uninstalled Napster after I found the other way of putting MP3s onto it. I believe the Samsung Multimedia Studio software also allows transfer of MP3s onto the player (as well as pictures), but I have barely used it yet.  Download and install the firmware upgrade before you start downloading files onto it. You will then have to format the drive. It allows you to use MTP services (downloading MP3 files) if you want and I think it makes it less likely to crash.  This MP3 player has great potential for the future if Samsung puts the effort into releasing and tweaking the firmware. I imagine they could create downloadable games, utilities, and further functionality if they put the time into development. The question is: will they bother?  Pros: - Small size - Good looks - Colour screen - Upgradeable firmware - 5Gb hardrive! - Multiple file formats supported - Nice to not be a part of the iPod masses!  Cons: - A couple of freeze-ups (crashes) experienced when trying to 'safely disconnect device' in Windows XP. No biggie though and none during normal playback so far. - Only one firmware upgrade available at the Samsung website. - No accessories available yet. Hopefully this will change as time passes, since a decent protective case would be very useful! (Could use a cellphone cover instead if similar size can be found.) - Ridiculously long startup time with the Samsung logo appearing twice for an unnecessarily long time. Hopefully Samsung will decrease this logo display time and add new functionality with future firmware upgrades. - Screen size is too small to make the picture viewer function much use. - Can be a little slow when switching between folders and files to play.

<Title>It's awful
<Date>Tue Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The device fails at even it's first steps.  I charged it.  Then I allowed it to try and install software that would cost me money for every song.  After 2 reboots it finally decided that it needed to upgrade the firmware of the device.    I took this to be a good sign.  If the manufacturer is getting you on a good firmware version before you load data it can be really helpful.  But the upgrade failed.  The device then asked me to call Samsung.  With a little experimentation I realized it was because the cable doesn't connect well with the device.  But if they can't upgrade the firmware on the first day, the chances of regularly transferring GB of data is very low.    I called the 800 samsung number, and got sent to a very generic slow queue.  After 10 minutes of waiting, knowing that eventually I would just be referred to a complete computer idiot I decided to cut my losses.  I have repackaged the device and will return it tomorrow.  Then I will buy an Ipod Mini for $20 more, 1GB more, and no ability to record messages on the go.  But at least I'll have a device that will play music well.    If you're short on toilet paper, go get $230 in single increments.  You'll be set for 6 months of bowel movements and you'll be better off than if you owned this device.

<Title>What are people thinking?!
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I'd like to say that I have NO idea what anyone here is talking about. I purchased this MP3 player, have loaded over 2000 songs in it, and never ONCE installed napster. the installation of napster is just NOT necessary! i never installed it. i stuck with realplayer, which works VERY well and I am very pleased. I use my mp3 player for hours every day and have NEVER had any problems with it. The only issue I have with it is that it does take about 15 seconds to start it up. But that doesn't make any difference to me. Who needs music to startup right away anyway?! I am not a camera person, but I have used the photo album. I'm pleased with it, but that wasn't the reason I bought it for. In conclusion, this mp3 player is very nice, despite what was said by the crazy people below. And not ONCE have I had an issue with the Hard Drive. This mp3 player might be a little pricy, but if youre willing to spend the amount, the color screen makes it worth it. The headphones included are very acceptable, and I am extremely satisfied with my samsung mp3 player.

<Title>Janus Upgradeable: to be determined
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my first yh-820mc audio player in June and Samsung has had it ever since.  I wish this was an exaggeration, but I've had the first player (or the second player that replaced the first) in my possession for a total of five days.  Even then the player was never capable of handling Janus.  The rest of the time Samsung has been repairing it - apparently, with less than stellar results.  I've spent hours on the phone with their customer service, of course, most of it on hold.  In short, the audio player has been a complete bust.  If you don't care about Janus, perhaps this is the audio player for you.  I would echo that the amount of time the player takes to load on start up does begin irk.

<Title>Terrific mp3 player in my opinion
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great mp3 player as far as I'm concerned.  I bought it refurbished and have had nothing but good things to say so far.  Regarding start-up time: it's faster than my cell phone (LGVX6100).  (Just a thought: must we have our music so desperately that we are unwilling to wait 23 seconds?)  Software: like others, I recommend Windows Media Player, I have v.10, I never even loaded Napster (it's so slow, why bother).  The Samsung is smaller than most competitors, holds plenty of music/files/photos, you can record voice with it - the only feature I miss is the FM transmitter.  Join the non-iPod crowd, it's just as good (if not better, and cheaper) on the other side.

<Title>Work Great For Me!!
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've used this MP3 player for a few months now and have to say its a very nice little unit. I would spring for the extra $20-30 to get an extra warranty. With mine, I swap it out if something goes wrong...no sending it in for repairs. So here's a breakdown of what I think of the Sam-pod... Positive: Great color screen Easy to use Nice size Sounds great Looks great  Negative: Barely get 8 hours on battery Can't use I-Tunes (but Media Player 10 works well) Not many accessories SLOW to start up (as compared to ipod)

<Title>LISTEN TO ME, buying this thing is a regretable decision.
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased a YH-820 in June of 2005. For approximately four months, the device worked perfectly and its features had me convinced this was the best mp3 player ever created. That is what I thought until October of that year. It was in that month that the device's HDD (Hard Drive Disk) crashed and would shut itself off (the screen would state that it could not HDD initialize). The HDD had crashed once before, yet I managed to get the device to operate, just that one time; now, the device refuses to function. Being that I NEVER abused the contraption and I spent $230 on the damn thing, I, of course, was pretty ticked off. And when I say ticked off, I mean that I am PISSED OFF out of my mind. Now, after completely abandoning my faith in Samsung, I am looking to get a new mp3, such as a Creative Zen Micro. To summarize what I have just said, the device has magnificent features that lure you (the customer) into buying the mp3. However, after some time's use, the device's HDD WILL, and I mean WILL, crash on you too. Forget what other people say (for they most likely have just bought theirs and do not suspect anything wrong yet) and forget all the hype (for I once campaigned to promote this device). DO NOT BUY THIS THING. I am trying to warn you so you do not make the same mistake I did. I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. Now, I do not know if this problem has been looked into by Samsung, so you might want to check that out. So my advice is, if Samsung says it has addressed the problem, then give the player a shot, but keep your receipt in the event of future device failure. But, if Samsung says nothing, then DO NOT BUY IT!!!

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned this player for about 6 months now, but have only been using it for about 3.  I was weary of opening the packaging after reading many conflicting reviews about the product - many were thrilled and just as many were utterly disgusted.  I decided to suck it up and deal with the consequences of my purchase should any arise and I must say that I am quite pleased with my purchase.  I have no complaints other than the start-up time and possibly with th transfer spped.  The latter however may be due to the fact that I was loading 4 gb of music in one sitting and that naturally is going to take more than an instant.    If you are looking for a user friendly product that is pleasing to the eyes and can deal with a few extra seconds of startup time as well as WMP 9 or above, then by all means this is the product for you.  Should I encounter problems with the player I will be sure to post again or edit this one... happy searching.

<Title>Started good, but crashed!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I guess I wasn't the only person who brought one (for a hefty fee and even a bigger warranty fee, that I regretfully turned down) I purchased it in March and almost needless to say to worked great and made a great jogging buddy also, but around May when I went to upload files the computer said they uploaded fine, but I wasn't able to find them at all in the player, it was like if they wear never uploaded.  Even though the player would occasionally freeze up (typically when you select songs to fast) it happened more often and I would haft to get a pen to restart it from the back, till one day (after attempting to "repair" and even "recover" the device and library) it began giving me this "HDD system will shut down" something along those lines, and it would turn off, and it keep doing this and to this day it doesn't work.  Samsung is pretty darn hard to get a hold of for technical support, your pretty lucky if you did. I agree Samsung needs to address this issue if they already haven't since iam not only one this has happened to, this is to expensive of a device to just have crash on you like that. If your going to get the device, get the warranty at least!.- A very dissatisfied customer!, that now has a $210 defective mp3 player.

<Title>Peice of Freakin Crap
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me tell you about my little experience with this bastard of all MP3 players. This thing would be considered the uncle no one talks about at the Family Reunion.  A year ago I buy it. I am on deployment I finnally get it after about 2 months. (No fault of anyones. Mail takes alot of time when your in the middle of the ocean.) I get it I hook it up to my laptop and start downloading MP3's to it. Works for a few days then the HDD crashes. A month later pull into the states for a port visit and I send it to Samsung for repair. 3 Months later I get back from deployment. I get it back, I plug it up and start downloading MP3's to it. This time it doesn't even finish the download. HDD crashes in the middle of it.  Send it off for a new one.  Got a new one.  NOw the little son of a B*%#& freezes up on start up 60% of the time and I have to make sure I carry a paper clip with me if I have it on me.   Currently I am sending it back to Samsung and they are cutting me a check for the price of it. Samsung makes good cameras but the MP3 player freakin sucks.

From going to songs to songs it has a bit of a lag. But otherwise this mp3 player is alright. If you dont want to pay the $150-$300 for and Ipod then you should definatly consider this mp3 player

<Title>Horrible Beyond Repair
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>*This is the same review I wrote on another site.*  Pros: 5 GB storage great for me, Color screen makes for great interface, can play all MP3 and WMA files  Cons: Hard Drive CONSTANTLY crashes, Slow doing ANYTHING, Most files do not work first time sent, and you must rebuild the library after every session.   When I was looking to buy a new player, I looked to Samsung. They made my first MP3 player, a YP-T5v (256 Meg). That player worked wonderfully for over a year, but I needed more space for my music.  The chaos began the day after it came.  The first day I had it, it was wonderful. It worked just fine with the 25 songs I put on there the first time. The next day I plugged it in to transfer more music, all the files I transferred to it showed up on Windows Explorer, but not on the player itself. Deleting the files on windows Explorer caused the files to remain on the player too. Reformating didn't solve it, so I called Samsung, where a very nice representative said I got a lemon. This was no big deal. They even provided a shipping label so I didn't have to pay for shipping.  However, The representitive said to "put your name, address and phone number, and RMA number on a piece of paper INSIDE the box" The box was returned "no RMA" I called Samsung, and they said to put it on a piece of paper on the OUTSIDE of the box. They provided me with a shipping label, and I sent it back.  The replacement one worked for about 2 weeks, but not reliably, it would freeze if you tried to play another song while a song was playing by pressing next. If I tried to add music to it (by using any program or even drag and dropping), it wouldn't show them as options to play, and you had to turn off the player, hold the next (FF) button, then connect it to the computer while still holding the next button, then load the "recovery utility" and click rebuild library. This took about 10 minutes with 30 songs. Afterwords, click the "safely remove hardware" button on the Windows toolbar and disconnect. Then press the play button, and wait about 45 minutes with player just saying "samsung" and it will eventually boot and play. But even then a song marked as one thing will actually be something else when it plays. EX when I went to play the song marked "love shack" it would play "so cold". Then the device gave up and randomly displayed "HDD could not initialize and the device will shut down". I called Samsung asking for a replacement of another model. They said that would be fine, and they said to fax the reciept to them and they'd get back in 3-5 days. A month went past, I called them back. The first person said "They had not made up their minds on the trade". I called back the next person said that they called during the 3-5 day period, and I was approved. He set me up with a shipping label, and I shipped it out. A week later, I got a package with ANOTHER YH-820.  On this one, it worked for about 5 files, then every other file it froze at. Then it displayed "Firmware corrupted, please repair it in the recovery utility". But when it was plugged in, windows wouldn't detect it, and the recovery utility said it "no device detected, please connect the player and try again."  I called back, the representitive said that the model I asked for was considered a "downgrade" (5GB to 2GB), and that they refused the trade, and sent me another YH-820.  At that point, I was promissed a refund and I sent my MP3 player back for the 4th time and am expecting the money soon (they said 2-3 weeks).  NONE OF THESE PLAYERS WAS EVER DROPPED OR MISTREATED IN ANY WAY, not even a scratch.  Maybe I just got unlucky with 3 players in a row, but that seems EXTREMELY unlikely.  If you get a good one, then it seems like a great player, but not reliable at all.  One side note, what I mean by it was slow doing anything, I mean that startup, transferring files, navagation, and switching songs was SLOW. Transferring one file required about a minute where it said "transferring" then about about 5 seconds where it accually transferred, then another minute to finish (on explorer). Switching between songs took about 10 seconds per song.   This is all on the most recent firmware and drivers, on a windows XP computer.

<Title>Been almost flawless for me.  Upgrade your firmware people!  
<Date>Sun Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player because I was looking for a little more storage for some of my MP3's.  I didn't want to spend too much money either, so when I saw a refurb model for $119 I jumped on the chance.  Most of the problems people are having can most likely be attributed to not having the proper firmware.  Until I got the right firmware I had maddening amounts of problems just getting music on the device.  Keep in mind that the firmware on Samsung's site is NOT going to help.  I must recommend that the first you do is Google Plays For Sure, and you will get the site that has the most recent firmware, which also improves the battery life tremendously.  Then, using WMP 10, file transfer is very painless and VERY fast.  You can even set it up so that you can automatically sync your playlists onto the device, although I find this annoying.  Once the files are on the device, you can create playlists, play shuffled, all the good stuff.  The sound quality can be tweaked to sound excellent, much better than any MP3 player I've heard.  The color screen is a nice touch.  PROS: Excellent price Very compact Excellent sound quality Sleek looks Nice color screen, picture ability  CONS: Doesn't seem to play WMA's encoded at 900+ kbps (won't be a problem for most) Almost unusable until you get the proper firmware/updates  All in all I would recommend this device, don't be suckered into thinking that Ipod's are your only option.

<Title>If you want something to fail you every time, then THIS is your player!
<Date>Sat Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think the people who submitted their responses before me basically tell my story as well.  I encountered the SAME problem, had to resend it back 3 FRICKIN times (and I had to pay for the shipping), and on the third time, I never even made it to play anything on it.  As soon as I turned it on, I got a screen telling me there was an error, and to run the repair utility that came on cd-rom with the device.  Needless to say, I ran it some, oh 10+ times, each to no avail.  That same time, a small slip of paper was included telling me to hold the forward button down to connect it to the PC.  NONE of it worked.  (And I thought you couldn't go worse than the Ipod!)  If the device didn't constantly crash, and I didn't spend precious time that could've been devoted to more music listening on the phone with their customer service getting new RMA numbers, then my score for the device DEFINITELY would've been more.  Although it lacked a FM player (not a biggie, not a big listener), the sound quality was excellent, and the headphones supplied were a perfect compliment to the able capabilities of the machine.  I never made use of the picture viewer, but did appreciate the colour screen, nevertheless. Hopefully Samsung has learned from the mistakes made with this device with their new line of mp3 players.  I'm not willing to take the chance though.  I think I'll consider the iRiver, or perhaps the Creative Zen Vision.  At least their users don't complain of constant "HDD failure" :)

Yes, it does freeze sometimes..but never had major issues with mine. However, that was a new one. I just had to buy the reman one as I no longer have my new one! So we'll see how bad this reman one is...  But it's worth the freezing for being able to record sets out of a mixer with such a small unit.

<Title>Great little player!
<Date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It looks like some reviewers have had problems with the product.  I originally purchased the product at Target and had great luck it played real well and no freeze ups or any thing else like that.  The only little drawback was that it does take a while to load but not that long for me.  I have used the voice recorder with the cord and got excellent results, as good as CD quality.  Never got to use the picture function because I didn't purchase it for that function.  The MPS player doesn't have a FM receiver but it does say that in the produce description so that wasn't an issue for me as that was a feature I didn't need.  The device saves your place at the last song you listen to and with random play initiated you go for quite a while, as long as you have several songs in the player, without repeating a song you heard earlier even with turning it off and turning it back on.  This player is a good alternative to the I pod and much cheaper that their 5GB model.  The one other drawback is that it only reads MPS files not WMA files but with either Windows Media Player or Musicmatch Jukebox offered by Dell that really isn't a problem.
