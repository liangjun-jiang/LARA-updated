<Content>I bought this for travel, but have used for walking and everything else. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is only one way to charge it, and if you want it to last its max time (about 3.5 hrs.) you must let it charge up for about that long and refrain from doing a lot of clicking and selecting while in play mode. The radio works pretty well, but uses A LOT of energy to use. The sounds are clear and crisp and it is just the cutes thing! It also holds up to like 30 songs and regular files also. I think for the price and all you get you can't beat it with any other MP3 player.

<Content>My boyfriend wanted this mp3 player so bad since it is the smallest mp3 player made. I personally find it is too small and i would not buy if for myself but he says that he likes it for when he is at the gym. The only problem he finds with it is that the screen goes off to fast and when you are in sunlight you cant see anything written on the screen. Apart from these two problems he finds it perfect and likes it a lot.

<Content>got this mp3 player about 2 days ago, im pretty impressed by the size and audio quality. a 30min charge can last u the rest of the day. it works well and is great for the gym, however there are a few cons.   -it is almost impossible to see the screen in sunlight  - theres no way of knowing when it is fully charged as the battery keeps showing that it is fulling up but never actually reaches full   - comes with a cd thats completely useless and unneeded   - using the radio completely kills the battery and the thing goes off without any warning  apart from the above mentioned its definately worth your money  
<Overall>3
