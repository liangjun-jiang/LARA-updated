<Content>equals no sale. Closed system that excludes me is more "proprietary" than iTunes/iPod combo. You are not forced to use iTunes to use your iPod, any CD can be ripped to it. You are not forced to use a particular OS for your computer either, with an iPod. Not so with this wanna-be. Zen-casting? give me a break!  no zero star option available

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for my son this christmas. He likes it but finds it too bulky and no way near as easy to operate as his cousins iPod video. He's swithcing to the iPod as soon as he sells the Creative. I must say that the video on the creative is very good looking. Sharper than on Apples iPod. But keep in mind that the Zen is a portable videodevice and the iPod is a MP3 player with videocapabilities. It's NOT a Video iPod. Maybe something will incarnate at Macworld !

<Title>Blows Apple Away
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has it all of over Apple's Ipod.  More importantly it is getting more and more obvious that Apple Fanatics (probably shareholders) go around and give every non-Apple product only one star and then make up some ridiculous negative review.   But the worm is about to turn for Apple as the competition is now coming up with superior products at better price points.  Which brings me to the new Creative M.     Superior battery life, FM Radio free (not a $50 add on like the Apple)and wider compatibility.  Enough said.

<Title>Solid features give plenty of bang for the buck, excellent PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off let me say I have experimented with the iPod Video (friend got it for Xmas) and generally liked it. Just for my needs, it wasn't the right choice. I use XP mainly and wanted more video and song compatibilty options. After much research (iAudio X5, iPod Video, and others) the Vision:M came out on top. Now that I've received mine and had a chance to play with it some, I think it's obvious by some of the alleged "reviews" posted by obvious iPod fans, they really haven't even tested this excellent unit.   Some highlights: 1- works with the subscription based music services, which was high on my list. iTunes may someday offer this option, but at least for now does not. I like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player (PMP). Sound quality for music is very good, with an EQ to tweak to individual tastes.  2- video quality is top notch, with several different formats supported. It was quite easy to transfer recordings from my Snapstream PVR setup on the PC to the Vision:M, so now I have several episodes of The Simpsons, Scrubs, and 60 Minutes to watch during trips. Nice.  3- The menu navigation is just like the Creative Zen Micro, and I think most people will get the hang of that relatively quickly. It's not perfect but I had it pretty much down in the initial hour of playing around with the unit.  OTHER INFO: I haven't had a chance to play video for a long stretch to determine true battery life, but specs and reviews on sites like CNET indicate it is about 4 hours for video and 14 or so for music. That is plenty for me. iPod is more in the 2-3 hour range for video.  As for size, I've seen some who make a big deal that it is thicker than the iPod Video. However, the Zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand. I have no problem at all with the size. It's plenty small.  I've noticed some people claim Creative has ripped off iPod for the look, but really, the Creative Zen Micro MP3 player (about 2 years old) is what struck me as a near replica as far as size/design goes. Similar to iPod Video, sure. But far closer to Creative's already long established MP3 player.  Features like microphone recording, FM play and record, Outlook calendar / contacts compatibility, etc. are nice little bonuses but weren't a real factor in my selection criteria.  With the upcoming vast increase in choices for video, podcast and music download availability (as evidenced by recent announcements at CES and elsewhere), the Zen Video:M should be a great choice for anyone who rates features/quality over the "hipness" factor iPod currently has over the masses. I give Apple credit for how they achieved their iPod success with great marketing and a solid product, I just think if you do your research you may end up choosing the Video:M as well. I wouldn't hesitate at all to steer a Windows XP user to it.  P.S. Tested out the ZenCast feature (in beta as of my writing) and it shows promise as a way to collect video and audio podcasts from a centralized location.   Creative Zen Video:M gets a big thumbs up from me...

<Title>Just trying to even things out.
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey I think the ipod line of products are fantastic! I think apple is doing some really great stuff. The fact of the matter is that Creative and other companies are doing great stuff too. The zen vision:m is an example of this. Why cant both products be good at the same time?!  Of coarse the reason I chose the zen vision:m is because of its ability to play multiple formats of video. I also have a subscription with napster to download all the music i want for 14 bucks a month. I do not like the iTunes interface and setup...but thats just me. I think that some people are better off with iPods (mainly the people who dont have a clue about technology). I also think that the 2hours of video on the iPod video is not enough for me...again this is not true for everybody. The zen vision:M gives a solid 4 hours of video playback time. Hopefully more people can come to love both products instead of sending hate one way!

<Title>Quality lacking
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this one for Christmas. After using it for a few weeks, it's going back and getting replaced with an iPod. My wife has the iPod, and it is much easier to use than the Creative. The Creative certainly is not as easy to use as the iPod, and it also feels as though it is not made as well. You can pretty much tell after using them side-by-side that this is Creative's attempt at copying the iPod. They do a good job of making it look similar, but it just doesn't stack up to the quality of the iPod.

<Title>A lil dissapointing, but I don't think anyone else could have done much better
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now, I don't see the hype between the iPod video and Creative Zen vision.  I can see why some people love iPod and can think that the creative is just a rip-off.  Well it is not a rip-off, because that's what companies do.  Competition is a vital factor in advancing our race.  Here, I'll do some pros and cons  Pros for creative: -Vivid screen, very nice colors, the iPod video screen is not so good -Compatible with most video codecs when the iPod is not (see specs above) -2 hours more battery lfie for video than iPod -a few more hours of music playback than iPod -When connected to the computer via USB, the battery charges using the USB power -Well made in my opinion, pretty sturdy, however I don't wanna try dropping it. -Connects to the TV and works perfectly (I tried it with a previous AV cable made by panasonic for my video camera) -Great sound quality -DOES NOT CONVERT MUSIC FILES TO AAC.  MUSIC FILES CAN BE DUPLICATED -You can change the background to any image you have on the creative -You can zoom in onto pictures quite nicely -Dubbed the iPod killer   Cons: -A bit bulkier (I don't mind, since it is pretty small to me anyways -Battery cannot be removed and voids the warranty when it is opened -Navigation is different, not hard.  People that are use to the iPod will always think highly of iPod's navigation system -Converting video is slow but I don't think iPod's is any better -The power plug is kinda big and im a bit confused why it comes in 2 pieces -The back is not black as well, I would have liked the back of the creative to be black as well as everything else including the cables etc -The video seek is slow, but I'm thinking that because it is a hard drive and not a flash drive.  I highly doubt any other hard drive based media player can be any faster -$30 over the price of the iPod video 30 gb, but it costs money is your a pc user in order to connect  I can add some more later after I use the Creative Zen Vision: M a lil more.   Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.

<Title>A real Vision M Review...
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>****Updated Review**** 1/17/2006 (original below)  I've installed Windows XP as a dual boot on one of my machines. I was able to install the Zen Vision M and Creative Media Source software without any issues. I also successfully installed WMP10 without issues.  While I was getting my pc ready to install XP I played with the player to see what I could do with it alone. I figured out how to quickly adjust the settings using the slide and tap paradigm. The Zen Touch has a similar paradigm but the Vision M extends it, the touch pad actually has left and right clicks as well. After a bit of frustration I realized that sliding through menu's should always be done with the finger on the surface of the pad, if you lift and reseat your finger the player would interpret that as a "tap" and thus commence whichever setting you happened to be on when you were sliding..I did this a few times before I got the hang of the slide and tap. Also, it took a few minutes to figure out how to enable submenu options using the lower right icon. Once I was up to speed (took about 10 minutes WITHOUT consulting the sparce instruction book) I quickly went through the task of selecting my name for the player, adding a background (I used one of the samples provided in the picture section), setting the date and time. I then moved on to checking out the radio feature, you can set the device to "auto" scan and it works perfectly. It picked up and preset every station inside of 10 seconds, awesome! I live in a basement apartment and I was suprised at how clean the signal was coming from the radio from such a small (read: tiny FM antenna) device. The next thing I wanted to try was recording, from the radio I was able to enable recording, the sub features are really very intuitive. Again, I did this all without consulting the book within a space of 20 minutes. The hardest part was the first 10 minutes of getting used to the slide and tap paradigm. Now on to the XP experience...  I finally got XP up and running, I installed the software and fter the obligatory reboot, I plugged the port doc into the player and connected the mini usb plub into the doc and the doc into the pc's USB port. Within seconds, the sync screen flashed on the player and the pc reported the synch process had been started. The Vision M software loaded up and showed my connected player fine.  The layout is very intuitive and nice, the inards of the device were layed out by category (music,video,recordings..etc.) and subcategories and folders where necessary. I could freely create or delete subcategories under the main categories. I am still miffed as to why this functionality couldn't have been provided in basic form for every known OS but only Creative and Microsoft have the answer to that riddle.  I proceeded to upload a ripped album ( I have several hundred cuts waiting to go on the player) unfortunately, I have USB 1.1 on the box I installed the XP on so the transfer is not as fast as it could be but it is acceptable. The entire folder of 14 mp3's took about 4 minutes to copy to the player. I tested a cut, the sound quality is really excellent. ( I rip at 192kbps)  Now that I have gone through the inconvenience of installing windows XP just to use it, I am very happy with the player itself. It is a shame that broader OS support isn't in place but that should be easily rectified with firmware upgrades (are you listening creative????). As much as I'd love to give the player a 5, the pain I went through to get it to work really demands something lower but not quite a 4. Hmm....I guess I'll have to give Creative the nod, after using the player now for a week I am  really impressed with it's performance in all areas. So 5 stars it is (this should tell you just how good the player is despite the hell I went through to start managing media on it).  Player highly recommended but make sure you have XP!     **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006** **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006**  How some are claiming to have this at Christmas time in the US when it wasn't even available until this week is telling of the mental disturbances behind some peoples needs to assert the superiority of products they prefer because of one one manufacturer or another. Sad.  That said, here is my real world review of the Creative Vision M. I just took possession of it today, UPS came through 2 days as promised by Amazon.  Previous player experience:  I have used a few other mp3 players but have never owned one until now. I've used the Apple Nano, Ipod Video and the Creative Zen Touch.  Packaging and box:  The box is well designed and sturdy, a sleave and box design gives it a artsy touch, however it makes it more difficult to get at the player..no matter it's just a box.  Player and contents:  Upon taking out the parts I enjoyed the well built and finished look of everything. The cables , port adapter and the player itself are very well made. Contrary to what some have said, the size of the player is quite small in my medium sized hands. I wouldn't want it any smaller, it fit in my hand comfortably and was a lot lighter than the Zen Touch which I bought for my ex girlfriend last Christmas. In comparison to the Ipod Video it's about twice as thick but weighs and "feels" about the same. In the hand they feel similarly, so all talk of the weight/size being a drawback is bunk or those complaining need to do hand strengthening exercises ;) The surface of the player is very cool, much like the Ipod video the black (the one i got) surface is glossy. After charging the battery (takes 2 hours) I turned it on, the screen is quite beautiful to behold with rich vibrant colors. In comparison to the Ipod Video, though technically the M has more colors both have enough that video on them looks amazing, I guess I'd have toplay something on both that stretches the gamut of the players to see which is better.  Software Installation?:  The first major issue I ran into with the player was installation of the software. First, Creative includes a warning card indicating that Quicktime versions 7.0 and 7.0.2 will crash the installation so you should upgrade first to 7.0.3 (which fixes the bug) or uninstall Quicktime, install the Creative software then install Quicktime again.  This isn't the deal breaker however, the insurmountable problem for me is that I use windows 2000 and windows 2003. I don't have XP on any of the 8 running pc's in my home/business network. I own an IT business and have no use for the annoying "features" of Windows XP, why Creative didn't think to maximize software support to as many OS's as possible is beyond me (actually it is not I have some ideas..). Beyond that, why the player just doesn't attach to any pc using the USB port as a drive is also inexcusable.  ****Creative! wake up, many , many users still are on windows OS's that are not XP and if a thumb drive can auto doc without software surely your $330 player should be able to as well!!!****  Now that said, I had to figure out how to add content to my player. I figured Creative has to have software available for windows 2000 so I decided to contact customer support to find out. Page 2 of the "product information guide" indicated that customer support services are located on the installation cd in the "support" folder, I explored the CD and found the english phone number on the "customer support service center" page.  For service in the U.S. in english (french,brazilian,spanish numbers also available):  405 742 6622  I called the number expecting a long wait time, 2 minutes turned to 5, 5 to 10...and then I realized the number was long distance, "complementary" service should always be on a 1 800 number other wise it is not really complementary is it???. The nerve of Creative to call this so called "complementary" service. I hung up quite pissed off. I figured maybe I'll have more luck at the website. I went to www.creative.com/support/downloads , and tried to select my product from the list, of course there is no listing for the brand new "vision m" player.  Now I was really seeing red, how can a company release a product for sale and then not provide the necessary support services??!!. Not one to give up (ever) I decided to see if anyone with my issue had posted to the public forums (always the best place..should have done this straight away)..I went to the mp3 player forums page and queried "vision m and windows 2000" and the results were not encouraging at all, of the 8 total posts that referenced the words together, only 1 had ANY replies. (I guess the Creative support team is keeping away from answering legitimate customer complaints about this issue???)  I dug into the only thread that had responses hoping a solution to my problem would be found there in.  http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=pmc&message.id=4967  Bad news was waiting, only one post was by a Creative moderator and they offered no help at all. I do have a copy of windows XP on site that came with my Dell Laptop, back then I immediately ripped out the XP and put the more functional windows 2000 on. The idea of installing XP is anethema to me just to use the player really sucks. If I didn't have XP I would have no choice but to return the player! There is no way I would give M$ $100 bucks just because Creative has a secret deal to lock us into M$ proprietary protocols.  The most egregious aspect of this situation is that the older players (Zen Touch I bought for ex) did support 2000 in file mode, why Creative went the restrictive route of only supporting the Micro$oft proprietary protocol exclusively has something probably to do with some "relationship" they struck with MS no doubt. It really stinks, here I am unable to use the device on my desired OS. I am seriously debating weather I should just send it back or if I should install XP on a box JUST to use my $330 mp3 player. (which is a pretty deck of card size brick otherwise)  Conclusion:  ***WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, IF YOU HAVE ANY OPERATING SYSTEM OTHER THAN WINDOWS XP , YOU CURRENTLY CAN NOT USE THE VISION M TO DOWNLOAD OR MANAGE MEDIA. IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 98,ME, NT, 2000, MAC OS, YOUR ARE DEAD IN THE WATER.***  Hopefully with enough of a stink being made of this ridiculous situation Creative will move to provide a firmware update that provides the WIDE OS support that existed PRIOR to this NEW product. The player itself works fine, the sample videos that were on it played with excellent clarity and color, the sound was excellent. The touchpad was a bit sensitive on first touch but that was rectified by turning down the sensitivity in the settings. However, the OS support severely hampers my ability to give this player a top rating. In fact I would have given it a 5 if it just worked with my OS but it doesn't (not even as a removable drive..come on Creative even a $30 USB thumb drive can do that!!!) so I will have to take the rating down 4 points to a 1 out of 5.    ...now I'll have to find that old copy of windows XP lying around to grudgingly install it on one of my boxes.

<Title>Best MP3 player out in the market
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got mine last week so i'll just try to list some pros and cons  Pros  - the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the iPod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better) - sound quality is also better, this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic.  I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today(i am a former 3rd G ipod owner) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store, then switched it with the Creative ones. The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass, as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ, whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound. Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life, Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours. - though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, IMO the size is perfect, it's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do  Cons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it's easier to press - no "on the go playlist" like the ipod, if there is i haven't found out how to do it yet  i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. It was the first mp3 player I've ever gotten, and as long as it keeps working, probably the last.   First of all, it is extremely durable. I'm really hard on electronics, but this thing can take a beating. I've dropped it a few times (once into a bathtub full of water... while it was playing) and the only show of abuse is the corner is cracked and it sometimes has a tendency to freeze if it gets too warm. As long as I'm careful, it's not a problem.  The best thing about it is all the space. I have over 1000 songs, 51 videos (mostly short ones I've taken myself, some music videos and some classic Ren and Stimpy cartoons), and almost 800 songs, plus two gb set aside as removable storage... and I have 20 gb left.   Aside from music, video and picture viewing, it can take short voice recordings, has an FM radio (with pretty good reception, too. I can get channels that my stereo can't pick up), removable storage up to 8 gb like I said earlier, and an date planner. I've never used that feature, since it has to be done on the computer, and I don't need it anyway.   The only really negative things I can think to say about it is that the battery doesn't last as long as it says it should, and the touch pad, even on the lowest setting, is a little too sensitive sometimes. Also I think the screen is a little too bright, even on it's lowest setting. The size is a little bulky as well, but for the for the amount of storage space it gives you, it's worth it. And it also tends to freeze, but I just put that down to me dropping it a bunch of times.   I don't know how it compares to an iPod, since I've never used one, but I think this player is worth every penny.

<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is amazing.  If you are a PC user, and not in need of the "baby-me" features of the iPod this is for you.  Personally I like the product most because it requires no proprietary software to transfer data to the device.  Just plug it in, and drop in the music.  I have had it for about a year now, dropped it a few times on subway platforms... I dont baby it- and it has proved extremely rugged.  Tales of the screen easily scratching (to a point of unusability) are just that - tales.  The controls are a little sensitive, but it is a small price to pay when you consider the limitiations of the zune and especially the iPod.  If you want something pretty buy the iPod.  If you want something rugged and functional, with very good sound quality GET THE ZEN!

<Title>Not for iSheep - Zen Vision: M == Death Knell for iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Multiple Formats. Multiple Functions.  Better Screen.  Better Battery Life.   Bye bye Mr. Jobs.  Creative's Zen Vision: M has been released stateside and with it ends Apple's reign of sleek yet mediocre HDD mp3 players.  Ignore all the bad reviews posted about getting Vision: M's in the states before early January.  Unless these people imported theirs from Singapore they're simply iPod-fanboys lying through their inordinately white teeth.  Finally the audio world can awaken from the delirium placed upon it by Apple's continued ludicrous drive toward form over function.  Got mine yesterday and I can already claim it's better than any iPod I've ever used.   Hey look, an MP3 player that looks great and actually doesn't treat me like a retarded child with 400USD in one hand and a pacifier in the other.  Boo hoo!  No Mac support!  Now that Apple has finally kowtowed and is using Intel chips in their machine, the noose just got a little tighter around its brand loyal drones.  Wake up!  PC has been the more versatile and functional platform for years.  It's no coincidence that the Vision: M is as well over Apple's mp3 player, the iPod.

<Title>Stop comparing this to an ipod!
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading reviews over and over, and almost all of them compare this to an ipod, why?  is it because they look alike? well look at creatives past models, they all look similer to this, including the touch pad.  Creative did NOT steal this look from apple!  It is the generic look for hardrive players.  I also recall that creative and rio were the creators of mp3 players almost, not apple...  This costs more than an ipod because of the technical specs, and the screen resolution.  The screen resolution is twice of what the ipod can display, and 4 times the color.  Also this can plays wma (which is more common than aac), mp3 and wav.  Ipods use aac, mp3 and wav.  With the video, this can hold wmv, avi, divx, xvid, mpeg2, mpeg4, and m4v.  The ipod can only play mpeg4 and m4v.  Also, the creative vision m comes with the wall charger, and apple charges $30 for thiers.  One more thing... This is the vision m, which means it is a decendant of the vision, which is in a totally different class than the ipod!  The ipod is mostly for music where as the vision is a portable media player.  Yes I realize this is a comparison of the ipod, but the point was to prove that creative didn't just pop this out because apple put out the ipod video, these things take work to put out.  And they already had portable players that could utilize all these, and that this is just a smaller version of them.  Creative even had their PMC out for over a year before apple brought out the ipod video.  I apologize for the ramblings, and no I have no hands on experience of this player, except that of creatives older generation players, which are superb.  I don't mean to talk down to the ipod because it is infact a nice player, but this thing over shadows it by a loooooong shot.  Also, you people who love ipods so much can thank toshiba for supplying their hard drives.

<Title>I LOVE THE ZEN M!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My 14 year old techy son received the 30g IPOD for Christmas.  I purchase my ZEN yesterday.  He was begging me to pay the restocking fee and return his IPOD, unfortunately the Apple store only allows 14 days for returns.  I do find it odd that the Zen wasn't available till now in the US, after our Christmas season, middle of January at which time all who may have rec'd IPODS for Christmas couldn't return their IPODs if they chose. Even the salesperson who helped me at Frys returned his IPOD and purchased this, lol  Notable differences:  better screen quality, better programming, being able to download from several sites, doesn't SCRATCH as easily as the IPOD!!! The radio is awesome! Recording from the radio is very, very, very good, not excellent though...but hey, I will still definately use this feature.    The ZEN box states *15,000* songs, the IPOD 30g states *7500* songs (the 60g IPOD states *15,000* songs) I am a little confused about this, you would think that both  the 30g IPOD and 30g ZEN would state the SAME.  The recorder is pretty darn good, I just purchased a digital recorder two days ago for $100. and now will return.  This is a valuable feature for all those college kids!  I am very excited to be able to record my classes, come home and burn onto CD's!!!!forget tapes, a thing of the past!!!!    Needless to say, I am tickled pink about this Zen M, and yeah, I probably woulda purchased the Pink one if it were available yesterday, but all they received were the black ones.  lol  I purchased the IPOD 30g for each of my 3 children for Christmas, my kids in turn surprised ME with one....having done my homework, cuz lets face it, kinda pricey toys....I read up on the Zen, customer service @ Creative informed me that it wouldn't be available in the US till 1-15, so I let all the kids make up their own mind, they of course couldn't wait...."I" however, being older and thus wiser, returned mine, and waited.....well worth the wait!!1!!

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this player for a few days.  Previously had the Zen Sleek.  This is a great model.  The screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy/clear.  They really did a nice job with the touch pad this time.  It has a great feel.  It also works flawlessly with Yahoo Music Unlimited.  My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll pad are very, very stiff.  Perhaps this is unique to my player.  But it is a little annoying having to press down so hard.

<Title>I now own 2 Vision:M players
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had ordered one of the players as a gift for a family member, then realized how difficult it appeared to get them, so I ordered another from a second source.  I received the first unit as promised.  I immediately started loading this on it.  It's a little thicker than the iPod, but I actually like how it feels in my hand better (IMHO).  The screen is beautiful, the file formats that are supported are great, the integration with WMP10 and the on-line stores is certainly better than the iPod.  I just love it.  I loved it so much, that when the second unit arrived, I decided to keep it for myself :)  I have used iPod many times before and I do like them.  But they can coexist and the competition will make all the players better.  If you love the iPod's great.  Again, I like them too, but right now I would pick this player.  I have synched up CD music, on-line songs, even a bunch of my TiVo shows (via Tivo To Go TTG).  I have taken those shows and played them directly on my TV too (with an A/V cable).  The currently availability of accessories is a bit frustrating, but livable - I am sure it will not match or surpass the iPod in that respect.    Like the iPod and other devices like this the screen scratches pretty easily.  I immediately bought some Palm protectors and cut them to fit.  I have customer shields ordered (from theinvisibleshield.com) but this will do for now.  This FM radio works fine.  I personally like one integrated.  It doesn't take any more space and it's nice on rare occasion.  I have read other reviews that say having the FM radio is a "negative" of this player.  Huh?  Why?  If you don't want it, just don't use it.  There is a reason why this little player just won the overall best of the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  Even my friends that have iPods snap their heads when they see this.  But again, this shouldn't be a religious discussion of iPods vs. non-iPods.  Buy what you like best and suits your use.    This one suits mine.  I am even thinking about buying a third one.  Why?  I don't want to share mine (or my wife's) with the kids LOL

<Title>Simply Amazing
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Zen Vision: M a few weeks ago.  I had first contemplated ordering an iPod, but simply hated itunes, and was skeptical about this.  My last mp3 player was a Zen Jukebox, but I found it to be a bit too bulky.  Right out of the box I had an easy time transferring all my files onto the player.  Putting videos was simple, and video conversion was not a hassle.  The screen is absolutely beautiful and it has impressive battery.  I actually prefer its controls to the ipods simple click wheel.  Instead of constant scrolling I can just use the letter listing menu on the side, search for a specific song, or hold down to scroll.  It feels good, small and sturdy, in your hand.  I especially like the recording and FM radio features, particularly useful for recording class lectures.  Overall this is a great product and simply amazing.

<Title>A great product for technophiles everywhere.
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Tired of all this Apple lifestyle propaganda?, sick of all these Apple's true believers with their childish zealotry?, then this gizmo is for you.   Creative hits the spot with multiple video format support but still no Ogg Vorbis format support for audio which according to recent conducted tests reigns in quality above all other formats and no support for free lossless audio formats like FLAC & Wavpack which absolutely rule in the audiophile world. Seems the industry doesn't want to support these superior audio formats because of their open/free and no drm'd nature.  Nevertheless,this product is the current King in its category,it simply ravishes Apple's Ipod line with more features/more value,i wont supply more info on this,just read the reviews in various dap sites.  The only flaw i find for this product is its clonish look with Ipod,but taking into account the momentum the Ipod has in consumers psychology it seems Creatives decision to drop an original interface and copy the Ipods is somewhat justified.  I believe Creative used Sigmatel's latest chip for this player,the STMP3600, but since this a new chip with lots of features/power it would be wise if you're not in the immediate need for owning a unit now to simply take patience because sooner or later more products with similar features and better price will appear in this highly competitive market

<Title>8 months, two dead Vision M's-don't buy this player!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've now gone through my second Vision M. I loved it, still love it. I bought the first one in March, the player froze with a "hardware problem" that required replacement after 3 months. Happily, Amazon replaced it. I now have had the second one since the summer and yesterday that one died on me. It now won't sync despite changing cables, etc. And between fatal hardware problems, there were multiple episodes of freezing screens, need to reboot (and lose then subsequently re-download all my stuff) and general MP3 mischief. I don't use my player very often, I always took care of it, never dropped it, etc.  Now hoping to decide between the Vision W and the Zune, so if anyone has an opinion, would be helpful.

<Content>This is my second one. I also have a new 16mb flash player. I bought this one because of the capacity. But my first ones HDD died after 1 year , after the warranty was up. So if you buy one get the three year protection plan from Amazon. I believe Creative know about the HDD problem as it is very hard to buy a new one of these anymore even from Creative. Creative are cheaper and better than Apple, especially if you already have your music in MP3 format and do not need to but it.

<Content>This product is defective! It doesn't work and there's absolutely no guaranty process to take care of this. We bought this product in Dec 07 and after 1 month of using it very sporadically it froze! There was nothing we could do to get it back on. Took it to the store and got it replaced just fine. New unit froze in less than a month later! Store refuses to replace it and sent us to the manufacturer. Manufacturer doesn't provide a process to replace this piece of garbage! If you are in the market for something like this, pass on this garbage! You will be sorry if you don't. By the way, there's no way to take the battery out and reset it. You are out of options on this garbage! Please, please pass on this. Thanks for your patience. Good luck on your search!

<Content>Just figured I'd add my review here since most reviews happen shortly after someone buys the device. Unlike Ipods, which tend to have an average lifespam of 7 months, this player lasts and lasts and it still has better features and compatability than the brand new Ipod videos. Highly recommend it !!! Better sound than the Ipod, better features, compatible with any format and a pleasure to use.

<Content>I have had my Zen Vision M for over a year and a half now and have had no problems at all. The first couple of months I had it i had some problems with it freezing and I had to reset it a few times, but after I went to the website and downloaded the new firmware. I have not had any problems at all since. It has been dropped many times and there it still nothing wrong with it.(I use the leather case that buttons over) The screen display is stunningly clear. The controls are great after you figure out how exactly to use them. And its easy to install on your computer and add and remove files. I am glad I bought this over the Ipod.

<Title>The creative zen player is terrible and customer support is rude and unhelpful
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Vision: M about 6 months ago.  It worked ok, until I got a new computer.  I installed the software and immediately the player froze up and refused to work again.  After spending days trying to figure it out, I finally called the company, but it also took me forever to navigate the website.  I didn't buy the protection plan, but I thought they might still be able to help me.  I got an Indian guy on the phone who was really hard to understand and refused to help me unless I bought the plan for 12.99.  I know it isn't a lot but, I felt like it was a trick just to make more money.  Apple will help you no matter what.  I told the man that I was pretty disappointed in the product and he laughed at me! So, I emailed them and got NO help from that.  I tried to reinstall the software one more time and my windows XP crashed!  I am done with this player and company, its not worth it if it's going to mess up my new computer.  I'm just going to stick with Apple because at least they don't outsource their customer support employees to India.

<Title>Better to spend more for an ipod...
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I admit, I loved this player when I first received it. It had a beautiful display, was easy to use/configure, and was cheaper than Apple for the same amount of storage capacity. Unfortunately, that didn't last long, as a little over 3 months later my player completely died, lasting only a few weeks after my warranty expired. Doing a little research online, I found that this is a common complaint with most buyers of this model, and most of the other models Creative makes. I had a similar problem when I owned a Creative MUVo micro prior to this, but was easily able to fix it by going online and updating the firmware. No such luck with this one, after numerous e-mail exchanges I was told that I would have to send it back to be fixed at my own cost, minus the cost of parts(though it was THEIR fault the product was defective).   Researching further, I found that this was also a common response to the problem, replacing the unit for $25 only to have the same problem reoccur months later. So i decided not to deal with it, and opt to spend the extra money to buy an ipod instead which is much more reliable by far.

<Title>Mysterious Screen Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The zen was great for the first six months or so, but then one night I set it down by my bed to charge. The next day the screen looked like someone had stepped on it. There were blank strips and inky looking splotches, and the once beautiful clear screen was crossed with horizontal white lines.   Now, it's *possible* that somehow someone stepped on it during the night, but I can't imagine how that would happen, as it was not in a place where your feet could go when getting in or out of bed. So, to all appearances, the screen suddenly just went crazy.   I can still use it, and the features still work the same, but the whole point was for it to play high quality video, and now it just looks like pixellated crap. Has anyone else experienced this?  Besides the mystery of the screen, there were some other annoyances. As some other users have mentioned, it is VITAL that you buy a wall charger. If you completely drain the battery on the Zen, your computer will not recognize it or charge it, so you can only charge it from a wall charger.  Often I would turn off the Zen in the middle of a track, and turn it on later to find myself in the middle of a completely different track. This also happens when you're listening to an audiobook, which means you have to make sure to bookmark every time you turn off the zen, or you will lose your place. This happens very frequently, and is more annoying than anything else. In random mode, if you want to go back to the track it just played, you can't. When you hit the "skip backward" side of the touchpad, it just goes to a completely different track, forcing you to hunt down the one you wanted manually.  The touchpad is either too sensitive, or skips over a track altogether, which just takes more time.  The zen itself is pretty bulky, and not very easy to stick in your pocket.  Also, there is a problem with freezing/crashing, which increases if you try to go jogging with it (the zen isn't meant for much jostling).  That said, I loved the clear colors on the screen (while it still worked!) and the shortcut buttons. It has a very easy and intuitive interface, and it allows you to drag and drop files as well as syncing them, which I like. You can also delete songs straight off the zen, which the iPod won't allow. I just wish they'd worked out the bugs before they marketed it! I'm torn. I've seen a lot of very bad reviews on the Zen's overall durability, but I don't like any other media players because they're not as easy as the Zen. Plus, the price has actually gone UP since I bought mine! A dilemma. Any suggestions?

<Title>Thoroughly Impressed
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my opinion; Creative audio/video players are the best on the market in terms of value, performance, and features. These traits outweigh the aesthetic qualities of the ipod. What first impressed me with the Vision M was the quality of the screen; it is very bright, the abundance of colors is amazing and the backround customization is great. The navigation system is a little tedious at first, but it becomes a breeze after a little practice. The best thing I like about this player is the fact that it supports a large array of video/audio formats. I was able to transfer my video and music files easily.In regards to performance, the playback was perfect. I was able to watch a full length video and still have plenty of juice left to listen to music. The sound quality of the music was very impressive, (97 db SNR), add to the fact that you can use Custom EQ to tweak it to your liking. The only drawback with this device is the screeen scratches easily, but as one reviewer pointed out, you can use PDA screen protectors to preserve the screens finish.Other than this; the player is perfect. If you're looking for a product that will play your music and video files flawlessy and more, then this is the player for you. It is a better choice than the ipod and your dollars will go a lot furthur with this investment.

<Title>vision M is a winner
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the Zen Vision M from Amazon last week.  This thing really blew me away.  The screen is beautiful, video quality is amazing.  Sound quality is second to none (with quality headphones - not the junk they throw in).  It is considerably thicker than the 30G ipod video, but it feels much more solid and is more comfortable to hold in your hand.  Battery life is great (charger included!)  You can drag and drop mp3, wma, avi, divx, almost any audio or video file you may have and this will play it (or use the included software if you prefer).  On a few occasions, it said the video file was not supported, but with the included video converter, you're in business.  The user interface is great, much better than ipod's in my opinion.  The vertical scroll button now has side to side scrolling (an improvment on the zen micro).  Other benefits are the FM radio and voice recorder.  I tried the voice recorder and the quality was excellent, no spinning hard drive noise.  My only concern is how easily the unit scratches.  If you get this PLEASE get a case.. mine already has some minor scratches even though I have been careful.  Enjoy!

<Content>I have always been with the war against Apple's plan to take over the mp3 industry.  This little gadget should get the rest of the publics attention.  Although the Ipod video is thinner the vision is quite worth the extra 30 bucks, besides who really cares about the extra width.    Pros: High Definition Screen, custom wallpaper, verticle touch pad and pressure buttons instead of all touch, sound quality is rediculous, removable disk option, radio, video output to tv, compatable with most video formats, Battery life is excellant, compatabilty most applications, durabilty.  Cons: lack of silly Ipod like accessories  so sell your Ipod and get this

Wow, very cool.......except.....being portable......am I going to plug it into.....the wall at Starbucks? 6. Doesn't use one software? Yeah, you got me there. It uses REAL, or Windows Media player, or Music Match. Yeah, some winners there. Maybe I can use Sony's software and totally mess up my computer as well? Not. 7. Microphone. I believe you can get a mic for the iPod if you really want it. But are you expecting the Creative to be good at recording sound? A little mono mic like that?  Do yourself a favor and get an iPod. Don't waste your money on this. The hype is true. Treat yourself to the best portable video/music player.

<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ipod has an over glorified market.  My sister went through 2 Ipods and dealt with Apple's tech support. She said they are garbage, and said their tech support is terrible.  She also said their battery life is terrible.  After a short period of use, she said she needed to replace the battery.  I have consulted with her and since then she bought a creative MP3 player and swears by it.  She has had no problems after 2 years of use.  Another person I know bought an Ipod and said the same thing about their tech support.  He said when he called them up, they placed him on hold and must have just walked away.  He sat there for 45 minutes waiting and nothing.  He finally got ahold of them and they told him he needed to fax his receipt in.  He tried it 5 times from numerous fax machines and got the same response that it was unreadable.  If he was on hold so long for tech support, it could only mean 2 things:  1. They are ignoring his call because they don't want to deal with him.  2.  They are loaded with other callers because their products are garbage.  You can do the math, but from both cases, I think I have made my decision.  CREATIVE ZEN IT IS!!!!

<Title>A Truly Unbiased review!  Very good portable media player
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those of you looking to read something with substance, here's a review from someone who actually owns both an Ipod and Zen Vision M and has used the Ipod Video.  I've been looking for a feature rich portable media player (PMP or PVP) and was about to jump on an Ipod Video when I saw the press release for the Vision M in December.  I already own a regular 4G ipod and loved it.  The clickwheel made using it so easy.  I borrowed a Video Ipod from a co-worker and was impressed with the video capabilities; however I really wanted something with FM radio and better video codec compability.  The early reviews of the Vision were fairly positive, but had a few bugs like video buffer issues and no on the go playlists, but both are now fixed via new firmware.  The clincher was CNET's awarding it the Best In Show at the 2006 CES.  For a reputable site to recommends this as best in show over the hundreds of other new devices says a lot.  Ok, on to the real review.....  I purchased the Black Vision M and the two things that stand out is the clean front layout and thickness.  It is about .7 inches thick so it's signficantly thicker than the Ipod.  Although I would prefer the slim shape of the Ipod, the thicker Vision M was fine as it still fits in my pocket comfortably and is quite snug in my hand.  The instructions require you to do two things first:   1) Update Quicktime if it's version 7.0 through 7.0.2 before installing Creative's software   2) Charge it up first using the AC adapter which only takes about 2 hours (great advantage over Ipod)  User Interface and Slide Touchpad: The software is pretty straight forward and so is using the menu system on the Vision M.  The slide touchpad takes a little getting used and I have to admit the Ipod clickwheel is much easier to use.  However, it does have its advantages.  You are able to very quickly scan though large song lists by holding down at the top or bottom of the touchpad.  Alternatively the user interface allows you to search alphabetically via song, albums, artists, and genre.  This is something I wish the Ipod had as going round and round on the clickwheel sometimes gets old if you're looking for something in particular.  The touchpad also doubles as a previous/next or rewind/fast forward button by pressing it the left or right respectively.  Additionally, there are four buttons located around the touchpad:  Play/Pause, Context Menu (Options), Back, and Custom Shortcut where you can set it to whatever you want (almost, you have a list of options).  These buttons light up in aqua blue which is nice for night time use.  Sound So how's the sound quality?  Very good!  The headset that comes with the Vision is slightly better than the average as they fit snug in your ear and have good response.  In my opinion, both the sound quality of the Ipod and Vision M are good, but the Vision M is slightly better.  Additionally you can enhance your listening experience with the built in preset or custom equalizer and bass boost options.  I only wish it saved more than one custom equalizer setting.  Be careful when using bass boost as doing this combined with boosting the low end using the equalizer may distort the sound.  Oh, did I mention you can bookmark your music so you can pick up where you last left off which is something the Ipod doesn't do.  Other info Radio:  Very very good.  your headphones is used as the antenna and the reception is very good.  You are able to preset up to 32 stations (including renaming them) manually or thought the auto seek option.  You also have a signal strength bar (similar to ones found on cellphones)  Video:  The player's codec supports DivX4/5, XviD5, MPEG-1/2/4SP, and WMV9 as well as Motion-JPEG.  The included software will convert your videos to the proper codec and resolution including cropping if you so desire.  My only complaint is the 4-6 seconds of wait time when you start playing, but since this is a hard drive based device, it's understandable.  Oh yeah, you can even password protect files from viewing.  Screen:  Excellent, the 2.5" screen is bright and the colors are vivid; it's capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors.  Easily better than the Ipod Video which I thought was good to begin with.    Pictures:  The viewer allows you to choose from specified folder and displays contents in a 5 x 4 format.  You then pick the one you want to see via touchpad and then you have the option of zooming in.   Again, colors are vivid and you can even get picture details (via context button).  Miscellaneous features:  Voice Recording, Custom Wallpaper, Sync your Outlook Calendar option, Button lock (disables the touchpad and buttons), song and picture rating, Play music while viewing pictures, Compatible with Windows Media Player 10, 6 hours of video battery life, Smart Playlists (higher rated songs play back more frequently I think), Smart Volume (Normalizes volume of all songs), Video Out, power saving options, and PlaysforSure compatibility.  Weakness: So what keeps me from giving this unit a 5 star rating?  An overly sensitive touchpad (should get better as I get more used to it), lack of accessories at this time, lack of a removable battery, lack of lyrics display support, can't do anything with it when docked to the PC, separate 3 in 1 dongle for USB, AC connectivity and Video Out.  Overall these are  fairly minor complaints.  In summary, if you just need a decent mp3 player with video and photo capabilities, then the Ipod is a fine choice.  For those searching for a more feature rich player, this is an excellent option.   This item is selling well and I hope that translates to more accessories for this wonderful player.  I have thoroughly enjoyed using this player and hope you find this review informative.

<Title>This is to balance out all the geniuses who don't even own this
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own this unit either but some people are just ridiculous.  first things first, this unit has been out for only a month or so and doesn't have the benefit of rabid apple fanboyism so of COURSE there wouldn't be many reviews but even 37 various reviews of a unit is good enough info to know whether or not you'd like the Zen.  Saying "I'll trust 300 people rather than 37 people" and giving the Zen itself (what did the zen ever do to you to deserve that?) a low score is absolutely ridiculous and asinine.  second off, iTunes should NOT be seen as a plus for the iPod, rather it depends on the user. I like having complete control over my library and itunes is great for ripping and renaming/ID3 tag changing en masse but I HATE HATE HATE using it for my nano (it was a gift!). Some people love iTunes and that's their perogative.  Third, as for it's looks. GET OFF IT~!  Okay it's shaped like a box that's longer vertically, guess that bites off the iPod?  It has a 320 by 240 color screen, I guess that bites off the iPod? The interface has words listed vertically! JUST LIKE THE IPOD?! Whoa what a COMPLETE ripoff (sarcasm, oh btw didn't you know that creative has a patent on hierarchical menu systems before apple could?  Did the Firefox browser bite off of IE when they put the "back" and "forward" buttons on the upper left of their interfaces?  The only similarities fanboys are just driveling up is that it's a mono colored MP3 player, like an iPod but that's just silly; so if another MP3 player was one color, then it's biting off the iPod?  As for it's features..  1) Radio - I'll listen to it to find new musical content/bands to enjoy plus at times I just actually might get bored of my 20GB collection. Also you have to pay 30 dollars extra and bulk up your iPod to add radio to it.  2) Interface - I'll give yah this one. Creatives interface is pretty intuitive but the click wheel is a darn nice idea apple has. Still, it's not impossible for a normal person to use this unit.  3) Battery life - A person below me scoffed at the Zen having better battery life. Wow that's ridiculous. who WOULDN'T want longer battery life? In a practicality sense, more bettery life == using the unit more OR charging the unit less == longer battery life in the long run. Remember that Lithium Ion batteries have limited charges so charging it less extends the life.  The battery life is the same as the iPod however, except with Video (4 hours-ish for Zen).  4) Color Variation - I'm pining for the green one. If the iPod's have color variation, people would be flocking for them too.. oh WAIT! Why do I see so many females with pink and green iPod mini's still? ridiculous argument yet again. Choice (In this case, color of the Zen) is a good thing.  5) AC - My buddy lugs his power adapter (30 bucks extra from good ol' apple) around for his iPod. He doesn't mind and he charges it quite often actually.  6) Software - You don't have to use any but yet again this is up to the consumer. Some people like iTunes so that would suck if they used the Zen but I personally hate iTunes so it'd be good for me :).  7) Microphone - Usable in class lectures. Also people have actually SAID the sound quality from recording was good, instead of this person CLAIMING it would be bad.  Stupid arguments by Fanboys, it's quite pitiful. I say get whatever you want, iPod's ARE fine players but the people backing them can be pretty dumb.  It's all up to you! BTW Once I save up, I AM getting this but that's just me!

<Title>Review of Reviews. (silly but maybe a hint)
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think it would be a bit redundant at this point to review my vision m extensively, given the hundreds of others. I have had my Zen for about a year with zero problems. No freeze ups, no blackouts, none of that.   Going over the negative reviews I would like to say this much:    I saw a ton of customers (and a lot IPOD biases) who rated the product One Star simply because one malfunction which was more from their own part. For example, the oversensitive touch pad touch pad can be set a LOWER sensitivity level. I did find the pad a little difficult on the default level, so I set it lower. (I fixed this within the first week).  On the reviews were there was no fault to buyer, like receiving a bugged Creative, I can only say that "it happens". My brother received a dead IPOD-everything was replaced except for the case- and had to wait a few months to get a "fixed" one (same brand). This new fixed one had to be sent back again, because of bugs. This is just a universal mp3 problem.   HOWEVER; I do agree that Creative support is worth no time, and luckily I haven't had to test this theory. This is my first mp3 and I will probably get another creative. If my creative dies within the next year, months even, I'm fine to just buy a new product. (Considering my creative has outlasted numerous of my friends' IPODs I'm very happy with it.)

<Title>Won't buy Creative again
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The battery could not be recharged after sitting off for 30 days. The online support pages were not helpful, and it was impossible to contact a person for technical help. Thanks for some kind people at a Creative forum I tried all the tricks and finally gave up. I won't buy another Creative product. I am now in the market for a new mp3 player.

<Title>Great MP3 but not without flaws
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my 30 gb zen for just over a year. I received it as a gift and have been very satisfied with it. The sound quality is great if you replace the worthless headphones the player comes with. The picture quality is good too. I love that I could set the background as a picture when the iPods weren't capable of that. The program it comes with is really user-friendly. Drag and drop, could it be easier? There is a large selection of free "zen-casts" as well, several to which i am subscribed. My main problems with this player are the heftiness of it: its thick, large compared to the new ipods and other mp3 players; and the fact that sometimes it freezes, and the only way to fix it is to stick a paperclip into the in-set reset button. This doesn't damage the player or the content in anyway, it's just irritating.   I'd really rather give it 3.5 stars. Overall, a really great player with flaws. For the price, I'd opt an iPod.

<Title>Creative Zen and NetLibrary
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Creative Zen Vision:M is quite acceptable for my purposes. I download Netlibrary books. You have to download the ZNVM_PCPatch_LA.exe to work with Window Media Player 11. You cannot download "Radio Quality" wma audio books to the Zen.  You must select "CD Quality" 32 kbps stereo books from Netlibrary. If your Zen unit does not charge, make sure you are plugged into a direct USB port (my expanded USB 2.0 card would not allow it to charge). My unit shuts down when charging (can't listen while charging). There are several updates.

<Title>Decent Player, rip-off service
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zen Vision M for 18 months now, and I am really pleased with the video quality and the ease of use. Sound quality is good too, and I like being able to hook that badboy up to tv when I travel so I can watch movies I've put on it.  Now the bad news - at least once every six weeks or so it freezes up and I have to reboot it. This sucks, since to reboot you have to wait awhile if you have lots of stuff on your player, and you need to find a needle (nothing else will fit) to reach into the tiny hole to trigger the reboot. This can be a real headache when you are riding on the subway or just sitting in a coffee shop somewhere, unless of course you carry around safety pins. Sometimes the reboots happen more frequently, but never more than twice a month. Still, that's kinda lame that its happening at all.  The worst thing about the Zen is the customer service - I dropped mine and the casing that covers the recharge jack came aloose, so I wrote to Creative to ask how much new casing would cost. $200 is what they quoted me (1/15/08)to install a new case!!!! Mind you, you can find a new player for cheaper than that on amazon. Now, there is nothing wrong with the player itself and I didn't want anything else done, just the casing replaced. The guy who wrote me back was even apologetic about the price, which tells me that the management is just out to squeeze every $ they can out of loyal customers, common sense be damned.  I sold my Ipod to buy a zen because I don't care for Apple's customer service, now Creative turns out to be much the same. I'd suggest that you either pony up for the extended 2 year warranty OR buy from a company that doesn't try to bleed you dry for what should be a minor repair. Between the freezing up and the exorbitant costs, I'd say look elsewhere.  Edit: Sorry, just looked online, since the Zen Vision M is no longer being sold at Fry's, Best Buy OR Circuit City, the price is an incredible $370 new!!!! I paid $323 new (at Fry's) for mine 18 months ago. I guess amazon makes a killing selling 2 a week (or month) but Creative seems to be really doing poorly if this is the best they can do in terms of marketing strategy.   Funnily enough, less than 2 months ago you could still find the M-30 online new for about $200 or so, but I guess this was before Fry's, BestBuy, etc stopped carrying it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ownership time: 1 month, refurbished player  Sharp screen, good clarity, brightness (even at 50%) and color quality.  I owned an older Zen Touch MP3 player and upgraded to this Zen and am not disappointed at all.  The best thing is that they cleaned up the touchy sensitivity of the touch bar from older versions.  Older Zen users might recall frustration trying to make the scroll bar settle on exactly the file you wanted to play.  The Zen Vision lets you either scroll with the touch bar or tap the ends of the bar to advance one line on each screen.    The interface has been made to operate more like an iPod, which I like.  The Random button has been replaced by a Today's Favorite button that does the same thing.  One thing I did like about older versions of the Zen that isn't in the newer one is that when you chose to play any song, whether randomly or by browsing to it, you could immediately call up the other songs on the album by moving the touch bar.  On the Vision this now increases and decreses volume, and if you hit the Back button you are taken to the main front screen instead of the album song list.    One other thing - the player supports limited video formats, mostly vanilla AVI, WMV and MPEG.  I have often found that Creative's built-in video converter will offer to convert an incompatible video type when you try to move the video file on to the player, but often times it goes through the whole process only to give you an error message that the file it just converted to wmv is not compatible with the player (???).  It doesn't happen all the time, only with certain video files.  Those nitpicks aside, if you have alternate means of converting video it's not really a problem.  Overall this is a pretty feature-packed player for the price and I don't regret my purchase one bit.
