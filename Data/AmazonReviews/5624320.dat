<Content>I do like little MP3, but I find a big dissadvantage the fact, that every time I have to charge it, I have to have PC with me. The MP3 comes only with USB cable! No additional charger available. For example, going on vacation - does that mean take the PC with me? Not a 21st century...

<Title>Ideal for Napster To Go
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this because it is compatible with Napster To Go, which lets you download an unlimited number of songs for a monthly rate rather than the 99 cent per song deal with iTunes.  The user interface is very nice and I haven't had any trouble with the unit so far.

<Title>THE BEST
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound on this is incredible.  it seems to stay charged forever which is great.  I know people with iPods and they don't stay charged for nearly as long.  I don't have anything bad to say about this at all.

<Title>Great  Mp3 Player.......so far..
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this Samsung for almost 2 weeks,plays all my files without problems,I didn't install the software so i just made the "Copy and paste" with all the tracks..Easyyyy!!!..No complicated like the Ipods...the battery last for almost 30 hours (if you dont touch any buttom)..the sound is great, even with the original earphones (I tried a new JVC earphones, good bass and crisp sound..only $12 at Walmart)...the look is fantastic...the only thing I dont like,there is no "custom equalizer"....the screen is clear and vivid colors,good size....My 2 Sansas only lasted for 48 hours, and the 1GB Creative was to small for all my music but still great sound after a few drops....There is no FM radio but nothing is perfect...this is the best you can get for the money..go for it!!!..
