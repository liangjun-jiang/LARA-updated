<Content>I didn't like this at all...it is really hard to use, has confusing operations, it feels really cheap, and the picture quality leaves ALOT to be desired.  Stay away from this one...

<Title>huge mistake
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Do not buy this. The 40gb hard drive and the "features" mask the true quality of this product. The firmware is terrible. Folder and filenames only show the first 5 characters, making it hard to find anything. The pause/play button does not always work when listening to music. Folder and file navigation is way too slow. The volume on this thing is extremely weak. Video conversion software that is included does not work (winXP & WME9). Seems to me that the manufacturer tried to make it as cheap and as quickly as possible. It's a good idea, it's just that they should have spent more time tweaking it. If you have the money for one of these things, save another $100 and buy a video iPOD.  P.S. - Anyone know if the PVR firmware is linux based?

<Title>Mustek WHO:(???????????
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know what I was thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!:). ZERO RATING First- You only get 2 hours on a full charge Second-Customer Services is the WORST Third-It's heavy Fourth-When watching a video there's a gap between the actors speaking and what you see.  Think of the old school Karate movies. Fifth-The ac piece on the machine broke after one year Six-If you watch a movie and needed to stop in the middle, forget about it, it won't hold your spot so you go back to the beginning of the show:( Seven-It doesn't show the names of your songs-more than 5 spaces and once a song in there you can't move it. Eight-the kickstand broke because it made of plastic and too weak.

<Title>some what pleased
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really liked the product stands for, but there were problems that I guess are internal problems with the machine.  I have purchased this device several times and each time there was a different problem with the machine.  After I loaded about 35 movies on the device, it wouldn't cut on.  Once the machine wouldn't cut off, so I had to reset the devise, which I lost all of my movies.  I think if there were more products like this, it could really be a good device, because it was good for travel and you don't have to take a portable DVD player and movies with you.  I really like the devise, it just had too many problems for me.  I would love to have another one, but I have purchased too many and returned too many, so I don't want to keep getting the devise, only to have to return it and keep paying for shipping fees for manufacture problems.

<Title>Interesting toy to play with
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have tried a little of almost everything with this device.  I have played MP3 music; recorded shows and movies from Satellite, VCR, DVD, and other sources; played those recordings on a PC; and stored photos and computer data as if it was an external hard drive.  Everything has worked so far.  On the downside, the earphones created instant static (so I substituted them with a set that I have used with a standalone MP3 player), the device is on the thick side, and the external speakers volume does not turn up high enough to listen to (you need to plug external speakers on the headset output to listen to the music or videos if you do not use a headset).  I like the relatively large screen and it almost offsets the negativity due to the thickness of this device.  You can just plug in this device to a PC and play video and/or music etc by double clicking on the file stored on this PVR   It has been easy to use and fun to play with so far for the first couple of months.

<Title>Don't waste your $
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm sorry for those who wish to sell their used unit, but I'm also a user of this product, or should I say USE TO BE.  For those who are interested in purchasing....buy something usefull.  Once the battery fails, it's useless.  You can't replace it.  The only way is to send the entire unit back to Mustek and you're at their mercy as to the price for the battery and shipping costs.  Do you really want to frustrate yourself???????  The only good thing about the unit is the fair video quality.  The sound is tinney, low volume (even on high).  Even though there's no speaker (connect earphones), the San Disk Sansa is the best bang for the buck!
