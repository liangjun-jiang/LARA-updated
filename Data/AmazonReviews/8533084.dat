<Product Name>Sony NWZB105FWHI 2GB Walkman MP3 Player (White)
<Title>Defective and poor Sony customer service
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the NWZ-B105 from Sony directly right after it was released. I bought it because I've had good experiences with Sony audio products in the past, and because it allowed for drag-and-drop or WMP11 play of your MP3 or WMA files. It's also one of the few OLED display players that lets you browse by folder, supports playlists, has voice recording, and excellent sound quality. I don't need JPG or movie playing, just something to use while exercising.   When I received it, I plugged it directly into my laptop, transfered about 1GB of music using WMP11 (the player is a 2GB model), and then listened for a while - sounded great, very close on par to Cowon/iAudio music players. Was very happy, until I decided to check out the Sony's other functions. First I tried voice recording, and got the message that the memory was full...well, no, it wasn't - I only transfered a GB...so I decided the reformat the player from the player's menu (the instructions warn you to NOT reformat the player using Windows) and apparently that pushed the player over the edge. It froze up - pressing the Power button after that only resulted in "Creating Database" and "Boot Error" messages flashing on the screen. I plugged it into my computer and it wouldn't even recognize it as a drive. Doing a pin Reset of the unit did absolutely nothing.   So I called Sony tech support, who told me to send it in for repair. No way was I going to go for weeks without a player, so I said no, I'll just return it, and they told me to call the customer returns number. I asked if I needed a confirmation number or something of that sort to indicate that I've already run the unit past tech support, and the rep said, "No, just call the number." So I called the Returns number and after being on permahold, and the rep answered and asked me, "Do you have an Event number?" I said, "No, the tech support guy said I didn't need one." The Returns rep said, "You need an event number to get an RMA." Sigh.  So I had to call tech support AGAIN, get an event number, then call Returns again, to finally get the RMA number. Plus I have to pay for return shipping, even though the unit is clearly defective.  Definitely not the product quality or service experience I expected when buying from a higher-end company like Sony. I know the player was just newly released, but for it to malfunction like that is just a pain and I'm way hesitant to make another investment in Sony players again because of the hassle.

<Title>GREAT LITTLE ITEM BUT STILL PREFER MD

<Content>This MP3 player is a nice breakaway from the seemingly obsolete Sonicstage/ATRAC software which was getting the Minidisc Walkman line nowhere. Why it took so long for Sony to come out with Drag-and-Drap compatibility is hard to comprehend.  The sound in this new device is superb. Though you can access only Windows Media Player among the major nonsubscription MP3 downloadable sources, the Drag-and-Drop is an improvement.  The player is great, though I still prefer the Minidisc HI-MD recorder. The latter can reproduce MP3s and WAV files from more than just one source, thanks to the innovations of digital media companies other than SONY, which, unfortunately, seems to have scrapped any potential upcoming minidisc projects.
