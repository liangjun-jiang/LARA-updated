<Title>great iPod for anyone

<Content>Not looking for videos or pictures, just want music, then forget the more expensive Nanos and such, stick to an iPod Shuffle.  Everything you want without all the needless bells and whistles.  Plus, with no screen to load, you won't have the problem many iPod users go through of having them "freeze up".  
<Overall>5
