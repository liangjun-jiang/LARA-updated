<Content>The sound quality is good. The battery life is good. It's great you can also use it as a jump drive. Only problem I have with it is that after listening to a song or two it shuts itself off unless you press pause or forward.

<Content>the sound is good and clear! so easy to use! I got it just until I could afford an ipod, I had a creative Zen but it broke and then got another one and it also broke, one fall and its over for those Zens!!! so I got this to hold me over until I could get an ipod and I was so impressed!!! just doesnt have much room for lots of songs but I switch my favs up quite alot and since its so easy to put songs in and out it really isnt a big deal! I love it! I am going to give it to my son when I get the ipod, but I am in no rush.

<Title>On 4th player

<Content>I can't believe this player! I've exchanged it at the store 3 times now and each player has quit on me. It will play for awhile, but then just won't come on anymore.  The customer service agent said I probably need to reformat the player, but my computer can't even find the device when I plug it into the USB port.  Insult to injury, Customer Service has not been much help!  I wouldn't even give it one star, but I had to rate it with something.
