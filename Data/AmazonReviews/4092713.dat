<Title>Just too finicky.
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one and installed the programs. Since then all I got was errors and requests for updates. I had 600 songs and it deleted 420 of them ! In the end I sold it and stuck to my Sony discplayer with a 1gb disc. No problems - great sound.

<Title>own 3 and buying another
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got one of these so that I could take my music with me when I travel. Love the functionality of it, and I'm not locked into the Ipod nation. I have mp3's and wma's on this unit, as well as downloading all types of podcasts. My kid's kept borrowing it, so now this is the birthday gift of choice. Just getting ready to buy another one for my 15 year old.  I use Media Player 10 with the play for sure for managing all of the music on the player. Another big plus is that it will sync with my outlook software, so I always have access to my contacts list. I don't even bother with the Creative software, because it works so well with the microsoft media player.  My daughter has an IPOD mini, and she has to use the apple software. Also, the battery is replaceable on this unit, where on the ipod it is not.  A great deal. Two thumbs up.

<Title>Wouldn't recommend this product
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this Mp3 player for my birthday 6 months ago and it has broken twice.  The first time it broke the sound would go in and out because of the fact that the headphonejack was poorly connected.  I tried using other headphones with the same result.  I sent it back and got it back about 2 weeks later, but i had to pay for shipping.   Then recently the sound was going in and out again, then one day when i pulled it out of my purse i saw that the top had fallen off because it had only been glued on and the on button fell off because of this.  My cousins on button on his also broke.  From what I've seen they don't put a lot of work into making quality products.  Personally I would recommend a Sandisk because they are pretty good.

<Title>I Pod Killer
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had no luck with MP3 players. I've a Rio, Phillips,I Pod Nano. The all have draw backs. Some don't play all formats, some only can down load from sertain sites. And some just don't work at all. Until a got my Zen. It take down loads of pictures and plays all the misic I need while traveling. It has a strong FM radio with good range. The only thing they need to do is fix the back plate and lessen the sensititivity controls. Other than that it was easy to use and FUN to have.  The "Q" from Jersey

<Title>frustrating product
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>when i first got this player, i thought it was great, and  had more features than an ipod. then i realized the  player is extremely incosistent and frustrating. All the connections are cheap... more than half the time i would leave the player overnight plugged into an outlet to charge, and in the morning it would not be charged at all; after a couple of months the headphone jack had a poor connection so my sound went in and out, and the usb connection was also poor, so i constantly have to plug the player  in and out for my computer to recognize the player as connected so i can upload songs.  after the headphone connection went from bad to worse i mailed it to get fixed since it was under the one year warranty. I had to pay over $20 for shipping and insurance on it, and didnt have my player for about a month, when i got it back they had replaced my player with a refurbished one. well that one didnt work at all.  when i called them to talk about it, they said I am not under phone service warranty , and i would have to give them my credit card # and pay $10 in order to discuss the problem.  they blame the problem on my computer, saying all my 6 usb ports must not be working and that is why i can't upload songs to it. yet they  dont seem to understand that i dock my digital comaera to the usb ports, as well as my boyfriends ipod, and there is no problems with the usb connection. they just cant think that their product doesnt work. so now after spend $200 on this product i have no mp3 player, and it has been so frustrating that i prefer throwing it in the garbage I guess i should go get an ipod, because there is a reason why they are so popular.

<Title>good stuff
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>very good quality, it's a bit tricky to figure out how to charge at first, but once you get it, it's very easy. the touchpad adjusts sensibility so you just have to get used to that. oh yea, i bought a battery charger with mine for occassions where i am not near a computer, it was only like $4 well worth it. overall, it's a good product, in my opinion it beats an ipod with extra features and you don't have to follow the whole "ipod fad"

<Title>Excellent alternative to the ipod. 
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player should be purchased just as often as the nano but doesn't. i'm not sure why this one is way cheaper and more durable, plus you can use subscription services that are way cheaper than itunes. I found the sound quality with the speaker to be better than expected.  The software included was alright but i'll probably use wmp most of the time. I was pretty amazed by the microphones quality. the fm transmitor doesn't work great.   The screen was much better than i thought it would be but i probably wont use it much for pictures cuz it is still so small.  My only complaints would be that I couldn't figure out how to get my computer to recognize it for an hour. But eventually it just worked so that was ok.  The foam on the headphones came off to easily and I lost one foam on my second day of use. Luckily the haedphones aren't uncomfrotable w/o them. still they shoulda come with extra.  i found the controls to be insanely sensitive at first but now i've gotten used to it.  It is lame you cant play music and look at pictures.  It should to be easier to change the volume while looking at the menus.  Thats about it.  I would really reccomend it especially at the low price

<Title>Best gadget ever
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My creative Zen Micro Photo player is the best electronic player ever.  I like everything about it. I like being able to listen to the radio and recording it. I like listening to my music, and being able to put my photos as my background. It did take a bit to get use to how sensitive the controls were, but now I have all the buttons down. So far I have had no problems putting any music on it. I saved up and bought this with my own money, well worth the cost. It is a really cool mp3 player! I like it much better than my friends iPods.

<Title>be sure to use the right charger!
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this mp3 player is great, but i had to return my first one because i screwed up the battery.  one thing to remember, when you first get it, CHARGE IT FIRST THING!  if you don't, this will cause your battery's life to be short and messed up.  and also, if you are like me and aren't able to stick to the computer for 5 hours for the thing to charge, buy a wall charger.  but you MUST use the CREATIVE ZEN official charger!!!  believe me, i used an A/C to USB adapter like the ones on sale here, but after more than 24 hours, the battery still wasn't full!  and also, the machine sucked up the little juice it had within 2 hours.  so i thought something was wrong with the machine, but actually it was the charger.  when i plugged in the official charger, the battery charged faster (only 2 hours or so, way faster than computer charging!) and there was the characteristic blue "glowing" that i got when it was hooked up to the cpu.  with the old charger, there was no glowing.  i think that this glowing only works with the official charger or the computer, maybe there's some special creative technology or recognition in their chargers.  so make sure you don't make the same mistakes i made, though AMAZON's customer service was great and sent me a new player via UPS AIR!  wow!  so make sure you use the creative charger since even though it is expensive, sadly, it is the only one that'll work.   other than that, the player itself is pretty great.  some things i think brought it down was:    A) the voice recorder.        it takes so much navigating and buttons and menus to start and stop it.  and when you play your recording back, you have to crank up the volume to almost maximum to hear.     B) the software        i have to admit, it is kind of frustrating at first.  especially mediasource (one of the two programs on the installation cd) , which i don't think is useful for anything besides playing music, which i could use windows media player for.  but the other program, media explorer is good.  i generally use mediasource for fixing and renaming the ID3 tags.     C) the fact that you can't listen to songs while viewing photos.  and when you do use them for screensaver, it's not so nice because you can't see the words real well anymore.       D) the earbuds do kind of hurt and the foamy things do come off.     but other than that, it is great!  but you should buy a case, even though it is pricy.  you don't want to scratch the screen or anything.  the player is very solidly built.  it's mostly metal, and the front looks sturdy and you won't have to worry about fingerprints, unlike the ipod.  and the connections are fine, don't worry about what those other people said!  my computer had no trouble recognizing it!  no cheap stuff.  i like the texture and the feel of it, and the lighting is really cool.  the screen is great, good color, not like LCD (you can see from all angles!), BUT i noticed once i was in the sun, you can't see the screen as well.      overall, great player for the price!  and 4GB is plenty of memory, i filled in about 100 songs and about 150 photos and i STILL haven't filled up 1 GB!!!  i don't know how you can fill this, let alone a 8 GB!  so take my advice and buy this!

<Title>Overall good player, with a few quirks
<Date>Fri Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After coveting this player for the past year and a half, I finally bought my 4gb microphoto used (and apparently abused) from eBay, so I've seen it at its worst. The entire back of the player was covered in white paint, the screen had several scratches, the edges had paint chipped off, and it was sold as-is because it couldn't be installed as an MTP device on the computer. Still, I'll try to give an objective review based on the qualities of the player and not just the appearance and my disgust towards the previous owner.   After doing my best to nurse my player back to health (a format in recovery mode quickly fixed its problem connecting to the computer and nail polish remover got rid of the ridiculous paint), I set out to test its features. I  was impressed from the start. Here are the pros and cons:  PROS: -The blue glow around the edges and underneath the tactile buttons. I love the look it gives to the player and I never tire of it. Sometimes I turn the player on just to look at it! -The additional functions. The FM tuner and microphone are definitely pluses to the player and do their job well, although I use the former more than the latter. I don't use the calendar all that much and don't plan on using the contacts feature much either, but it still is a good thing to have. -The scrollpad. Yes, I know this is a huge annoyance for some people, but honestly, I can't say that I've had too many problems with it and it beats the slow navigation of click buttons. I just set the scrollpad to the lowest sensitivity and I've been fine with it. -The sturdiness. Although mine obviously has a lot of wear and tear, it still works fine. I wonder what the iPod nano would look like if it had undergone the same treatment. -The intuitiveness of the music menu. It has multiple options to enjoy your music such as a search function, a lookup artist function, and even a DJ function with an "Album of the Day" feature if you feel like being random and mixing up your tracks. -The removable battery. This is a huge plus because I don't have to worry about replacing the battery if something were to happen to it as opposed to having to send it back to be replaced for a hefty charge. Good move, Creative  Now for CONS: -The sturdiness comes with a price. It's pretty clunky and heavier than my other mp3 players. I don't mind too much, but with the silicone case on it can feel like a small brick. -The OLED screen isn't all that clear or bright and pictures can look pretty blurry -The major complaint for most people: you can't listen to music and browse photos at the same time. I really could care less because I don't usually do that anyway, but I admit this was a pretty big blunder on the part of Creative. -The durability of the hard drive. I don't plan to take this player out for a jog for fear the hard drive will crash, apparently a problem with some of these players (just take a look at the Creative forums and you'll see what I mean). I don't think it would have hurt to use flash memory instead. It definitely would have reduced the weight and clunky feeling of the player.  Overall, this player's great. With great care it should last a pretty long time and you won't regret purchasing it. Try to buy it in good used condition on eBay, though. It's definitely not worth the price new because I bought mine for around $40 and it works like a charm despite cosmetic blemishes. Hope this review helped!

<Title>It's a good player
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got mine for $119 new from amazon. I have to admit after my ipod nano suffered some injuries and later kidnapped, I decided to try a different player because there was a problem with ordering a replacement. It's a good thing too. It player music just as well as a nano, you can use your pictures for wallpaper, it has radio, recorder and other little features, that I honestly don't use, but hey thats a lot more than my nano did. Did I mention it was cheaper too.

<Title>A Great Buy!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is amazing. I have purchased it before, about a year ago, and it worked perfectly until it was, unfortunately, stolen. A few months later, I decided to purchase it again! The touch sensitive effect is really neat, and for those who need it to be more or less sensitive have that option to change in the settings on the actual mp3 player. I also love the photo aspect of it, you can zoom in on pictures and have different sharing folders, and even change the backgrounds. You can personalize it with different color pallettes and types of backgrounds - I love it. The battery life is really good too, and it doesn't take very long to charge up - about 3 hours is my guess. Also, you can purchase more batteries and use them for long term mp3 player use without charging, unlike my other ipods which I had to use them sparingly on road trips because they come with only one internal battery. The headphones are really good quality, and have the ability to be LOUD or soft. Another neat tool is the FM radio, if you ever got tired of your music or just wanted to hear a radio station wherever you are. Oh yeah - a great thing - it's really hard to break. I'm the type of person who ALWAYS drops and ruins things like cameras and phones, but this Creative Zen has proven itself to me. I've dropped it various times, and it's still working. I decided to buy a rubber case for it - that is really neat too because it's extra padding and virtually indestructible. All in all- the Creative Zen Micro Photo was cheap, durable, and all around a great product. I strongly recommend!

<Title>seemed great at first.....then broke.....
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought this was a really nice mp3 player when I first got it.  But the more I use it, the more I hate it!!!  Half the time the buttons/scroll are way too sensitive and the other half of the time they won't work until the tenth try - very frustrating. I do not like the whole menu setup in general either.  It seems to have too many steps to do things.  I hated it even more after I tried out someone's ipod nano.  The ipod made this seem even more bulky and heavy.  Sometimes the USB won't work either.  It won't charge or my computer won't recognize it to download music until the third try.  Then to top it all off, right in the middle of it playing music it just froze!  No matter what I did it stayed frozen, I couldn't even get it to shut off.  Then like an hour later the screen went blank yet the "on" switch was still lit up.  The creative website showed how to boot it in format mode after removing the battery.  This seemed to work but now ALL of my music and data are gone so I have to start all over again.  This happened after just minimal use too!  I have read that others keep having this happen a lot after the first time.  And what's more.....I would have to pay $25 just for them to look at it because it has been more than 90 days.  That is ridiculous!  It's their issue to resolve, I didnt make it malfunction.  Needless to say I will be asking my husband for an Ipod for Christmas! (and throwing this one in the trash)
