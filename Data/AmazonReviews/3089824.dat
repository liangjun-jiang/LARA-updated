<Title>Excellent alternative to that other "high end" portable MP3 player.
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Originally written July 24, 2005.  Well, this is the 3rd Creative product I have purchased and I'm just as satisfied. I was pondering getting this, the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player, or the Creative Zen Touch 20GB MP3 Player. I actually slept on the Zen 40 gig when it was under $200.00. Not this time, I got the 30 gig for $180.00 and I'm very happy.   Other than not having a Radio, it has the features that make or break a MP3 player. I can create Play list on the fly if I desire, import playlist from the computer. There are a zillion EQ settings with the ability to customize my own.   The sound is great, even at 64 kbps WMA format. For hundreds less that the so called leaders, this is a true value and I'm so glad I finally made the purchase. I know I'm forgetting some items, but I'm listening to it as I type and load my CD's onto my computer. This MP3 player is everything I'll ever need.   Recommended: Yes   Amount Paid (US$): 180.00 Recommended for: Music Lovers - High Capacity Storage for an Entire Album Collection   Update: June 15, 2006. Well, a year later and my review is pretty much the same. I can say that I have had a couple of instances where the unit has frozen completely and I had to either reboot or remove and replace (same battery) the battery. This has been a great product for me and I have moved on to the Archos AV500 (sorry Zen Vision M, not enough features to compete). Now the 40 and 60 gig units can be purchased for much less than what I originally paid. Great device, Monk....

<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i liked it.  it was good for a year and a half... then crashed a few days ago.  i bought it for under $200 instead on an ipod.... 10 gigs more for $100 less...good deal to me.  one thing i hated about it was that it's so huge and bulky... somebody actually asked if it was a walkman.  it was my prized possession... i had 2500 songs on it and lost them all....so for that i'm pissed.  i plan on staying with creative and getting a 20 gig Zen Sleek Photo.

<Title>Still works great after 1.5 years
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 30GB player in May 2005.  I have used it constantly since then - at home, in the car, traveling, camping trips.  I have nearly my entire CD collection - over 10,000 songs.    The fidelity is excellent and the battery life is still 12+ hours.  The replacable battery feature is great - I bought an extra battery and fully charge both before going camping where I won't have electricity available.  I have had the problem some have mentioned where the unit freezes and needs to be reset - some times it takes 10+ resets to get it working again.  The problem seems to be with the AC charger, and I found I can completely avoid it by never turning the player on before connecting to AC and disconnecting the AC before turning off.    Another tip: a company called Red Chair Software sells a "Notmad Explorer" interface program that I highly recommend.  Makes organizing, downloading and playlists much easier.  Best feature is a SQL database function that allows you to export results (lists of songs, albums, playlists etc.) to Excel and print them out.

<Title>Batteries Need UpGrade
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This unit is great for meeting storage needs,30GB. This player has huge, unacceptable flaws. The bad news starts with the lithium battery. The battery(fully charged) does not hold charge longer than 70 minutes at a Volume setting of 19 or higher. What's worse, is that you cannot hear audible sounds under a volume setting of 16 through headphones. Even at full volume of 25, it is difficult to hear sound in outside environments. One more thing_If you shutdown the player after a full charge, and leave unit alone for anytime longer than 48 hours:the unit will need to be manually reset. In closing, this MP3 player is definitely not worth the hassle. Note:I bought two replacement batteries only to get the same disappointing results.

<Content>I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3. Though this model is probably dated by today's standards, it has been very reliable and has none of the battery issues of the ipods.

<Title>Maybe worth the cost!
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a Zen Xtra 30G player.  It frequently needed to be reset, which is annoying.  I have owned it just over a year now (just!  bought it just before Christmas for my son, who chose to pass on the gift in favor of an iPod) so it's out of warranty.  Although it worked OK, Windows Media Player 11 said I needed to update the Zen software.  Using Creative's instructions and downloads, the player ceased to work; the computer sees it, but Zen's firmware program does not.  It cost me several hours of struggling with their web pages and downloads, and I finally gave in and PAID $13 for them to tell me that apparently the card went bad, just as I was updating (of COURSE, it was not their fault, nor caused by the software, just a coincidence, he said)  They'll fix it for $95-135, or the rep suggested that I just buy a new one.  I will.  It won't be a Creative player--the rep estimated 1-2 years of lifespan.  If you decide to buy one, I suggest that you pony up the forty bucks they charge (on a NEW one)to guarantee their product at least two years.  UPDATE:  I again contacted Creative, and they identified Media Player 11 as the cause.  They provided complete instructions to roll it back to Player 10, and to reinstall the firmware.  My Zen is working again, and is back to being full of my favorite music.  I must commend their Tech Support for not just leaving me to swing in the wind.  You can feel my frustration in my original posting, but my opinion of Creative improved considerably, thanks to the extra effort of the tech and the tech's supervisor.  I would change my review to three stars, but it won't let me.

<Title>It's mostly fine for me
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I give it four stars 'cause I've had it for a few months and the harddrive is fine and I've dropped it [many times] and it still works. One big problem I have is not with the machine itself, but with the program that came with it. A couple of weeks ago, the program you use to load CDs into the player stopped working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times, and then it wouldn't recognize the driver that is needed to connect the player to the computer. I just learned that you can download new drivers from their website, though, so hopefully that will work when I try it later. The whole program-not-working thing might be because of my computer, which is old and has a tendency to mess things up, hence the reason I didn't give it lower than four stars.  Overall, I love this machine. I have 2,278 songs in it [and many more still need to be loaded in] and it's so much more convenient than carrying around a bunch of CDs. I'm one of those indecisive people who used to leave the house with one CD, only to end up wishing I had brought something completely different. This is a godsend for people who have way too many CDs and want to listen to a diverse mix of music on the go [even if they don't have a CD burner to make mixes, which was my problem before I got the jukebox player]. Plus, its cheaper than an iPod, it's battery is replaceable [unlike the iPod, where Apple charges $100 for a battery replacement], and it holds more songs than the cheapest full-size iPod, which is actually more expensive than the Nomad Jukebox player.  It's a good buy. But I'd get the warranty, 'cause you never know what'll happen.

<Date>Wed Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 60GB player in December 2003. The headphone jack immediately failed within the 1st month, even though I took extra care in handling this unit, always had it in its protective case, and never dropped it. I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for the previous review from &quot;seleniumdream&quot;. I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one.

<Title>A few downsides, but still one of the cheapest HD mp3 audio 
<Date>Fri Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this player for some time now. It's biggest downside, is that the bundled software didn't work for me, it was very unstable and would crash frequently, which was very frustrating, but thank God there is another software called &quot;Notmad Explorer&quot; which does the job all right, although you must pay $25 bucks for it. CD-Ripping and MP3 compression can be done much, much better by other free software like EAC and Lame.  The players physical aspect is not close to that of the nice iPod, but mine came with a nice carrying case that let's you see the screen and use the controls.    The player does what it's made to do: play mp3 and wma. There is not much more in it, no recording microphone, no games, no text... but it can be used as an external hard drive, but only for moving/copying files. Its database system is not fantastic, but it works.     Pros:  -More than $150 cheaper than the iPod of 20GB (July 2004)  -Li-Ion battery lasts about 12hrs.  -Fast USB 2 into 30 GB portable, for $200    Cons:  -No remote control  -No microphone  -Not recognized as an external drive in My Computer by Windows XP  -Bundled headphones or worthless  -I don't love the Quick Scroller    It has freezed a couple times, and I have dropped it, but it still works fine.    So the player is not fantastic, I had to buy some Sony MDR-EX71SL headphones and the Notmad software to use it decently, but after that it has worked well and I feel pretty satisfied with my purchase, the iPod is a lot nicer, fashionable and expensive... So I'll get one when I don't care much about money.  I only want to enjoy music and listen to some audio books, and this player does that very well, so I'm happy with it.

<Title>Great Product!! But buy the new Zen Touch!!
<Date>Sat Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, i kinda know you "adults" won't listen to a "kid" but I'm dying to say this. This product is great, considing the price, comparing it to the iPod (I'm saying this becuase I had to pay for it myself). I LOVE the EAX Audio features, with the virtual environment and smart volume. The sound qualities great! I personaly don't really like the iPod because it's feels like Apple wants to suck up all your money with all the accessories and iTunes. The removable battery is a great feature for the long term, because eventually the battery will die. The advertissed battery life isn't as long though, it's only about 6-7 hours. The case is real cool because it look nice and you can actually access the buttons and see the screen. Although, the size and weight compared to other Mp3 players is that lovely, it's kinda bulky. It's a pain in the neck trying to navigate through 30GB(about 1000 songs) with a small scroll wheel kinda thing with one hand. And too sad it doesn't have a remote though, it would be a lot better since I bike with it in a bag. And when you try to switch songs you have to take it out. Overally, this is one of the best mp3 player i've ever owned. I'm returning it though, becuase the new ZEN TOUCH look and probably is better (it's smaller too). To conclude this is a great product overall. Buy it if you want a high capacity mp3 player and is restricted by money.

<Title>Beware
<Date>Sat Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My hard drive failed at seven months. I knew that dealing with Creative was not going to go well as they had already scammed me on the rebate. The technical service is horrible and unprofessional- Creative does not stand behind its products and treated me with contempt and disrespect. And that's if you can get them to answer the phone. I purchased an Ipod after that and even though there is the battery issue, Apple has a totally different attitude towards its customers and technical support. Especially with the recent decreases in ipod prices, drop your coffee habit for a month or two and spend the additional money it takes to get a truly great product- the Ipod.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Sun Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my player for almost 9 months now and so far so good.  There have been a couple of downsides, the ear buds they supplied hit the trash right away as did the cover they supplied. The ears buds were junk and WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU SUPPLY A COVER THAT COVERS THE DISPLAY SCREEN????  The only other irritating item is the battery switch.  It's on the bottom of the unit and always pops the door open.  Obviously, the engineer who designed this had no intention of ever actually using the player himself.  Since this is my first player, I'm relatively happy with it as I've learned to work around the above items.

<Title>Bad Support, Short Sighted Design
<Date>Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received a Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra for Christmas last year.  It worked fine for six months and then the headphone jack malfunctioned.  It was out of warranty, but it certainly wasn't time to pitch it a get a new one.  I returned it to Creative to have the jack replaced.  This cost $20 for an initial evaluation.  After a couple of week Creative called me and said that the unit would have to be replaced with a refurbished unit at a cost of $200.  New units can be purchased for $239.  I thought this was stupid since the harddrive is completely detachable from the rest of the unit (surely half the cost).  It made me wonder if they can't fix a bad headphone jack, what on earth could they fix.  Seems like they scammed me for $20 in addition to their bad product.  Since the unit was completely functional except for the headphone jack, I chose to have the unit returned without repair and use it as a portable harddrive.  I had also hoped that I could listen to the music through my computer.  It wouldn't be completely portable, but I could take it to work.    I then made two painful discoveries.  First, the headphone jack on the jukebox is the only audio output, even though you can control the unit from your computer using Creative's software and the software appears to have functionality to change the output.  Secondly, there is no way to access the jukebox as a generic mass storage device, so you can use another media program.  Consequently, I have to drag files over to my computer harddrive to listen to them.   The jukebox will also not let you copy protected files to a computer.  Pretty short sighted when you consider that there is no way to backup your protected files.  Jukeboxes are great and I will buy another one.  It won't be a Creative product.

<Content>Can't help feeling that another reviewer's comments about Creative's business plan might be accurate. Looks nice, performs well but the headphone adaptor seems almost designed to break. I suspect the 30 day warranty is because Creative knows this.  I'm certainly not an Apple freak and would rather buy something else, but feel MOST reluctant to buy anything from Creative ever again. Oh - maybe that wasn't such a cool business plan on their part after all ...

<Title>Good price for a good mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for about three months now, and it has been working very well. Size and looks don't really matter for me, so I have no issue with it being big or bulky. It's lighter and smaller than a cd player, at any rate.   Positive things: - Good price - Excellent sound quality - Replaceable battery; the lack of this feature is a major drawback of the ipod. Li-ion betteries always die sooner or later, and its nice being able to replace it instead of buying a new mp3 player. - It supports non-latin alphabets, which is good for me because I have a lot of foreign music.  A few drawbacks: - The software that it comes with really is crap. - Short warranty; although I haven't needed it yet - I still have not figured out a way to sort my music by folders and not ID3 tags. A friend with an older version of this player tells me that its possible, but I did not discover it yet. - I wish it had more accessories to go with it. - Every once in a while it freezes up and you have to take the battery out or press the reset button. - Battery life is actually not that long, especially if it is not depleted completely before recharging.

<Content>Battery life sucks big time!  It's always on low.  The iPods are nice, but overpriced.  This unit gives you a lot of storage, but creative doesn't put too much thought into their products.  Their software always sucks... For example you cant just use windows explorer to copy files, music over.  You have to install a large software install which then gives you an explorer "like" interface.  Why didn't these bozos just make this thing plug and play and act as a hard drive?  It's not very convenient that way.  They do however give you a leather case which apple charges too much for.  I wouldn't recomend this unit.

<Title>A thousand times better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went shopping for MP3 players when I found out I was getting sent to Iraq.  I had no desire to lug my 200+ CD's around the desert.  I, like others, was thinking iPod.  The guy at Circuit City changed my mind though, this thing was $90 cheaper than the iPod and 10GB more!  I like the interface better than the iPod, for example if it ever stops responding there is a little reset button on the back.  The first time a friend had a problem with his iPod it took us hours to figure out the reset key sequence.  I like that it has a replaceable battery and that you don't have to use iTunes.  An earlier review states that you *MUST* use Nomad Explorer ... this is simply NOT TRUE.  I did NOT install the Nomad Explorer software at all, I use MusicMatch Jukebox to manage it, but I can also just open it in Windows Explorer and treat it like a folder.  I repeat, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE NOMAD EXPLORER, all you have to do is install the Jukebox driver.  I HATE how Apple FORCES its customers to use iTunes and iTunes only.  Anyway, I have had it for about a year now and it works PERFECTLY.  I have been trucking around the desert with it now for about 6 months with NO PROBLEMS.  I listened to it almost non-stop on the flight from Indiana to Kuwait and it kept on trucking (of course I had it in sleep mode because I knew I would fall asleep, so it turned off every time shortly after I fell asleep).  I think some of the previous reviewers haven't read their manual.  You CAN create playlists on the unit, and you can create multiple playlists.  You can play random tracks by genre, artist, album, or (my favorite) play any track.  I have seen several guys have their iPods go bad over here.  My commander saw my Zen Xtra and liked it enough to go buy one himself.  I have almost 3,500 songs on this thing and PLENTY OF SPACE TO SPARE.  I don't even buy CD's anymore, it's all electronic.  BTW, this thing sounds AMAZING with my Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones.  At this stage in the game Creative has successor products out there, but in my opinion the Zen Xtra is still a great buy.

<Title>This really is a good player
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm in high school, and I see EVERYONE with an iPod. So when my birthday came rolling around, I naturally asked for an iPod. However, my dad ended up getting me this instead, and I was very disappointed with its appearance. It looked huge and I was embarrassed of it. I've had it for over a year now, and I am now ashamed that I used to be ashamed of it. It plays all my music really well and putting music on it is really easy and fast. I don't carry it in the case it comes with because then it just looks amazingly HUGE, but I've dropped it several times and it still works fine. I have more songs than I can listen to and still lots of room for more. And even though it's slightly unattractive compared to some other MP3 players, it is worth the price and can easily be hidden in a bag ;) But, honestly, the most important part of any MP3 player is that it works well and plays well, not how pretty it looks, and this Creative definitely does both. I highly reccomend this to those who want to save money and can still easily enjoy their music wherever they are.

My only complain has always been it's uglyness, it's so large and ordinary, but to me price and performance is more important than trendy devices disguised with eyecandy, so I've managed. But it did cost me $240.00 and for such a price, I've been more than happy with its performance. Great deal.

<Title>Good quality, long lasting
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this player for a year and a half now. I have to say, it's more long lasting (and tougher) than I thought it would be.   Size: This thing is pretty big. I have not had a problem carrying it around- I mostly use it around the house (I recently boxed up all my CD's and only use MP3s), in the car, and at work when I'm not moving around much. I have recently orgered a small 1 gig flash memory player to use when I am more active, and I think this is a nice compromise.   Interface: The buttons are on the sides, and I love this. When it's in a pocket or bag, I can reach in and control the volume or skip a track without looking at the player. This is also nice in the car- I put it in the storage slot with the skip buttons facing out, so it's easy to control without taking my eyes off the road. There is no lock switch (you can access a lock feature through the player) but the buttons aren't that sensitive so I have not had a problem. The jog dial on the side is pretty small, but since I have small hands, this has not been a problem. The downside to this method of control is that it can take forever to cycle through a large numbers of albums.  You can download an update to the firmware that lets you use Windows Media instead of the software that comes with the player. I did this because I found the software that came with the player was having trouble with my 20 gigs of MP3's.  Durability: I have dropped my player, sat on it, and generally beat it up, and it's fine. I thought it would be flimsier- the entire front comes off to replace the battery, but it has not been a problem.   Battery power: When I first got the player, the battery lasted as long as the rating. Now that I've had it for a while, it's down to 6-10 hours.   Sound: I don't really have much to compare the sound to, but it sounds good to me. The sound presets are great, and it's plenty loud enough to play through my home stereo. I can't comment on the earbuds that came with the player, as they were too big for my ears- this is a problem with almost all earbuds for me, though. I ended up buying Sony's Fontopia in the ear earbuds,and those work quite well.   In the end, this has been a good player. There are better players out there now, but if you can get a good deal on this one, I would reccomend it.

<Title>Design Flaw in Headphone Adapter - Steer Clear
<Date>Mon Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content> In comparing the price of this player to others, be sure to factor in having to pay an additional $175 every 60-90 days of use.  That's how much it costs to have the headphone jack fixed by Creative.  Unless you're good with a soldering iron and don't mind fixing it yourself, this is a product to be avoided.  Sad too because it worked great for the first 60 days.  Shame on Creative for not fixing this defect free of charge.

<Title>Works Great!
<Date>Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Xtra for about 7 months now and have had almost no problems with it. I read the other reviews and I haven't had any of the same problems. I found both the player and the software easy to use. My favorite thing about my player is the EAX sound effects. You can listen to songs in fast forward or slow motion, without distorting the pitch. You can turn it on night mode which stops sudden increases in volume making it easier on your ears. The buttons and the scroller are at the sides of the player, so you avoid accedentally pressing buttons while the player is in your pocket, and it makes it much less awkward to use them. My only problem with it is the headphones, I couldn't get them to stay in my ears, so i just bought some different ones.

<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item in May of '04 and it worked perfectly...for ninety days. I tried my very best to take care of this expensive piece of equipment and the headphone jack STILL went out on me. You're lucky if you purchase this and don't have a problem with it. Sure, in my opinion its the best MP3 player out there- that is, when it works. Luckily, I bought a 2 year protection plan on it and I'll get my money back. There's just no reason to take yhour chances on whether you'll buy one that has a faulty headphone jack- you're better off going with the more expensive Ipod, or maybe even the new Sony Network Walkman.

<Title>Great MP3 Player at a good price
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player from Amazon.com about 4 months ago, and i only have good things to say about it. It has great storage and a good design. I have used the ipod, and i prefer using this player because of how it was made for computers with windows and it allows you to play wma files (which i havent tried yet) but its nice to know you can play more than just MP3's. Also i love how it comes with a case. I know a few people with ipods, and the ones who didnt buy a case now have a very bad looking ipod. This comes with a nice (fake) leather case that protects it, and after 4 months of hard use, it still looks and works brand new. The batter has great life and i hardly ever charge it, i just leave it in my car all the time. Transferring files onto it is very fast and simple. I would recommend this player over the ipod to anybody wanting a player with lots of storage capacity at a great price. Buy it!

<Title>Best thing I've bought in a while
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am in the Navy and I bought this right before I deployed for six months. It was by far the best thing I took along with me. I don't know what I would have done without it. On a ship there is not much storage space, especially for hundreds of cd's. This fit right in my pocket or hung on my belt and was with me everywhere i went. I don't know what I would have done out there in the ocean without my music! I had no problems whatsoever, and was able to upload music from anyone that had something I liked on the ship. For those of you in the military, this is definately the toy for you! I used it often while jogging and working out, I dropped it many of times, and I have never had a problem yet. My favorite feature was the play random song because with over 200 cd's worth of music, you never know whats going to come up next. I recomend this to anyone who wants a cheaper but extremely reliable mp3 player.

<Title>The best reason not to buy an iPod
<Date>Thu Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I first started looking for a portable jukebox, I--like everybody else--was drooling for an iPod. Then I did my research, and here's why I decided on the Zen Jukebox Xtra: (1) the iPod battery is not user-replaceable, you have to pay $60 for a two-year Apple plan in order to get it replaced, and you have to send the unit back to them to get it replaced (evidently it starts losing its charge about six months into ownership); (2) huge storage space--I have my entire CD collection on it plus a whole bunch of downloaded tracks at high quality and I've still only used half the space; (3) sound quality is fabulous, especially if you spring for a decent pair of headphones. As far as durability goes, granted I haven't passed the dreaded 90-day-warranty mark, but it goes with me trail-running daily (because of other reviews I've read, I hold it in my hand over rough spots so it doesn't get jostled too much) and in the car on long drives a few times a week. I've also dropped it from a pretty good height with no damage. My one complaint? No support for MP4. BUT...you can upgrade the firmware to be Real Player compatible (their downloads are only 49 cents) and I've found the process easily done. Good tech support as well. I just don't think there's a better value for the money.

<Title>Great product-- for a little while
<Date>Mon Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my second Nomad Jukebox, and I should have learned after the first one.  The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03.  It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me.  No amount of tech support would bring it back to life.  I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.    The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me.  I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months.  Then the headphone jack stopped working.  Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod.

<Content>I've had this guy over a year now and i'm totally satisfied with it. It has crashed a couple of times, but there is a nice little reset button that takes care of things in a flash. The software is a little klunky to say the least, too much of stuff bundled in something that's meant to be real simple!   Other than those 2 quirks, works like a gem, one of the other reviewers had concerns over durability, i think it has survived me pretty good! great features and it looks great, personally i don't like the iPod's plastic look. I much rather would have something like the Creative. Controls are great easy to get used to. A nice add on is the FM wired remote.   One thing that could have been useful is a sleep timer or something, but that's probably included in the later versions

<Content>this is by far the best deal for hard drive based mp3 players. im extremely satisfied with my purchase, its an excellent player at an amazing price. ipods are a total rip off, if you want to pay $400 for a nice case then go ahead, but you'll be getting one of the worst players on the market. a 15 gig ipod retails for $250. thats half as much memory, much lower sound quality, and a shorter battery life for $50 MORE! ridiculous! this jukebox has excellent sound quality, long battery life, huge storage, and all for less than some crappy flash based players. do some research and you'll see this is a great player. the only thing better than this is the iriver hp120, but it costs a good deal more. the fact of the matter is, if you dont care about price get an iriver, if price matters get this player!

<Content>I've had my Creative Jukebox for over 1 year and have so far had no problems with it and the review that says you can't use the Janus thing from some services might be true but you can get around that by transferring the music to your computer and then transferring to the creative.I haven't had any freeze up problems with my unit so far but I think all ipod devices freeze at some point.I've even heard about people reporting that apple ipods occassionally freeze up.The only negatives I've found with the creative jukebox is the battery life isn't that long between charges and you can't transfer video from your computer to your creative zen.I've got some game trailers on my computer that won't go to my zen it's just for music.The big plus in this product is the much cheaper price than apple and the battery is replacable.I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great player!
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I bought this player way back in June this year, and since there were plenty of reviews of bad happenings with this player, I waited until now to submit a review.    So, this player is pretty big.  That really doesn't bother me though, I think its great, compared to the CD and cassette players of yesterday.  I bought this player because it offered the most for the cost, including the size.  Making electronics small tends to be more expensive, except TVs, unfortunately....  If size is not a big deal to you, this player is perfect.  If you want something small, maybe this one ain't so great.  I live and work on a farm, and I bought this player because I like my music, and dislike a lot of the stuff on the radio.  This unit gets a pretty good gauntlet run on it in my job: dirt, bouncing, and all the stuff you would expect.  I am not saying I don't take care of it, I just am pointing out those little things that just happen no matter how hard you try to protect it.  I have put it through a lot of that sort of thing too, and as of this time, I haven't had even a little bit of trouble.  Battery life is a big issue too, I know, and my experience is that on full blast (FM transmitter), it will run for over eight hours, probably around nine or ten, I just started a little down, and stopped a little before dead.    All in all, its a great player.

<Content>I absolutely love my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Ztra 30 GB.  I initally had a problem because it didn't seem to hold a charge.  Fortuneately I had a pocket pc that used the same power adapter so I plugged in the unit without the battery and it worked fine.  Not the end of the world to get a working power cord.  This works with audible.com books but you first need to update the driver and firmware.  You can't create folders but can play based on genre, artist, album so forth.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a really cool gadget.  I have had the nomad jukebox zen xtra for a year and it's still just as good as the day I got it.  First of all, this player is about the same price as an ipod(depending on which product your talking about), and it has freakin 30 gigs!  That is a whole lotta songs!(for those of you who are technologically challanged)  Yes, it's true, this player is kinda big as far as most mp3 players go, but as long as it can fit in my pocket, this doesn't matter to me.  Some people have said that it is difficult to find what song you want on the player, but I figured it out in a few minutes.  It's not difficult at all.        Another thing I like about this player is the EAX audio options.  If your in a car, change the audio to CAR.  If your on a plane, change the audio to PLANE, etc.  You can also speed up the song, or slow it down(which can be quite hilarious if your listening to a rap song).  There are many other audio options that I won't go into.        The software that comes with the player is good.  Creating playlists is easy, and you can play the songs you have on your player right on the computer(but you have to put them on the computer first, of course).     One minor problem is that occasionally,(4 or 5 times ever) the player freezes up when I turn it on.  But this can be fixed quickly and easily by reseting the player.  The headphones that come with the player are a bit odd(you will have to see them to know what I mean).  But you can always buy new headphones.       This player never skips, which is cool.  I've shaken it as hard as I can and the song continues to play flawlessly.  This is great for jogging or working out with the player.     Last of all, don't listen to the reviews complaining that their players don't work.  This only happens with 1 out of a couple hundred.  I understand that they are upset, but there is no need to dis an mp3 player of which you've never seen it's full potential.    Buy this player for Christmas, Hannukah, a birthday, whatever.  You will be a happier person.

<Title>After a year Creative's Nomad still proves to be a great buy
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was given this MP3 player last Christmas and over the year it has peformed great for me, which silenced all of the doubt about this player that other reviewers spoke of. This player has some nice features such as the EAX audio, quick song or artist search, and great easy to use software. I dont really like the Media Source software much for playing audio and video on my computer, but I love using it to manage all of the music and files on my MP3 player. The only thing I can complain about as far as features is the fact that this player doesnt have an AM/FM tuner built in, which the new Creative 30GB out this year has. However, with all of the songs you can load onto this puppy, finding something to listen to wont be a problem. If you are interested more in great storage, sound and value, then check out Creative's line of MP3 players. They will definitely beat out anything that Apple has to offer.

<Title>If it does have problems, it's easy to fix yourself!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Nomad Zen Xtra for over two years now. I had dropped it several times without problem. One day it fell from about  18-20" and that killed the hard drive. I didn't keep it in the sleeve it came with but I do now! Since my warranty was already expired I took the chance and cracked open the case as I had found instructions online on how to swap out the hard drive. So for the fraction of the cost of a new player of any brand, I bought a new, even larger hard drive and replaced it. It was incredibly simple.   And yes, the headphone jack does come loose, but I really used mine very heavily (almost daily for 6-8 hours per day) and would remove the headphones from the socket to plug the player into my car or stereo at home. However, if you have a friend w/ a soldering iron, this is some what easy to fix too - online instructions galore.  I think it's a great player and the sound, capacity and price are far better than that of the ipod. I don't give this 5 stars because I do think the buttons are a bit clunky and not intuitive. The software that comes with this devise isn't very good, but again, for a few bucks you can get some really, really good third party software that works via Windows Explorer. And the fact that you can change your battery (I bought a spare when I was going to be travelling a lot and couldn't be sure I'd have access to recharge my battery), I can change the hard drive and I can make other repairs if necessary because I can get into the case which is not the case w/ an ipod!   I'm considering buying the newer version of this and giving my sister this one.

<Content>I've owned one of these 9 months, but about 2 months ago the power jack started getting screwy.  It basically refuses to charge unless I fiddle with it for an hour.  I opened it and it needs to be resoldered in a very hard to reach place.  I finally broke down and bought an iPod instead, and I can say for an $80 difference the change in technology is astounding (much better screen, interface, less annoying software).  I far recommend the iPod to this nowadays (at the time it was a good deal for 30 gigs)  The design is pretty ugly, it's larger than it needs to be, easy to break, the interface is irritating to use and the software is *horrible*.  However, it *is* $220 so if you can live past these problems it will get you by.

<Content>If you want a lot of storage and a basic mp3 player, this is the way to go. However, I do wish I had gone with the Ipod and plan to upgrade... but its all personal preference.  PROs ~Its not picky about file types; you can download just about anything (labeled/licensed or not) and it will play it.  This is not possible on Ipod.    ~Ease of use;  just plug and play.    ~Creative music software; this is a really convienient program and I actually use this over Windows media player.   ~Can use as a external hard drive.  I have about 15 gbs of photos stored on it.  Can't view the photos, of course, just store them.    CONs ~Somewhat heavy and bulky.  I can't workout with it.  Then again, it does have a 30 gb hard drive, so its a tradeoff.  ~The metal case.  Mine doesn't fit exactly right, and makes getting to some of the buttons difficult.    ~The battery is iffy; sometimes it doesn't hold charge.  ~Cheap headphones/case.  Overall, if style matters to you, pass on this.  If it doesn't, you will like it!    ~This might be glaringly obvious to everyone but me, but it is Windows/PC only, not compatible with Macs.

Since then I have upgraded the firmware twice much to creatives credit, including the now playforsure compatibility. It now stands as an equal to the ipod as far as portablity. Its a little bulky compared to the mp3 players available now but I'm not ready to trade up yet. My gripes are the travel case doesnt have a window so its pointless, and you'll have to buy one if you want one.  also the buttons are clumsy and the headphones are uncomfortable. as far as purchasing a new mp3 player now i would get one with the color screens and possibly video player but thats yet to be seen.

Instructions on how to use the player are vague and navigating thru the nomad can be a chore.With all the said, however, i can say that after you get used to the way it works and how to retreave your songs, it really works great. i am sure there are easier mp3 players to use out there but the quality of the music cant be beat. i am buying 3 more for my family for christmas this year

<Title>You take care of it, it takes care of you--Great Product!
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my Nomad Jukebox since the end of June with no problems.  I was at the checkout with an iPod, watching it and all its accessories for a PC add up to nearly $600 and gulping.  Before finishing the transaction, which was rubbing me wrong anyway, I went back to the small electronics department at Best Buy and happened to run into a Creative rep, who showed me the Zen Jukebox and how to use it.  It came with everything for only $240!  The reason I hadn't seen it before is because it wasn't displayed with all the Apple products.  I'm SO glad I bought it.  It has replaced the 6 CD changer in my car because I use an old tape player adaptor with it from an old portable CD player.  I bought some Creative speakers for $50 and mounted them in my bedroom with which to use the Jukebox, so it has replaced a huge boombox I used to have in there.  I used it in the car for a 980 mile x 2 trip to Oregon and the battery never ran out.  It is a VERY GOOD PRODUCT, but you must handle it with care.  Yes, the headphone jack is a bit touchy and not great for jogging, but this is NOT A WALKMAN, this is a mini hard drive and needs to be treated with care.  AND, LAST PIECE OF ADVICE....if there is the option to buy a service plan wherever you shop, BUY IT--whether you buy a Jukebox or an iPod.  It isn't because they are destined to break, but they are delicate, and getting the service plan is just good sense, good insurance, and you'll kick yourself later if something does go wrong and you don't have one.  Happy shopping--buy the Zen Jukebox if you're money conscious.

I did have a sligh problem with the headphone jack - about 4 months after purchase.  I didnt have my recipt and I had paid in cash.  I sent my player into the tech support team with no recipt and they fixed it for free and sent it back to me at no charge in less than a week.  Great customer support which would give me great confidence in buying from Creative anytime.    I dont particulary like the software that is shiped with the player.  I dont think it is as useful as it could be.  It will not sort the songs in a particular play list by name.    But overall its a very good player and a great company.

<Title>Works well, for however long it works
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm in college and I don't have enough money for an iPod, but it would have probably been worth the extra money if i had it.  I treat my Jukebox like it cost me half a month's pay too.  It worked great for a few months, and when the headphone jack broke, I assumed it was just my bad luck.  I paid the $20 service charge because it was a few days out of the three month warranty, and went back to rocking when they returned a replacement.  Now, just out of warranty again, it stopped working completely.  I've sent it back a second time and when this is over, I will have paid at least $300 dollars total for the thing.  It works well when it works, even if you hold it while jogging or working out, but you better be prepared to pay if you want to keep it working.  Looking at the other reviews on here, I guess my case is unique, but I surely would have gone with the Dell DJ or even shelled out the beans for an iPod if I had it to do over.

<Title>If you are bouncing, don't get a hard drive based MP3 player
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Benjamin Young's review states that he's had problems while using the Zen Xtra while working out and jogging. Well, any hard drive based MP3 player -- including the iPod -- is going to have problems if you bang it around (think what would happen if you took your laptop with you while jogging). There are memory buffers in these devices to preload content from the hard drive so that if the hard drive skips you won't hear it in the headphones. The Zen Xtra uses a laptop-sized hard drive. Smaller hard drives such as are found in the Zen Micro, Zen Touch, iPod Mini, the Rio Carbon are less prone to skipping, but they're still fragile. These jukebox models aren't really meant to be treated violently, despite what Apple's marketing might tell you.  If you're going to be bouncing around while using an MP3 player, use a flash memory based unit. They're lighter, cheaper and can take almost any amount of shock short of actually damaging the case or buttons.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got a NOMAD Zen Xtra 30GB and its really cool. It has worked flawlessly , without any problems for last 2 months. Software is also great to keep it in sync with ur PC. Or if u want to save space u can directly manage the mp3s on the jukebox. Battery is long-lasting, haven't tried to run it for full 14 hrs though. Have to try it out... Only thing that is missing is FM tuner and a line-in to record mp3s directly like some other expensive players have. That would have made it 5 stars. The wake to alarm feature is cool, you can wake to your favorite soothing songs, rather than a wake up beep.

<Title>Purchased 2 weeks back, not bad
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I bought one from best buy, just 2 weeks back, and have been compairing it to ipod since then. but my perticular player has some problem for adding songs to playlist, Or may be i am doing someting wrong. If i am in say Music folder, then Artist, and then Song, if I select a song and say "Add to Play List" the song does not get added to play list, and the highlighted option on the previous menu shifts one position down !!! apart from this , it is a very good player. I think the biggest disadvantage is the Size.. these things are going to get smaller and smaller , so in next 4-5 months this is going to look like the thing of 80's.. Biggest disadvantage of Ipod was If i am browsing some menu and want to reduce/increase volumn of the currently playing song..I CANT !! thats pathetic.  In this aspect Zen is much better because the volumn buttons are seperate !  the other options that zen have (and ipod does not) are just TOO cool.. like virtual sound etc (EPX settings)  I guess its a choice between saving $100 or looking cool !!  will keep compairing the 2 till zen touch or micro comes out

<Content>I would prefer the iPod as my child and I live a very physically active life and would like to take music with us everywhere.  But overall, if you can't afford a more expensive unit (maybe because your ex is a deadbeat parent), this unit will do.  Add it to your wishlist--a great Amazon feature--this is how my son receives gifts nowadays.  But, as in many things in life, your expectations for this product cannot *warrant* what they should.

<Title>Pretty good for the gym
<Date>Fri Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this to reward myself for 6 months of daily workouts, and I am very pleased with it. The software and user interface took a couple of tries to get used to, but now, I can sit down to my computer and rip my favorite cuts from CD (at my chosen quality level of 192) as fast as my system can process.   At the gym, I have no problem whether I am riding the bike, bouncing on the elliptical trainer, or lifting weights. I've dropped it a couple of times, but it hasn't missed a note.   Two minor points: the included earphones were useless, as I could not get them to stay in my ears. $9 at Wal-Mart bought me a great pair of Sony's  The other is that I haven't seen the battery actually go for 14 hours without charging. 9 was more like it.  Other than that, I have been very happy with my Zen Nomad.

<Title>A better alternative to Apple IPod
<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This unit is great. I wanted the features of an Ipod without the very expensive cost of one and the Creative Zen delivers. The unit requires about 15 minutes of reading to learn how to use it. The user replacible battery is a good idea. The Creative software needs a little updating though, it's not as smooth as I thought it waould be for downloading music from your library to your zen. But aside from that it really is an Ipod killer.

<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got this Creative mp3 player a few weeks ago and am MORE than happy with it. I used to use a Creative Jukebox 2 and the Zen Xtra shows the same attention to quality and detail.  Of course this small player is still a bit larger than an ipod but the features make it an even trade.  The EAX effects are amazing and work well with the music.  It's also got a pretty good battery life (I've used it for two weeks and it's only my second time charging it).  All in all, I think this is a much better choice than an ipod especially since it is much much cheaper.

<Title>I've had this thing for OVER a year and...
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...I must say, IT STILL WORKS!  When I purchased this thing, the two main things on my mind were SPACE and COST.  If you don't care about the Color Screens, FM Tuners/Recorders, Voice Recorders, or that you can play pong on your MP3 player (or whatever games iPod boasts), then this player is for you.    If I'm any indication, ignore those people who gripe and moan about user interface, included software, and size.  Unlike the more recent iPods, and even recent players by iRiver and Creative, you're not dealing with a click/scroll wheel.  All of the major buttons you'll be dealing with are on the sides of the player, and can be navigated with one hand.  To scroll, it uses a "jog wheel", which may take about 5 to 10 minutes to get used to - TOPS.  The next issue that I'd like to address, and use myself as an example to debunk, is the complaint about software.  Okay, the Zen Xtra can't be seen as an external harddrive, so the only way to move files back and forth is through Creative's Media Organizer.  Maybe I'm not sure what the anti-creative crowd is complaining about, but the software is insanely easy to use as far as moving files to your player goes.  Honestly, you'd have to be pretty computer illerate to not be able to figure out the software within 10 minutes, and I'm no computer expert myself.  Though if you're not a fan of Creative's software either way, there is a program out there called "Notmad", but I've yet to find a reason to not use their Media Organizer.  Oh yeah, a BIG stigma Creative has that I have not experienced: the headphone jack issue.  I don't know whether I'm one of a lucky few, or there is just a silent majority, but I've had no issues with my headphone jack going out on me or anything.  Take that for what it's worth.  Also on the subject of headphones, I don't recommend the stock headphones, just because I'm not really a fan of stock phones, but other than iPod users, how many people use the in box headphones anyway?  Seriously, to enjoy the music at it's fullest potential, just look for some better phones.  I love the EQ/EAX settings on this product, as I set it to different pre-sets for each environment I'm in (I change it when I'm in the car, listening through headphones, etc.), and the screen is good enough for me to see in any situation.  I must also mention the removable battery, something I wish MP3 Players would implement more often.  Assuming the harddrive doesn't die first, I really wouldn't have to upgrade/buy a new player as long as I can find a replacement battery.  Much better, and probably cheaper than those who have to replace their internal batteries through the company, in my opinion.  Finally, let's talk about size and aesthetic.  No, it's not as slim or "sexy" as other players out there, so it won't look good if you're wearing tight pants and small pockets.  The carrying case makes it even bulkier, but if size and aesthetic isn't as important as price and space, then looking at the Zen Xtra is an excellent option.  To conclude this somewhat long review, if you're not into all the jazz and features being offered by Cowon's iAudio X5, iRiver's H10, and the new line iPods, then go for the Zen Xtra.  If the touch pads, the color screens, and other bells and whistles do not appeal to you, then the Zen Xtra is for you.  If you need a player that deals with music (mp3, WAV, wma) and gets the job done - keep the Zen Xtra in mind.  Finally, if you are on a budget, take one more look at the Zen Xtra.  Personally, my next purchase (from Amazon this time) will probably be an iPod Photo 60GB, because my wants in a player have changed in the past year.  I'd still recommend Creative's Zen Xtra to anyone with a tighter budget, but I'd love it if they atleast gave me a color screen with their 20/30/40/60GB models.  I know people like me, who need that much space, may be a rare breed, but don't leave us out totally!  Once again, consider this product if you need the space for music, want to save some money, and don't care too much about it not being as thin as a pencil.  It's well worth the cost, especially if you can find some good (cheap) deals on it!

I like realplayer and it allows you to use realplayer to download your songs as well as other places.  Do not stick yourself with just I tunes - get diversified.

<Title>Ok player, but not worth the money.
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I finally decided on the Zen Xtra, after some time of looking around. I didn't want an Ipod due to the fact I didnt enjoy the sound and price, but thats a differnt review. I decided to buy this because of the following:  - Changeable battery - Huge memory - Very cheap  I live in Paris, so I was extremly excited when it finally arrived. I installed the cd and the program it came with. It took me about 25 mins to understand how to simply add music but once I understoud it I placed all of my music on it in a time span of about 1 hour. Not bad I say, Usb was pretty fast.  Now comes the faults...  -It is extremly large compared to the current 20gb+ Mp3s out there. It was a pain to put in my pocket, and if you have a small hand then good luck on operating the Zen. I can only describe it as a big silver brick.  - The scroller isn't as inuitive as the other mp3s out there either. It didn't always stop where you wanted and sometimes lagged for about a second or two before it would start to move.  - The case it comes with is pointless really. It dose't fit properly, and dosen't protect the screen. All it does it make it harder to hold and 2x bigger.  - And to finish it off... My Zen Xtra died right after the warranty. It had as they call it on the Creative forums/ website a hardware error. Meaning there is nothing I could do. I was told to just buy another. Ha never!!!  Now the good...  - Great Memory, 30gb is alot!  - Ability to have different profiles for different people  - Eax has a range of different options and has ability to make a custom setting.  - Pretty good memory life, I used it about 2 hours a day and reachcharged overnight about 1 or twice a week.  - Removable battery, So you don't have to send entire player to have the battery changed( Like the Ipods).  I think you should just save up for an Ipod or buy an iriver (which I did).

<Title>iPod Killer - less money - great sound - a MUST buy!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I consider myself well versed in the language of portable mp3 players as i've had quite a few since they hit the market, begining back in college.  After using several types (iriver, rio, ipod, creative, olympus, etc...) i can honestly say that I've found the unit that i've been longing for that met each piece of criteria i had.  This unit not only meets my expectations, it exceeds them!  Truth be known, I did have an ipod and was very happy with my purchase.  However, my joy quickly turned to anger as I realized just how limited I was with it.  The battery can not be replaced by the user (you have to pay apple to do that), it only works with itunes software, and apple refuses to release information or software to allow you to use it with music "rental" services like yahoo or napster.  Apple wants to continue to make money off of you long after you buy their ipod.  Battery life began to deteriorate after about 3 months of correct usage.  Also, you're only allowed to contact apple once for a complimentry tech support call.  After that call (in 6 months) you have to purchase an apple care plan which costs over 1/4 the price of the ipod itself.    I finally had enough and decided to do more research into a better player.  I've used several of Creative's products in the past and looked into their new players and discovered the Zen Xtra.  After reading reviews and watching a few demos, i purchased it.  The cost of the unit was $20 more then an ipod mini and my unit has a 40 gig hard drive in it.  Cha Ching!!!  Out of the box, i could tell that the player is a quality unit.  The weight is almost non-existant, barely weighing more then the ipod.  It includes an AC Adapter (you don't get one with an ipod), USB 2.0 cable, carry case, NICE headphones, software, and literature.  The manual was very easy to follow and I was up and running in about 10 minutes.  Even beginner mp3 players will find the set-up easy to follow!    Once the unit was connected the software asks you if you'd like to add music from your My Music folder to the player.  It cofigures itself to work effectively with your computer.  Adding music was a SNAP with the Drag-and-drop feature.  It's incredibly easy to create playlists with as much music as you'd like.  The sound quality with the included headphones is phenominal and the player also utilizes EAX technology which allows you to manually adjust the sound settings to your preference, or even adjust the sound to resemble a concert hall or other locations.  You can adjust sound quality on an ipod, but not to your exact likings as the sound settings are all pre-made on the ipod.  The hard drive is so roomy, i'll never fill it.  At present, I have the 40 gig model and i presently have over 2,500 songs on the player and it's slightly 1/4 full.  It's quiet as a mouse, making virtually no noise as the hard drive spins inside.  Forget about skipping, this player never does... NEVER.  My ipod would get pretty warm/hot after about 30 mins of usage... the zen xtra doesn't even warm up.    The unit does not have a color screen... but... i never noticed the sound quality of my music improving when i had a color screen.  I'm not staring at the screen when my music is playing, i'm doing other things.  The backlight on the zen xtra is a brilliant blue and is easy to read.  You can even customize the way the screen displays information for you.  Navigation is a snap with the click wheel on the side and the buttons are located in easy to reach locations no matter where you store the unit. You can even replace the battery yourself when the time comes, at a fraction of the cost of the ol' ipod.  The battery life is great on this player and you can customize the power settings on this unit to maximize the battery life even further.  Of course.... you can't do this on the ipod either.... At present, i'm getting 13-14 hours on one single charge.  Accessories are easy to come by and the tech support with Creative is truly top notch.  They continue to release firmware updates to support new file types and give you continued features and improvements.  Updating the player is simple with an extensive online support base.  Everything i thought i loved about the ipod is crushed with the creative zen xtra.  Oh, and for you Mac users out there, yes, you can use creative mp3 players on a mac.  The software is called XNJB and it's FREE!  It even works with the USB cable that comes with your zen xtra.  You can also use this player with multiple music services like yahoo and napster.  You can even use this player as a portable Hard Drive to store files and other information on it.  As a graphic designer, i take advatage of this feature extensively.  Don't watch your money burn up, give this player a shot.  You'll fall in love with the features, ease of use, tech support, and impressive sound quality and features.  Don't believe the ipod hype... you're really paying for cool commercial budgets.    Go creative and never look back!

<Title>mostly happy with it
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a very good buy at $150 that I paid. While it was one of the least visually appealing models on the rack (even when compared to other creative players) its performance is very good. Installation was quick and easy. Sound is excellent. Capacity is huge: I've put on it over 8,000 tracks at CD quality (300+ CD collection) and still have about 1.5 GB left.  Some of my complaints: 1. Not possible to shuffle within albums or artists or genres 2. Not possible to re-assign genres or albums from within the unit (must write down which tracks and go back to the comp to do it) 3. A bit too large to hold in your hand and mine are big - slippery plastic adds to fear of dropping - indeed did drop the unit, it slipped out of my hand but survived undamaged - would like a wrist strap - unit comes with a protective belt pouch making it even bigger (belt pouch comes right out when you sit down, so it is useless) 4. Must buy new headphones as the ones included are terrible quality - worse than dollar store 5. Only one bookmark can be placed, and if that was not enough bookmark disapears as soon as you choose different album/artist/genre. What's the point of having bookmark if it doesn't stay on?!?! 6. Copying tracks back to CD is a two step deal - must copy to comp harddrive and then to CD 7. Does not support MP3pro 8. Poor battery life My wishes: 1. Line-in recording 2. Built-in radio + record from radio

<Title>Doesn't support To Go subscription services: don't do business with creative
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before you buy, check out the blogs about Creative's customer service. There IS none! Most of us who spent a lot of money last year to buy a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra were disappointed to find out that this mp3 player does NOT support any of the Janus subscription services (like Rhapsody to Go, Napster to Go, Yahoo's to go service). That is bad enough, but any attempt to get a straight answer from the company about firmware updates (so that we CAN use these very cool services) is met with either no response, or a canned "This device does not support these services at this time."   No one has been able to find out when or even IF they ever will. I suspect not.   The other problem is that both my Nomad and my son's have a serious freeze-up problem, one to the point of not being able to be used.  I would highly recommend another mp3 player if you are considering the Nomad and certainly don't buy from Creative, they  pretty much don't care at all about their customers once you buy from them.

<Title>Awesome - new version has been fixed
<Date>Tue Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The newest version has fixed the headphone jack problem.  That was my only complaint.  The User Interface isn't quite as slick as ipod, but more powerful, and more predictable.  (i.e., it has a power button, ipod does not.  It has a volume button, ipod does not.)  Sound is higher quality as well.  the DbNR is 98 Db.  Apple has never published the DbNR, but most people settle on 90Db or so.  SPL is much higher, and it drives the larger headphones very admirably.  I think Creatives investment in E-mu is beginning to pay off.    Now supports audible and Real.  Only complaint is that there is no lossless file support, although I can't honestly tell any difference between a 320 mp3 and flac.

<Title>So Far, It Works : Part 1
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this player from zipzoomfly.com ($20 rebate, $207 price, free 2 day shipping) about 2-3 weeks ago, and so far its working pretty well.  Player: So far, it hasn't stopped playing or broken down, but i've held it charged up well, and always had it in it's case. I use it in school, and it's in my pocket as i move around, and so far it hasn't been damaged from running, walking, being sat on (once), etc. The only actual problems i have with the player are simple: 1. Unless you have big pockets, this player is going to fit, but it'll be a really tight fit. 2. With the case,its hard to get both the volume and the search buttons, you i have to keep moving my han to reach the bottons. 3. I had downloaded alot of music, and made about 150 playlists so far, and I turned it on, and found only 5 playlists. I quickly solved this problem by resetting it (the library rebuilds in a minute) and had all my playlists back (note: the songs were there, but the playlists only were missing).   The Computer Program: This is probably the worst part of the player. The program isn't bad, as it is annoying. Once you figure out how to use it (relativly simple drag and drop), but using it later is annoying. The music downloads relativly fast on my USB1, so i can only imagine what it can do on USB2. CD ripping CDs is alot slower (but my cd drive is only 4x) but still fast (5-20 minutes per cd). Organizing music is where this player fails: ID3 Tag (is that right?) is a hassle. I recommend making playlists for every artist, becouse otherwise the songs all go into a genral folder, and even at 10gb, thats alot of songs to scroll through. Songs are arranged by ID3 Tags, and if you have any music you downloaded (not from a website like itunes or Sony, but from Kazaa, imesh, winmx, and such), your ID3 taggs wont be accurate, and the artists, genres, etc will be wrong, mis-spelt, etc, and you won't be able to find any of you music. This is why I recommend making playlists for all your artists: if you download into a playlist, you don't have to aggange you music into playlists later, and all the songs are together, for easy managing, renaming, editing, etc (select them all, then right click, edit). Please note this is not a problem if your music is ripped from CDs or from pay-sites (it comes with a program for identifying all your CD music). The last problem is that when you close out, and come back to edit later, the playlists in the left window (think windows explorer) are in a wierd random order, and this is annoying especially if you have over 100 playlists.  Other then the problems with the program, i like the player so far, and look forward to having it last at least a full year, hopefully two. I plan on making another review after a few months, to (hopefully) prove everybody wrong about the player falling apart.

<Content>better than the ipod...really it is... and i hope you arent fooled by apple when your choosing an mp3 player for you, or someone else...  i own this mp3 player and have owned it for almost a year... it does everything it is intended to do, and then some...  it is VERY DURABLE, it survived my freshmen year of highschool, running from friends/dogs while playing,and a 25 foot drop off of the bleachers...(not recommended)  it comes with a case, unlike ipod (who wants to charge you extra for every accesory you might need)  and for the people that complain about the software, YOU RECIEVE UPDATES for it, for FREE so you can manage your library of music, while listening to songs, and burning cds... very cool  and way stronger than the ipod, (metal exterior), theres no annoying touch screen to wear out on this model...  more space than ipod for the price...  EAX effects you can apply to the soungs while listening, which are kinda cool...and the menus are customizable to an extent...  it has a clock, (displays date/time/alarm) hook it up to a pair of computer speakers and you can wake up to tunes every morning...also you can make and save playists by using the menus of the mp3 player, ipod cannot...  ipod is struggling to keep up with competing companies, apple is coming out with useless little knacks to encourage people to buy their product instead, aka: solitaire, calander, ebooks...  let me just say this... IT IS AN MP3 PLAYER... MP3 PLAYERS ARE FOR PLAYING MP3S... and this little device does that very well..  you can use it as a 30GB exterior hard drive if you must... so you can transfer movies, games, and software, from pc to pc..  this is a very cool toy :) , and mine is still holding up strong i highly recomend it...  and if you decide to buy an ipod for some reason, have fun mailing it in for a new battery ever year or so...  this one uses a replacable lithium battery,  (lasting about 14 hours)  just buy this one...its a no-brainer...

<Title>Great Ipod Alternative: Excellent Capacity, Reasonable Price
<Date>Sun Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited a full year before writing a review of my Creative Labs Zen Nomad 30GB Xtra, because some products work well for the first 6 months and then break down once its too late to return. Well, after 12 months, I can say this has been a great purchase, with no regrets. I listen to it everyday going to/from work on the train, with no major performance issues. With 30GBs of storage space, I have 4000 songs loaded and use the extra space to store files I need at work. Another plus is that it plays both WMA and MP3 file formats, so I can play all the songs from my CD library, as well as downloaded songs, without having to convert them. The unit itself is not as graceful/compact as an Ipod, but when you consider a 20GB Ipod costs around $300, whereas a 30GB Nomad costs around $225, I think you get more for you money. Plus, you're not forced to download tunes from Ipod's Itunes store at 99 cents/song.  Regarding usage, I use the included Nomad MediaSource Organizer on my PC. It scans your computer for song files, and then organizes them. You can then plug in your Nomad using the included USB 2.0 cable (which works with a USB 1.1 interface, albeit slower). The computer recognizes the Nomad after a few seconds, after which you can transfer all the songs on your computer (the first time), and then new songs afterward on an individual basis. One major drawback is that if you change a song title, genre, artist name, then the software will not recognize the song as being the same. As a result, you may have multiple versions of the song on your player. Perhaps a new updated version of the software will be `smarter'. Another problem is that you cannot delete or make changes to songs on the Nomad directly - instead you have to sync it with your computer to make those changes.  Regarding durability, the player has not had any major problems, except it froze once, but I pressed the reset button with a toothpick and that fixed it. I haven't dropped it (yet), but I do notice the faceplate of the player is not too secure and has come loose a couple times. If you use the leather case (included), that won't be a problem, but the player will be much bulkier as a result. I use the player without the leather case so I can put it in my pocket, which works fine. I wish there was a separate control unit on the headset cord, because Japanese trains can get so crowded that even my pocket is inaccessible. Speaking of headsets, the included pair are not the greatest, but they work.  The battery is supposed to last 12 hours, but I find that it last closer to 5-6 hours on a single charge. This is not an issue, because I only listen 1-2 hours per day and charge it up at night. One minor complaint - the power indicator has only 4 bars, so once you are down to a single bar, you're never really sure how much listening time you have left (which is why I charge it to full every night). I hope Creative Labs can improve that function on future models.  In conclusion, if you are not concerned about having the coolest, most ergonomic player around, but you want to have access to every song you every owned, wherever you go, the Nomad Zen 30GB Xtra is well worth it.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player for all
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Yes, this was my first mp3 player.But it might very well be one of the best choices I've ever made.I bought a 30GB Zen Xtra from Best Buy as of January of 2004.I must say, I am extremely impressed.Considering the Xtra supports USB 2.0, the transfers for all of my music and data files were outstanding, transferring at an average of 2.9MB per second.That's fast!! And yes, the player stores data files, so if you want to, you can back up all of your important documents on this (or photos if you have a lot of those).The real joy is the superb sound quality you get with this thing.With the SNR coming in at 98dB, this player produces LOUD sound.Very loud.Do yourself a favor, though: be sure to get rid of the earbuds that come included with the player.They make the player sound decent, but nowhere near as amazing as if you used higher quality headphones.My suggestions for headphones include Dynex behind the neck headphones (for the money-conscious, at only $9.99...yes, it's a Best Buy exclusive), and for earphones, try the Sony H.ear earphones (with different style changes, blue and silver).You can create playlists whenever you want to, something you cannot do using an iPod.With an iPod, you have to connect your player to your PC before you can do such a thing.While I'll admit the player loses the contest in looks to the iPod by far, that doesn't necessarily mean it's ugly.It has a very nice brushed-metal feel to it, and scratches don't show easily on it.The bright blue backlight is a plus, and the player controls are very intuitive, as is the interface.Go ahead and put on high quality music files, too: I have yet to come close to running out of space on my player.I still have over 6.5 GB of free space, with MANY songs and data files on it.The player not only supports the MP3 (MPEG-3) format, but also supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) and WAV formats.It supports bitrates from 32kbps (about AM-Radio quality) to 320kbps (True CD-quality), as well as VBR (Variable Bitrate) and CBR (Constant Bitrate).I highly recommend this player to anyone, whether it be their first mp3 player or not.It's very well worth buying, and at only $200, it's a steal.

<Title>Buy Sony and RCA's digital music players instead
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a good music player  and looks pretty nice.It is overadvertised and everyone has one so its not even unique. There are many better players at comparable prices with 20GB or greater harddrive.There are many accesseries you have to buy for it which you'd get free with other mp3 players(SONY Walkman digital music player and my favorite the RCA jukebox and video player)  It holds less songs than Sony's(Sony-13,000)  You can't watch movies in color on a 3.5inch flatscreen(you can on RCA's) Accesaries not included Case-$20-$45(included with Sony's and RCA's) USB cable-$30(included with Sony's and RCA's) No free songs(30 free with Sony's Walkman digital music player)  Dock $40(included with Sony's and RCA's)

<Title>Good value for price - but buggy firmware!
<Date>Wed Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned mine for almost a year now. All's well, except for pesky firmware freezes which happens a fairly regular clip--almost once a month. But I use mine almost every day. I haven't been able to pin it down to an exact sequence of button pushes, but it always recovers from it by a simple RESET with a paper clip. About half a dozen times during the syncing process with the PC I have seen it freeze with a seemingly virulent "Library Corrupted" message, but nothing a paper-clip cant fix ;)  I have even gotten used to the UI which is a bit clumsy compared to iPod, but then heck, I knew that before I bought it. I didn't care to pay an extra $200 for the sesky UI on iPod. The tiny jog-dial on the side is not as crisp as it ought to. Once every 5-10 attempts pressing the jog-dial produces undesired results, like going forward a step or going back instead of the "select" function. So its a bit of an annoyance.  What I *LOVE* about this, and something that I haven't yet seen on any other HD-based MP3 player, is one of the EAX functions which allows playback at 0.5x, 0.75x (slow speed) or 1.25x, 1.50x (fast speed) without altering the pitch! That's simply awesome if you have a keen ear for classical music.  The PC application used to organize the songs is awesome. I would have liked a better (more intelligent) auto sync capability.   The MP3 encoder that comes with it is very good.  Overall, a solid A-!!

<Title>My best college purchse
<Date>Wed Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In getting ready to go to college, I decided I didn't want a big stereo and CD cases taking up space in my room.  So, I bought this MP3 player at Bestbuy and two small but powerful Bose speakers that I can connect to it or to my laptop.  With my first semester coming to an end, I couldn't be happier.  I've yet to have a technical problem with it.  The amount of songs it holds it great and it's easy to use.  The software it comes with is great too, because you can put songs from CDs to your MP3 player without having to put them on your computer first.  So no hard drive space is used up.  You can't say that about ipods.  My sister got the dell MP3 player and has had problems with it too.  I listen to mine for hours everyday...basically when I'm in my room, I have music on, and I love it!

<Title>Not for the technically challenged and others
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The instructions are just about worthless. When I first had it I was able to rip and burn CDs. I did get about 40 loaded before it stopped downloading them. What the problem is, I have no idea. It plays fine, but since I can't download anymore music, nor figure out why it doesn't work, I have to say I greatly regret buying this thing. They offer no technical support that I can find. There is a reason why iPOD is the leader it seems.

<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen for a few months, and, after getting a defective unit replaced, haven't had an trouble with it. My main purpose for writing this review is in response to those complaining about the included software for putting music on your player: If you have a Zen, you can't function properly without Red Chair Software's Notmad Explorer. It's a breeze to use, and I can't imagine using my Zen without it.

<Title>Good but not Perfect
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have not any problems with the player yet but there is somethings that get frustrating. For example it took me hours to figure out how to create a playlist, and you pretty much have to learn how to work it yourself. Also the battery can work for a long period of time or just 90 minutes. The software that comes with it is not very good I registered the product then used windows media player for my music and it was a lot easier. But otherwise this is a great deal and the music quality is great.

<Title>Good player at a great price...but not perfect
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the 30gb Zen xtra a few years back and it is still working perfect and the battery life is still good as well (about 10 hours). I've even dropped it a few times and while one of the corners is a bit scratched up from dropping it, it is still working perfect. As with any product there are pros and cons. Here is what I've found over the years about this player:  Pros: Great battery life. Removable and replaceable battery is a big plus. You could buy an extra on ebay. By the way, for those of you who have a Muvo^2 4gb player may want to know that the battery and charger are exactly the same and interchangable with the Zen Xtra. The sound quality of this thing is amazing... especially if you rip your own mp3's at a higher setting bitrate (like 192kbps or higher). Lots of sound features that let you customize your own equalizer and other settings. By the way, it comes with a good mp3 ripping/compression software called mediasource.   Cons: The case that came with mine didn't have a window for the screen. The newer Xtras may come with a different case that does, so this isn't much of an issue. The size is a bit larger than other mp3 players(especially while using the included case). The controls are not as user friendly as they could be. No FM radio or voice recorder. Not a lot of accessories available for this player.      Creative, if you are listening... here is what we need for the  next Mp3 Zen upgrade. It needs to be a bit smaller yet hold at least 30GB standard. FM Radio and Recorder integrated. Removable battery is a must. Plug and play USB and drag and drop features like the muvo with no software to install would be great. USB charging feature. And last but not least, aesthetically pleasing looks and easy user interface.     Okay, while I was writing this (literally) I just went to the creative website and it looks like they have a new player out called the Zen Vision! Looks very exciting and has all the features I was talking about. Only thing is that it looks like it's $399 retail. Um... can I add that "affordable" needs to be a feature that we need too?

<Title>Very Good Value
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own one of these for over a month by now. Regarding performance, I have no major complaints. This gadget delivers as promised, and sounds beautifully; even through my cheapo headphones (I could NOT bear the tinny sound of the original Creative headphones, so I replaced them with a pair of Sony low-end cans, which happen to improve the sound a lot.)  Now I will try to analyze the Zen Jukebox in some detail:   1.	Performance: As I said, it is really good. I cannot wait to buy a good pair of headphones, then the sound will surely be even better. Even now I perceive some details I've never had before in some of my oldest songs, it is amazing! One point I did notice: occasionally, the sound gets scratchy, apparently for no reason. I read some other review indicating this same failure and saying that it can only be solved by removing the battery. What I do is changing the album and/or turning the Zen off (using the power button). It has solved the trouble every time and, as I said, it's been very occasional up to this moment. I assume it is related to the fact that this is basically a portable hard-drive which may suffer magnetic interference from other devices (I have a lot of electronics both at home and at work).A good pair of headphones is essential so you can really get the most out of your investment. 2.	Battery: I charged it for 04 hours the first time, following the Manual's instructions. An average of 10 effective hours can be expected from a 03 hours charging. Considering I have to use a higher volume level to compensate my lack of good headphones, I guess this is acceptable.  3.	Software: Many people complain about the accompanying software. It's certainly not the best they could supply. Nevertheless, it has some advantages: for example, transfer is unbeatable faster than with any alternative (Windows Media Player and Real Player, for example). And I've found a way to rip a CD and transfer the files directly to the Zen without saving to my PC hard drive (it saves time and space)! As I mentioned, you can also rip and transfer from Windows media Player and Real Player. 4.	Connectivity: As the manual acknowledges, this is not intended to be an additional hard drive. But it would have been a blowout if it were. This means you cannot plug it in to any PC and expect it to receive or send files on the go. The Nomad Explorer installation is required first. Transfer speed is generally  good, but amazing if you use the Creative Software: for my usual songs, it averaged a second or less per song! 5.	Navigation: You can easily access any song, album, artist or genres, assuming you have taken care of ID tagging your MP3s. The bad point here is that you can only create real playlists in your PC and using the Creative SW. It is virtually impossible to do it in the device itself. But I've read some one say that you cannot play album tracks in the original order. This is not true; you only have to select the album.  *	Pros: Very good  price/value ratio; excellent sound; doubles as data storage  *	Cons: Cannot create playlists on the device; not for athletes

<Content>Many people are audiophiles and search endlessly for other options besides the infamous iPod for enjoying music on a portable mp3 player.  I feel that the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra is great.  It has plenty of space and works very well.  The Nomad has an excellent screen display, and it is easy to search through your files.  Also, unlike other mp3 players, you can directly transfer music to your mp3 player and from the mp3 player to a computer (any computer that can comply with the system requirements). Sure it's not as stylish as other mp3 players with its slight clunkiness and large earphones, but if you are searching for quality and not necessarily good looks, then I believe you cannot do any better. It's great and I take it everywhere!

<Title>Headphone Jack Defective
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've used my Zen Xtra very little - mostly on long road trips plugged into my car stereo, or on long flights. It's received very, very light use. Even so, the headphone jack on it is totally broken, rendering the player completely useless. This is apparently a common problem with these players - the jack is flimsily attached to the main board of the player. It clearly takes only the lightest use to sever the headphone jack connections, and once it breaks you can't do a thing about it. Bye bye Zen Xtra. Do a web search and you will come up with numerous web sites talking about this issue. It's a well known issue. Creative refuses to fix it even though it is clearly a defect in the product. They want to charge close to one hundred dollars to fix it - half the price of what I originally paid for the unit. Yeah - it costs less than an IPod, but all I can say is you get what you pay for.

My wife has a ipod mini, the ipod sofeware and controls are much more user friendly than the creative.  The software was very hard to find on my desktop once it was in installed, veryy odd. My Mp3 fell 3 feet onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of the hard drive for my Mp3. If you do get player make sure to get a extended warrenty.  My next player will be a ipod or iriver.

<Title>Simple, Solid, Almost Perfect
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Buying things online is not foreign to me, neither was having my entire music collection with me. Back then of course this meant several CD wallets and not much room in the glove box! I bought the Jukebox during the early days of ipod as a sound, cheaper, and equally competative product. I will never look back. Its not the most asthetically pleasing device but it does the job, I don't go in for fashion things for twice the price. Sturdy piece of kit with a carry case (very plush!) and its so simple to use your nan will have her sinatra on it before you can blink! The software provided isn't the most user friendly true enough but if you have 10 minutes to actually work it out properly its really really easy to use!  I've moved well over 4000 songs on mine with plenty i get from sharing media with others (not by dodgy rip off downloads). Plus I have saved over 5 years of digital photos onto the player too. I can't view them on it, but having a safe back up of all my photos is great.  Initially I had a little hiccup as the hard drive suffered a hardware error and wiped itself which hats off to Creative was sorted and a new player issued within 1 week! Plug in and reinstalled before I knew it.  Plug, Rip, Share, Play, so so simple. The only thing lacking is the ability to link it into the car without using a dodgy tape link thing or seperate mini speakers. Once creative achieve this, anyone owning this will be laughing! 4 stars but only because the software can be hard to get used to and because there is always room for improvement DJ

<Title>Great Product, great price
<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is probably the best mp3 player you can buy for the price it has. It can store more songs than anyone can come up with and probably only crake about 3/4 of is memory. With reading these reviews it may seem like "you get what you pay for" when reading about its reliability. But in reality all you have to do is simply TAKE CARE OF IT! its that easy! For instance, don't let it drop 3 feet on a hard wood floor *cough*. Im sure most heavy mp3 players would stop working after that fall. There's basicly one rule to this, if you treat it like crap, it will work like crap. Keep in mind this is a 30 GB hard drive first, and a mp3 player 2nd.   Ok now that i have all of your worries about reliability gone, we can talk about its performance. I have to say this thing is good, and i mean good. the sound is great, its easy to use, the only problem is the size, which is well worth whatever it cost. Also the program i got from it is great, its really easy to use and it knows exactly what cd your burning (even if you made it yourself). making tags for songs and albums is so simple with this, you barly have to do any work. So anyway this is the product, its recomended to anyone that is not going to use this for jogging or anything like that, cause of its size.  By the way, i like the reviewer that made a pro's and con's list and under cons put: Stupid and Crappy. That made my day, I love people.

<Title>Ipod Schmipod
<Date>Mon Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen for five or six months now; it's a great little item. No problems. It's solid and sounds very good with my Etymotic headphones, and it has taken my music enjoyment to new heights and places. I have over 2000 songs and pieces on the unit, rock/pop/folk, jazz and classical recorded at high mp3 bit-rates. And there's space for plenty more. I put the Zen on random, and away we go. What odd and often wonderful juxtapositions of music come up. I would give the Zen **** and 1/2 if I could.  A few quibbles. The battery life is fairly short, not near twelve hours, probably more like four. The menu pointer is a bit touchy, takes some fussing, and the software is quite serviceable but could be better. Sveltness and size is where the Ipod wins. Everywhere else, I'd take the Zen. Size, well the Zen's bigger, but it's not exactly huge. Neither the Ipod nor the Zen are meant to be worn during sport--mechanical hard drives don't like to be jostled--and both will fit into your pocket.  The Zen has been reliable--my main concern. I use it daily in my car. When I walk with it I clip it to my belt in its leather case. I charge it nightly as it is recommended that one does not run the batteries all the way down.

I have 60GB hard disk in my pocket for storing my data, plus I can listen to the music! The software is very easy to use (Explorer-type drag-n-drop), strips CD's in no time, great sound! Earphones that come with it though are pretty pathetic, but it's a minor detail. I love my Zen, it is not as "cool" and "mainstream" as i-pod, and of course it was never on the cover of Newsweek magazine, but it's a great buy nontheless. I would highly recommend this player as both a jukebox and an extra disk space that fits in your pocket.

<Title>Unfulfilled Early Promise
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As an audiophile, I just this last year succumbed to the allure of being able to take most of my music with me and bought first an Archos Gmini (battery life of about 1 hour) and then the Zen Xtra. What I like about this unit: using WMA files ripped at 192kbps, the sound is often quite good, especially with a decent set of 'phones (Sony MDR-EX71). The size of the unit, while larger than the iPod, is perfectly acceptable. I even like the stying. And the price is right. With so much storage, I can carry most of my CD colletion with me. What I don't like: EAX "ambience" settings are a pure gimmick, sound pretty bad, and reduce the volume too much.  The buttons are flimsy.  The software is an abomination. And if you want to actually try the world of purchased digital music, it's probably best to stay with iPod.  I used MusicMatch, and have been unable to get the files onto my device after it recently crashed. Which brings me to the Achilles' heel of this unit: poor reliability.  My first unit died within a month after about a 6" tumble to the floor. My second unit crashed, too, for no apparent reason and I had to reformat the hardrive.  Now the FF and rewind buttons won't work. My unit is no longer covered by the ridiculous 3-month warranty, and customer service is a sad joke.  Being able to take so much music with you is great. But if this is what you have to put up with, it's not worth it.

<Title>I don't know why everyone has problems with it
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got it about 3 months ago, and I still love it. Playback is still perfect, I like the software a lot (others hate it for some reason), and I have yet to have a functioning problem. It took me about an hour to figure out how to put songs on it without it getting messed up, but that was my stupidity, not the players fault. It make take a while to get fully used to the scroll wheel, but it is a breeze to navigate once you do. It now comes with a snazzy leather case, complete with a nice viewing window. Now volume issues, this thing goes LOUD! I can't stand to have it on 23/25. However, it keeps perfect clarity even on 25/25, and sounds great when you run it through speakers. I run it through my surround sound system with it and the surround sound on full volume, and it still sounds clear. Not that its always too loud though, it has a good volume for any setting. The headphones that come with it are crappy, but that may just be because they are earbuds, which I hate. USB 2.0 is fast as hell. It takes me more time to put stuff from a CD onto my computer than it does to put stuff from my computer onto the mp3 player. All this, and its not over priced like others in the markert. *coughipodcough* I doubt that you have enough songs you actually listen to fill the 8000 mark, so feel free to put them in super high quality. Its also got some good playmodes, including a shuffle all, so you have a DJ that only plays music you like. You can sort your music by track, alblum, artist, genre, rating (you rate them in the software program), or how recently they were added. I find the EAX audio has several great features, but some features that are kind of pointless, extra fetures never hurt I guess. There is a slow motion mode, geat for musicians like myself who want to figure out how to play parts of songs. It also has a way to set a custom EQ, which I like. Finally, it has a mart-volume mode, with presets for trains, planes, cars, late nights, and some other stuff. The part that is stupid is environment mode. If you ever wondered what your song would sound like in a church, bathroom, jazz club, or several other odd places, environment mode can help you out (to each his own, I suppose) If you buy an Ipod after looking at this player, you are quite foolish IMO.

<Title>Awesome so far!
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My husband bought a Creative Zen Nomad 30GB for Christmas.  So far, it's been a blast.  I have uploaded 10GB of music onto it so far and it has already made my drive to work so much better.  I told my husband I wanted this player after reading about the battery issues of other mp3 players.  This one has a huge capacity, good durability so far, great sound quality, and a replacable battery.   I found the software to be pretty intuitive--after a few transfers I got the hang of it.  It's pretty much drag and drop.  The fact that it checks for duplicate files is really nice.  The upload rate is really fast with USB 2.0--in a matter of a couple hours I organized and uploaded 2500 files.    The player itself is nice and compact.  It's a tad heavy given its size, but then again, it IS a portable hard drive.  I am being very careful with it because of that--it's not a tape-based system, and I don't think anyone should treat a portable hard drive like this roughly.  The case that comes with is helpful, but I'm still being careful.    The buttons are laid out in such a way that it makes the player very intuitive to use.  Track advance is on one side, while volume is on the other, and the buttons are shaped in such a way that you can find the button you want to press even when you're not looking.  The select wheel button takes a bit of a light touch to get it right, but after a short while I got used to it.  The screen size is great--it displays all the information I would like to know about a track while playing.  It even gives you a count of how many songs are on your player.  I think the earbuds that come with are pretty good.  They might be a little big for someone with really small ears, but I think the sound quality is great.  I have uploaded mp3s that I have downloaded as well as those that I have ripped from my own CDs and have had no problems getting the player to recognize them.  It even plays .wav files.  One of the things that has always attracted me to Creative is their attention to different styles of sound--you can adjust it so your music sounds like it's being played in a concert hall or live in the same room, so it's amazing how it sounds.    I would recommend this player absolutely so far.  I will repost another review in a few months just to put in my two cents about durability.  All in all, it's a great buy so far for any music junkie!

<Content>I recieved this as a gift, and was astonished when i first downloaded my cds onto the unit.  they transferred lightning fast, and no loss of quality.  AMAZING storage capacity, up to 8, 000 songs.  i already have 150, and i have only had it one day!!!  I would recommend buying an extra set of headphones/earbuds.  The stock set is usable, but cheap, breakable, and not great sound quality.  It is better than the Apple iPod's because it had way more features, it may be slightly bigger, but the compromise is way worth it.  this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!

<Content>I recived this item on chirstmas and down loaded all of my muscic (about 300-400 songs) in just above 30 minutes.If your purchase this item for anyone they could transfer all their music without parental help. Once it froze-up on my bot get a paper clip and press reset and your fine,no this will not earse your music.The only thing i dont like about this great product is the power bar has only 3 bars so you dont know if your battery is almost dead or almost fully charged.Some people say the head phone jack is faulty but this is not true.The best feature is the EAX audio feature it lets you controll sound,loudness and change the sound of the sound setting such as put on the indoor arena and all of the suden you think your in an indoor stadium during half time while they prefom the music.The allover rating out of 1,000 its 1,000 if you buy this produt you'll definatly agree with me.

<Title>I Can't Get It To Work...
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased my Jukebox 30 back in February (2005) and have yet to get it operating. I've written Creative Labs tech support numerous times (4x) and always received prompt/courteous answers but none have yielded any results. I can't even find updates and/or firmware info on the Creative website.  I checked Amazon.com today just to ensure this player is still being sold... I see that it is. I live in the Rochester area and it seems to have disappeared from the shelves over the past months. I purchased it locally from 'brick & mortor' vendor, so this review is NO reflection on Amazon.com or its associations.  Has anyone experienced this problem? Does anyone out there know what I can do to at least get something out of my player? Maybe I'm doing something wrong. The software that comes with the player is Creative's "MediaSource" and after loading all my music library from my Maxtor 60 GB drive into it, I got and continued to get, despite Creative's effort to help, an error message saying the 'MediaSource' files are 'corrupted'. I know that the music files are fine because I can play them with other software, ie., Roxio, iTunes or Windows MediaPlayer.  I think this player would be great if I get it to work. I would return it, even at this late date, but I'm still searching for the receipt.

<Title>Great deal
<Date>Wed Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this mp3 player after reading a lot reviews.  I saw this player had some mixed reviews, but when I had the chance to get it for $150 ($40 in rebates at Office Depot), I finally went ahead and bought it.  Overall, I would say it's a very good value for the money.  Below are some highlights I've noticed during my past 2 months of ownership:  Battery - With the Creative Zen Xtra you can change the battery with ease.  Unlike most other hard drive driven mp3 players (including ipod), you can swap out the battery.  Creative claims a 14 hour battery life, but so far I have found it to last a lot less than 14 hours.  However, I tend to use some battery expending features while the player is on such as - scrolling through songs, adding songs to the playlist, and keeping the "now playing" screen on constantly.  I think the battery would last a lot longer if I didn't use those features.  I ended up buying an extra battery for a long plane ride I'm going to take later this month.  If you search diligently and keep track of prices day to day, you can pick up an extra battery for $28 or so.  Normally, extra brand name batteries are about $40.  Sound - This player has great sounds.  I use about average quality headphones which I bought on my own.  I never tried the earbud headphones that came with the player  Software - Creative Media Source, which came with the player, is all right.  It's easy to rip CD's with the software and instantly download the information for each track.  However, I have noticed some bugs.  It doesn't do a great job or organization, so the user has to be organized.  I am not very organized, so a lot of my music is in random folders instead of correctly labeled.  This could be my fault, but the software could do a better job of detecting information from id3 tags.  Also, the mp3 player will show up as a drive on your computer.  Then, you can just drag and drop songs onto it.  Also, you can download free software from creative that will work with MS Explorer and give you more organization to just dragging and dropping.  Hardware - I find it easy to search for songs on this player.  You can search by artist, album, genre, song title, etc.  The menus are easy to navigate.  The buttons on the player feel sturdy.  The case for the player is plastic.  I would have preferred metal.  It's also a little on the large side.  Finally, the scroller feels somewhat flimsy and I could see it breaking one day.  Creative Xtra compared to ipod - The 30 gig ipod photo is much nicer looking than the creative zen xtra.  The ipod is much thinner and has a beautiful case and screen.  However, my Xtra was $150 and my mom's ipod was $329 (and she got a deal).  Also, the battery for the ipod can't easily be replaced so for long plane rides, you will have to buy an external charger (which I don't really trust).  The sound on the two players is about the same to me.  The ipod's scroll wheel is really nice and fun to use, but the menus are less thorough and you have fewer options for playing music than with the Xtra.  The itunes softward also has a nicer look to it than creative's, but the functionality of itunes isn't any better than creative.

<Title>I'm going back for the IPOD
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one a 30 GB Zen for myself and later one for my wife.  I thought it was the greatest thing in the world.  After a year of use, my Zen has problems with the headphone jack (motion will cause static).  And after only 9 months of use, my wife's Zen is dead.  The harddrive crashed.  I have read that other people have had the same problems.  I'm afraid that I will have the same problem with mine.  I have to perform a hard reset about once a week.  So I'm now going back to the store to buy my wife an IPOD.  Sure it's more expensive (a lot more expensive), but I know people that have had an IPOD for over a year and they have never had a problem.

<Title>Best value on the market!
<Date>Mon Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the Xtra 30GB a month ago, and it's since been an absolute pleasure to use. Sound quality is superb, I like the ability to set an alarm or the sleep timer, and the user interface is adequate (not as good as iPod or iRiver). The carrying case - Creative updated the old version to have a screen "window" - is AWESOME. Think about this one - if you bought an iPod, you'd have to add at least $30 for a decent case. The Zen Xtra comes with a great one; nothing extra to buy. The case protects the player wonderfully, has a belt clip, and isn't too bulky. All controls are accessible from inside the case, and it's easy to adjust the volume or skip tracks when it's clipped to my waist.   The main gripe I have with this player has to do with how data is organized. It depends solely on ID3 tags, much like the iPod. Prepping my existing MP3 collection was cumbersome, to say the least. Once you've pulled up a group of songs (by genre or artist), you cannot sort that list at all. I would like to be able to sort by album and track number. Playlist creation was not flexible enough, either. It is very time-consuming to create a large playlist of files in specific order. I really wish there were a sort feature in the Zen Explorer's playlist editor.  For us Linux users there are adequate open-source applications to interface with the Zen. Gnomad is the most mature, but there are also KZenExplorer and Neutrino, among others.   I bought my Zen Xtra for HALF the price of an iPod with the same capacity. It cost around the same price of a 20GB Archos, which is a nifty player, but the 10GB extra capacity and the belt-clip case are what tipped the scales in favor of the Zen.

<Title>Good and Bad...
<Date>Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an OK mp3 player. Since day one I have had problems creating playlists on it,...and by that I mean that it CANT BE DONE! I have tried everything but I am stuck to playing just random which sucks if you have an audio book on it. Anyway pretty freakin huge capacity Im not even close to filling (wishing I just went with the ipod mini which was 20 bucks more). Ummm the control system is pretty much whack compared to ipods roller-wheel. Also If I dont touch it for a day or so, the next time I turn it on it takes about 30 minutes or more to boot up and be ready to play.....pain in my eye.  Another thing is that this player is HUGE compared to even the normal sized ipod. You might as well be carrying around a walkman. One good thing though is the fact that you can EXPORT tracks too, the ipod does not. I just got a new PC and loaded my entire library lickety-split. But since I have a PC now, which is the epicenter of my media, that feature doesnt matter anymore...  PROS; -big capacity -export capable -bludgeoning tool if necessary -cheap  CONS; -Size of small brick -impossible to create playlists, and if you try it will seize and die -crappy navigation tools -booting time in excess of 30 mins sometimes -software pretty crappy compared to itunes -with belt clip on it looks like cinderblock painted to look like an ice cream sandwich -crappy -stupid -wish I just got a small, sleek, more "chick-attracting", playlist having, better ipod mini.

<Title>Warranty Issues
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The unit failed after 2 hours.  Because it was a gift and I did not have a receipt, I called Creative to ask if it were under warranty.  I didn't want to ship it back to have them simply charge me.  They assured me it was under warranty.  But, after shipping it back, Creative refused to repair it or even send it back without substantial payment.  So, if you are going to give it as a gift or receive one, try to maintain the receipt.  The warranty is only 90 days (which says something about the quality of the product).

<Title>Problems are easily resolved.
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As an avid music listener, I purchased the mp3 player with the most  bang for my buck. Thirty gigabytes for $209 (at the time) was incredible. I also recieved $50 off my next purchase (a printer). Although I dropped the player and it suffered from a hard disk problem, it was replaced for free even when it was well out of warranty. Now, I have abused my headphone jack enough that it is having a problem. As long as I get a new one back for free, I'll be happy.  The software isn't great, but there is a perfect alternative - Windows Media Player! Just rip all tracks into WMP and put all your downloaded songs into the library (select the songs from "My Music" and right-click "Open" them. After a little time playing in WMP, the songs are in that library. Use the Sync tool in Windows Media Player and it is ready to go - sends in very quickly too. Plus, you can burn your music for other people easily for people with other audio formats (converting iTunes into wma is tough). Creating playlists are easy using the Creative MediaSource Organizer program. This product is an incredible price for 30 gb. You can export other items like documents as long as the program is installed at each computer. It is rather large, but as a guy with pockets and a car - size isn't important - it still saves room from cd's and cd players. Size is a problem, as well as durability. But everything else - even the controls, are very good. Not perfect, but the best for the money - hundreds less for the same size from  Apple! A great investment for me, and hopefully for you.

<Title>Best Customer Service Around
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As MP3 players go I think that the Zen is fairly middle of the road...its a little large, but it does hold a TON of music, the interface is fairly easy to use, it's easy to read...etc etc. However, the customer service given by Creative Labs is the best I have ever received, and made the purchase of this particular piece of equipment well worth it for me.  I had had my player for about 6 months when it stopped working.  The telephone support folks were not able to correct the issue and I was instructed to return my MP3 player for service.  I got the player back within a week and a half, which was awesome, but the best part was that they upgraded me to a 40G (I originally purchased a 30G) for FREE as compensation for my inconvenience.  In todays day and age you rarely get something for nothing and I have to say that this little perk which probably cost them next to nothing really made my day when I got my player in the mail yesterday.    I highly recommend this product, it's low cost, high value, works great, holds a TON of music, is easy to use, and the service that comes with it is PHENOMENAL.  -Shell

<Title>Couldn't be able to believe someone would call this a bad Mp3 player...
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved this Mp3 player for my 16th birthday,  and through most reviews i've read of faults at arrival, mine didn't have any problems. I think i made a really going choice, 30GB of music (And data) @ $200 is really a bang for your buck!  And it looks very sexy too.  Sound Like i expected from a Creative product. The sound quality is amazing. The EAX EQ REALLY helps .  I couldn't ask for better sound quality,  except the headphones. Even though they don't  produce the bass levels that i'd like, for plug headphones they have decent quality.  And, seriously. I'm tired of hearing the "Elephant Ears" Excuse. The earphones are just fine and i don't  have elephant ears. I realized you don't have to  force it all the way in your ears. Just put them in place where they feel that they wouldn't fall immediately and no worries.  PORTABILITY/SEXINESS It's anodized aluminum body, firm grip, blue-lit LCD screen, white lining, and that black "border" around the screen  makes it all too irresistable for another look at.  Sexiness spreads through this mp3 player.  Even though this Player isn't really considered "portable" anymore, it has a travel "shirt" that has a clip for your pants(And not your boxers, the weight will  eventually drag it down!). I don't often put take of the  protector from my player, to keep it as scratchless as  possible. I wouldn't recommend sticking the naked player  in your pocket.  CONTROLS/INTERFACE/EASE OF USE Where it gets interesting that the Zen Xtra does have a Navigation tool in the middle. In my case; It works perfect without one.  The side-style navigation takes a bit getting used to (Especially with the back button that i keep forgetting that's there), but eventually it'll easy to navigate. A little dissapointment was the graphics used for navigation. It's not good, and not bad. I'll live with it. Compared to something like the iPod Mini  it's below average. What amazed me (It's my first time, sue me),  was that how fast the USB2.0 interface works. I uploaded a  103 song album in 1 minute and 15 seconds. And last but not least, the software is very helpful  if you want to change a group of song's title, artist, Album Altogether. For example you select group of songs and  change their Artist to "poo" so you can organize fast n easy. The Data/storage method is pretty nice, though found it  rather odd that you couldn't open a file in the mp3 player  itself. I found out that : 1. it would discharge the battery terribly 2. if the charger was connected to it, it would overuse    the hardrive, easily damaging it or shortning it's life.   BATTERY LIFE Here comes a conflict, but after a while i solved it. I wasn't very familiar with HD mp3 players. The Booklet said that you had to charge it for 3-4 hours. But it took only 2 1/2. So i was worried the battery was at a degraded point. I didn't worry too much when i started listening to it and played around with the thing, and  changing songs manually. When i noticed after 5-6 hours the battery died. Completely. I was dissapointed that it promised up to 14 hours. But then i noticed that without doing anything to it while listening. Just put a couple of albums play  the battery life extended to about 4. That's when the battery  reached 1 bar, where i normally charge it again.   PERSONAL NOTES I haven't let this player fall yet, though i notice that everyone does. Most people complain about it breaking  through that. That's personally a really bad excuse since  the mp3 player extremely delicate. If i would let it fall even once and it doesn't work anymore. It's my fault, Not creative's.  For anyone who can't live without music and has 20+ albums  and needs a good storage device in the palm of your hand; for an explosion of your buck; go for the Zen Xtra.  You won't regret it.

<Title>IPod's superior
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Till this day, I have no idea why someone would buy an MP3 player other than the Nomad Zen Xtra.  This baby has the IPod and most other players beat hands down.  Before I bought mine, I read some of the other reviews, and some were saying to be wary of hard drive failure after 90 days.  Well I've owned mine for 8 months and it is still working the same as when I first opened it.  Unlike the IPod, the battery is removable and replacable.  A very good feature should your battery die, you can just purchase a new battery and be on with it!  The IPod is 50 bucks more with 10 less gigs of space.  You do the math.  Battery time is excellent and good for late night owls who wait till the last minute to study such as myself.  Display is bright and easy to read.  My only complaints are the awkardness of the controls and occasionally it freezes up.  A great buy if you're looking for a quality MP3 player!!

<Content>I received the Zen Xtra 30 GB for Christmas after posting it on my wish list. I have to agree with other reviews regarding the software. The manual and help information wasn't specific enough for me, a moderately computer literate person. It took me about a 1/2 hour to figure out how to get things from the source to the player. Now we're up and running and perfectly happy. While surfing for stuff to download last night, I ran across an e-book sight. Being an avid reader, the idea of being able to download a book onto my player is exciting. The all-knowing web is telling me that the 40 or 60 GB player is compatible with this function. The 30 GB is not on the list. If I can't find a way around it, I may have to trade up.

<Date>Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For the price, the Nomad Zen xTra 30GB is great. I've had some problems and I've found a workaround. Like some, after installing the Creative MediaSource software and installing all the updates and upgrades I was only able to transfer a handful of files and then couldn't. I also purchased the Notmad Universal version and it wouldn't work either. However, after (on the Nomad, NOT the PC) cleaning, formatting, reinstalling the OS, and rebooting (this takes only seconds), I tried copying files from one Windows Explorer window to another...and it worked. Keep in mind, this is just from two Windows Explorer windows and NOT from Creative MediaSource or Notmad Explorer. They wouldn't work. If everything was installed correctly with the newest firmware and software upgrades, the Nomad device should appear in Device Manager and Enabled and without errors. The Nomad should also show up as a Nomad icon in My Computer. Formatting earlier also wiped out the music that came with the Nomad but that's OK. This method also doesn't require you to alter any tags you've previously made. Hope this helps anyone out there who had the same grief I initially had. I am now happy with the Nomad.

<Title>A great product--give it a chance
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a very good product and should not be knocked simply because it isn't the &quot;in&quot; brand at the moment.  I've had mine for 6+ months and it has worked great at a fraction of the price of an iPod.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I use it in the car daily with a tape adaptor from a portable CD player.  I charge it up nightly.  It took me on a 980 mile x 2 road trip to Portland, OR with no problem.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Think about it:  you're getting 8 TIMES the space for songs that you get on an iPod Mini for less $.  8000 songs versus 1000 songs for less money?  Doesn't sound like much of a contest to me.  Plus, it comes with everything you need, including a case at no extra price.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;So if you are more concerned about a good buy than what's &quot;in&quot;, you'll be very satisfied with this product.  But a word of advice:  buy the service contract--it's just good sense.  Any brand you get is still a fragile item and you'll kick yourself if something goes wrong and you haven't protected your investment.  Happy shopping...

<Title>World's greatest mp3 player value!
<Date>Sat Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I travel a lot and was really beaten down by lugging even a portion of my CD collection around with me. It always seemed like the song I wanted to hear was on a CD that I had not brought, or was in the larger CD case in my checked luggage. Like I said: beaten.  The natural solution to this dilema was a large mp3 jukebox. After a few months of rationalizing the price, I decided it was time to treat myself.  Of course, the iPod is the gold standard in this market, so that's where I started. I tried it out at a few different stores and, and sure enough, it's a great product. I could have easily bought an iPod and been very happy with it.  However, as I did more shopping, I kept coming across the Zen Xtra 30GB. The price difference between the Xtra and the smaller-capacity iPod is dramatic, and I thought I should at least check it out.  After many comparisons and lots of review-reading, I decided on the Xtra. For me, it sorted out this way:  - Design and cool factor - iPod wins by a bunch - Usability - tie, maybe a slight edge to iPod - Sound quality - dead heat - Flexibility (file formats, music store options, platforms, etc) - Xtra wins - Long term viability (ie: ability to change battery) - Xtra wins and iPod isn't on the track - Value - Xtra wins in a landslide  The only thing that iPod clearly has going for it is it's coolness. Once you get past that (and I get past it pretty quickly), the Xtra ties or wins in every category that matters.  I've had my Xtra for a couple of weeks and find myself using it EVERYWHERE. A Belkin TuneCast II FM transmitter (also a great product) allows me to use it in the car, some Sony travel speakers I've had for years let me use it in the hotel, my Bose headphones for the plane, and the very acceptible ear buds that come with the Xtra are great for the office.   My "Good Stuff" playlist is now over 450 songs, and I've got nearly 10GB of albums on the Xtra. How did I ever live without this thing? I will never listen to a commercial or DJ on the radio again!  The Xtra is a great value on a fantastic product. I enthusiasticly recommend it!  Updated 11/05: I've had my Zen Xtra for almost a year now and still love it. The ONLY complaints I have are:  1. The battery meter, which only has three bars. It's tought to tell how much juice you've got left. However, even after a year of nearly every-day use, the battery goes strong for 10-12 hours.   2. The near-total absence of accessories. You can use any generic FM transmitter in your car, any generic speakers, etc. But, there are no cases or any other toys to specifically go w/ the Xtra. This is the price you pay for bucking the trend.  The sound is still great, the earbuds are still great, the interface is fine, and I still use the hell out of it.  I'm not in the iPod "Cool Club", but that's fine by me. I have definitely got my money's worth out of the Xtra, and intend to keep it until the ROKR music phone grows into a usable product.  If you're on the fence regarding the Xtra, I'd encourage you to get it. You can't beat the price for the amount of storage you get, the performance is great, and the device will last.

<Title>Zen Xtra brings peace to this music lover.....
<Date>Mon Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Hello. I have been wanting an MP3 player for some time. I have been hearing all this " i-Pod...blah blah blah...." but in researching advertising does not always bring out the best. When I began looking at players the Zen Xtra 30gb was mentioned as a great choice. Having ordered one and had a few days to load 450+ songs and play with the features I am very pleased. The controls are handy and logical. I find the PC software to organize the music library a bit clumsy, not totally intuitive for the novice, but solid. The size is bigger but not bad at all. I do wish the battery indicator provided more warning then the three line indicator. The music organization and sound, EAX sound enhancements, are awesome. The replaceable battery of the Zen Xtra is a feature that many MP3 Jukebox's don't have. I am so over joyed with this product that I highly recommend it to others looking to make a smarter purchase over the blah-Pod.

<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for six months now (I bought it in July), and it is still in my top three favorite purchases.  I have my entire CD and mp3 collection on it, but only a fraction of the space has been used.  I use my jukebox daily in my car (I have an input jack built in), and it has worked perfectly since day one.  I, like other reviewers, have never had (or even used) an iPod, but I definitely think this little machine is worth every penny.

<Title>First Day Use
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just received my jukebox this afternoon.  About 5 hours ago, so far I am fairly happy.  I didn't have anytrouble downloading my music off my laptop.  Also went through about 25 cd's and ripped the songs I liked off of them, only had trouble with a couple of cd's.  Right now I have about 1150 songs on the things and still have about 75% - 80% of the harddrive space left to fill.  It's great to have all my music in one place, the 30 gigs is pretty awesome.  The software seemed pretty simple to figure out.  The jukebox is already charged up.  I still got about 50 cd's to rip music off of.  I liked the price. Downloads were fairly fast.  Nothing fancy, but seems like a really great budget jukebox when compared to some of the other higher priced and smaller memory players.  Earphones aren't all that great. This will be great to carry around.

<Title>Works great, does not disappoint
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When it comes to all the new technology of MP3 players, palm pilots, etc., well it's all a bit over my head.  So when I decided to finally join the rest of mankind and get an mp3 player, I just figured I'd get an iPod.  After all, everyone has one (my sister included), they have a cute design and the commercials make them seem so cool.  But because I am a research fanatic when it comes to most purchases, I first decided to read reviews, etc. on the Jukebox.  I soon learned that the iPod is not, in fact, the best of the best (the Apple marketing team certain has certain done a great job, most people think of 'ipod' when they think of mp3 player).    So I decided to base my decision on what features were important to me:  (1) Hard drive capacity of player - you really cannot beat the 30gb of the Jukebox compared to the 4gb of the minipod (which was in my price range).  I wanted to be able to put all of my cds and then some and carry them around with me.  The Jukebox serves that purpose.  I have many of my cds (I'd guess about 90 at this point - a small collection compared to some I know)on the Nomad thus far, and still have PLENTY of room to spare; (2) Price - of course one of the biggest factors for me.  But when you compare the price of the 30gb Jukebox to the 30gb Ipod, well, there was clearly no more comparison, the Jukebox was for me.  Only small downfall for me was it's size - it's definitely bigger than the Ipod; it's similar to the size of a Palm Pilot.  I'm more concerned with quality and durability, so size wasn't a deciding factor; and (3) Battery Life - I wanted something that I wouldn't have to charge often (not to mention have to send to the manufacturer to replace).  My sister has had battery problems with her iPod, which seems to be somewhat frequent regarding the iPod.  At the most, I use the Nomad about one to two hours a day during the week and have to charge it about once a week.  Perfect for a commuter like me.  I've now had my Nomad for over six months with no problems.  The original leather case has softened a great deal.  I still use the standard headphones, which I think sound perfectly fine.  I also use a car adapter and unfortunately some of the songs don't sound so great in the car, but I think it's more the quality of the songs than the player itself.  I also use it while running and have had no problems (even dropped it once), however, because of its size, I do carry it in my hand (thereby being the only con of this player for me).  I did try to use the hook that's on the case once to attach it to my clothes/jacket, but it didn't just feel secure enough.  If you're looking for a player to use primarily for running/exercise, I certainly wouldn't recommend this mp3 player.  The Nomad definitely needs to be handled with care, so if you're prone to drop/break things or exercise, maybe you should look at something else, i.e., non-harddrive based mp3 player (I plan to soon).  The software program that comes with the player could be a little more user friendly, but once you tool around in it, it does becomes easier.  The instruction booklet could also use a little finetuning, I remember being frustrated in the beginning trying to figure some things out.  For an advanced user, it might not be a big deal, but for someone non-technical like me, more detailed instructions would be helpful.    Sometimes the scroller button on the side can be a little tricky, it moves fast and so you have to be careful you're not entering a menu you don't want to.  Other than that, it's very easy to maneuver within the mp3 player itself.  Right now, I only have music on it, so I cannot comment on the photo storage, etc.  Overall, I'm very happy with my first mp3 player.

<Content>Well, I my parents got this for me for my B-day in January(after I convinced them) and it worked....until about mid april, when the Hard Drive Shut Down...I had to call tech support which had me send it to be replaced. THis took about 10-12 days total. After I got it back around May 1st, it was problem free until now, when I got the "Hardisk-Problem" message again. I personally regret getting this and today, I will call Tech support to request a refund. I'll Prbobaly buy the I-pod Mini. Overall, expect it to break down alot. It is a cheap piece of C*** so don't buy it unless you want to go through a lot of repairs.

<Title>Best value, some quirks
<Date>Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For the gigs you get, your dollar goes far here.  There are players out there still with less gigs that cost more than I paid a year ago for my zen.  I've encountered some quirks, but most of them aren't critical.  The leather carrying case that comes with it (for FREE... suck on that, iPod) covers the power port.  Just drill a hole through the strap, though.  Works great, doesn't look bad, and you'll never have to remove the player from the case.  I got a car adapter, though the only one available was off by 0.2 mV.  Still works, but may have zapped my zen.  Zen still plays, but playlists no longer work.  Occasionaly when it powers on, it freezes on the EAX Audio screen.  Just wait a few minutes, and it will get to playing.  The player has some quirks, but I've heard of more problems from the iPod.    I actually like the program they supply for transferring files.  It lets you see everything in the player and computer in opposing windows.  Select and a click of a button gets the transfers going.  The design flaws that annoy me are that they didn't provide a firewire connection and the data hard drive option appears as a network drive... works weird.

<Title>Unreliable - the hard drive will break!
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have bought three of these for my kids, and I'll certainly never buy another! All three have broken and been fixed under warranty, and now they are out of warranty and are breaking again. Each time the problem is a hard drive failure -- for no reason the drive just stops working, and none of the "rescue mode" options will fix it. It costs $130 to replace the hard drive and receive only 90 days more warranty, so it's not worth a repair. I don't know whether other Creative Labs products are more reliable, but I think that having all three of mine break is pretty terrible. For $675 I was hoping for better. I wouldn't recommend that others take a chance by buying this product.

<Title>Nomad plays well but has battery issues
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Nomad plays well and contains all the features that are advertised.  However, after only 3 charges, I let the battery run down all the way and it wouldn't recharge.  Called Creative and they asked me to pay for a new battery.  I would not recommend this product because electronics are only as good as their power source.  In this case the power sources does not function well at all.

<Title>$200.00 Piece of Junk
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had written a somewhat favorable review of this unit a month after initially buying it. A year later and I am compelled to revise my evaluations and warn anybody considering getting this thing.  Shortly after the 90 day warranty ran out I lost sound in the left channel. After a search of the Net for related issues it became obvious there was a design flaw of the jack that has affected enough owners of the Zen Extra that a Web Page exists on how to  resolder the connections, a sort of "do it yourself" guide.  Not wanting to do this I contacted Creative Customer Care to see if I could get a break on the repair costs. The guy on the phone admitted this as a known problem but said I'd still have to pay a$40.00 minimum to get it fixed. Not wanting to send them any more of my hard earned money,I sent the unit off to another repair company. A week later I got an E-mail from Creative offering to extend the warranty. Blast! Too late!  The repair lasted six months before both channels went out. I sent the unit off to Creative to see what they could do. The answer? I need to send them $100.00 for a new main board!  I told them they can keep the blasted thing. I'm not going to pay twice over for something that never worked well in the first  place.   These hardware issues are just the tip of the iceberg, though. In my first review I took off one star for the clunky software package. After using it for nearly a year now, I'd take off more than that. Just be sure to keep a backup of your  music library data file because it seems to become corrupted very easily. It's happened to me when I disconnected the Nomad before closing the PlayCenter, and many times for  no seemingly good reason. Also have a paperclip handy for  reseting the Nomad when it locks up during transfering  files again, for no seemingly good reason.  Consumers, please spend a little extra cash and get something of quality. I'm not going to specifically recommend anything, but just go read some reviews of competing players before you buy.

<Title>A little big, but a great value
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the player for Christmas after spending a lot of time researching the various mp3 players out on the market. Of course, I wanted an iPod, but I couldn't justify asking for an mp3 player that cost $200 but only held a couple hundred songs. I read the reviews for this player and was pleased at what other customers said. Since Christmas, the player has worked very well. It's frozen a couple times, but if you push the reset button, the player works again without losing any of your songs. It's larger than an iPod, but it comes with its own case to clip to your belt or pants. One recommendation I would make would be to buy your own earphones....the ones that come with the player aren't well made. With these players, too, you can't get all the perks that you get with an iPod, like different cases and things like that. And I tried downloading a song from iTunes onto my player, and it didn't work. I haven't looked more into it, but I'm a little disappointed at that. All in all, it's a great player, for a great price.

<Title>Their Warranty Says It All
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have semi-mixed feelings about this player. The one upside is the price per gigabyte. It's close to the lowest in the industry. The sound is average and the software isn't much buggier than average for an MP3 player.   On the downside the dinky 90 day warranty tells all about what Creative Labs thinks of the quality of this product. Mine died after just after the warranty gave out and I won't buy another. The second weakness is the directory structure. Everything goes in the root and is simply sorted by ID3 tags.   Finally there is no support for any lossless file formats such as FLAC or APE formats. Lossless music makes all the difference in the world to those that prefer quality over quantity. With all the sleek 1GB flash players on the market, that's really the only reason I can see to have a player this bulky. I think I'm just going to wait and save for a Cowen X5 30 to compliment my iRiver 799t.

<Title>delivers as advertised
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read dozens of reviews of this player as well as every other player out there before making my choice. I avoided the Ipod as all my files are in the WMA format which Apple does not support. The Zen is also over $100 cheaper than the Ipod. Disregard other reviews mentioning problems with the cover - in the new models the cover does not block the screen and gives you access to all controls. I've had my player for about 45 days now and already have over 2200 songs on it. It took me a bit to get used to the sound which seemed a bit flat to me. I used the graphic equalizer in EAX to pump up the treble (as is my preference) and now it sounds great. Getting music onto the player is pretty easy but I first go through the Windows Media Player as the Zen player is frighteningly slow from cd. The sync feature works pretty well for music that I already had in my computer. Organizing playlists is real fast and easy on the computer. The jukebox is not the lightest or most compact player on the block and I keep the case on at all times but it's controls are all very easy to use. If you want sexy get the Zen Micro 5gb but if you want over 7000 songs at 128kbps the Creative Jukebox is the one to get. I got mine at Circuit City for $200 but opted for the 12 month warranty (which I never get for any other product) which seemed to make sense for a little computer that you keep in your pocket. I have hundreds of cd's and am constantly making compilations so for me to have a player that can hold over 400 cds and deliver great sound is a real joy.

<Title>Definitely worth the money!
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Creative Lab Nomad Zen Xtra 30GB player.  I've read some reviews complaining about the pre-packaged software; however, I've actually found the software (after some playing around with it) very intuitive and effective in managing my MP3 files.  Works great!  In fact, I find it better in managing your music files than the iTunes software.  I've downloaded about 800 songs to my player and only used about 4 gigs of space.  My out the door price for this puppy after the twenty-doll rebate came out to one-hundred seventy-seven dolls, which is a superior value to any iPod product.  So it's a little bigger than the iPods, but look at how much more you get:  More hard drive space at a lower price No hyper-sensitive jog dial.  The Nomad's controls are buttons and a scroll-wheel on the sides of the unit that is so much easier to use at least in my humble opinion.  I can change the volume while looking through the menu - something you can't do with the iPods. A classy free case to protect your player.  Expect to pay $20-40 extra for an iPod case. Great software that rips CD's to MP3s quickly and helps to organize your MP3's and playlists effectively A removeable battery that you can replace on your own.  Office Depot sells a replacement battery for thirty-three dolls, while Amazon has one for thirty-eight dolls.  You have to pay at least sixty dolls to replace an iPod battery and ship it back to them...what a hassle. Fast USB 2.0 transfer (backward compatible with USB 1.0).  Okay, iPods have this too. If you're an iTunes user....you can still use iTunes.  Just burn your iTune format music to a CD and then rip back to a MP3 to download to your Zen Xtra EAX sound controls, which allows you to apply special effects to the music such as pretending that you're in an indoor concert.  The best EAX control is the one that "normalizes" all of your MP3s' volume so you don't get one song sound real soft and another one that you can barely hear.  Using the EAX feature, though, shortens battery life.  The only negatives I think are as follows:  Headphones aren't the greatest.  To fully maximize your listening pleasure, I suggest getting the Sony MDR-E829V Fontopia Ear-Bud Headphones with In-line Volume Control right here at Amazon, which only costs thirteen dolls and has a built-in volume control. Battery life doesn't come anywhere near the 14 hours listed.  Maybe if you set the contrast to 0%, turn off the backlight, don't use the EAX sound effects, play only 128kbps or lower music, set the volume to 1, then maybe.  I've turned off my backlight, changed my contrast from a high of 50% to 20% and generally don't use the EAX sound affects, which has given me 6 to 8 hours of playtime, which is more than plenty.  Would be nice if the battery life indicator had more than just 3 bars (actually 4 bars if you count zero bars as a count....even at zero bars, the player can still go for awhile).  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone. iPods are overrated in my opinion.  I've owned this thing for about a month now...so obviously, I can rate it yet on longevity.

<Title>Pros and Cons
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for about a month and i have found some good things about it and some bad things. Pros: - It has a great price for a great value. First it comes with a carrying case and 30GB for only $200 (unlike an ipod 4Gb $250?) - I found that the headphones it comes with have better sound quality then your average $20 headphones. - It has many variations of sound effects you can have on it     For example you have and equlizer that you can customize or it already has some settings you can have on it. also there are environment sound effects that can make it sound like its playing in a Indoor arena, garage, cancert hall, bathrom hall, and many more. - The balck light works great. Every time you touch a button it will go on and when your not touching a button it will turn off whatever you programed it to (3, 5 ,15 ,30 ,60 seconds).  Cons: - The screen easily scratches (but the scratches are not noticble you havre to be in direct sunto see it and its not thta noticble or a problem) - It does not have any games unlike the ipod - The headphones phomy  black stuff around can come off kind of easy if in your pockect or bag and if you loose it the heaphones become very uncomfotable and they will easily fall out.  - It is bigger then an ipod but it is still smaller then a cd player - To replace the battery is $50 and it takes about 3 hours to charge  I do recomend getting this MP3 player. So far a really like it and i do find it better then an ipod

<Title>Great Mp3  with a geat price
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this mp3 of about 2 days now and i am amazed! I has everythin you can want and very easy to use. True True it is a  little thick but dosnt make much difference. It comes with a beautiful case and pretty good head buds. If you can try to use  Windows Media Player 10 instead of creatives software. Also u can use it as a external drive.It is also one of the few players to offer eax wich has sound levelling and time-scaling(speed). I am also amazed at the great boot times it has,instant, It is a great barigin and i will post some pics of it soon.   P.S if your regstry is corrupt like mine and it give the error of you not being an admin you can open a new windows accout and install the drives there and then delete that account.

<Title>Not happy with my Nomad Jukebox
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, I am NOT biased toward Creative Labs or Apple.  I bought Creative Labs' 30 GB Nomad Jukebox after much research.  I liked that it was 30GB, and only $220.  A good amount of people recommended it, and were happy with other CL products.  But for me, getting started didn't go smoothly at all.  Trying to copy all my files over was difficult, and I never really got it done.  It didn't work well with Windows Media Player, and even it's own software that came in the box.  It attempted some kind of conversion on every song it copied over.  It took forever, and the process always died out before completing.  Then a day later, I got the "FIRMWARE LOCKED UP" blue screen of death.  I returned the Nomad and bought the Apple 40GB iPod.  Admittedly, I paid much more ($400 for 40GB).  But it was super easy to get up and running, I was listening to music in about an hour (after charging it).  I am not saying don't buy the Nomad, but for me the experience wasn't so great.

<Title>Poor product, poor support
<Date>Thu Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After a few months of working correctly, my Jukebox one evening had a "Harddrive Problem." It wouldn't let me reboot, reinstall the product OS, reformat the drive or anything. It just keeps giving me a error screen stating "Harddrive Problem" Also, my PC no longer recognized it as an attached peripheral device.  Apparently Creative Zen products are designed to operate ONLY just beyond the length of the warranty. What a terrible piece of hardware. I took great care in researching and deciding when I was originally trying to decided which mp3 player product to buy. Apparently I made the wrong choice.  Even though the appeal of so much hard drive space for the lower price is strong, the adage is true: you get what you pay for. In this case, you get a lot of hard drive space- the hard drive just doesn't always work.  KEEP COMPARISON SHOPPING!

<Content>...you'll probably need to make sure you carry a paper clip in your pocket. I use mine to reset the player when it freezes up when starting, this happens about once a week.   The sound is very good and I had plenty of capacity to store my 400 CD's.

<Title>Good Overall, But Could be Better
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for over 6 months now, and am generally happy with its performance.  In terms of value, its huge storage capacity is great, especially compared to the more expensive iPod, but it has shortcomings too.   The Good: -Hard drive is huge.  I have my whole music library on it and still have plenty of room for more music. -It is relatively small -It works very well with Musicmatch.  I don't even use the software it came with.  The Bad: -Battery life isn't very good and if you want to use it in the car, I have yet to find a car adapter to work with it -Menus are hard to figure out and manuver -If you don't use it for a while, it won't work until it "rebuilds the library" which is annoying and takes time.  Bottom line:  every accessory on the market now seems to be totally geared towards the iPod, so if you want the fully integrated MP3, this probably isn't the best way to go.

<Title>Durable,Inexpensive,Great Sound
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most people that have commmented on this mp3 player have put it down just because its not an ipod. In my opinion your getting 26 gbs more of space for 50 bucks LESS than an ipod.   Durability:  Well if you drop it hard the face plate will pop off without damaging the product. If it does break you have a 90 day warranty.  MP3 Playback:  Diamond clear sound is produced by this player. I have 345 songs on it and they all play beautifully. 345 songs is about equal to about 18 mix cds. The 14 hours of battery isn't true it usually only puts out 6-8 before chugging out.   BOTTOM LINE:  I've had no problems with it except that it is slightly to large  to fit into my pocket comfortably. 197 dollars, 197 dollars. The only problem other than size is the freezing about once or twice a week. Its a great gift.

<Title>Good value, but a bit "clugey" and so far not very reliable
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't fall for the "I just gotta have an iPod" phenom.  I researched and found the Nomad to be a much better value.  I now have 2 of them; a 30 and a 40GB.  Although I really like them and use them a lot, I have had some problems with both, as follows: 1. The pre-packaged software is not real intuitive and I couldn't get it to work on one of my PCs running XP Pro.  It wouldn't recognize the player.  I recommend trying to get it to work with either Music Match (my recommendation) or Windows Media V.10 both of which I got to work easily and you are probably already familiar with one of those interfaces. 2. The 30Gb suffered a HDD failure last night; lost everything and had to set up a return/replacement.  Unit is less than a month old! 3. The 40GB suffered a O/S corruption and I had to re-format and re-build the HDD.  Lost everything again (not a real big deal but a real hassle!). 4. I have had some trouble getting the unit to perform file transfers under USB 2.0 5. File transfers under the pre-packaged S/W is error prone.  On the UP side, I really like the sound although I use different headphones - I personally can't stand "ear buds". The ablility to vary the sound environment is way cool. I have been able to fix the 40GB unit myself with help from their (Creative) website. I gave the 30GB to my son as a X-mas present and he was in love with it until the HDD crashed! Then he acted like someone had punched him in the stomach when he realized what had happened!  Overall, my experience is somewhat disappointing.  It's a kin to the old MAC vs. Windows PC experience!  I hope the replacement 30GB works better and that I can get USB 2.0 to work consistantly.  I'm not giving up yet!

<Title>If I wanted good looks, I would have bought an Ipod.
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>upon first glance this review looks long, but pelase read it - generally the longer reviews point out the facts that you really want to know when buying something.  When I first started looking for an mp3 player with a large capacity, i was faced with many choices.  I narrowed it down to four-the 20GB MPIO, the 20 GB Ipod, the 20GB Creative Zen Touch, and this, the 30GB Nomad zen Xtra.  A few things turned me away from the Ipod.  Some friends had it, and complained about short battery life, The back of it scratching easily and showing every single fingerprint, and I read reviews about having to send it away to get the battery replaced.  The 20 GB Ipod was $400 (Canadian) at Future shop, plus taxes and a 3 year service plan, it would come out to about $540 total (I would never buy one of these things without a service plan, cause if you dont buy one,. something is bound to go wrong).  I didnt really look very hard at the MPIO.  It was fairly small, and it was $379 (Cdn).  I liked the Creative Zen Touch much better, and being 20GB as well, i figured if I ended up buying a 20GB player, i would pay the extra $20 and get the Creative.  So it was down to the two Creatives.  The 20 GB zen touch, and the 30 GB Zen Xtra.  I went to Future Shop to check them out, and found that the 30GB Xtra was a web-only offer, for $300.  I played around with the Zen touch, and liked it very much, but it would have cost me $540 total.  I could have paid that, but it seemed impractical when i could get a 30GB player for $300 (with taxes and 3 year service plan it came out to $400).  I went home and ordered it online.  It came a few days later, and I installed the software, which i found very easy to use, and started burning song to the player.  I have tons of albums, and within the first night of owning it I had about 1300 songs on it.  When I brought it to school the next day, most of my friends thought it was pretty cool, however, my Ipod friends laughed at me.  This thing is quite a bit bulkier than the Ipod, but hey, its still smaller than my discman, and it can fit in my pocket.  I just told the ipod ppl that i dont really care what it looks like, i can hold more songs than you, and it cost me less.  The touch-wheel on the ipod make it very easy and appealing, but the user interface on the Zen ztra is not all that difficult.  It may take a little longer to find a certain song or artist, but I just say thats because i have more songs on it.  I really had to rub it in on my Ipod mini friends, because seeing this they realized they have made a fairly stupid purchase.  Yes, the mini is small, and it has different colours, but its only 4 GB!! plus, it costs $30 more than my Creative.  My one friend paid about $460, because he bought the service plan.  Thats $60 more than I paid, and I have 26 GB more than he does.  I have had this player only a few days, no problems yet, but i am not worried.  The future shop service plan covers everything from hard drive failures to power surges to lightning striking your house while the mp3 player is plugged in to the wall (that happened with my xbox).  If anything goes wrong, i can get it replaced.  If i have one or more major problems within the 30 exchange period, i will likely upgrade (or downgrade?) to the Zen touch, but i cant see that happening.  So heres what I say:  If you want good looks, go mainstream and hop on the Ipod bandwagon.  But if you want an mp3 player that stores tons of songs for cheaper (not to mention the suberb sound quality - creative in known for making sound cards), then buy the Creative NOMAD Zen Xtra 30GB - you wont be disappointed.

<Title>Great, with minor setbacks
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Zen for my birthday about a month ago, and I'm sad to say that I had to return it. The upper right hand corner was coming off, for some reason, I think it started when I lifted the cover to put in the battery, and it didn't attach. When I went back to Best Buy to return, I noticed that the display model had the same problem, so I decided to try out a Rio Carbon. However, I really, really miss my Zen, there were some great features on it that I can't seem to find on any other player:  1. The EAX Audio: This thing is amazing. You can set "environment" like you're listening to your music in a small room, bathroom, airplane, etc. But the REALLY cool thing about EAX is the time-scale stuff: speeding up or slowing down your songs was awesome, and I really miss that feature, I think most of all. It was a great thing to have and I can't find it on any other player.  2. Battery life: I charged it twice in the entire time I owned it, and not once did it die or come close to it. I didn't calculate how long it lasted, but it was great not having to worry about it stopping all the time like with some players. It's also easy to charge, just a plug-in DC (not like the Rio Carbon I have now, which you hook to a USB, then to a DC...maybe I'm just lazy) and it doesn't take long at all.  3. Storage: This is a big one. I loved having the huge amount of space, but I decided I really wouldn't use that much (ever) but I got about 200 songs on it and barely tapped the memory.  4. Software: By far the easiest mp3 player software out there. I absolutely loved it, it's horrible not to have anymore. Very simple, look at the instructions once and it's the easiest thing to figure out.  5. Carrying case: An all-in-all awesome thing. Holds it perfectly, GREAT belt clip (not a cheesy falling apart one) and it feels actually like leather, although I don't think it is. It rocked and I miss it. :(  6. LCD Display: This was the most attractive thing about the player. Not only the LCD light, but the icons on the screen were more fun to look at and better than boring words.  7. Delete feature: If you have a song you don't want, all you do is click it and scroll to delete. Awesome feature.   The only other thing I DIDN'T like about the player was the size. It was bigger than a 40 gb Ipod, and thicker too. A little heavier, but a small price to pay for such a great unit. All in all a great buy.

<Title>A Flawless MP3 Player.  But Not A Perfect One.
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned this thing for over 3 months now and I have had no problems.  I've heard a lot of bad things about this player and how it crashes/skipps/breaks after 90 days to 3 months.  See theres a catch to it though.  Some people are stupid and will write a review on how it broke but they never tell you how BADLY they treated it cause they think they treat it fair while others think they treat it like crap.  You have to watch out for that in reviews.  I learned it the hard way.  Lets start out by listing the features on this thing.  It starts out with the best feature of all, REPLACEABLE LI-Ion Battery! Thats right.  You can buy one in your local electronics store for around $35-$50.  (Prices range from what store/deal you get)  The reason not to get an iPod is this.  When the iPods battery dies, (which is in about 18 months they say) they make you send it in, pay $100 and wait for the replacement.  I personally think thats horrible.  With the Zen, you can just pop off the faceplate and replace the battery yourself.  Easy as that.  Another great feature on the software part of this player, is the EAX sound enhancemnts which allow you to make it sound different, speed up the song without wrecking the song or slow it down, and you have all your presets such as Rock, Pop, Jazz, Vocal and such. The menus on this are very easy.  I got used to it very fast.  I would say the learning curve is about 15 minutes for a average electronics person.  On the side of the player there is a scroll wheel which moves up and down for picking and you can press it in for selection.  Theres a play/pause/ |>> &lt;&lt;| and volume up and down buttons. There is also a Menu and Back button which I'll get into in a second.  BUT...there is no pause button as people say on here.  Luckily for all of you I have read a persons review telling you how to stop it and it really does act as a stop button sequence.  Pause the song and then hit |>> or forward track.  It stops!  Hooray! The menu button is for going all the way back to the menus if you dont want to press the back button 50 times cause you've gone through too many menus. Lastly, there is a power button. You should know what that does.  Hold it in to turn it on or off. Press it to button lock the buttons.  Ive been to a few review sites (here and Epinions.com) and I've noticed that people were having trouble with the headphone jacks.  They would fail or fall loose after a few days.  I was never going to get this mp3 player if that was the case. WELL LISTEN UP BECAUSE IM GOING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT WHY THAT DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE.  Creative re-released this version of the jukebox in a heatsealed package.  When you open it up and it has a SEE THROUGH WINDOW in the case, (which the old models didn't which meant they had the old headphone jacks/faulty HDD's) then you have the new jukebox that has ALL the problems fixed: Hard Drive, Headphone Jack, and faulty hard drives.  Trust me.  I did so much research before i got one of these.  I am a die hard music fan and i am a HUGE audiophile.  Just make sure its a heatsealed package and a window in the case.  Read around and you'll find the information I got from other reviews on other sites too.    The sound on this thing sounds beautiful compared to the iPod.  I'd say this one has the best sound out of the Iriver and ipod because it IS Creative Labs and they are all about sound cards, speakers, so you know they have the best sound around. (plus on the package it says up to 98DnB!!! Thats good!!!)  The bass is not overpowered but everything blends together to make it sound great.  There is bass yes....but not A LOT like some overpowered CD Players.  The headphones included are actually pretty good but they are too big for my ears.  They have a gold plated plug which enhances the sound greatly. Plus the cords are white ;)  The USB 2.0 works great! It transfers very fast on my computer (a song every .60 seconds)  I recommend purchasing Red Chairs Software: Notmad Explorer because the bundled software with the Zen is pretty bad.  Its faulty, crashes (on my top of the line computer) and sometimes doesnt even transfer songs i told it to transfer.  Red Chair software claims their Usb transfer rate is a good deal higher than creatives.  Right now I just use Nomad Explorer that came with the Zen.  Its the easiest, fastest, flawless software they give you.  Use other programs to manage your music.  I heard of my friend losing his whole collection on his computer because of Creative Media Source.  (Hes sorta a computer noob though)  The carrying case included is terrible and bulky but sturdy so i dont use it.  Plus, the clear stuff over the screen is GLASS so it doesnt scratch barely at all.  The Aluminum casing in the front and back feels solid and well built.  All in all, you should by this mp3 player because of the replaceable battery and its 14 hours instead of 12 of playback.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because it is a BIT bulky and a little heavier than the ipod but its 100 dollars less for 10 MORE, YES MORE GIGS OF STORAGE MORE BATTERY LIFE AND A REPLACEABLE BATTERY!!  Good job Creative.

<Content>After my iPod was stolen, my wife bought me one of these.  I stuck with it for about 2 weeks, but then I had to eBay it.  In short if you've had an iPod, you simply cannot make the switch to such an inferior product.  If, on the other hand, this is your first mp3 player you won't notice what a raw deal you're actually getting.  I would only recommend this product for first time buyers, or those that value cost over quality.  Just my two bits ......

<Title>Once the honeymoon was over....
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVED my Jukebox for the first eight months I owned it.  I had a bit of a problem getting the software to work, but beyond that -- the sound quality and battery life suited my needs without question.  I would have like the software to allow for better file organization, but you can't have everything.    Then my headphone jack went (I tried 2 other sets of headphones, it's the jack.)  After reading reviews here and on other user forums, I found others had the same problem.   I wasn't overly concerned since I assumed that Creative stood behind their products and fixing it wouldn't be a problem.  I soon found that Customer Service at Creative is abysmal, and that's on a good day.  They only take calls during the M-F working day, and about 48 hours to get back to you via e-mail.  The only solution available was to send THEM $40 for the dubious honor of assessing whether it was (a) broken and (b) fixable.  They also made note that if I did want the device repaired, I would have to pay for it.  However, they did acknowledge this was a defect they were aware of.  I'd rate this policy in the "not-so-good" category.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do -- so for those of you looking to buy, I'd shy from committing to CREATIVE until they get their act together.  Like I said, it's a great device, but unless you can spend $350 every eight months, it may not be the product for you.

<Title>The new 2004 Zen Xtra is finally a great iPod alternative.
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As many people know Creative dropped the ball with this device in 2003.  There was a major problem with the headphone jack that caused it to break loose.    Creative fixed this problem and released the Zen Xtra again in 2004.  The result is an amazingly good and inexpensive option for people in the market for an iPod or jukebox MP3 player in general.  The Zen is bigger than the iPod, but the aluminum case looks nice and doesn't get scratched up as easily as the iPod.  I've owned two iPods and they scratch so easily that you have to put them in a case almost immediately to keep them from getting ruined.  Navigating songs is easier on the iPod, but the Zen navigation is pretty good and has a pretty quick learning curve.  It is also missing some of the useless features of the iPod like games and contacts.  However, you are buying this for music not to keep your appointments.  The Zen Xtra excels in several areas.  First is storage size with an amazing 30 GB for about $100 less than a 20 GB ipod.  Next is sound quality.  The Zen has easily better sound quality than the iPod and also has an EAX EQ that works very well and has many cool options.  The EQ on the iPod has never worked in four generations of devices.  The ability to make multiple and varied playlists on the go is unmatched on any device I have used.  You can also delete tracks without needed to hook up to the PC, something else the iPod lacks.    Instead of being stuck with just one PC jukebox option like the iPod you have multiple options.  The Zen will sync with the included software, the incredible Notmad Explorer, Real Player, Winamp, Windows Media Player, and many others.  This player also is fully compatible with Audible.com and I highly recommend that service to anyone getting a Zen Xtra.    For the price this is really the best MP3 Jukebox you can buy.  The Rio Karma is close, but the frequent harddrive failures have never been addressed by Rio so I would skip that one as well.  I've owned iPods, Rios and Sony Minidisc players and this player from Creative is better than them all.  It may not be as pretty as an iPod but it is better at what is important playing music.  Oh yeah, did I mention the battery is user replaceable.  Nice if you go on a long trip because you can bring an extra and switch it out.    I also want to note that the Zen now comes with a one year warranty instead of a 90 day one.  Nice for some piece of mind as a Zen owner.

<Content>Though it may not the sexy aesthetic appeal of an IPod, Creative's Jukebox has the necessary features and a remarkably low price tag.  Some people have complained about various defects in their product, but for an additional twenty dollars many stores offer insurance that will replace the product in full.  The software enclosed with the Jukebox is user-friendly and quite reliable.  There have been times when I had to restart the computer for it to recognize the player, but it has been few and far between.  On a whole I highly recommend this Jukebox for people on a budget, because there is certainly not a better deal out there.

<Content>I have several problems with this product and they are: 1. Either it doesnt have a stop button or I havent found it, this after printing the entire PDF manual 2. my play modes dont work unless I select random selection which is most irritating if I want an entire album to play sequentially and since I bought this product in the US but live in South Africa I am at a distinc disadvantage since I only discovered the fault once I returned home 3. the player is heavy and the clip on the case doesnt hold it securely when i wear it to walk I am constantly worrying that it will fall off my belt or pants 4. My player doesnt have a blue backlight for some reason  On the positive side, the sound is GREAT!!! A huge saving grace, and it stores so many full cd's I am never going to fill the drive, I think overall i would trade down in hard drive space to have a smaller product which is easier to use when gyming This item is fantastic for in the car or for lieing around the house.

<Content>I'm really sad that I have to return this unit. If it delivered on its promises it would be great. At first it didn't work. I updated the firmware. (A newbie wouldn't know to do this and would go nuts.)Then I read the fine print: You can't go jogging with this thing (which is why I got it)it's too delicate. Looking on various forums I find, ALL Creative players have faulty headphone jacks-- just a matter of time before you lose sound in one channel. People have gotten 2 & 3 replacements with the same problem! After the 90-day warranty, cost of repair is $95! Huh? For a $200 device? I now wonder if ANY hard drive MP3 player, including ipod, is durable enough for people on the go and into gyms & jogging. Corps want suckers to buy it, have it die, then buy another. I'm sticking with my ol' reliable 128 mb solid state player.

So I looked around and read reviews and looked to Creative, the Nomad 30g was less expensive than the Zen 5g, and I figured, well I only want to have to really ever buy One Mp3 Player, and extra space is way better than not enough, so Amazon had a sale and that was the point where I said, OK i'll buy it!  I got it yesterday, charged up the battery and started loading songs. I hadn't really ever used transferring music software, took a few mins to get used to the included software with the player, but it wasn't hard at all, and tranferring became quite easy.    I loaded a bunch of stuff, and still have tons of room left. (tip: use the wall charger when you're tranferring songs using your PC, seems to drain the battery quickly. Since you've already got the USB plugged in, its not really hard to have one more plug nearby)  The sound quality is very good, the case that comes with it seems like it's going to protect the player very nicely. I have small hands, it is slightly wide, but it's no big deal since I really have nothing to compare it to.  The playlists are easy to create and the player sorts your music in several different ways to be able to find it easily.  Here at work, I plugged some small desktop speakers into the headset jack, and voila' audio comes thru just fine!  I only gave it four starts and not five, because the plastic scroll button on the side seems like it could be sturdier, although I have had no problems with it. Also i'd like Creative to come out with interchangeable faceplates for the front, since the front plate comes off, which is where the battery is.  All in all, I've had it for about 24 Hours now and think it will become a trusted sidekick, esp. in the car where the endless commercials and flipping stations had become a daily routine.  For the features, the price and the storage, I think it's a pretty good deal.

<Date>Tue May 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had brought the Zen Xtra and had it replaced 3 times!!  For the 1st one I called Creative's tech support (which is horrible) they did't know what I ment by skipping and the songs cutting off.  I really like the unit so, as a last resort I contacted customer service where I purchased the unit.  They sent out a replacement immediately and a prepaid return for the unit.  I rcv'd the 2nd unit it did the same thing!  I had purchased a seperate drive to hold my transferred cd's which was about 200 until the new unit came. I just couldn't believe it!!! After all the trouble calling Creative the 1st time and worrying about running out of the 30 day time period that they would talk with me, I didn't even bother to to call them.  I e-mailed customer service where I got unit from and asked if maybe there was a problem with the units.  I've been in retail so I know these things happen.  When I had asked Creative they said no there was no problem and rushed me off the phone.  To my suprise my email was returned from where I purchased the Zen xtra and they stated there was a wide spread problem with the units.  They wouldn't be able to supply me with a new one because they wouldn't have them for about 4-8weeks.  My hats off to them for there honesty.  Because of there great customer service I put another on on order and this time the 60GB.    I waited patiently everyday checking stock.  When I rec'vd the 3rd unit it did the same thing.  Skipping songs, cutting them of I just couldn't believe it.  That unit has been returned and I will no longer purchase from CREATIVE!!!!! You don't even diserve the 1 star.  Hopefully your service and products will knock you out of the MP3 business!!!!!  I will continue to check amazon's reviews for an MP3 that is worthy of my time and money.  I'm hoping the iAudio increases ther product line to include 40GB or 60GB.  I'll keep checking because there reviews are good and they also include an FM radio.  W

<Content>I got mine for christmas of 04 and have loved it since. I have about 2500 songs on mine NOW and i have seen no problems,skipping,slow-downs or anything not working correctly. Its very easy to navigate from menu to menu. The sound quality is top notch and it even plays big high quality .WAV files. The battery life is very long i have played it for hours on end and the battery meter didnt even drop a single bar. and for 200$ it is the one u should buy. Creative Labs rock!

<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one reads the reviews on this site, one needs to take into account what else might be going on behind the scenes that affects one's experience with the product.  Never has this been so true as in the case of the Creative Nomad.  I bought mine almost three months ago and have had ZERO problems.  The hard drive has never frozen or crashed.  I bought Sony earbuds to use with it and it sounds great.  I use my car kit from an old cd player to play it in the tape deck and it's perfect for my commute.  I have never dropped it or handled it roughly.  I always keep it in the case.  I have used it while walking or lifting weights at the gym and it is too bulky to work that well for this.  I recommend a flashcard-based player for working out.  Furthermore, if you are a runner, all of the joistling will hurt the hard drive, if not make it skip.  Would you go running with your laptop strapped on you?  I would imagine not!  Hard drive players aren't meant for that kind of use.    The only complaints I have are the lack of a line-in jack, the size, and the battery life.  I have to charge mine once every two days after 3-4 hours of use.  I do have the EAX on, scroll around a lot on the songs, and have the volume up, so it stands to reason the battery is getting drained quicker.    I fully reccommend this mp3 player to the person who knows that it isn't indestructable and has common sense as far as to how it should be handled.  Ipod isn't the be-all end-all of mp3 players and Creative shows that in this product.                           ***Update***  I have now owned this player for eight months now and it works as well as the first time I fired it up and I use it every single day for a minimum of two hours.  The hard drive has never crashed.  I am still using the original battery (which is easily replaceable).  I download songs from RealPlayer and that works great; I have exceeded the hard drive space of an Ipod mini.  I stick with what I said above: it's a quality item as long as you know how to treat it.

<Content>Well I just passed the 3month mark with this Jukebox, and of course it stopped responding/playing.  It was fun while it lasted.  The sound quality was great.  But that is moot now that it does not work.  I wish I would have bought the extended warranty.  Dont bother with Creative's online support.  Have not received any help from them yet!  I guess it goes without saying, you get what you pay for.  I just wish I would have bought an Apple.  Maybe it would have lasted longer!!

<Title>This can take abuse.
<Date>Fri May 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let people fool you buy saying this product is junk.  I'm very happy with it.    I got this because i'm always on the road and at any given time i would have about 40 cds or so sitting in my car getting sat on, scratched, broke, etc.. I don't take very good care of my stuff.   I take this with me everywhere, In the winter I plow snow, so When i'm plowing long nights the long life battery works great.  In the the summer I mow lawns, I use walk-behind mowers, riders, weed whip... I'm always running around getting this this covered in grass.   I put this thing through all sorts of abuse. I've dropped my nomad around 10 times(I'm very clumsy). I've even dumped coffee on it one day in my truck, All i had to do is take the face plate  off and let it dry out. I was listening to it an hour later.  Don't let people fool you. This is a great sturdy product that is easy to use.  I only gave it a 4 because i did not like the headphones that came with it. They have good sound, but don't fit in your ear very good and the foam does not stay on the earphone

<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing.  I have put about 400-500 songs on there and it works fine. I run with this in my pocket, change and stuf usually inside. The headphones that came with it were pretty bad,  but i have my ow, so i just used those.  It was a bit bulkier than i expected, but i had a juicebox that was about 2 timesbigger so i really didnt notice  Considering that the ipod is $100 more and you have to convert all your songs to work  with it, this is great.  The battery lfe is amazing. I have gotten at least 16hours if i turn off the  backlight.   Great buy, just consider it before you buy an ipod

<Content>Husband has had this since Father's Day last June and has had NO problems with this. He uses it nearly every waking moment, no kidding, even when watching TV-he is an audio addict. He uses it on the way to work with the FM radio gizmo, he uses it at work, at home working, while on hikes in the mountains, while grocery shopping, etc. He has worn out two sets of ear phones but the Jukebox still keeps on going. He purchased the extended warrenty for two years but has had no problems at all and has not had to use the warrenty. He records old 33 rpm records he gets at garage sales, then to files, and then to the Jukebox with no problems what so ever-I would have heard much swearing if it did not work well and I have heard no complaints for the Father's Day gift. I have trouble figuring out the buttons, but my husband loves it and has not had problems

<Title>works for me
<Date>Fri Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I spent hours and hours researching mp3 players when I decided to invest in one. At first, I was dead-seat on getting and iPod, no matter the cost. Yes, I had been sucked into all Apple's advertising and the sheer "coolness" people who owned one seemed to have. Then I went online. I could not believe the cost of the iPod for so little space and so many problems. I'm a full-time college student who's also trying to hold down a part-time job and a life and I simply wasn't going to smack down the 400 bucks (not to mention the 100 dollars I'd inevitably have to pay for a new battery) for such a low rated product. After many more hours of research I decided on the Nomad. I haven't had my player as  long as some of the other reviews but I feel this is the best $215 (I got new headphones as well) I've ever spent.    The sound quality is fantastic. A few of my friends have iPods,  iRivers, etc. and I have to say my player beats them all in this area. You'll hear things in the music you've never heard before and this, for me, is one of the best features. If you love your music as much as I love mine you'll appreciate this feature. Just make sure you get some good quality earbuds.   The battery power is good and even though there are only three bars when you use your player you'll get a feel for about how long it'll last. Of course, battery life wanes depending on whether you have the EAX Audio on, how long the backlight it set to show and how much you fidget with the buttons. Mine has never died on me. The battery is replaceable for as little as $35 at Radio Shack, that was another selling point for me.   I love the software. Maybe I'm stupid but I haven't figured out Music Match and it annoys me. The Creative software is easy to use, fast and syncs all you're files. I haven't had any problems so far and it's set as my default player now.   The appearance on the Nomad isn't as shiny and aesthetically pleasing as the iPod apparently is but really, if that's your major concern in deciding on a player you have bigger problems. This player is still sleek and very portable. Yes, it is a little "chunkier" than an iPod but it still fits into my pocket and it is durable.   I have dropped my player once from about four feet onto the pavement two days after I got it and I almost had a panic attack. I had read all the horror stories about the player breaking or shattering into a million pieces but all that happened was the face plate and battery popped out and I got a weird look from the Blockbuster girl. It has only frozen once and that was probably my fault, I asked it to do too many things at once. Also, I walk a lot and even though it isn't intended for athletic use it hasn't given me any problems.   Ultimately, though, the price was the deciding factor. I got 10 gig more than the $400 iPod at half the price. Considering how much money I have already invested in my record collection and in replacing damaged CDs which I was lugging with my everywhere I think I got one heck of a deal.  This is a great player but it does have problems.   While my buttons haven't broken they are flimsy, as one reviewer put it. The scroller button is plastic and easy to push the wrong way (i.e. the breakable way) and there is no stop button. I can't leave the player on 'pause' for too long because that drains the battery so I end up turning it off all the time and then turning it back on.   The backlight isn't as bright as the iPods and it hurts my eyes which are bad enough already.   I know it won't last forever and I'm worried about the crappy Creative customer service I've been hearing so much about. I've been taking care of it and not banging it around (you really really should treat it like the computer it is if you want it to last).   All right, enough said. Just know that if you're researching players I highly recommend this product. There is not "perfect" mp3 player but this is a darn good one.

<Title>Darn near perfect, taken as a whole
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just received this unit yesterday, and pumped it full of my "stuff".  It's playing one of the classical collections included on the hard drive as I write this review.  Just how much more exciting can an mp3 player get?  Probably NOT ALOT.  Even after two decades in the high tech arena, I am stunned by the "novelty" of backing up my entire customer contact database, ALL my client quotes and letters and such, a 350MB Outlook mailbox and hardly denting the storage on a device the size of two cigarette packs.  ALL my Christmas (its Christmas, not Holiday) music, ALL my Audible audio books (couple dozen, mostly long ones), ALL my extended self-help stuff (alot), and the thing still has more than 25GB left.  AWESOME.  What's AWESOME:  - The capacity for the price.  Even if you had to take a physical beating from some guy selling one on eBay, there would be no way to compete with the price/capacity proposition.  This fact may stem the sheep-like purchases of the iPod being sold at criminal prices . . because they can.  - The earbuds are surprisingly high fidelity as long as your music isn't RRRREEEEEEEE-BOOM-BOOM-RRRRRRREEEEEEE!, which isn't really music so much as self-abuse anyway.  - The battery, unlike so many portable product batteries, GIVES you the impression that it is there to power this thing all day long.  It is so surprisingly robust as to actually make it less disappointing when it finally gives up the ghost and needs a recharge.  - The carrying case is almost unbelievable in construction and materials quality, for being a giveaway especially.  I have the new one with the window cut out.  The only GLARING item here is the hole that's missing for the power cord.  ?!?  - The charger has a very standard AC cord that can be replaced without replacing the whole unit.  BRILLIANT.  - The speed of data transfer is almost unbelievable given that its going over a USB cable to a "couple of packs of cigarettes".  What's NOT awesome:  - The controls are a bit "scattered" in their design.  While close to chunk-blowing, they don't actually go over the edge of the cliff.  - The belt clip that is solidly sewn into the back of the case BLOWS CHUNKS.  Be CAREFUL about that.    - I understand this unit used to have a scrolling wheel instead of a "flipper" wheel. Changing to the flipper was STUPID, although not the end of the world.  Creative Staff: next time, take the scrolling wheel off of a 5 year old Sony cell phone, and beat that design.  - The dismal backlight, combined with the almost "pretend" contrast controls, and small text make the unit a real teaser for anyone who is remotely visually challenged.  Given that the display is bigger that some portable TV sets, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING regarding the text size?  The backlight on mine is NOTHING like the advertisment in terms of brightness and clarity. STILL, not a deal killer, but it aggravates my sciatica something awful.  - A bit clunky size-wise, but for half the cost of the equivalent sheepPod, who cares?  My Advice to Creative:  - Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  I SAID, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  THAT IS TO SAY, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  MEANING THAT, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  What you should take away from this is that Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  - When the Thinking Cap slides off one's head and onto the floor in the design phase, the correct response is to PICK IT UP AND PUT IT BACK ON, straightaway.  Clearly, the folks at Apple secured theirs with duct tape when they designed the fiendishly overpriced sheepPod.  You need to do the same.  The Upshot: One of the most AMAZING electronic devices of any sort I have ever seen or used for under $800.

<Title>Zen Xtra worth the money
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently bought the Creative Zen Xtra 30GB mp3 player.  Positive: The sound quality is great.  Not a whole lot of bass, but that's not really important.  I don't reccommend using the premade equalizer configurations though, they all lower the volume and you have to max it out.  I have over 900 songs on the player and they all sound great!  Haven't even touched half of the memory.  You can replace the battery yourself.  Yes, you have to buy another one but you don't have to pay extra to send it off and get it replaced along with the cost of another battery.  Software and player itself are really easy to use.  I have Windows 98 SE and had no problems.  Usually my computer has a problem downloading new hardware but not with the player.  Very compatible.  Price! The apple ipod 20Gb player costs about $300.  The Zen Xtra is 30GB and only cost $200.  That's a hundred dollars less for 10 more GB's!  Negatives:  I have had the player for a week now and it has frozen twice.  Once on the first day and once today.  Just have a paper clip with you to reset it just in case (I kept this in mind after reading another review, thanks!)  For something with so much memory I wish it had a voice recorder or even radio capabilities.  Mp3 player is a little bulky, but it's not anything you can't get used to.  Battery life isn't really as long as they advertise.  It's probably really half.  And if you want to keep the battery working longer just don't let it reach the last bar.  Always keep recharging even if it's not going to be used at that time.

<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned this mp3 player for a few weeks and I'm really very impressed with it.  I'm on a really tight budget (college student with a minimmum wage job), and I think you get the most bang for your buck here.  Pros: 1)Huge memory, especially when you compare it to other mp3 players in the same price range 2)Great sound quality (Creative makes good sound cards though, so I'm not surprised) 3)The time scale feature (you can speed up a song to double speed, or slow it down to half)  I don't really see any use for speeding up the music, but I'm a musician (I play mostly guitar) and being able to slow down the tracks is amazing.  Now that the guitar mags are including CD's with the musical examples in them I can really get a lot out of them (I dunno, maybe I suck, but I think that they play everything way too fast to try to figure out on those CD's) 4)User replaceable battery (take that Apple) 5)Fast transfer rate (on my comp., Windows XP 2.01 ghz) 6)Can be used as an external hard drive  Cons: 1)Doesn't have all the bells and whistles (ie voice recorder, FM broadcaster, radio, etc.) 2)It's kinda big and clunky 3)Short battery life 4)Only compatible with MP3, WAV, and WMA files 5)Buttons (especially the scroller) feel flimsy 6)90 day warrenty.  I don't know.  For something this expensive it shouldn't break, but I wish it was guarenteed longer. 7)LOTS of menus (but I guess that's unavoidable)  This is really convenient for me.  I have a little over 150 Cd's and a lot of audio files on my comp.  I havn't even used a third of the memory and I have 3894 tracks on it (though about 1200 are guitar tracks, and they're only about 5-10 seconds long).  Maybe if you have the extra money you should look at something else, but this is good for the price (assuming it holds together) and I'm satisfied.

<Content>I find it difficult to describe how little I like this product. It paused, froze, shut down on its own, and even erased its own hard drive before I finally got rid of it. The battery, when fully charged, only lasted somewhere around 4 hours. And, in case you were wondering, it is emmense and horribly ugly. So save yourself the trouble and the money: Don't Buy It! Though it does work well as a paperweight - an incredibly offensive-looking paperweight.

<Title>Newbie to the DAP world
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I guess I am a few years behind the rest of many DAP owners.  I just received my first digital audio player in the mail about a week ago, the 30 gig Zen Xtra from Amazon.com.  Out of the box I was actually surprised to see how small it was.  All these reviews complain about how bulky and large it is but for someone who has carried around a CD player for many years this is a welcome sigh of relief.  I now have about 600 songs on the player and so I dont have to carry my CD case around anymore either.  I spent three weeks reading reviews on various sites and debating between several jukebox players before purchasing this model.  I was able to get this player through amazon.com for about $130 less than an over-priced IPOD and thats what did it for me.    Remember that I have only been a proud owner for about a week now but here is what I have come up with so far.    pros:       - huge storage, more than I will ever need (15000 songs!)       - Wonderful sound for files loaded at 64kps       - software is much easier to use than expected. I ripped  down and labled (no home internet) 600 songs in a total of 4 hrs.  USB 2.0 is amazing, 42 Led Zeppelin songs in 27 seconds!       - Playlist managment and organization is easy, a learning curve of about 15 minutes of playing around with the software. Like I said, I have never owned one of these things before.       - removable battery!  I cant imagine paying $100 to have one replaced in a year.         - very nice carrying case that clips on your side.       - Recognizes several types of files        cons:        - scrolling button seems somewhat flemsy        - I wish the warranty was longer than 90 days         - no FM but thats not what I bought it for anyway        - had to buy earbuds at walmart that would stay on ($8), but they all come with those things.  If I had to do it over again I absolutly would buy again.  Hope this helps!

<Title>Great jukebox
<Date>Thu Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did some research in looking for a good JB that would not break my budget.  I have some friends that have the Dell DJ.  So I looked at the Dell DJ, Zen Xtra and an Ipod.  I decided to go with the Xtra.  The reasons why?  1. Zen works with WMA files (Ipod does not, which stopped my considering Apple)  2. Zen's battery is easily to replace.  Quick run to Radio Shack.  (Apple is proprietary (expensive) and Dell's is not easy to get into)  3. Previously owned a Creative Jukebox 1 and have had great luck with it.  Never had an issue with it.  4. The price was $100 cheaper than Dell and $200 than Ipod.  For around $200 on Amazon, I got a 30 gig unit.  Try to find that with Dell or Apple.  What I don't like about it...  1. Software that came with it is not great.  It is not as bad as the original stuff that came with the JB1, but Notmad by Red Chair solved that issue.  Plan on an extra $25 to get it.  Nice thing is that it is available for Ipod and Dell as well.  Well worth the money regardless of which unit you buy!  2. Little wheel feels cheap compared to Dell's, but no one has reported major issues with it.  3. It is a little bigger in physical size than the other 2.  No big deal for me since I am not using it jogging or anything like that.  I use mine for listening to music in the bedroom, car and office.  Easy access to my music collection was my goal.  I've seen people complain that there is not a stop button on it.  The Dell unit doesn't have one either.  Both have a pause button which works fine for stopping the unit.  I have not missed the stop at all.  Hope these insights help others looking.  I am very please with my purchase.  Highly recommend it.

You can choose your songs by artist, genre album or all tracks! if you can't find the song you simply click on the letter which it begins with and the mp3 player will find it for you. The instructions are very easy to understand and it comes with its own CD to help you download songs into your mp3 player. If you buy it, you wont be dissapointed.

<Content>ok so for christmas all my friends got ipods and i got a nomad. yea i guess i was disappointed because i wasn't as 'cool' hahaha. no i love my nomad because the software is so easy to use once you get started. i love it because i can put a cd in and it will get all the track info and then put it directly onto my player. i won't have to load it to the computer and then onto my player. the ipods won't let you do that. plus a few of my friends who got their 'sweet' ipods have been having some trouble with songs getting deleted and the software being difficult to use. i find it easy to use and the battery seems to last a while. i'm taking it to europe with me for ten days so i'll see if it can withstand a long trip it should! but on occasion it does freeze up all i have to do it reset it and it saves all my songs so its not a big deal. i have the 30GB and i don't really think i can fill up the 8,000 songs i'm only at like 700. But i would really recommend this to someone who is looking to get a decent mp3 player with out the whole 'label' concern because this is durable, reliable and it holds so much without the steep price tag.

<Title>Great Player for the money!
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this player! There a tone of reviews here, so I'm just going to add a few suggestions from my experience.  This is what happened to me when I first got it:  The first night I downloaded about 8 gigs onto it.  I didn't touch it after that for another day.  The next time I downloaded some more on it, no matter how much I did, after about 24 hours of it being off (and charged), all the recent mp3s/wmas wouldn't show up in music/albums.  It would still show it was there (in the total space being taken), but no music.  At that point, I had loaded about 25 gigs and didn't want to reformat.. But I bit the bullet and reformatted eventually, and it fixed the problem.  Hope this helps anyone else that has this weird problem.   There's another program called Notmad by Red Chair Software that makes it much easier to put music on your player.  Just load the driver, then Notmad, and everything will be great.  I'm still waiting for someone to crack it to load other formats of music besides mp3/wmas.

<Title>I'm sorry I bought it...
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Lasty July I bought this unit, and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, they were dashed very quickly. I realize that I might have gotten a defective player, but still:  1. The software is cumbersome and difficult to use. (It's also nearly impossible to do a clean uninstall from your hard drive, even though the manufacturer claims otherwise.)  2. The sound quality was mediocre at best. (I used Grado SR-60s, not the phones that came with the player, or others of comparable quality -- i.e., cheap.)  3. I had persistent hard drive problems from the get-go. My player tended to freeze at least once a day (usually several times a day), and crashed altoghether right around the end of my 3-month warranty period. The screen shows an icon with the caption "hard disc error." A Creative rep. told me that it would cost at least $100.00 to replace the hard drive; and $40.00 to reflash it. (iPod users can reflash at home...)  4. The belt clip isn't trustworthy.  5. The controls aren't exactly ergonomically designed -- I got mild tendinitis from using them!  The only pro (to my mind): the replaceable battery.  I'm not a shill for Apple, but I ended up buying a 4G, 40 GB iPod  late last year. I've had NO problems with it, and the sound is far, far better than that of the Creative player. (I'm still using the same headphones.)   The upshot: I love my iPod. My Zen XTRA was nothing but trouble!  Suggestions:   1. If I were to investigate other brands/models further, I would probably buy an iRiver, or else get a new iPod. And if I were an audiobook listener, a Creative MuVo would probably be my choice. but I will never, ever make the mistake of buying a dedicated music player from them again...  2. Make sure that you have an extended warranty or are able to purchase one (or a replacement coverage plan) if you buy this unit. I wish I'd sprung for either or both.  3. Give Red Chair Software's Notmad program a try. I use their Anapod Explorer (finding it far superior to iTunes) and have seen a lot of raves on various Nomad sites, including Nomadness. (I do not work for Red Chair - I'm just a satisfied customer.)

<Title>great buy
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, this mp3 player is great.  The top of my christmas list was a mp3 player.  I wanted a sleek looking one, but the ipod was way too expensive.  My older brother found this one, it had rebates as well, and got himself one as well as one for a present for me.    I am very pleased with this item.  The software is easy to use.  If you can use any player such as music match, this software is a snap.  Loading songs was a breeze, the one complaint is that you should make sure all your songs have their artists and song names correct before transfer.  I didn't do this and it took me a about an hour to fix, but it was very easy to fix.  Once I fixed it, it automatically uploaded the correct information onto the player since it was plugged in.  Once the songs are on the player you can suffle songs (amongst other play options), it has different EAX properties you can mess with.  You can choose your songs by genre, artist, etc, just like most players on a computer.  The controls are very very easy to use.  A good thing is that you can use it easily with one hand.    It also comes with a case with is nice since most other mp3 players, you have to shell out at least another 20 bucks for a case.  The headphones that came with it sound great.  This player almost sounds better than my expensive computer speakers!  I had to get a different pair of headphones because these wouldn't stay in my ear.  I have that problem with all ear buds.  So if earbuds work on you, then these headphones are very good.  Charging doesn't take long at all.  The first time I used it, I charged it and transfered at the same time.  I have had it since Dec 2004 and it hasn't frozen or any problems what so ever with it.  in short:  Pros: -looks sleek -has a removable battery -comes with case -huge storage space -very easy controls -sounds superb  Cons: -a little bit bulkier than ipod -just a scroll control instead of touch sensitive(like ipod has)  I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want to shell out a ton of money for an ipod, but still wants a very good player.

<Title>I highly recommend this player!
<Date>Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I actually looked this page up *in order to leave a review*, because I have been so pleased with the player so far!  I'm now at six months of ownership with some pretty intense usage, and I haven't had a problem yet, despite dropping the player once or twice from about five feet.  Pros: The storage capacity is impressive: I've got my entire CD collection on it (a little over 200 CDs), and there's still plenty of space left.  This is great for me since I go overseas for months at a time and can now easily take my whole CD collection with me.  The interface is simple and easy to use.  The sound quality is fantastic, especially with a ton of preset equalizer settings.  My favorite feature is that it plays wma (Windows Media) files, as they are easy to rip and are often smaller than mp3s of comparable quality.  Cons: My complaints are minor.  The first is the size of the player, which is much bulkier than an iPod.  The second is that scrolling through menus can be a pain.  A partial solution to this is to make playlists in advance on your computer using the Creative software (which has a great user interface) and transferring those to the player.  If you're seeking an mp3 player that works well, sounds great, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg: you've found it!

<Title>Weak custom EQ, somewhat bulky, great sound quality
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm impressed with the 98dB S/N ratio and the Zen Xtra sounds cleaner than any portable I've heard. Higher quality earbuds or headphones make it even better.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on reliability but unmentioned rough handling may account for half the bad reviews. I would make sure to never drop this thing or even bump it on a table. Save the casual handling for a solid state device. The scroll wheel feels like it could possibly break if you repeatedly don't press on the exact center, but I like how it functions.  Some tracks just won't copy to the unit (internal file corruption?) and others will copy but freeze when you try to play them. This has only happened with 3 of 1,000 tracks so far. 2 were downloaded MP3s and 1 was WMA with DRM. Sometimes, various tracks will "hiccup" when first played. I assume it's a hard-drive lag issue.  My only real complaints are bulk and weight (it's a bit hefty for true portability) and the weak selection of custom equalizer frequencies. The "low" end is only 100hz, which is the realm of boomy bass. It seems like a big oversight not to offer 50hz or 60hz, with more than 4 bands, but better headphones or speakers minimize that gripe. I still hope Creative will make a firmware upgrade that adds 50hz or 60hz to the Custom Equalizer's low end.  Commentary: WMA sounds a lot cleaner than MP3 at equivalent bitrates and we ought not be stuck on the term "MP3 player." The manual does mention that it takes more battery power to play/decompress WMA files.

<Title>Amazing.... while it lasts
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Nomad because I needed a lot of memory for as little as possible. I'm on a tight budget, there aren't exactly a lot of jod oppertuneties for a 15 year old. I bought the thing about a month ago, and I loved it. In fact, I wrote a review for it here, ad gave it five stars. Then, the thing clonked out on me. I can't get music onto it, the software won't recognize it, etc.. So now I'm stuck with a 220.00 dollar usless lump of trash. I hope I can return it or something. Anyways, I plan on getting an Ipod, i suggest you don't make my mistake.

<Title>Poor performer in the MP3 line
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit because of the 30G storage and the price was decent.  I must admit the sound quality was very good.  After charging it up initially, there were many preloaded tunes that were inaudible even at max volume.  Same thing with tunes I loaded. Tech support was OK, they suggested bringing it back to the store to get a new once since the firmware upgrade didn't help or reformatting the hard drive either. 2nd unit worked ok for about 2 weeks.  Went to use it after 4-5 days of no use, and I could power it on and that was it.  No response from the wheel, power button etc...nada.  Had to remove the battery to shut it off. It went back to the store and I got a Rio Carbon instead.  Awesome sound, more compact, sleeker and functions much more reliably.  No more Creative products for me.

<Title>Sort of like it
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 30gb Nomad jukebox because of Creative Labs' reputation for high sound quality, and the nice price/memory ratio.   I was mostly pleased with my jukebox when i received it in the mail.  The sound is great, the controls are functional and easy to master, the software worked on my Windows XP with no glitches.  However, I have to say that, I wish it was just a little bit smaller and sleeker...that's right, like the ipod.  These are just minor aesthetic gripes.    About two weeks into using my Nomad, the headphone jack stopped working, no sound at all.  I could tell that the hardware was still functioning (responded to controls, little hard drive whirring sound, etc...), but there was just no sound. I got a quick response from Creative's returns department  and had a replacement jukebox in about 10 days.  Inconvenient, yes, but they handled my claim quickly.    Occasionally, my jukebox freezes up (maybe once a week), but everytime, I've used the tiny reset button to restart it with no problems.  For the price, I think this jukebox is a great deal.  It's sturdy and functional and has so much memory.  But be warned, there are many reviews which list technical malfunctions like I've described.  There is a good chance your jukebox will breakdown, too.

<Title>Good, but not perfect
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for about 2 months and I'm very pleased with it.  It was half the price of a 20GB ipod and had 10 more GB.  First some of the negatives.  I had to change the meta data on my ahem.. less than legal songs so that they were sorted correctly.  Also it locks up occasionally while transferring songs. Despite the negatives, it gives you great value for your money and the software that comes with it is pretty good.  It allows you to choose what you want to load on the player instead of automatically deleting your songs like itunes.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone not looking to spend a ton of money on an ipod.

<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this about a year ago and I've loved it ever since.  This isn't for the trendy kids so don't expect somthing that looks as "cool" as an iPod but i'll say one thing about the Zen's features.  It lasts much longer than any iPod.  All my friend's iPods have scratches all over them from being in pockets or whatever but mine will not scratch.  It's very durable and even comes with a really good case.  Battery life is almost double of the iPod which is a big concern of mine because I forget to charge it sometimes.  The sound also is much better than the iPod.  Excelent product and I will continue buying from Creative.

<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before investing in the xtra I've owned two flash-based mp3 players, an MD player, and I've fooled around with a million of my friends' Ipods. I've had my xtra for about 90 days now and I've been very pleased with its performance.   Pros: Replacable battery Durable (dropped it about 4 times already, once onto a metal pole with no damage) The price per gig ratio is unbeatable (about $6.5 a gig).  Superb sound quality Effective EQ and fun audio modification features Bundled software (nomad explorer) integrates cleanly with XP On-the-go playlist creation  Cons: Somewhat large  Difficult to operate with one hand for people with small hands With many albums loaded, scroller becomes a bit cumbersome to use Only 3 battery bars - hard to know exactly how much time is remaining  Bottom line: This player is for those who don't want to fork out a lot of cash and just want a simple high capacity mp3 jukebox that gets the job done.   As a side note the customer support is stellar (at least for the first 90 days).

<Title> Amazing
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Nomad is just amazing. I bought 3 days ago, and the thing operates like a dream. The software can be a little confusing if you've never used it, but it really isn't bad at all. I'll get straight to it and list the pros and cons as I've noticed them. -PROS -amazing price.  -GREAT sound quality -reasonably easy to use software -easy to use menus, even though they are a little long g-reat features on the player- equalizer, EAX, screensaver, clock, find, etc. -comes with a spiffy leather case -owner changeable battery  -CONS -a little large, but still fairly small -at first, the interface (controls) is a little awkward, but you soon get used to it -DO NOT trust the belt clip on the case -no firewire port   I wouldn't have bought anything else now that I've used this. I was going to buy an Ipod when I first decided to get a harddrive player. Before I had a Samsung Y-P35, and a Creative Labs Muvo Micro 512, both excellent products. However, I decided to get the Nomad because of the price difference. (I'm a fifteen year old on a tight budget)   If you want the prettiest player on the market, and you want to pay the price, get an Ipod. If you want to save some cash and get something a little less atractive and larger, get the Nomad. It's a little larger, but not enough to make a difference, and while it is slick lookin' with it's aluminum case, it's not as pretty as the Ipod. However, I've listened to my friend's Ipod, and both of us aree they have the same quality of sound. There you go.

<Title>Wonderful Player - Lots of Room for Favorites
<Date>Tue Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First the bad...it *is* a little big for smaller hands.  And the earbuds...whose ears do they fit?  Yoda's?  Oh, yeah, and it shimmies. Just a little. The installation software appeared to hang (got to 5% and just stayed there), but it did install just fine.  I don't know if it's just my computer, because something similar did happen with another player we recently purchased as well, but the management software appears to be non-functional.  BUT...that's okay.  It was instantly recognized by Windows Media Player and it synched like a dream.    Now the good...everything else!  This is a great player.  It's got a ton of room for all the musical buffet you could possibly want to put on here.  Battery life is pretty good, and recharging takes two and a half hours or so.  Lots of room for text, so you know what you're listening to and have specifics on the tune right at hand.  Lots of options.  You can find artists, albums, etc., right away.  No stop button, but that has been no problem at all for me.  The price on the unit is unbeatable.  I can't believe that in my hand, for less than $200, I'm holding a computer that has 29 more gigabytes on it than my first desktop pc did!  I'm really loving this unit.  I consider it a "best buy," when you take price, functionality, and storage space into consideration.  I'd buy it again in a second.

<Title>After 9 Months, Time to Pay the Zen Its Due
<Date>Tue Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As an introduction, I'd like to state that I did days of research before settling on the Zen Xtra 30gb back in June of 2004. I compulsively read reviews, specs, compared prices, and then did the same over and over again. I considered most of the regular contenders - Ipods, Iriver HDs, Philips, and Sonys. Creative, however, continually stood out as the substance over style Ipod-beater - and the price, though I hate to admit it, was the deciding factor. Back when I bought it, I was chained to Best Buy by a gift card, so I payed about 240$ (Even at that point I had found prices as low as 200). But, to the point - once I finally had the player, I was enthralled. It simply does what it's supposed to do, and it does it oh so well. The sound quality is absolutely great - I'm no audiophile, and I even commit the sin of ripping a lot of music at 96kbs, but regardless, this player has fantastic output. The firmware is perfectly sensible and was instantly understandable. The creative MediaSource Software was absolutely fine by my standards - simple to use, and fairly fast to use - that was one of my greatest concerns when doing research. And the bottom line is its 30gb (or 40gb for just a few more dollars) for under 200$, has absolutely great battery life (had 14 hour battery life way before units like the Ipod finally made it to 12, not to mention it's battery is removable and extremely cheap to replace if ever necessary which it hasn't thus far), and amazingly durable (I've done things to this that I should be put away for - it's been drenched, dropped, thrown, stepped on, etc. . .and keeps going without a hitch). The only real knock against it (and this is entirely relative to the new offerings of Mp3 players from most all the brands)is its size. I affectionately refer to it as my "cheaper, fat Ipod" - and there is a clear size difference - but see one in person and decide for yourself if you can't bear a few extra fractions of an inch - for an extra hundred bucks in your pocket. Overall, this thing has held up and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're on a budget, or even if you're not, this is a smart choice I believe you'll be extremely satisfied with.

<Title>3 and 3/4 stars, really, but i'm nice so i'll round up
<Date>Wed Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>***EDIT 3/28***  Okay, so it's more than a week later since I got this badboy (two weeks to be exact), and it's only given me ONE error message -- that it wasn't connected to my computer when it obviously was. But I just unplugged the cable and plugged it back in, and all was well. Other than that, no problems at all, except that I still have to be careful to upload a few songs at a time using the software, or else my computer freezes up. Not a big deal for me.  So, I've been using it during my commute to work and back, so that's only about two to three hours a day. I make sure to check the battery power and recharge it whenever it's been showing 2 bars for a while. When I transfer songs (BTW, I have only begun to chip away at the 30GB), I also keep it plugged into the recharger so I don't drain the battery. I keep it in my bag, using the case to clip it to the edge of my bag's inside pocket. I suppose I can bump my rating up to a complete 4 stars. (I'm stingy about that elusive 5th star.)  ****  This is my first MP3 player. I immediately knew that I wasn't interested in an iPod -- at all (mainly because I knew iPods won't work with my computer) -- so I did as much research as I could on other brands. Creative Labs stood out the most, and for a good long while, the 1GB Creative Muvo was on my wishlist, while I continued to compare prices, functions, and space.  I guess the main reason why I picked the Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra was because it's 30GB for around $200. Compared to what other brands are offering, that's a bargain. (iPod's $200 models only offer 4 to 6GB.)   I care more for capacity and functionality over style and trendiness. And while I didn't think that capacity would be so important to me -- which is why I'd been considering the Creative Muvo 1GB for so long -- I think it's just something compulsive within me. Must... Have... Bigger... Memory... Anyway, I'm not exactly aiming to use this to store all my CDs and MP3 -- just my favorite ones, and ones I'd like to have in case of emergencies.  Well, it's only Day 2 of my Zen Xtra ownership, and while it hasn't lived up to all my expectations, so far I'm satisfied with what it does.  Bad and good things...  The MediaSource software made my computer go all wonky at first. I only have Windows 98(SE), so I guess I had to install it. It took a while for me to figure out -- even the pdf manual wasn't all that helpful. But once you see where your files are on your computer and how you can send them to the player (connected with a USB cord), then it's all good.  HOWEVER, when I tried ripping CDs with the software, it caused my computer to crash several times, and hard. It could just be my D drive, though, but that's what happened. I found out that the best way to make my computer and MP3 player play nice with each other is to select 3 or 4 songs at a time to rip, and not an entire album at once. That's a bummer though, since I wouldn't be able to leave and do other things while an entire album is transferred. But, such is life. ...Oh wait, never mind, I don't have a life anyway.  That's the only real big hitch that came with the Zen Xtra.   And aside from trying to figure out how to create playlists on my own without the "manual," so far I'm pretty satisfied with the little critter. Oh yeah, heh..."little." No, really, it's small, but it reminds me of a Walkman c. 1986. Kind of heavy, too, but remember it's a hard drive and not flash.  So far it hasn't frozen, jammed, blinked, conked out, beeped, buzzed, or assaulted me. The sound quality is quite excellent, too. But the earbud headphones? They really were made for people with larger ears than mine. Or maybe they were made for elephants. I'm not certain.  The scrolly-wheel thingie was a bit of a trick at first, but soon became almost fun to use.  Oh, and I seem to recall somebody saying there wasn't a STOP button? Hahah, there really ISNT one!! Hilarious! However, you can circumvent that problem by pushing the play/pause button, and then the forward/back button. That'll stop the track.  I might be adding things to this review once it passes the One Week Test.

It took me a total of about 5 minutes to get command of the interface of the player and then another 5 minutes to get used to the software. The software is very nice and easy to transfer and organize files.. The unit is fantastic and the sound quality is amazing. Why bother with an Ipod... Save yourself $200 and pick this up...

<Title>Bump up to 5 stars if you factor in the price
<Date>Fri Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll keep this review short.  I got my Nomad for about $170 on sale.  That's close to half of what a 30 gig Ipod costs.  So right there if the unit works well it is already worth the money.  Guess what?  It does work well.   Once you figure out the song loading/unloading mechanism (you'll probably have to read a tiny bit) the interface is wonderfull.  The "front end" work of loading the songs onto the player is a little more time consuming than some other players I've tried (since you have to propperly tag each mp3...but an internet connection automates everything anyway) but once the songs are on the sorting features are amazing.  Select and play catalogs by artist, genre (and you get to name your own genres), or album.  Say you want to listen to every Aerosmith song you have and nothing else.  You can do it.  Say you want to listen to a single Counting Crows album.  You can do it.  Say you want to listen to every song in the jazz genre.  You can do it. Ditto for personalized playlists.  In addition, you can randomize all of the above.    So why 4 stars out of 5?  The sound doesn't quite hold together at the highest volumes.  I hear distortion begin to creep in up there.  However, If you plug into an external amp this isn't an issue as the amp can boost the sound for you.  And with headphones...you don't want to be playing it that loud anyway.  I feel the distortion is a minor issue.  One last bonus is the battery is user replacable.  The top pops right off without any screws and the battery is right there.  No $100 charge for sending it back to the company for a new battery on this player.  Just do it yourself.  Nice. Battery life is nice and long too.  I highly reccomend this player.

<Title>Numerous hard drive and physical problems make this product 
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is the most worthless piece of junk I have ever purchased in my life.  Not only are there obvious physical problems (which I thought would not bother me), but there have been numerous - and I mean numerous - problems with the hard drive since I purchased it a mere seven and one half months ago.   The physical problems are as follows: the player itself is way too big and bulky, it weighs a good deal, and its carrying case will not stay hooked onto your article of clothing.  Also, with the addition of the carrying case, the player now has even more bulk.  But I have found the carrying case is always necessary, because the player is too flimsy to withstand bumping, jostling, or dropping.   Now to the more important problems.  Approximately one month after I received the player, an error message started popping up every 7 or 8 songs, obscuring the scene.  It did not affect the music too much, although it was a huge nuisance (still has not gone away).  About three weeks after I started using the headphones, one of the pads fell off; thus, they are now useless as they will not remain in my ear.  About four months after I purchased the player, I could only hear music out of one ear.  Despite numerous emails to Creative's customer service (who are unsympathetic), the problem still remains unresolved.  Now, I can only hear music in both ears if I have the jack in a certain position; otherwise I can only hear in one ear.  Now, seven and a half months after my purchase, the player has stopped functioning completely.  I tried cleaning it, rebooting it, and replacing the firmware, but there is a "Harddisk Problem," and I cannot play any music.  Again, despite emails to Creative (whose solutions have been either to send it with a forty dollar repair fee not including various other costs or reinstall the firmware), nothing has been resolved. I have spoken with multiple people, all of whom have I-Pods (surprise), and although I was initially against the idea of the I-Pod, now I fully recommend you buy it instead.  I have yet to find someone who has experienced problems with their I-Pod, while mine is completely dead.  Good luck!

<Title>Great, Wonderful and Super Product
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The reason why I purchased the unit was because of the battery.  In the Apple Ipod, you cannot change the battery yourself.  You must send the unit to Apple to have them do it.  With the Zen Xtra, a new battery from Creative is $35.00 and an after marlet battery is $29.00.  I use this device at work.  I do alot of driving around town making deliveries, and I use it at the gym. I have had my nomad for almost a year now and I have had zero problems with the unit.

<Content>I got this mp3 player for christmas and was very happy with it untill one week ago. I was in school and i wanted to turn it on but it wouldn't go past the title screen. When i tried to erase all the memory it said "hard disk" problem. I had this mp3 player for 3 months and it broke on me for no reason.  It was a waste of money and I would reccommend a different mp3 player.   (I'm 15 years old not 13 )

<Title>Excellent product!
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Regardless of the Ipud lovers who trash this unit, the truth is it is an excellent product. I have had mine for 6 months now and have had NO problems whatsoever! I've used half the space on the drive and have over 4500 songs on it! Two things keep this from being 5 stars. One is that the case belt clip is plastic and does not hold to your belt too well (which isn't a big deal, I keep the Nomad in my pocket- the beeper style spring type would be better) and that in order to keep all your albums in alphabetical order by artist you have to rename each song's album title "Artist-Title of album." An easy way to collect songs from various years (I like to have collections of hits grouped by year) is to just rename the album title of the song by the year of release. Viola! Albums arranged by year. Want to hear hits from 1957? Select the album! Songs form 1985? select the album! This is just fantastic!!! Highly recommended! Oh, and the earbuds do sound great!

<Title>Don't be a Drone!
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my player nearly 9 months ago and it has yet to give me any problems. The only minor annoyance is that the LCD screen doesn't seem to be too securely attached to the player and sometimes the display will not show if I've been running with it.  Press down and forward on it a little and the display shows right back up. I'm not an audiophile -- I just need something other than the crap that is playing on the radio to listen to, so I can't attest to how the sound quality measures up to other players, but it is definitely not bad. Most audiophiles seem to decide that Creative's sound is better on a basic level (excluding limited EQ adjustments) because as you know, it IS the leader in PC sound cards.  So here are reasons why I bought it: -- Cheap. Duh. Ipods are overpriced by a large amount because they are practically the only thing making Apple money. Don't contribute to Apple's greed, the Ipod simply _isn't_ fairly priced right now, and because of all the people out there willing to pay these ridiculous prices, they are not going to lower their prices any time soon. (The recent low prices are "fake" -- they simply neglect to give you accessories.) -- Great international language support. If you didn't know, Creative is a Singaporean company and thus the support for Asian languages is great. -- Durable. I run with it and have never bothered with anything other than the belt clip it comes with, I just put it inside of my jogging shorts instead and reverse the direction of the player. Never had a problem with it skipping, ever. -- Decent firmware. It could be better, but it's not like they are Apple and trying to limit your choices of what software you can use.  It IS SUBSTANTIALLY bigger than the Ipod, which is annoying when you exercise, but I much prefer not being a drone. Anyway, my brother has the Zen Micro, and I would have bought that instead, but I made my purchase quite a while ago. Check out the Micro if you are less concerned about storage!

<Content>I totally love it! It's so much fun. Even though it's a little bigger than the iPods and the smaller versions of Creative Zens. It's still very easy to travel with. It's very comfortable in the hand. I go for my walks with it, and listen to it at work. I don't even know what I did without it! It did freaze up on me once but when I pushed the reset button I didn't even lose any of my music. I was totally relieved.

<Title>Just get the extended Warranty!
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just get the extended Warranty, but if you want to know why read on. I bought my creative Jukebox 40GB right around the New Year. I have placed over 400 CDs on it and plan to continue. I wanted to wait to write a review, these reviews really helped my decision.  I did a ton a research and this is what I found:  Ipods are much more aesthetically pleasing and have a slightly better operating system (more user-friendly) just like all their products.  But like all their products they overcharge compared to the competition for basically a "hot lookin" item.  I paid about $150 less than the Ipod but then bought the $40 2 year extended warranty from Best Buy.  Ok extended warranties are like lottery tickets but if you plan on using your player the battery will die, and there is your $40 investment right there.  Best Buy (I'm sure other stores have these, CC etc.) will give you a new battery. Plus if the dreaded headphone jack fails then your covered and paid $100 less.  One of the best features that the Ipod doesn't have is that you can add a song to a play list, meaning that if a song is playing you can select another one to play after, and so on.  DJ style.  The battery life definitely out shines the Ipod.  I have had multiple 8 hr road trips.  The headphones that are supplied are poor so don't be fooled at the initial sound quality it is definitally equal to the Ipod and plays wma format.  Selecting songs can be a hassle especially having over 10,000 because of their weird slide wheel.  There is an alpha search so if an artist starts with a `T' you can quickly get to the T's.  You can use it as a USB drive for transferring files although I don't use that option often.  You can have multiple sites of download for Mp3s, so if you keep some of your music on another computer... The software it comes with isn't anything special but it gets the job done could improve.  Recap: With everything comparable (size sound quality etc.) the price and making mixes on the go are the reasons I purchased this guy.  I bought about $100 worth of music in the last couple months, saw a show, and bought new strings - rock on.

<Title>Large Library, Low Budget?  This is for You.
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, most people buying an mp3 player care about aesthetics and size.  This isn't the most beautiful machine in the world -- but the metal casing on the front and back feels sturdy and looks good.  None of the buttons look or feel cheap, except for the button on the bottom which opens the battery compartment; it is made of cheap gray plastic.  All in all, it's a good looking player with a fairly minimalist aesthetic design, but it does seem short and fat compared to  some other players.  With the case, however, it will be a tight squeeze.    	The case is made of (probably fake) leather, and  is well built.  It has a nice and soft inside which rubs against the front of the player, protecting against scratches.  The buttoned latch which shuts case is study, and I don't expect it to open accidentally.  The belt buckle on the back is fairly strong, but it wobbles from side to side.  Still, I wouldn't expect it to break off suddenly.  Unfortunately, the case has an open window which provides very little protection for the screen -- I scratched my screen within a few days of receiving mine.  The case feels like it would provide some protection, but it is not hard and isn't likely to save the Zen if it is dropped from any substantial heights.  	The button placement makes sense, but it isn't particularly easy to hold and control the player with a single hand.  With the player facing away from you (as if it were on a belt, which is where mine usually is), the volume buttons are on the right, with the power and back buttons as well.  The menu, play / pause, forward and reverse buttons are all on the left, which makes the player obviously geared towards right-handed users.  The scroll wheel is also on the left, and it is very easy to use.  It always responds, but can be hard to press if it is not centered in its slot.  	Functionally, the player is fantastic.  Most EAX features will go unused, but I always have my custom setting on.  Most of the Advanced and Environmental settings are useless, but fun to play around with.  The Time-Scale setting is very cool, even though I have little use for it -- I would imagine more musical people using it to their advantage.  Smart Volume and Spatialization are also unused.  Of course, having features I don't use isn't a problem, so I can't complain.  	The menus are fairly intuitive, and the placement is simple and easily understood, if still difficult to memorize -- this player is hard to control without looking.  The in-player clock can be set as a screen saver, but is otherwise not used.  There is also an alternate skin for the menu, if you prefer icons.  The ability to create custom playlists on the go is fantastic -- I'm not sure I would want a player without this feature.  Tracks are easily sorted, and the search can bring you to a letter far more easily than it can bring you to a specific track.  The find functions, while useful, are cumbersome.  The play any track and all track features cause some lag when first loading, but are neat and useful.  The menu can be set in 15 languages, which is fantastic (but again, totally useless for me personally).  There are also 6 different profiles, which are very useful.  I use them to easily switch between power saving settings, depending on whether or not I am home.  	The sound quality is fantastic, and extremely tweakable.  The in box headphones are worthless for most ears; I bought a pair of Closed Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia Headphones, which sound excellent.  	The storage capacity is cavernous, which is fantastic considering the player can also be used as an external hard drive.  I store important files on mine, but I do not generally keep it connected to my computer; USB 1.0 is too slow, however, I'm sure that if I had USB 2.0 capabilities on my computer to match the player's, it would see more use as an external hard drive.  	Transferring files can be done through a click and drag interface in Windows Explorer, or you can use the Mediasource software. Mediasource is excellent software.  It was confusing at first, but if you read up on it, it will make sense and be easily understood.  	The battery doesn't hold a 14 hour charge as advertised.  I may have made a mistake charging mine at first, but with the EAX always on and the volume at maximum (oh yes, this thing is loud), I usually get about 6 or 7 hours out of it.  It also takes about 3 hours to charge.  Still, the battery is removable (which will save you a lot of money in the long run), and an extra battery can easily extend the player's life during long trips.  	I've only had my player for three months, and the warranty just ran out, so I can't say for sure how long it will last.  Still, I have had absolutely no errors so far, so I really can't complain about this player at all . . .   	. . . Especially considering the price.  Considering all of the features, the quality, and the capacity, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal.

<Title>Bulky But Beautiful
<Date>Sun Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is lightyears ahead of Ipod.  Yeah, it's bigger and not quite as easy to navigate through the controls, but consider the the advantages: 1. It is far more easily loaded with music.  2. The battery is user replaceable (not so with Ipod).  3. Tailoring sound to your exact desires is much more easily accomplished with Zen Extra with many more sound options as well. 4. Making playlists and managing those playlists is a snap. The disadvantages: 1. It is bigger.  2. It is heavier.  3. It isn't nearly as esthetic. The only reason I don't rate this machine at 5 stars is that it isn't quite as compact or light as I would find ideal. On balance, while I like an attractive package, the sound and ease of use makes the Zen Extra a much wiser choice.  I use mine daily at work.  With only 20 gigs used on the hard drive I can still go weeks without having heard everything I have loaded on my machine.  If you are looking for an excellent player and want more bang for your buck, this player or one of it's cousins, of different capacity, will do the job. Zen Extra is the one to buy.

<Content>The Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra, is, quite simply, the best mp3 player ever. It is the best reason not to plunk down $300 to buy an ipod. Navigation and playback is stupid easy. You can randomize and shuffle around the music in A: the whole player, B:a specific album, C: a specific artist, D: a playlist, or E: a specific genre. Take that, ipod shuffle! The software that comes with it is a breeze. An alien from Mars that's never seen a computer before could create playlists, transfer music, etc, etc. More reasons it's better than ipod: doesn't scratch as easy, you can put any music that's on your computer into it, as opposed to the ipod, which is only compatible with itunes. Buy it now!!!

<Content>I have had my Creative Zen for about 3 weeks now. It has passed the test with flying colors. I initially purchased it for a long car ride I was going on; Mainly because I didn't want to lug around my cds. The battery was still over halfway full after 6 hours in the car. Exactly what I was hoping for. Although it is a bit bigger than an Ipod, looks can be decieving. I know that in school people say "wow that is big" and all this other stuff but I say that it works well, and is definantly better than an Ipod. The battery is replaceable, it lasts as much as 10 out of the 12 hours or so promised. It is more affordable, and it can hold up to 15,000 songs I believe.

<Date>Wed Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this player for 10 months. I truely abuse this thing and havnt had a problem yet. First, I never use the protective carrier that came with it. Its big and ugly, I just throw the player in my pocket with my keys and loose change. I run about 10 miles a week with it, although running with buffer-based players is not recommended. No problems. I throw it in the air, toss it on my desk, leave it in the car at night when its cold. Regularly, I let the battery run completly down. Its charge still lasts 14 hours every time. As mentioned, the battery cover will come off fairly easily...IF YOU DROP IT! This has only happened to me a couple times even though I am completely neglectful towards it. There is dirt and grime in the the audio jack and USB port and yet, no problems AT ALL. The only thing is that the software that came with it doesnt work. When transferring files from PC to the player, the software crashes. SO! I use the explorer in My Computer and it allows me to edit everything, add files, and it also organizes it into Artists, Genres, and Albums JUST LIKE THE SOFTWARE IS SUPPOSED TO. I really like this thing. I have yet to fill it up despite my best efforts and NO. I dont work for Creative.

<Title>Beware the NOMAD (non) warranty
<Date>Wed Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Before you buy this awful product check out the warranty- it is for only 90 days. NOMAD's business plan is to sell an expensive piece of equipment that will most definitely fail after 90 and usually before 365 days so that the unwary buyer will then pay an exbortitant fee to replace something that should not have broken in the first place and should have been under warranty if it did.<br>Our first NOMAD's drive crashed in one week - the second lasted about 7 months.  Our experience here is far from unique. When customer service wanted to charge us $120.00 to repair, we took the high road and bought an IPOD. We also shipped the dead unit to the company's president, who is apparently content with his dupe the consumer program.<br>Caveat Emptor

<Content>I have a Nomad for about 8 months now.  On the whole, I am glad I bought it, but it has its pros and cons. Pros: 1)More memory for the money, compared to any other brand that I saw. 2)Easy to add music. 3)Controls can be operated with gloves on (very important, as I walk for fitness, all year.) 4)Unlike the Ipod, battery can be replaced by the consumer. 5)Backlit screen is easy to read. 6)Good battery life. Cons: 1)Included case is poorly designed- no viewing window and a belt clip that falls off your belt. (I bought a small camera case, to use instead.) 2)Included ear buds were not comfortable for me (a problem with most jukeboxes) 3)A bit bigger that the Ipod.  In short, it's a good product but could be improved upon.

<Date>Sat Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's passed the 6 month test, no problems w/ it, no shutdown of hard drive.  Fingers crossed it can pass the 8 month test...I'm sorry about the horror stories, maybe I just got lucky w/ a functioning Jukebox.  I'm pretty active w/ it, jogging, weightlifting, painting w/ it on, even dropped it once or twice, but still works.  Course, I don't throw it around or treat it like a stupid little walkman, it *is* a computer and should be treated as such.<p>I have never tried the Ipod, so I can't compare the sound, interface, ect.  All I can say, is that this product is a Godsend at 220 bucks.  If you are a finnicky listener like me, and you can't stomach listening to the radio because you have to change the station every other song, if not turn off the radio completely, because you are so freaking sick of stupid music passed off as, well, music, then a product like this is mandatory in your life.  You need to have the ability to only listen to what you want to listen to.  I have a playlist of over 400+ indie-esque rock songs, another of 50+ that lists my current fave songs, and another of 40+ classical and celtic music pieces.  It is what it is, a personal jukebox, a personal radio station.  No more interchanging CDs while driving (btw, I just used an old car tape-deck adapter from my CD player to adapt the jukebox to the car stereo, no need to buy the accessory car adapter kit), no more tedious and infuriatingly redundant pop-&quot;alternative&quot; rock music while waiting to hear one good song out of thirty, no more 8 minute commercial breaks...just pop in the jukebox and hit shuffle.  The interface can be a little messy, but it's still worth it.  80 bucks less than an Ipod and 20+ GB more...yeah, it's definitely worth it (if it works for you).

<Title>So-so
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Granted, I own a Nomad Zen NX 30GB, not the Xtra, but Creative doesn't have a good track record with me anymore.  I had a craptastic experience with a 10gb Creative Labs jukebox before, and at first, the Nomad Zen was a welcome upgrade.  Well, for about a week.  <p>Parts in the front casing are actually glued together with what looked like rubber cement.  The snap for the front case fell off within a week.  So, I took it back to the store and got a replacement.  The second one was okay for a while, but then I started losing sound in one channel.  I don't abuse my mp3 player, I simply plug it in in my car and plug it in at work.  <p>It turns out that the solder joints between the input jack and the circuit board are pretty flimsy.  It has been almost a year, so the warranty was gone, and I just performed a home repair job on that.  It still works, but I certainly won't be tempted by the cheap price of the creative labs products again.  An Ipod will probably be my next purchase.<p>Other problems include:  I left my mp3 player in the car a few times during the winter.  When the zen gets too cold, it'll boot up and reset over and over again until the hard drive gets warm.  And, the mp3 player occasionally gets static.  Simple enough, power cycle the mp3 player.  And... the last one I can remember is that the mp3 player freezes up from time to time.  I have to pop the battery out and put it back in when this happens.<p>So, the nomad zen does offer a huge capacity for a lot less than an Ipod, but you get what you pay for, a device that is a little sub-par.
