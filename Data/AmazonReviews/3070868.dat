<Title>Best Mp3 Player.
<Date>Mon Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>There is nothing in the market to beat the Ipod. I tried a Nomad Jukebox, before I bought my ipod (15gb - Windows firewire). Nothing better than it. I have most the songs loaded from my Comp and it works like a charm. This is the best mp3 player I ever had. could have /should have bought the 30Gig one...but i am really happy with the space on the this one.

<Title>My favorite thing....
<Date>Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really, really love my iPod. I've had mine for about 7 months now and use it every single day. So far, my colletion is only about three and half gigs of MP3 files so everything fits onto the hard drive very comfortably. The battery life is more than acceptable, even though I use the backlight almost constantly. There are a few words of advice that people should consider before they buy one. First, you simply must have USB 2.0 or Firewire to use this. In theory, you could use this with USB1.1 but the transfers are painfully slow. You could just as quickly burn your music on a CD to take somewhere. Second, MusicMatch works for synchronizing with PCs but there are much, much better programs such as XPlay. Third, this thing will scratch!! You should really pay a little more for the carrying case by Apple. I really wish I had because this masterpiece of consumer design is now very dinged, scratched, and beaten...but it still plays beautifully, which is what counts most. Like I said, I use it every day and learn new reasons for loving it every time I turn it on. It is impossible to be dissappointed by iPod.

<Title>You've bought a MP3 PDA with a disk drive and a buggy OS
<Date>Wed Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Check out the IPod's support website and you'll see what I mean.  The other issue is:  Do I really want to WORK this hard to play a few tunes when I go jogging?  I don't want to download any firmware or resynchronize, I just want to turn the device on and play music.  I don't want to obsess about whether I really have enough charge to last a few hours, or not, maybe.  I just want to turn on the device and play music.  If you stay with this product, you might begin to wonder if you're doing product research or OS beta testing for Apple, particularly if you're one of those people who discovers issues with sleep mode, non-recognition of your IPod device by the computer or the software, or can't seem to charge the battery enough even though the PDA says it's sort of charged, maybe.  In my opinion, these are BASIC issues that a company should deal with in a product BEFORE sending it to market.  Imagine having to constantly worry about your computer laptop not working because it may not be able to figure out if it has been fully charged or not?  What happened to the idea of: &quot;I put in a battery and the device runs for X hours, and then I recharge the battery&quot;?  Imagine paying three hundred plus dollars for a piece of unfinished technology and feeling a debt of gratitude.  Doesn't make sense.  For this price, the device should work.  If I have to work this hard to make it work, it had better cost under a hundred dollars since I'm doing their job helping them get the bugs ironed out.  Take a look at all the comments with the positive ratings which make such obsequious concessions to a flawed product.  The reality is this is not a finished product.  It looks nice, but in practice, it's not a finished product, at least for this Windows user.  I get better results with MP3s stored in SD memory on my Windows Pocket PC.  Try again, Apple.

<Title>More than expected !!
<Date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought a 15Gb iPod last summer for $385. Well... I wont spend too much time talking bout things that everyone might have known (large capacity, small size..) but I have some highlights that really made me prefer iPod than others:<p>(i)Personally, i think synchronization is the most important of all for mp3 players. Why getting a 60Gb mp3 player if u would have to wait for an hour everytime u sync with USB? Synchronization is never be better in other mp3 players. First of all, ipod can be connected thru FireWire (which is really really faster than USB!!). I'd switched to use iTunes for Windows and it really enhances synchronization. I was using MusicMatch before but synchronization is much slower compared by using iTunes (Using Music Match, i have to wait for average of 20 mins to let Music match get organized before sync, but using iTunes, i only have to wait for about 1 minute before it starts synchronizing) <p>(ii) Lazy to organize your songs ?? Most people do not have time in organizing their songs (especially if u have more than Gigabytes of songs from thousands of artists and albums!)and in this, iTunes really helps. Just click on 'Preference' in iTunes, 'Advanced' and click 'Keep iTunes Music folder organized'. iTunes will then organize all your songs according to their albums and artists, and everytime u made changes in iTunes, they will change it in your file name as well. You only have to name them once, and that's simple (Recalling when i was using Music match, i would have to rename all songs in Musicmatch, and the file names as well!)<p>(iii) Smart playlist (again, only for iPod and iTunes user!). I realized that most mp3 players do not provide convenient playlist. In iTunes, you can create so called 'smart playlist', which enables u to create unlimited amount playlists according to your preferences. For instance, u can create a playlist that would only include songs that are rated '5 stars' (Those u like the most). Not only that, everytime u made changes, iTunes will automatically update your playlist as well. (for e.g., when u changed a song from 5 stars to 4 stars, that song would be removed from the 5 stars' list and added to 4 stars' list). There are much more options to choose, for e.g year of publication (so u can listen to songs of the year), songs that u never played before, genre, bit rate..etc<p>(iv) Thanks for the FireWire, I can play songs in my iPod from any Macs in school, friend's house..etc. Once connected, the iPod acts as a hard disk, which enables me to choose and play songs from iTunes on the computer. For sure, it's much easier to choose a song to play in a music player rather than on a mp3 player. Besides that, it charges my ipod when i connect it to computer, thus I dont have to worry bout battery life when listening to iPod in school.<p>(v) Transfering files into iPod is very convenient. Once connected, I can open my files in iPod, transfering it to other computers or vice versa, with blazing speed (Usually just take seconds to transfer). Imagine having 10/20/40Gb of files in your iPod and bringing it wherever u want.<p>(vi)Touch sensitive buttons (which others dont have!). All buttons are touch sensitive and it's so convenient to click or scoll.. , and besides that, the non-moving parts enhances the anti-shock period and prevent from dust, liquid etc from entering ur buttons.<p>(vii)Why wake up with beeping alarms if u can wake up with your favourite music from iPod?? Imagine waking up with your favourite music everyday... i doubt u would 'snooze' this alarm.<p>(viii)This may not applicable to most of u, but it really surprises me when i realize that iPod could read and display chinese characters when they play chinese songs. I wonder if others could do that.<p>Cons: I should have bought the 40Gb iPod.. as I didn't expect file transfering to hard disk is that simple. (If u do the math, it's more or less costly to buy an external hard disk in such a small size!)<p>Enjoy your iPod.. u'll definitely LOVE it!

<Title>Revolutionary
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Wow. My 15GB iPod has got to be the greatest invention since the LP. Mine currently holds a couple hundred hours of music with plenty of room to spare for more. This means that I take my entire CD collection to work with me every day -- and it weighs just ounces. I find I can typically get about four hours of use out of the battery, but I've also recently taken to plugging my iPod into its base station (on AC) and plugging that into my stereo via a Monster cable. I may donate my CD changer to Goodwill before the year is out.

<Title>Apple's well-designed marvel
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have had a 15GB iPod for about 3 months now, and it has served me very well. I started out with a SlimX mp3/CD player, but switched because of the fact that as much as I had been changing mp3 CDs on it to listen to different music I may as well have brought my entire CD collection and had better sound quality to boot. The iPod has solved all those problems. I have a PC with Windows XP, and while some complain of problems with Windows, I have yet to experience them. MusicMatch was a little cumbersome, but since I downloaded iTunes the iPod works absolutely seamlessly with my computer. Mac's AAC compression format really does blow MP3 away--important to audiophiles like me, who want portability and sound quality at the same time. iTunes is designed to help you get the most out of your iPod, and it even syncs playlists you make on the iPod with your computer (something MusicMatch didnt' do). The FireWire interface is lightning-quick so I can watch an album load in the space of 15 seconds. The size is nice--I have 80+ albums on my iPod and it's only about 1/3 full. I do use the iPod to manage my calendar and contacts, something few reviewers have mentioned and which comes in very handy. (Syncing this calendar and contact information is a pain on the PC, but it pays off when you need to quickly find a phone number on the road.) I use the dock and a cable to plug the device into my stereo, which saves me the trouble (and expense) of burning CDs I have created or downloaded. <p>There are, however, some things about this device that I simply don't understand. For example, the chrome that makes up the back of the iPod and the front of the remote is plain silly--just something to get dirtied up and uglied with fingerprints (the chrome on mine looks absolutely hideous at the moment). Much as I like the touch-scroll wheel, I wish the other buttons were conventional: I don't like having to use the Hold switch just to fumble around in the dark to find the Menu button (which controls the backlight). The hard case, while it does a great job of protecting the iPod, prevents you from seeing the screen or using the buttons, requiring you to use the remote which just adds more cord to get tangled up. Before iTunes I had the problem of gaps in between songs on live albums and on my beloved Mahler symphonies: iTunes solves this with the &quot;Join CD Tracks&quot; function, but I wish I could keep the individual tracks and not have to deal with the little hiccup between them.<p>If you are looking for a way to carry around a variety of music in one small device, and you don't mind shelling out the big bucks for it, then this is for you. The ability to carry around your entire record collection in a thing as big as a deck of cards seems silly, but once you have it, you are spoiled. Apple has created a well-designed, functional product that is sure to please any music-lover.

I was getting so sick of carrying all my cds around!!<br>I know Ipods are the expensive MP3 palyers but if you buy it at auction it is worth it given the quality and how easy it is to use. The firewire makes it so fast to update change or add music to your Ipod. You can make as many lists as you want to listen to your music.<br>The earphones are great, I also have a Radio Shack titanium Headphones but Irather use the ipod earphones since they are so small and give such great sound. I sometimes connect my Ipod to my home stereo and what a sound and I never have to change cds I just make a list and play it for as long as I want and hear as many different songs that I want!<br>I also use my Ipod as a portable hard drive, a calendar, and an address book.<br>Awesome little gadget!

<Title>Flabbergasted !
<Date>Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As the title of this post attests, I'm truly marvelled at this product. Apple is and is going to beat all the competitors in the MP3 player arena. WOW, this product is sleek from the moment you see the box. And once you open the box and see how much care Apple takes care of presentation, you'll realize that you made a good investment. The player is SO much compact  and lighter than I expected. I used to own a Creative Nomad Zen (20 Gb) and sold it because it was rather bulky and the controls were really clumsy. in contrast, the iPod is very intuitive and yet powerful. The design is outstanding, and the features is more than worth the money. The sound is superb, and the EQ is very decent just as the included headphones are. <br>If you look at the Price-Value relationship, iPod offers the most "bang for the buck," if you pardon the cliche. With organizer, clock, calendar, games and 15Gb of soage this unit is by FAR the best value. You won't regret it for one second! It will make a believer out of the most skeptical person. If you have the money...do not hesitate and get this unit.

<Content>I previously kept all of my music on Minidisc because I wanted something small that could change music quickly.  Now the iPod is small enough and holds ALL of my music, plus it's very easy to use.  I'm using mine on a mac with the new iTunes music store which really makes purchasing music quick and easy.  Finally, the mac version supports the new mp4(AAC) format for small, high-quality music.

<Title>Positively awesome!
<Date>Fri May 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>When I buy electronics, I usually look for items that serve multiple purposes (ie I waited for a DVD player until Playstation 2 came out so I'd be gettng two machines in one).  My husband and I have been looking to upsize from our current iMac since we can't upgrade the video card, and 8 mb just isn't enough for some of the programs we're running.  Since we'd been wanting an MP3 player, and we also wanted to be able to transfer the iMac's information onto an external hard drive, we figured this would serve both purposes well.<br>Although I'm not much of an audiophile, I really love the clarity of the sound that the iPod offers- so if even I can tell the difference, it must be pretty drastic.  Transferring music to the iPod is really very simple: Launch iTunes, put in the CD's you want, select the songs you want iTunes to import, and when you're done with that, plug the iPod into the FireWire port, and it automatically sends the songs to the iPod.<br>A word of warning to those with lower-end Power Macs: importing songs from a CD to iTunes can take a long time.  I'm currently running on an iMac with a 450 mhz processor, and each song takes from 1-2 minutes to import.  But despite this, sending the songs from iTunes to the iPod is extremely fast- I sent 59 songs from iTunes to the iPod, and it only took maybe 30 seconds.  <br>From reading the instructions included with the iPod, transferring songs from the PC to the iPod is relatively simple too, although it takes a couple more steps to do so on a PC than it does on a Mac.<br>The new design of the iPod is excellent as well.  The buttons are extremely touch-sensitive, but I have found that they are only sensitive with fingers, not objects such as pens.  I was able to adjust the volume and switch from song to song with my fingertips effortlessly, but when I tried to use the top of a pen, it wouldn't go.  I think this is a very helpful feature, especially if you're going to be carrying this in your pocket, purse, etc. <br>Just as a word to the wise, if you are considering purchasing an FM transmitter to listen to the iPod in your car or personal stereo, a better option is to use a cassette adapter, like the ones that come with CD car adapters.  The FM transmitters have a lot of static, whereas the casette adapter replicates pretty closely the crystal-clear sound in the iPod itself. <br>Some people may wonder why to purchase the iPod instead of a lower-end MP3 player and there are two major reasons: ease of use, and the large amount of drive space avaiable.  If you have an emergency situation where you need to transfer a large amount of information from one computer to another, the iPod is ideal: just connect the iPod to the computer and send the files to the iPod.  Of course, you can't open these files on the iPod itself, but it's a great extra hard drive in a pinch.

<Title>iPOD on PC is initially unusable
<Date>Fri May 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple really needs to be hit with a silly stick for shipping the brand new iPOD with what possibly has to be one of the worst mp3 management applications musicmatch.  Firstly, it doesn't work correctly under windows 2000.  Secondly their dock and undock application is extremely fragile under W2K.<p>This is how it works.  To a PC, the ipod looks like a 15GB SBP2 hard drive.  That's right a harddrive.  While it is connected to the PC it disables all menu functions and remains in hard drive mode.  This part is fine.<p>Apple ships a dock/undock util which doesn't quite do the right thing.  If you use the built in MS hotplug device tray util things work much better.  The apple util only removes the drive letter, not the 1394 device.  The microsoft one removes the whole subsystem, a much cleaner way to go and less error prone under WIN2Ks less than stellar 1394 stack.<p>Music match.  Lord what an unstable application.  Like many windows apps it's all glitz and no stability.  I spent 3 hours trying to get it to work with the iPod.  I reformatted the iPod at least 4 times.  No files would transfer to the iPod.  Only play lists.  This was a horrible out of the box experience.  I bought this as a gift.  I'm not a neophtye, I know how this stuff should work.  Especially having seen the OSX work just beautifully in comparison.<p>Solution ?  Download ephpod, as recommended by other users on Amazon.  This app rocks.  It's simple, reliable, stable and it works just beautifully under W2K.  MM may have bells and whistles, but as a device manager it fails miserably.  Apple should buy ephpod and ship that as the standard device manager, because right now the iPod is pretty much unusable under windows.  It might be better under XP but I'm not using XP so that's not all that helpful.<p>The iPod itself is beautifully presented in almost japanese style understated packaging.  The device itself is a modern miracle and has much to recommend it.  10 out of 10 for the ipod itself.  1 out of 10 for music match.  Apple I do hope you are listening.

<Content>Locked up and overheated. The Apple store had great difficulty trying to reset my Ipod - after many tries - it finally reset. They charged me a 10% restocking fee to return it- since they were able to reset the ipod. I could tell it was defective. I have always stayed away from Apple as a PC owner. They have always abused their customers dating back to the earliest Macs with the motherboard scandals. If one owns a Apple computer - they 'got you' like in th old days of the PC. It is like owning an exotic car - it just has to look good - whether or not it works is not really important. It is the style that matters!

<Title>Great Design but problems with audio quality and battery
<Date>Tue May 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought a 15GB ipod and after three days I decided to return it. The design is absolutely great and it was one of the aspects that stopped me from returning it at the beginning. Furthermore, being able to store all my CDs was also great However, I am a minidisc user, and the main problems I found with the ipod were the audio quality and the battery life. I get around 14 hours of battery life from the minidisc, but only 6 and a half with the ipod. Furthermore, although the sound quality of the ipod is pretty good (much better than other mp3 players I had in the past), as soon as you use the equalizer with bass intense songs the audio is distorted (I tried different headphones). I read another review complaining about the same and I have to admit that is true. If you disable the equalizer, the distorsion disappears, but of course, you loose sound quality. I played the same song with the minidisc and the ipod at the same time and kept changing the headphones from one to the other, and the sound from the ipod was not as rich.<br>I will wait for the next ipod version and hopefully they will correct these two problems.

<Content>If you're a Mac user, this is a great product. It works wonderfully.<p>However, if you're a PC user, there are better products to use. I'll give it to Apple; the design of this product and the very intuitive UI are very strong points. In fact, those were what won me over in the first place. I brought it home, and tried to get it to work for several hours (8-10) without progress. I kept getting errors, and eventually called Apple's tech support, which were VERY professional and helpful. Turns out, though, that the iPod didn't work with my firewire card. So I bought the one they recommended, and still ran into problems. So I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for the Creative Zen, 20 GB USB 2.0 version, and it's way better. The sound has less noise, the battery life is almost DOUBLE the iPod's, and has almost all the features of the iPod (it's also got more space).<p>So, in short, for PC users, the Creative Zens are so much better, if a little more lacking in style.

<Content>I didn't buy the my ipod from amazon the way I normally buy my stuff. But I don't think Apple is properly prepared to deal with Windows users. At least, not from where I am sitting. First expect to pay whatever for the amount for the ipod. [$$$] for me (15gb) expect to pay another [$$$] for the firewire card then spend all night trying to get the thing to work with Win98. As  of this writing the usb wire has not been released. The Software included with the ipod nicely tells you it doesn't function with your OS. I tried ephpod and macopener and they don't work with the latest ipod for windows because ephpod will error out. And if you use macopener and recreate the directory structure with ephpod, the ipod won't boot. Musicmatch the mp3 jukebox that comes with the ipod will work with Win98 but the plugin for the ipod won't. In short if you want a portable mp3 solution and are a windows98 user run, don't walk AWAY from the ipod.

<Title>Best MP3 player to date
<Date>Thu Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got my 15GB iPod yesterday, and it is truely amazing.<p>The sound quality is exactly like it sounds on my computer.  Now what I don't like about other MP3 players and whatnot, well you're listening to your music on your computer, or in your car or whatever, and then you listen to it on your MP3 player, and it sounds different, the quality is different, and it sounds like a different song.<br>Well the iPod is different.  It's amazing, the sound, the design, everything about it is as close to perfect as you can find!<p>What's truly amazing about this package is not only does it have space for 15GB of songs, but lets say you don't fill up that 15GB with songs, what's the point of having all this space?  Simple.  The iPod not only works as an MP3 player, but it also works as an external hard drive.  So now, you're not only listening to your favorite songs in amazing quality...  You're also carrying that important document or file that you need to transfer to another computer (Or just backup).<p>I've heard some Windows users having trouble with their iPod.  My advice would be to get a program called XPlay, it works better than MusicMatch.  I had a second generation 10GB iPod for Windows, and I got XPlay for it, and it worked great, far better than MusicMatch (MusicMatch worked, it was just horrible to work with).  Although now I use Mac's, I do suggest XPlay for Windows users.  Also for Windows users, Apple is coming out with updates for the iPod, I don't know when they'll be released, but with their release, it should and will make them that much better.  Also Apple is making an iTunes for Windows (I'd be really excited about that).  iTunes for Windows is set to come out later this year.  Although I don't know if it'll work with your iPod, I imagine it probably will.  So if you have had bad experiences with iPod's and Windows, wait until later this year, and you may also want to consider other options.<p>If you love music, you'll love your iPod.

<Title>Mac Convert
<Date>Mon Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After using Macs in college and for some of my professional life, I've been a slave to the PC for the past 6 years.  After getting fed-up with my Win98SE locking-up every day, I leapt for the iMac, in part because of the promise of the iPod.  <p>What a difference a day makes.  I can now surf the net, listen to music and transfer tunes to my iPod without incident.  With my PC, I was lucky to have multiple windows open while surfing.  Try to open MusicMatch and I'd lock-up.  MusicMatch also had the annoying problem of inserting a clicking noise in the background of CDs that I burned.  <p>With iPod, I am free of my CDs completely.  I have over 200 CDs on my new iMac and can transfer them to my iPod in seconds.  The critics of the iPod are those running on Windows.  Go figure.

<Title>How much patience do you have?
<Date>Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had high expectations for this device and they were not met at all.  I purchased the 15 Gig version for Windows and it simply will not synch with my MusicMatch library.  Oh, it will get some of my songs... and then stop....and then some more.... and then stop.  But I bought this because it promised to carry my entire music library.  <p>Three calls to Apple support and one to Dell (my PC) later and the device still won't perform as advertised.  Is it the driver?  Is it the Firewire card?  Is it the device?  Is it the cable?  Is it the software?  I don't know and frankly I don't care anymore.  All I know is that I've already spent too much time trying to make it work.  It's going back to the store.  <p>Oh, and if anyone from Apple cares....  You really want me to switch to Apple for all my products?  You're going to have to do better than this.  Feel free to blame the PC... that'll just [anger me] even more.  Make it work or don't sell it, people.  Is that too much to ask?

<Title>Great Product once you get it set up...
<Date>Wed Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my Apple 15GB Ipod but it was very difficult to get it set-up at first on my Windows PC.  Everyone is right when they say MusicMatch isn't very good.  I tried MusicMatch first but I had too many problems. It would not recognize my Ipod and then I couldn't disconnect the Ipod. So, I went to Ephpod to get the software everyone had recommend on Amazon and please believe me when I say that Ephpod is so much easier to use to transfer files to the Ipod.  Anyone can use Ephpod, it is that easy. I recently took my Ipod with me on my summer vacation.  It was perfect on the plane and on the beach.  It is so light and easy to carry around. Great Product!!!  I would recommend this product to anyone who is tried of carrying around all your CDs with you.

<Title>Windows perspective
<Date>Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Like my ex-wife, the iPod for Windows is beautiful and doesn't work. Needless to say, this is a recipe for extreme frustration, and I can only warn Windows users to resist the siren song at least until Apple addresses several problems. Chief among them is the iPod's inability to remember it's been charged. Consequently, it has a functional battery life of as little as 10 minutes, after which it must be recharged for several hours (assuming it doesn't become entirely unresponsive for 24 hours or more). This problem, in varying degrees, has afflicted each of the half-dozen Windows-iPod victims I know. Conclusion: don't get an iPod unless you have a Mac.

<Title>Myths about iPod
<Date>Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased the 15GB iPod this week (June 9, 2003) to run with my Win2000 machine.  I was almost convinced by messages on this board that the iPod wouldn't work very well with Windows.  That could not be any farther from the truth.<p>1. I opened my iPod at 11AM.  The install of iPod and download of all my music was complete by 1PM. No kidding. Granted I don't have Gigs of music but I was pretty impressed that iPod plugged into the firewire port and began working without errors.  The transfer speed was outstanding (5Mg is less than 10 seconds).<p>2. Musicmatch worked seamlessly with Win and iPod. I drug my music library to the portable device window and the download began. No problems what so ever.<p>3. The firewire port DOES allow the iPod to charge when it's plugged into to my PC.  Don't mess around with the USB connection! Someone claimed you had to buy some upgraded Firewire card but I purchased a cheap PCI firewire card and its works great.<p>4.  Apple installs a utility to dock and undock the iPod from the PC.  Works like a charm every time.  <p>Maybe I'm the lucky one here but I can't say enough good things about the iPod. My recommendation is to purchase this tool and then trade in your PC for an iMac, that's my next big purchase.

<Title>Beautiful, amazing and spectacular. Product of the Decade!
<Date>Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Pros: Best-of-breed design and interface; excellent playlist features; clean, configurable sound; smooth syncing with both Windows PCs and Macs; organizes contacts; includes games; functions as an external drive.<p>Cons: No FM or voice recording; line-in recording included but not enabled; no USB kit until June; battery life compromised somewhat by small size; no AAC ripping or purchasing by Windows users.<p>The minute I openned my iPOD 15 GIG, I was so impressed with the packaging that I could not wait until I started using this marvelous product. I was up and running in about 5 minutes after a full battery charge. I brought it to work and the all of my co-workers are racing out to get one. The sound quality is great and the features are wonderful. Bite the bullet and purchase this very well designed electronic marvel. I would need several pages of text to continue to explain how great this product is.  Also, I would like to mention that the battery life is horrible and there was no FM and voice recording. But desptie that, I suggest that you hurry up, try it for yourself, and you won't look back.

<Title>iLove My iPod
<Date>Fri Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Spending [the money] on an iPod was perhaps one of the smartest investments I have ever made.  Yes, I've succumbed to buying into the Jobsian music revolution.  For those that aren't like me, a veteran member of the Apple cult, the iPod is essentially a digital music player, with serious space for the serious music aficionado.<br>Getting the device to be recognized by my iBook was a breeze.  To do so, I merely had to connect the dock with my laptop, and drop the iPod into its dock.  iTunes, Apple's digital jukebox software, immediately took over, and proceeded to transfer my entire library to the iPod - a seamless process.   <br>With 15 gigabytes of hard drive space, the tiny mp3 player managed to hold my 100-album CD collection.  I filled the remaining space with my many Dave Matthews Band bootlegs, which calculated at a whopping 700 megabytes apiece.<br>Like many other Apple products, the iPod is very intuitive, and very user friendly.  The face of the device includes a touch sensitive scroll wheel, and four buttons used to maneuver through menus, pause and play music, and switch from one track to the next.  In addition, the interface of the iPod is neatly setup in a folder format, sorted by album, artist, genre, and song title.  Like navigating through a hard drive on a computer, finding music on the iPod is a simple process.<br>Many music enthusiasts proclaim that the death of the compact disc is near, and that digital music is the future.  If this is the case, I have seen the future, and Steve Jobs has taken me there.

<Title>Great Concept, but with bugs
<Date>Fri Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I absolutely had to ahve an iPod when I saw an ad for it - it can store up to 3500 songs, great sound quality, easy to use. So I went out and bought one, but the main thing I dislike about it are the touch-buttons. They do not always work, especially if you ahve left it sitting idle for even 2 days, and put it on HOLD mode. Then when you release the HOLD button and try to turn it on, it doesn't turn on. <p>It has a reboot function, where you hold the two middle buttons down at the same time, and it is supposed to reboot and the apple symbol comes on. But now even THAT doesn't work.<p>SO I am sitting with a gorgeous new toy which I cannot switch on to use. Very frustrating indeed. Anyone who has any ideas please let me know.

<Title>Insanely great, and works with Window XP and MusicMatch
<Date>Sun Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got the Apple ipod a few weeks ago and my only regret is that the 15GB has been replaced by the 20GB model. Other than that though, it is an insanely cool device. It doesn't quite hold all of my music collection, but it does contain about 75%. I've been using it with a Dell PC running Windows XP and MusicMatch Plus and I have not had any real problems with the interface. However, I'm looking forward to a PC version of iTunes in the future (I had to cross over to the darkside and abandon the Mac platform several years ago; no flames for that please!). Using MusicMatch is not quite seemless, but it is not the headache that you might think reading the reviews here. I've managed to load, organize and use it without significant problems. I do notice that some punctuation devices are problematic for MusicMatch but not for the ipod. Also I think that a firewire interface is to be recommended. Overall, this is a fantastic device.

<Title>Windows version allows mp3 files ONLY from CD burning.
<Date>Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I use both Windows and Mac all the time.  I'm tired of Apple's elitest B.S.  The sell the iPod as Windows compatible, which it is, but they DON'T tell you the lame Windows program it comes with - Musicmatch - does NOT sell legal, downloadable mp3 tracks &amp; albums (i.e. like iTunes).  Instead, now that I've bought their $400 iPOD, they want me to invest another $2K in one of their computers so I can use iTunes.  This feels a lot like a bait and switch.  If anyone knows how you can pay for mp3 downloads on Musicmatch, I'd love to know.  Thanks.

<Title>Nifty gadget
<Date>Tue Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received one of these as a gift, so I have no complaints.  The device synchs perfectly, instantly, and automatically with OSX, though it required me to install the version of iTunes that comes with the CD.  But as ingenious as this technological marvel is, the next question for me is what to do with it.  Aside from the fetishist pleasure of carrying the thing in my pocket, I haven't found much place for it in my schedule.  Listening to music with headphones doesn't do much for my social life, and carrying my whole music library around with me really doesn't enhance my appreciation of the original albums.  Also, I'm thinking that just several hundred bucks more would purchase a laptop capable of performing the iPod's functions plus a whole lot more--and with convenient built-in speakers.  <p>Maybe it's a generational thing.<p>If you pick one up, select the feature that allows you to choose the songs  or playlists to load into the iPod.  Otherwise you may end up having to trash your entire library of songs.

<Content>I have been lovin' the iPod since Christmas of 2002.I wanted this so badly but I got a Samsung Yepp.I was dissapointed with the fact that it could only hold up to 40 songs.Then,I moved onto the Archos Jukebox.It was a nice device but still not what I was looking for.When I graduated I finally got the iPod.I was speechless until later that day.Ok forget my life story go on to this.It is really easy to use.I'm a member of the youth club and I am able to use it.Y eah I might just be a regular smart kid.Plus,it holds over 3,500 songs.I have Smashing Pumpkins,KISS,Rage Against the Machine,The Simpsons,Sonic Youth,Marilyn Manson,Gorillaz,White Stripes and Zwan on this thing and not even half of it is filled up.Lastly,it's interaction with the computer.I am a Windows user and I use MusicMatch.Still easy but iTunes may be better.But I don't know everything.You can take all of your music and all of your playlists and transfer it onto your iPod using MusicMatch or iTunes,and then unplug and just go.Well that is my story of how I got the iPod.A totall reccomendation,I highly,highly reccomend this.

<Content>Trying to figure out the tricks of manuevering within the software took a little bit, but no real problems I couldn't figure out eventually.  I bought this toy in June and have did have a total lock up problem with it within the 1st month.  After trying to troubleshoot it on the Apple website I sent it back and they quickly sent me a new one.  Their 800# customer service support is decent, but not great.  I'm a Windows user and I've had no other issues since.  I have filled about 10 G's of it and purchased a couple Marware cases to better protect it(highly recommended)as well as the car adaptor stuff.  I don't know how I ever I lived without it before, I take it everywhere and no matter what mood I'm in I always have the right music.  Love not having to carry mountains of CD's with me.  I only gave it 4 stars because now less than 4 months since the May release Apple has a new 20G for the same price I paid for my 15G...I'm a little cranky about that.

<Title>So far, So Good on the PC
<Date>Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was reluctant to take the dive on a cross-platform product, especially after reading some of the other reviews on problems with the PC hookups. However, I really wanted a player to take running that had the capacity for both songs and Audible books (at high quality). <p>I brought it home yesterday and hooked it up to my PC in about 1 hour and it's working fine with both the MusicMatch and Audible. There were some little hiccups that I cured by reformatting the iPod (2x-takes about 2 minutes) until everything was setup properly. I got the idea from the other reviews! The fact that the PC sees it as a separate drive doesn't have any impact on how the different software works with it. I loaded a 120MB book in less than 30 seconds. Now I have music and stories to add to my runs.One thing that might have helped is that I'm running this on a fairly new computer (3 months old) with FireWire and Windows XP. <p>I held back the 5th Star for 2 reasons. First, is that I'm waiting to see how well it holds up after taking it on some long runs. Second, I would have liked 1 place to go to add both books and music - maybe that will be fixed with iTunes for the PC.

<Title>A wonderful experience
<Date>Mon Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Last week I received my new 15Gb iPod (for Windows). It has turned out to be everything I expected. It's wonderful to have all your music in one place and be able to carry it around. The sound quality is great. <p>My only disappointment was with the Tunecast FM tuner thing that Belkin sells (via Apple). It only broadcasts on 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 88.7 and here in SF they are all full. Also, the sound quality was terrible. .... The direct line-out from the dock into my home amplifier also gives very good sound quality. <p>Like several people here I had some problems with Musicmatch, which is a very un-Apple like piece of bloatware, so I am using ephpod, which is free, looks like Apple software, and works flawlessly (after some tinkering). <p>I did hit a few snags during the installation, so here are a few tips to get you going once you get your iPod:<p>1. First install all the software from the CD that comes with the iPod. This also configures the iPod. I used an Orange Micro firewire card for my laptop.<br>2. Then uninstall Musicmatch, using the Windows Control Panel. Don't forget to uninstall the Musicmatch iPod plug-in as well. <br>3. Get Ephpod from www.ephpod.com and install it. It's free.<br>4. Make sure your iPod is fully charged (takes about two hours). <br>5. Plug your iPod into a firewire port and start ephpod.<br>6. Go through the wizard and find your iPod (it was drive G: in my case)<br>7. Use the config button to select which directory holds your music (My Music in most cases).<br>8. Hit the synch button. <p>If ephpod crashes halfway through your first synching operation, reboot your computer and change the cache to 512k in the ephpod configuration menu (advanced options). I also clicked the Windows API thing (no idea what that does, but someone recommended it). After that it worked smoothly. Took about 15 minutes to download over 2000 songs. <p>One thing to remember: when you change tags in ephpod's menu it only changes them on the iPod. Synching afterwards will create duplicates, because the unchanged songs on your hard disk will be loaded onto the iPod in addition to the songs you changed. So you should either make sure all your tags are good before you synch the first time or just download single directories after your first synch. (All of this sounds more complicated than it is in reality). <p>Don't forget: make sure the iPod is fully charged. Downloading all your music takes a lot of energy and you don't want the iPod to die in the middle of your first synch, which is going to be far longer than any subsequent ones. <p>Finally, if the iPod does die just uninstall everything and reinstall using the original Apple CD. It only takes 10 minutes or so. Don't forget to uninstall Musicmatch! <p>Enjoy!

<Date>Mon Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am going to switch and buy a 12" powerbook in september, before I go to university. I couldn't wait until then to get an ipod mostly due to the fact that my older MP3 player (64mb creative muvo) broke-down.<p>I fell in love with the 15 gb ipod when I first saw it, In fact I have experienced love for the first time. It looks a lot smaller than I thought, and I know you will also think so if you haven't seen one in the flesh before. It is a fantasic bit of kit, even though it has a hefty price tag, I think it is worth the money.<p>Why I hear you ask?<p>1) It is a lot smaller and lighter than any other MP3 player with that storage capacity on the market<p>2)The sound quality is beyond belief, for classical music and show music you really hear this. If you are into drum and bass, the headphones that come with the ipod may struggle, I tried other headphones and the sound was better.<p>3)So much love and compassion was used to design this ipod, and the manufaturing of the product is of the highest quality. the build quality is fantastic, believe me you will not find anything that is so beautiful, I know because I work in an electrical store and we have about 20 mp3 players for sale and I have played with them all, nothing compares!<p>4)The solid wheel and the menu structure are very easy and fast to use, lets put it this way, I turned the ipod on and used it without looking at the instructions, It also has three games on which will keep you amused on long journeys.<p>Cons<br>1) As I said I don't think much of the headphones, maybe mine are faulty, and I may get on to apple about that. (thats only if you have the volume up very high, which is bad for you anyway! LOL)<p>In conclusion, even though may hard-drived based mp3 players are on the market, the reason why the ipod is the market leader has to be due to the size and ease of use, in fact it is slightly larger than a pack of cigs.<p>I give this product 4.5, it lost 0.5 marks due to the headphone problem I have experinced, however reading forums I have not seen this issue raised.

<Content>As a near-decade &amp; 1/2 long windows user, I was 'hesitant' to consider the purchase of an iPod.  Luckily, I received one for father's day and didn't have to 'make' the decision.<p>As it is, the product-- everything about it-- defines excellence: the box and initial packaging, the documentation, the accompanying (windows) software, the iPod w/ headphones &amp; docking station.<p>My old compaq had a firewire port, so I connected in the docking port directly to it, plugged in the iPod and went to town recharging the batteries.<p>With that in place, I plugged in the Apple supplied CD and found my *only* disappointment.  Namely, while I have (already) purchased a MusicMatch license (with recurring updates), the iPod (currently) only auto-synchs with the supplied 7.5 release (a capable MusicMatch release, but not quite as refined as the 8.x release currently out there).  Conundrum? No.  I uninstalled the existing 8.x MusicMatch, installed the 7.5 release and found three things:<br>(a) The existing Windows 'bug' with regards to uninstallation was still present (eg programs never 'really' remove themselves once installed)<br>(b) The bug was *wonderful* in this case because all my playlists, recording settings, and directories were all present.<br>(c) iPod's software (from the System Tray service/icon to the 7.5  software) worked *exactly* as advertised.<p>Not bad. In fact, excellent.

Once I installed the software in my !Mac the !Pod was downloaded in I would say less than a second a song, very very fast and impressive downlaod from my Mac to the Pod.  So far I have 188 songs and it didn't even scratch the surface of the 15 GB I have. The Pod's backlights were a big surprise and they look very attractive esp. when docked.  This is the coolest toy I have bought besides the !mac.  Do yourself a favor and if you can, get this it is so damn cool!  Best Mp3 player ever!!

They are indeed rechargeable, but since Li-ion technology dictates that the battery can survive only 350-400 discharge/recharge cycles (afterwhich it becomes totally unchargeable), both the iPod and Zen are destined to be paperweights in 18 to 24 months, granted that lifetime depends on use. Li-ion batteries begin to lose charge capacity after 200 charge cycles, meaning that neither player will be able to hold a full charge once that point is passed--something sure to limit playtime. Neither Apple nor Creative tech support were willing to ensure that their companies would be willing to replace the Li-ion battery, even if it were possible (the iPod's battery is not replaceable, period.).

<Title>Alright people..... Hands Down the best!!!
<Date>Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The IPOD is the greatest MP3 player available. The old one was good (relativley small, lotsa space). The new one however is great. 15gb hardrive that small and light?!?! How amazing. Plus the sound quality is excellent. There are 2 major complains with this MP3 player. I feel the need to address them. The first one is that its expensive. COME ON FOLKS!!! You get what you pay for. The only other hard drive MP3 player that has these features is the nomad 2 and 3. However they are huge and weigh a lot. This is mean for portability. It still amazes me. The next closet thing too it is the zen, which is 100 dollars less, but does not have nearly as many features and is bigger. The second issue many peopel complain about is the fact that it is hard to use with windows. I have a windows computer as well as a Mac. I can use both. When you plug it into windows, it comes up as a harddrive. All you have to do is transfer the files. Same thing wiht Mac. Plus, it is an APPLE product. Made for APPLES. I guarantee you that if you look at half the other MP3 players out there, they have NO compatability with macs. This one does, and even goes a step further with providing compatability with PC. Thats the reason why its more friendly with macs as opposed to PC's. Sound qualilty is excellent through the ear buds. I thought that would be the first thing I would need to upgrade, but that isnt so. The only complaint I have with the product is that I wish it came with a removable battery. Tho it states there is no memory, within a couple of years, it WILL deplete. This makes me conscious. I recommend buying the apple care warranty wiht it, makes it much better. Will replace unit when the battery goes down. Other than that, its a great unit at an OK price. Nothing Less.

<Title>You cannot beat the iPod
<Date>Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>There is really no way to overemphasize what an elegant, well-designed and thought out product the iPod is. I have it connected directly into my car stereo and my commutes are that much more pleasant without having to make sure I have some CDs with me. I haven't even made custom playlists for my commute yet but when I do it will be that much better.<br>If you love music and want it portable all other products fall short of the iPod.

<Title>It took a week to figure out, but...
<Date>Sat Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It's the coolest toy I've ever had.  The hook-up took two trips to CompUSA to get the right card for my PC.  Then it took an additional 5 days to figure out how to understand, first of all, that my PC could even "see" the ipod.  Once I figured out how to use the cradle and how to know if my PC recognized the ipod, it took another 2 to 3 days of fiddling with the software to figure it out.  Once I caught on, it was well worth the effort.  This truely changes how I will 'acquire' music from now on.  This may be the beginning of the end of CD burners and paying $17.99 for a CD at Border's.  <p>Had I used the expertise of my 18 yr old son earlier, I might have figured it out sooner.  But, I'm no dummie and it took some patience working thru all the variables as to why it didn't work intially.  Great product!!  I look forward to seeing what else the wizards at Apple will come up with.

The IPOD turns heads when people see it.<p>Sure, you pay a little more for Apple, but you pay for amazing quality and ease of use. <p>Long live Apple and the IPOD.

<Title>A revolutionary device - easy to use, small and cool-looking
<Date>Tue Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple has long been considered the industry leader in technology and features in personal computing.  They were the first company to use the 3.5" floppy drive in its consumer products (and one of the first to eliminate it), as well as the mouse and the graphical user interface that has been imitated by other software manufacturers.  Since the introduction of the iMac a few years ago, Apple has been the undisputed design champ of computers and electronic devices.<p>Both performance and style are combined quite nicely in the new iPod.  I've always heard that the thing was "about as big as a deck of cards".  Those people are wrong - it's about as big as a deck of cards if half of the deck was missing.  It's very light and sturdy - I carry it around in my pants pocket w/o any skipping, although I recommend purchasing an armband and case for the iPod if you plan to jog or do vigrous exercise while wearing it (see below).  I can't believe a 15 GB hard drive sits in the little plastic and chrome case.<p>It works flawlessly with iTunes for Mac OSX or Windows.  The spartan instruction manual does not really give detailed instructions on how to create custom playlists and why some of my artists are listed multiple times on the iPod.  After 5 minutes visiting Apple's support site and another 15 minutes of experimenting with playlists in iTunes (hint: select every song by that artist, select "command+I" and you can edit the artist name for every entry to avoid misspellings, hidden spaces, etc).<p>I also bought an extra power cable so I can listen to music at work (via self-powered speakers) and at home (via my stereo system) without losing battery power.  <p>Now I bring my iPod everywhere for easy access to my 3700 songs.  The iPod has definitely cut down on my CD-listening time because it is so small and easy to use.  It is very sleek-looking and the backlight feature makes the buttons glow orange and the LCD display glow blue.  The buttons are very touch-sensitive, so Apple included a locking feature on the iPod that's similar to the ones found on portable CD players.  I found the buttons a bit TOO sensitve for my liking, but the lack of moving parts means a more reliable MP3 player.<p>The 15GB iPod also ships with a black belt clip, a wired remote that attaches to the headphones, a 6 pin to 4 pin FireWire adapter, a power cable and a docking station so the iPod can stand upright and connect to a computer or stereo system.<p>As I wrote above, I can't recommend use of the iPod while jogging or while exercisting vigorously, even if you purchase a third-party jogging armband.  Since it stores music on a hard drive rather than a compact flash card, the iPod is susceptible to skipping and freezing if bounced around continuously.  Mine locks up after jogging for about 20 minutes.<p>Other than the lousy manual (Apple has a pretty decent support web site, BTW), my only other gripe is the chrome back to the iPod.  Sure, it looks totally cool and functions as a handy mirror, but shiny chrome quickly becomes smudged and smeared chrome after only one or two handlings.<p>But those are minor complains to what is looking like the neatest and most innovative personal audio device since the original Sony Walkman.

<Title>15 GB Ipod Honest Review
<Date>Tue Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased my 15gb ipod and I decided to put down the extra $[$$] for the 15gb instead of the 10gb, which i think was a very good idea. One of the reasons for my choosing the 15 over the 10 is actually the price. Many do not realize, but in the long run, the 15 comes out to be cheaper. This is because of accessories. At first, I was planning on buying the 10 and then adding on sme accessories such as the dock and remote (which come free with the 15 and 30 models) but once i got to the shoping cart, i soon realized that it was actually more expencive than the 15!<p>Now if you are smart (like i was hehe) you are probably reading this review to get some insight from real people who have real opinions on the  purchase you are about to make. I, a windows xp home user, have had no problems whats so ever with synching, charging, or installing. You will also [hear of] users complain about music match. I am not sure what program [they]'ve been using, but my experience with music match has been a dream. By far, music match is the best and most user-friendly media player out there for windows. And with music match jukebox plus (witch is what ships with all ipods) the limits are endless. If you download songs off the net, you wil often fnd yourself with incomplete song tags. Feilds such as "artist" "album" etc will often be missing. With music match plus, all one has to do is use the feature "look up tags" and music match will automatically connect to their servers and repair the tag and even download the album art! All in a matter of seconds.<p> I think that the sensitivity was perfectly calibrated and apple has sone a fantastic job with the design of this mp3 player. The touch wheel makes scrolling through thousands of songs a breeze and the backlit buttons and screen look amazing.<br> Besides the AAC file format (which will be available to pc users by the end of 03') all extra features are available to pc users. Its easy to creat contacts, notes, and calender dates on the pc using microsoft outlook. And to add them on ur ipod, you simply just drag and drop like it were a hard drive instead of an mp3 player, which it is!<p>Probably like you, before purchasing anything, i compare it to its leading competetors. Currently, the only competition that even comes close is the nomad zen. Both are firewire400 and usb 2.0 compatable, but the zen just cant match up to the style, ease of use, and compactness of that of the ipod. Just the box of the ipod alone says it all. Everyone knows the most fun out of recieving a gift or making a purchase is opening the box and laying your eyes on it for the first time. <br> This is definately the best mp3 player out there.<p>I admit that the ipod is not cheap, but the price is very fair for what you get. If you are gonna spend over $$$ for a portable music player, you should buy the best, dont settle because you will regret it later.

<Title>Good idea, but bad execution.
<Date>Wed Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought an Ipod because I wanted the space and the small size.  While it was small, and spacious, it was impossible to use.  Doing anything on it is overcomplicated.  Putting on multiple playlists is damn near impossible.  I would recommend just buying an MP3 cd player and change cd's every once and awhile.  Because the Ipod is too damn hard to use to be useful.

<Title>CDs are out and iPods are IT!
<Date>Mon Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I can't believe I lived so long without owning one of these babies! I've downloaded my entire CD collection and mp3 list onto my 15gb iPod and haven't touched a CD since! I take my iPod everywhere (which is easy because it fits in the palm of you hand!) I bought an accessory to listen to it through the car speakers, and at home I plug it into my spare computer speakers and I never have to worry about lugging my fat CD case or switching CDs when I get bored. Trust me; the cost is nothing when you think about how much use you get out of it. As of now I have 900 songs on my iPod and I'm still adding more. Transferring songs is easy and takes much less time than burning a CD! I got my new iPod out of a rebate after I dropped and broke the old version and I am so glad I did, because this new version has so much more to offer! Buy it today and you won't be sorry.

<Title>Whats all the hype?
<Date>Fri Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I can't believe anyone would say such great things about an iPod.  I was very nervous of trying one of apples products, I never liked them.  I was right to be sceptic.<p>I had been looking for a good MP3 player and after much research and questioning of people at stores, people online and friends who have had them, I decided to get an iPod.  I was pretty excited when it showed up on my doorstep but by the time I tried to hook it up and get it to work I was alright irritated.  Not only is the process much much more complicated and difficult than people have led me to believe there are tons of things to go wrong.  Maybe my iPod is broken, but it isn't doing things it's supposed to do on its own.  I find myself pushing it to do what I want it to do all the time.  The one hour 80% battery charge is a joke, after an hour i'm lucky if I get 45 minutes of juice out of it.  And I can't even get it to upload NEAR 15 GB.  After only 206kb it says my iPod is full?!  I don't understand it at all.  And the manual doesn't do anything either.  it's a complete waste of time.  I feel like I was ripped off of my $$$.

<Title>iPods are great after they are installed
<Date>Sat Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Once I got everything installed and running correctly, I was really happy with the iPod.  I don't know what the problem was, but installing the FireWire card, the software and equipment was a hassle every step of the way. But, once I got over the mystyerious freezes, things have been working like a charm.<p>The manual that comes in the box is lacking in details.<p>Be forewarned, the iPod does not support .WAV files. If your files are in .WAV format, you will need to re-rip them. A friend told me that I could convert .WAV into .MP3 format but the musicmatch software doesn't do it, contrary to my friend's assertion. Maybe I'm missing something.<p>The ergonomics are great. The machine works flawlessly. The remote operation buttons are great. <p>15MB is a huge amount of storage space. I can't imagine that my music library would ever be big enough to fill the 15MB, let alone 30MB.<p>Get the 15MB instead of the 10MB because the 15MB comes with a docking station, remote operation buttons and carrying case. The 10MB doesn't include these items and if they are brought separately, you get close to the price of the 15MB anyway.<p>The back of the iPod is polished chrome.  After a couple of handlings, it looks awful.  But after a while, all the smudges and scratches blend together and it looks fine.

<Title>Love my iPod!
<Date>Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Just got it about a week ago.  Took me a few minutes to get it set up on WinXP (but already had a firewire card).  Now it works great!  My main gripe are the blank spaces between continuously mixed or live CD's.  I get around it by ripping the CD as one huge mp3.  You lose the ability to skip songs, but you can use the wheel and navigate through by time...  That works ok...  Hope Apple fixes this.  The headphones sound great, but I don't think they're well suited for sweaty environments (gym, etc.).  Bought some different ones.  Not a big fan of Music Match, but it gets the job done.  Didn't like Ephpod, and may try XPlay.  It's my first Apple product, and I like it a lot.  May buy more, who knows?  But minor gripes aside, I love it.  I already have tons of music on it (with 11.5GB remaining!).  Wow...  Glad I bought it!

<Title>i love it, despite one or two flaws (windows user)
<Date>Wed Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i love my new ipod. i've been using it nonstop for 3 weeks now although there are two flaws i have found. first of all, some mp3's seem to distort. at first i thought it was the shoddy headphones i was using, but in fact, the files themselves peak to high. this is not the case for all mp3s, just some of the mp3s i have made using the Musicmatch software (included with the ipod). i cannot tell if the ipod or the software is at fault although the mp3s sound fine playing on my pc. the other flaw is Musicmatch will organize your mp3 library differently than the ipod. the ipod is actually smart enough to know that "the beatles" should be filed under "B" whereas Musicmatch will file it under "T" (so i have more artists filed under "T" than any other letter). Sometimes i find multiple entries for the same artist on my ipod, when it's only listed once in Musicmatch. if you know what you are doing, you can fix the mp3 tags to remedy this problem, but whose grandma is going to be savvy enough to figure that out?<p>other than the above minor gripes, the ipod it fantastic. the remote and the case are must have accessories, so at least get the 15 GB model (it will cost just as much to buy the 10GB model and those accessories separately). the interface is intuitive and easy to use and it looks like a million bucks. plus 50 cent has one in his "P.I.M.P." video. be like 50 cent and get one!
