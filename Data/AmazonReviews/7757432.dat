<Title>It is easy with XP and performs beautifully
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't get the "Microsoft Professional"; sounds more like an insider for them. This was very easy to install to my XP Pro PC - downloaded Itunes from Apple, charged up the battery, ripped a CD to the software and transfered it to the Nana...it is that simple.  The sound is amazing.  How do they create such a huge volume of sound from this little device?  I am a PC guy, and this gets me to start transitioning to Mac. The Nano is a buy, recommending to my wife and family.

<Content>I've never owned one of these, it's so cool! I love this ipod! I'm not an expert, but I think it sounds great, it looks good (I got silver), holds a lot of music and it's small but substantial. The only problem is those earbuds, they really hurt my ears....

<Title>I'm a Pod person now
<Date>Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I give this iPod 4.5 stars out of 5. I always wanted an iPod so last year I bought an iPod mini at the low, low price of $300. I was disappointed that I had paid so much for something that didn't even have a radio and I returned it to the store. Instead, I bought a Creative Muvo Micro, a tiny pink player with a replaceable triple A battery and an FM radio. I thought, why should I pay $300 for an iPod with several gigabytes of space that I don't need just because it was pink and cool looking, when I could have a $100 player that has more. Me and my Creative Muvo Micro were getting along great for an entire year before the unthinkable happened...I lost it. I searched for 2 weeks for the little thing and I still can't find it, so I needed a new mp3 player. If I'm going to get something new, I want something with more space, better sound quality, a better screen, just something of better technology than the player I bought a year ago. I didn't want an iPod, but every other player sold in stores is big, black, and ugly. Since the iPod Nano was now a more reasonable price at $150 for a silver one, I bought it. I wanted a pink one, but I didn't need 4 gigs of space and besides, you should get a case that covers your iPod to protect anyway, so I just bought a pink case instead. I've had this player for a week and so far I love it. It came in a small box with nothing but a usb cable, earbuds, and the iPod itself. You have to download a certain version of iTunes from the Apple webiste. Afterwards, I didn't know what to do. I'm pretty computer savvy but it took about a day before I figured out how exactly to get songs on and off the player. The directions on the website are in a video tutorial and I didn't find them that helpful.  The sound quality is excellent. Much better than my previous player. The earbuds fit very well, they're comfortable and sort of small so they don't hurt my ears.  The color screen is very bright. It even allows you to put album artwork with the songs you play, which is really sort of useless to me, but it's still looks cool. There is no radio which means that I can't listen to the tv at the gym. However, I just discovered free podcasts. I downloaded some free upbeat running music as well as some educational stuff to learn to speak Spanish. There are many, many podcasts to download so I might not have a problem filling up the 2 gigs of space. You can buy a radio for it though. Battery life is excellent, I've had a full battery every time I turn it on. There is one thing I don't like about the player and that is the placement of the headphone jack. It's on the bottom of the player which is very awkward. If I've got the iPod clipped on me while I'm working, the headphone cord gets in the way and sometimes gets pulled out. I've actually had one problem with the player since I've had it, so that's not really a good sign. The thing completely froze with the screen light turn on. I couldn't turn it off or do anything with it and since there's an internal battery, I couldn't just pull out the battery to shut it off. I had to go home and search the apple site to figure out how to reset it. It took a couple of seconds and now it's working fine again. I think Apple could have at least included a belt clop or a case for the player, but you can find cheap stylish cases with clips at online stores.  *UPDATE* I've had my iPod Nano for about 2 months now. I haven't had any more problems with it. I use it just about every day! I've never run out of battery life and rarely have to charge it up.

<Title>Joining the iPod Movement
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this iPod for listening to a salespitch at work and consequently did not have a choice in color, size, etc.  I have owned various mp3 players in the past and most have been decent.   iTunes is great software compared to some necessary for other mp3s.  With a little experimentation I have almost mastered it.  Any other question are answered easily by checking online.   The 2GB is larger than any player I have had in the past and so far I am good with the number of songs it holds.   Good sound quality, tiny and light although almost too light.   Although I don't have a high-speed USB port, the song transfer is pretty quick.  Never experienced the supposedly scratch-prone Gen. 1, but so far this seems durable.   Miss FM radio but the area I currently live in doesn't have great radio stations anyway.      Overall, a good product.  Still don't know if I would spend the money to buy one.  But definitely awesome, especially when it is free!

<Title>Love this 'pod
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a shuffle a year ago and loved the quality, I was iffy to purchase a Nano due to my clutzy nature with electronics. I have to say, this baby is TOUGH, I love the brushed finish of the Aluminum casing, no fingerprints!!!My dog has sat on it...twice, it has fallen on the floor and I have fallen down the stairs with this in pocket.....Not ONE SCRATCH on the Ipod....Me, I had a nasty break in my tailbone.  I love the games...but does anyone alses know any games that can be downloaded onto the Ipod Nano? I love, love, love this product, almost as much as my shuffle (My husband took my shuffle from me) but I am never giving up my Nano!  Peace! J

<Title>I'm sold on the 2nd Gen.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to have the ipod shuffle but was frustrated that I couldn't dictate which songs to play. The nano is the perfect solution; I can play by specific song, artist, specific artist's albums, playlist (music folder I create), or genre. This ipod gives me the flexibility I want! Although I mostly just play music, the stopwatch feature has come in handy a few times. I haven't tried downloading games or anything else, though.  I recently went on a 24-hour road trip. I used my ipod the whole trip, and I still had battery life when I got home. The thing is very intuitive, which was nice trying to choose a song while driving at night on strange roads. I've heard people complain that it is too simple, but who wants to spend a lot of time surfing the thing when all you want is to play music NOW! The backlight was REALLY bright at night, but I like that I can determine how long the light stays on after I'm done (10 second, 5 or less after last touch).  Negatives: The earbuds are just OK but not bad enough to make me buy new ones. I would love to reorder the thing so I could get the 4 GB instead of just 2; I have A LOT of songs I want to put on it, and the 2 GB is just a little bit under what I need. There is no carrying case or anything, so you have to put it in your sweatshirt or whatever while transporting the thing. By doing this, you can accidentally increase the volume or change songs. However, I think you can lock the controls to avoid this. My shuffle has a lanyard, which is nice.  I researched mp3 players in depth, and the nano sounded like the player with the least problems (in this price range). I'm glad to know that I made the right buy.   I wrote extensively here because I truly benefitted from other people doing the same.

<Title>Grandma can do Nano's!!!!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having zero experience with iPod-type devices and with purchasing music online, this grandma put music on her grandchildren's Christmas gift of the Silver 2GB Nano in only half a day with only 2 calls to customer support. If I can do it, anyone can. The Apple support are incredibly patient, helpful, have a sense of humor, and you don't have to wait long to get through to them. I just wish the iPod Nano came with a written manual. I did go online and print the 60-page feature guide and it didn't help me with my problem with getting the audiobook out of the music category. Once I did the "Manually manage music" option, the audiobook went in the correct category. A 2 1/2 hour book took minutes to download from the iTunes store (that's the Apple online site where you can purchase books, music, etc.)and minutes to transfer to the Nano. I loaded about 50 songs and 1 book and used 0.1 GB of the available 1.7 GB capacity using a DSL connection and a pc with a USB 2.0 port. The best part was listening to the music. It's stereo sounding, clear and the best I've heard coming out of a radio/cd player in ages. I just laid back in the recliner and listened for an hour. I bought the Tough Skin Nano holder which does have screen protection, because the Nano's are going to a 6-year old and an 8-year old. The Skins come in colors which will differentiate silver Nano's going to the same family.

<Title>Apple 2 gb Ipod Nano (2nd Generation)
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod Nano is a sleek, perfectly sized mp3 player.There are many great things about it, but I have found one thing that frustrates me.     The great things about it are its sweet sound quality, size, graphics (for such a small screen), strength, and smooth click-wheel. I don't know about other headphones yet, but the ones that came with it sound great! The Ipod weighs 1.3 oz. and is 8.9 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, and 0.6 cm. thick. The graphics on this are great especially on the games!(brick, music quiz, parachute, and solitaire) I have dropped my ipod so many times and it is still working great!!!!!! The click-wheel is very smooth ;although, I expected its size to hinder its capabilities.     The only problem I have found is that it cannotplay videos, but it can show photos.     I hope this review helps you find the right Ipod for you!!!

<Title>Excellent product!!
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this product as a gift from my company Christmas party!  I was a little nervous since I am a PC person.  WOW! It was very easy to get set up.  This is a very nice MP3 player for someone who is looking for a music player only without a lot of bells and whistles.  My only complaint would be with the ear buds; they sound great but do not fit in my ears properly.  Certainly not a reason to send it back!!

<Title>I'm thru with Amazon!
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this i-pod, "IN STOCK," a week ago and they are now telling me it won't arrive in time for Christmas?!  3 weeks to ship something that's IN STOCK! And that's with expedited shipping! (though I'll bet if I had chosen 1 or 2 day shipping... what a racket! They want more shipping $!)  PLUS, I can't cancel or change the shipping on the order now!  Sorry, but I don't have an extra $150 sitting around to re-buy this gift elsewhere and return the one I ordered here later (and how long would THAT take to get my money back?)  How do I explain why Santa didn't bring what my child wanted? (or brings it a week late?!)  THOUROUGLY disgusted with Amazon. I used to get "IN STOCK" items within a week if not a few DAYS.

<Title>iPod Nano 2nd Gen.-  2 GB
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Although I prefer the 1st generation look, the iPod itself works perfectly. I couldn't find a thing wrong with it if I tried unless it's my fault (its pretty dirty). The delivery was great too. It arrived one day before the delivery date range was up. I had not gotten an email from amazon informing me that I could track my purchase so I emailed the seller at the given email. I had walked into my house around the time packages are delivered, and i saw no package so I went to my computer to read the email response from the seller. The email stated that it should have arrived that day so I walked back out 5 minutes after I had walked in, and there was my package.

<Title>The best of all the Pods
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned 5 or 6 iPods: several shuffles, the original iPod, the video iPod, and this - the 2nd gen nano.  This little guy is by far my favorite and I use it all the time while my clunky video-pod gathers dust.  It's easy to use, the perfect size, light, and incredibly wearable - especially with the lanyard headphones.  It's so much more convenient than the big pod but holds plenty, and it's way better than the shuffle because it has a display.  I LOVE it!  I'm sorry Apple saw fit to make a 3rd gen nano (with video - which I DON'T want).  They no longer sell this treasure.  Why?  As far as iTunes being hard?  I've never heard that.  My Mom and both my kids easily use iTunes and sync their pods with no trouble.  I find it incredibly user-friendly and idiotproof, myself.

<Content>I have a diferent ipod previously and it is great.  I bought this one used and it was dead in 1 week.  I will not buy an ipod used again, it is not worth it.  The Nano in general is a good product, just not the one I got stuck with by buying used, you never know the abuse.
