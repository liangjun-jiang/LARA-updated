<Title>SAY YOUR PRAYERS, IPOD.
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing does everything the nano does(and things it doesn't like FM tuning and voice and radio recording)for less money.  The only reason to choose an ipod is if you want to be a trendy hipster(god knows there are plenty where I live).  The battery life is great and the shell is pretty scratch resistant.  Even the screen seems pretty sturdy. I found a compatible case logic armband for it at Sears for ten bucks-good luck finding an IPOD armband for less than thirty.  I haven't tried the video feature so maybe the last guy is right about that, I don't know.  But as far as music and photos this thing is great-Sandisc has a new loyal customer.

<Title>Much Better Than the Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.

<Title>A great MP3/WMA player
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: In August SanDisk released a firmware upgrade. Now there's a Custom EQ capability and best of all: syncing to subscription based music (URGE in my case) is WAAAAY FASTER. It's almost as fast as if you're adding your own local files. Previously this was the achilles heel, now it's fixed.  SanDisk actually made a good product better. :-) ______________________________________________________________  I just bought this for $150, a great bargain!  I have mostly WMA's and therefore have no need for an iPod. This player is terrific and it works with subscription services. The interface is easy, the screen is sharp and did I mention it's a great deal?   Oh and another reviewer said these things:  "The scroll wheel is a very loose, flimsy, plastic ring. It's also difficult to turn. Often, I need to use both thumbs to turn the wheel."  and  "Video playback is very buggy: A movie is arbitrarily broken into tiny video files, which the player displays and treats separately. It also adds 5-seconds gaps between them!"   I found neither of these to be true --I suspect the reviewer recieved a faulty device. The video playback is PERFECT and the wheel certainly doesn't require "both thumbs" to turn ...?!  And yet another "reviewer" stated this: "Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player" as their review heading. With minimal PRODUCT RESEARCH one discovers that this device charges via USB. Basically that reviewer is asking for something that this product is not advertised to do --and whose problem is that? What's next, being upset that his/her 2GB model doesn't hold 8GB worth of songs?  Helps to read the product description. ...

<Title>Beats any mp3 in it's category, especially the Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for the ability to play music and it's great. It is far superior to the Nano in everything except the availability of accessories but it's slowing changing. In fact, I had bought a Nano and sold it because this is better.  For instance, 1. longer battery life 2. FM radio 3. recording capability (including from the radio) 4. scratch resistant 5. user changeable battery 6. ability to expand memory by using mini sd cards 7. better price.  Outstanding mp3 player.

<Title>SanDisk has done it again!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I like to read reviews before buying stuff, I've never been attracted to iPod, becuase there have always been better alternatives at a better price. Since SanDisk announced the E200 series  I decided it was gonna be my next digital audio player. well, I got it and it's a great little device. everyone can notice the great quality of this player just looking at it. its metal back and solid apperance shows it's very durable. I like the wheel control, it works great and once you get used to the buttons layout, you'll find it convenient too.  pros. -Eye-catching design, silver and glossy-black look really sexy. -Great quality built (metal frame, liquidmetal back and hard glossy front) -Easy to copy your songs, either by using Windows Media Player or drag and drop. -Gorgeous screen display, easily visible even under direct sunlight. -Great Battery life -User replaceable battery. -Decent earbuds provided. -The right size and weight. -Hard to scratch. -Plays videos, FM radio with good reception, shows pics and records voice and radio. -Easy menu, with practically no hidden or hard-to-reach pages. -Dedicated voice recording button. -Great audio quality.  cons. -No custom EQ, you have to use the provided ones only. The normal  (flat EQ) sounds great, though. -Catches all your fingerprints even if your hands are clean. -It should show more details about the playing song (Bitrate, format, etc.) -It has a clock, but once you start playing a song, you never see it again. -It's been storing some stuff under the screen, it doesn't look like dust, it's like some white crumbs that maybe come from the interior and not from the outside. if it gets nasty I'll take the unit apart and clean it up, I just hope it's easy to do so.  This is a nice player and SanDisk offers feature packed, great quality players at a very affordable price, get it if you can. Sorry iPod, maybe next time...

<Title>iPod Nano Killer
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I do agree that this is a iPod Nano rip off. But this player adds so much more and has value for the buck.  I just bought this player after a lot of research about this product. Read video reviews on gizmodo and engadget before I got this. I'm extremely impressed by all the things that this player can do namely 1. Music 2. Video (1.8" screen) 3. FM  4. FM recording 5. Photos 6. Voice recording  I got this for $150 and it is surely worth every penny. The mechanical dial can look and feel little ugly but once you get used to it, it is not that bad.   Also this player has same length & breadth of Nano but is almost twice as thick as the Nano. It is also heavier than the Nano but somehow this feels more sturdy than the Nano. It comes with a lanyard and I wear this all day without any problems with weight.  The screen is very bright and the interface is very very intuitive.   The software (Media converter) that comes along with player is simple and easy to use. It converts videos to .mov format to be played. Music can be transferred by just dragging and dropping mp3s. Sandisk also provides firmware upgrades on their website which worked fine. FM recording was great though the FM receiver isnt really good. It also has a micro SD card slot that can be used to add more memory to the player.   Overall, if you are looking for something that can do way more than the iPod Nano and costs $50 less, you SHOULD buy this player. If you want to follow the crowd and cant think out of the box, then you should buy the iPod Nano.

<Title>I already despised the nano, and this is the nail in the coffin
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>NOTE: If you want to be a clone, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER! GO GET A NANO LIKE THE 8 TRILLION OTHER CLONES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE ONE.   Otherwise, this player is the flyest thing I've seen in a minute. I was actually waiting for the e250 to be released b/c in doing research on it, it essentially had everything I wanted. MP3s, photos, fm radio, recording, fm radio recording, and even video! All this in a small but STURDY package. The obvious competitior is the iPod nano, which doesn't even compare to the e250 on any level. The nano would probably snap in half in my pocket if I sat down wrong. The drag and drop the e250 has is so simple my dog could do it (no, really). The only thing that I recommend is looking up the user guide from sandisk.com which has way more detail than the included instructions. Otherwise, buy this! I wouldn't steer you wrong.

<Title>It's great!!!! The best mp3 player i have ever bought!!!BMO
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever bought. I you ever need to buy a mp3 player TRUST ME!! Get this one. I was just a normal person looking for a for a mp3 player. I got it at best buy about one week after it was on the market. I have not had one single problem with it once. I had and i-pod before this. But it broke in the washer, and the sansa could probably be ran over with a car and not break(liquidmetal). It Plays video but you need quick time player 6.5 or more. Save it to that and you're good. The only thing i have a problem with is the music store. Rhapsody is horrible, but windows media player works perfectly. But if you want a music store choose something else. So, an overall preview on it, is,it can store up to 400 songs, plays video, fm tuner and recorder, can store info and pictures, and is great. It also can scroll down very fast. In the box comes a starting disk and manual. Trust me get this mp3 player. It beats the nano by far!!!!!!

<Content>I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books on a long commute, and I purchased this when the last MP3 player I had died after 4 months (with a 3 month warrantee) - Avoid Coby!.  Used that experience to look much more closely at what I wanted - a replaceable battery, easy to use controls, easy to read display, reasonable power consumption.  This has met my expectations and more.  A very solid, well performing player.

<Title>DO NOT BUY, DEFECTIVE
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got this MP3 player and was very excited. The first thing I did was start charging it. Then I turned it on. The first thing it did was say "Key Locked, System Shutdown". I thought it might have just been one of those random things that happen so I tried turning it on again. Same thing happened. I tried one final time, and IT DID NOT TURN ON AT ALL AND NEVER EVER DID FOR THE REST OF THE TIME I HAD IT. I returned it and in 1 day already had a new one, thinking this one would work fine and the last one just had a defect. It worked great for about 1 week, and then one day I tried to listen to music and it said "synchronize to continue your music subscription" and would not let me listen to any songs. My sister has the same MP3 player as me and had the same thing happen to her and all she had to do was plug it in to the computer and then it worked fine, except for she could not have it on shuffle and she also could not skip songs so she had to listen through songs to hear one that she wanted to listen to. If she had it on shuffle or skipped songs it would give her that message I talked about earlier and would not play the songs. So, I plugged my MP3 player into the computer, hoping it would fix the problem, and it would not turn on at all, and still won't. Also, some of the songs on my sister's MP3 player will still not play. I have gone through two of these MP3 players and both did not work properly, and my sister's MP3 player is defected and will probably stop working just like mine did. Both me and my sister are very dissapointed and are both returning our MP3 players. I am not going to get this one again and neither is my sister. It would also be wise for you to take the same path as us. Do not ever buy this MP3 player!

<Title>WILL NOT PLAY SONGS
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 player at the end of May, and was very happy about it. I immediately synchronized songs onto it, and it worked very well. The sound quality is very good.   HOWEVER, after a couple weeks of owning this product, something very strange occurred. It was playing completely normally, and all of a sudden when it was going to the next song, it would NOT play and a message came up reading "Synchronize to continue your music subscription". I was very confused; I had obviously synchronized the songs onto the player.  It would not let me listen to any of the songs for the rest of the day. Finally I got home and plugged it into the USB port, hoping that this would solve the problem.  I unplugged it, turned it on, and it seemed to be working fine.  But then, the very next time I used it, the exact same problem occurred.  I found that if I don't have the Music Options set on "shuffle" and don't skip forward, it USUALLY will play just fine. Otherwise, it won't let me play any songs and keeps giving me that annoying message.  Even when I don't use shuffle, however, it still will occassionally not allow me to listen to certain songs.    In the end, I am returning this MP3 player and am not going to buy another one of the same brand.  There are lots of good reviews for this product, but maybe that is just because those reviewers have not yet experienced this problem.  It seems to be defective.  Everyone should save their money and time, and avoid this product at all costs!!!!!!!!

<Title>BETTER THAN NANO!
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>***The person who's title is "DO NOT BUY,DEFECTIVE" is a total idiot. I had the exact same thing happen to me! Guess what I did! I unlocked the hold switch and PRESTO! It magically started working!***  Anyway...this is BETTER THAN THE IPOD NANO. Both of my sisters have a Nano and after I got this and played with it for a while, I looked at my sisters nano and laughed at it! It wasn't near as good! The E250's screen is probably twice the size of the nano, and the bright color screen is mouth dropping. AND YOU CAN HAVE VIDEO! YES VIDEO! It can't hold A WHOLE LOT, but it can still have videos. I am more than satified with this product. Some more awesome features are FM Radio and Voice Recordings. I'm not sure if this is mentioned in the description already but YOU CAN RECORD A SONG STRAIGHT FROM THE RADIO SO YOU CAN HEAR THAT EXACT SAME SONG ANYTIME!!!And you can still listen to that song while you're recording it. Also the Voice Recorder, doesn't sound like a big deal, but mannn is it fun to toy with! haha! Another neat little feature is you can "see into the future". You press a the middle button once or twice and it tells you what song is next! Here, let me break it down for you!...   THE GOOD...  ~BRIGHT & COLORED BACKLIGHT MAKE IT MORE THAN EASY TO READ SONG TITLES,ETC... ~SCROLL WHEEL IS VERY EASY TO CONTROL AND VERY ATTRACTIVE ~THE OVERALL LOOK IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ~SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT ~MORE THAN ENOUGH FEATURES (MUSIC,VIDEO,PICS,RADIO,RADIO RECORDER,VOICE RECORDER) ~VERY LARGE SCREEN ~NICE PICTURE QUALITY! ~THE 2GB CAN ACTUALLY HOLD 1000 SONGS IF FORMATTED TO WMA. ~AND MORE!  THE BAD...  ~SOMETIME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PRESS BUTTONS TWICE ~CAN SMUDGE EASILY ~HAS TO CHARGE BY A COMPUTER ~UPLOADS MUSIC IN A "WEIRD WAY" BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ~AND THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF!!! (SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA?)   OVERALL : GREAT PRODUCT - I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!

<Content>I've had my Sansa for about two weeks now, and love it.  The positive reviews here are spot on.  You definitely have to download the full product manual at sandisk.com, or you'll be a little frustrated trying to figure all the features out.  There are also a couple of good discussion forums out there if you search for them. Earphones are crap, but then most every review of MP3 players say that.  Overall, I'm impressed, and glad I bought this vs. the Nano.

<Content>This player is definately worth the money, but there is one flaw that annoys me. The media converter for video (pictures work fine). The video function for me plays well, but without audio. I am still trying to find a way to correct this. If I can get this function to work, I would change my rating to five stars. The screen, music playback, and pic viewer are all great. Technically, the video playback is also clear, just without audio.

<Title>Think Twice Before Buying
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player thinking I would be able to use it to listen to my music and the radio on my daily commute.  The radio worked fine.  The MP3 player worked, but I could not load music on either of my computers.  I have a Macintosh desktop at home. The Mac would recharge the device, but did not recognize it.  The other computer I have is an HP laptop with an XP operating system.  It would not recognize the player at all, I kept getting an error message.  Once, during the two hours I messed with it, it froze and had to be rebooted.  I called tech support and found out that the Sandisk Sansa 250e will not work with a Mac at all.  His other suggestion was that the device needed Microsoft Media Player version 10 or 11 or it would not work.  I checked my laptop and it had version 11.  I sent it back and got my money back.  I bought an Ipod clone that works great on either system.

<Title>Better than the iPod nano, even better with Rockbox
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had limited experience with mp3 players, but have found this one to work very well for me. I had used the iPod nano and the sansa m240 before purchasing this mp3 player.  This player is better than the iPod nano because:  *You don't need iTunes. You can sync files from other music ompanies. *You have a very handy voice recorder built in *You can watch video once you have encoded it to play on the sansa (free software included) *You can (sometimes) get halfway decent radio. (But hey, the nano has nothing so what do you have to lose?)  I purchased this player over the sansa m240 because I wanted to be able to play video. (something the m240 can't do.)  The format of the Sansa is decently pleasing to look at, and I was able to begin loading music within minutes of opening it up. I have always used Windows Media Player to sync my music, but you may be able to do a direct drag-and-drop sync with this player. (Locate the player in the My Computer folder, find the Music folder, and copy your music files right there)   My MAJOR complaint was the EXTREMLY annoying scroll wheel light. It glows blue when turned on and remains on while the player is in use. (Even after the screen light goes off) After using a nano, this light seemed blinding!! This is a huge drawback unless...  You install Rockbox! This free software available at rockbox.com removed the sansa software in the player and replaces it. The main reason I installed it was so I could turn the scroll-wheel light off. But rockbox offers so many more options, I probably would have installed it even if the wheel light was not always off.  You can: *change the font   *change the color of your screen *create your own folders (or use their database)  *flip the screen upside-down  *play games (none come on the original sansa) *and lots more!  I am really happy with this combination of the e250 and Rockbox. Once I loaded the software I was able to sync my music from two different computers. Basically, the computer reads the player as a UBS device, and lets me add and delete music on different computers. I have begun building my own "database" for my music by creating folders and organizing my music. Playing video was a little tricky, as the rockboxed-player will only play mpeg video. I downloaded some free converting software, and once I figured it out it wasn't too hard.    I have only had this player for a few weeks, so I am still playing with all the features. The player would probably be fine with the original software if Sansa would include a wheel-light off setting. The wheel problem is the reason I only gave this product a 4 star. Otherwise a great player, cheaper than the iPod nano, and a good starter player if you are looking for video and pictures on your mp3. If you are interested in Rockbox, visit their website www.rockbox.com and look at their free software. You can load software for other players besides the Sansa e250. Google it and see what you can find!

<Title>Exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one in the first week they came out, but just now am getting around to reviewing it. Why? I've been using my iPod touch, my iPod shuffle, and a few other odds and ends for music, but the Sansa e series does exactly what I want it to do and doesn't get in its own way. Its easy to use, battery life is amazing (about a week at 3 hours a day or radio and MP3) and so far  even after I've abused it leaving in the bottom of my gym bag it's still alive and doing fine. For the commute and they gym, it's my MP3 player of choice. Oh, and I'm a sucker for the cool blue light on the dial. What can I say?

<Title>Affordable, Expandable, Small: MP3 Player to Buy in 2008
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product to pick up right now, in early 2008, as prices drop. The Sansa e250 should be a Nano-killer, and it's a great buy for anyone who wants an inexpensive flash mp3 player for exercising, walking, or general use. I've owned a bunch of mp3 players, including iPods and one Nano, and here are the selling points for this little Sansa e250:  * Expandable memory through SD Flash. Buy a 2GB and by next fall, you can upgrade it very affordably to some mega size (16 GB? flash memory prices are falling). You'll have a cheap flash player larger as big as some iPods.  * Good sound quality. Via headphones, this is indistinguishable from any of the top mp3/iPods I've listened to. Don't know how it sounds in an audio system, but I don't recommend that for any iPod or flash player, just my tastes.  * Affordability, affordable, cheap, well-priced ... This thing is $69 online and at Best Buy. A few players, like the also excellent Sansa Click, are $49, but they are not expandable. For $20, that's a great option.  * One more note on affordability: Flash players and iPods sometimes get crushed, lost, stepped on, or dropped in rivers (did I mention I've owned a few?). That's their nature, or rather, our nature as clutzes. It sure feels better to hear your front left tire crush a $69 player, as opposed to a $149 one. Trust me.  * FM Radio. It's a great option, available on the e250. Works great.  * Usability. Compared to some of the uber-small players out now, you get a more readable screen. The interface is minimal but easy to use - what you want on a flash player.  *  Good size/form factor. It's not the Click, which is perhaps optimal in size, but it's small enough to attach to your clothes while running. I hold mine, which is plenty easy.  * Free 60-day Best Buy Digital Music Store trial (aka Rhapsody). I have gotten this with two of my past mp3 purchases. Have never signed up for the subscription service, i.e., never paid, but I love the 60-day free trial period. It's a great way to learn about new artists.  * Integration with Audible - pretty standard these days, but well done on the e250.  Negatives? There is not as wide a range of formats as you can play on a big old iPod or larger digital music player like the big Sansas or iRivers. But hey, this is your flash drive, for working out - for your selected collection, not the whole thing. And if you're strictly playing .wma or .mp3 files, you can in fact get the whole thing on there, using an SD flash card.  Bottom line: Probably the best deal out there now in the combination of features (FM, expandable), affordability (just $20 more than the cheapos), form factor/usability, and the not-to-be-overlooked sound quality.

<Title>Nice MP3 player for those on a budget!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This Sansa MP3 player is a nice, rugged piece at a great price!  Pros: Solid metal case feels substantial, long battery life, nice screen size, cool blue backlight, plays videos, lots of accessories available, great volume Cons: Controls difficult to use for someone with big hands/fingers, no ac charger included(charger included works off of PC USB port)  All in all, this is a very nice Ipod-like MP3 player. Make sure you buy a case and AC charger with it!

<Content>Once I figured out how to convert videos, it was simple and easy!  You have to download the software for it b/c it doesn't come with it.  I contacted the company on a sunday and it was very quick and painless.  They were very helpful.  The videos are VERY clear and the music is a cinch to add.  Also gotta love the expandable memory. One way to save money up front on buying a larger memory MP3 player.

<Title>Excellent value for money; potential i-pod killer
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used 2 ipods (a mini and a nano) and now I tried Sansa e250. Apart from the "click-wheel" navigation, i-pod nano faces serious competition from the Sansa e250. The reasons: 1. A bunch of features at comparable price points (a 2GB Sansa vs. a 2 GB nano) 2. Excellent look and feel (i accept the fact that ipods have the best form factor) 3. Value added features: non-scratchable display, excellent video quality, more rugged than ipods, FM Radio, Voice recorder, Battery that can be changed 4. The best: does not tie you down to i-tunes, can use industry standard mp3 version of songs, can create collection faster and cheaper (at abt 17p vs. 99p per song in itunes) The only weakness: Navigation for people with large hands! Buttons around "wheel" are a bit small for comfort  Suggestion for Sansa: 1. With excellent video and image qualities, a new version could be introduced with a camera. If form factor is a constraint some features like the radio and sound recorder could be done away with in the new version.

<Content>I've had this player for 4 hours, in that time I've had to remove the back of the device in as many times to remove the battery in order to reset the player.  The device locks up with no display, no sound no nothing but a constantly lit navigation ring.  Device BIOS is same as on SanDisk's website.  Direction in user manual state to "press and hold the menu button for 15 seconds to reset the system" BZZZZZTTT Thanks for playing!  That doens't work either.  Too bad, I really like the overall look, feel and features for the price.

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have only owned one other mp3 player in my life, and that was 128k flash player by iaudio.  it was one of the first to come out, so it obviously pales in comparison to the players today.  I have messed around with ipods and others before, but never owned one, so my background on these players is limited.  however, i do know that the ipods are overhyped and over priced.  in my opinion, there is no comparison between this player and the nano.  this blows it away with all the added features, and it's cheaper.  i have had it now for about 2 weeks and so far it's awesome.  the only negative, and it is very small, is that the front is a fingerprint magnet, but let's get real here folks, if that really bothers you a lot you have got some serious issues.  other than that, it has great sound, and it's simple and intuitive.  it's also the perfect size.  there defintely is such a thing as too small, especially if you are a big guy with big hands, but this machince fits nicely in the hand and is easy to operate one handed.  the buttons really arent that hard to push, depsite what some other reviewers say.  i got used to them in about 5 minutes.  the program that comes with it to upload videos and photos is also very simple.  it's just a drag and drop system, just like you would do if you were using windows explorer.    bottom line is that it looks great, sounds great, it's easy to use, it has a replacable battery, and it has a lot of features that no other player in this price and memory size range do.  you won't be disappointed.

<Title>Quality MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent about 7 months researching MP3 players, looking for one with the most features at the most reasonable price.  Hands down, this player fits that description.  Here are some of the qualities that I love about this player:  1) Video capability:  although the screen is small, the short videos that you can load onto this player are fun to watch.  It actually comes with a short clip from, I believe, Star Wars.  The sound/picture quality to this short clip is amazing.  2)  Ability to increase music storage:  I purchased the 2 GB, but I have the capability to increase the storage by purchasing a memory card.  3)  FM radio:  If I get bored with the music I have, I can switch over to FM radio and listen to my favorite radio stations.  4)  Size:  I plan on using this when I run long distance, so I wanted a very lightweight player.  This thing is very small, and extremely lightweight.  5)  Music/Video/Picture Transfer from PC to player:  Before this player, I had a small Samsung player that I purchased back in 2002.  Although it has held up great, I dislike using the software to transfer songs from my computer to the player.  This SanDisk Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player, making the transfer process quick and smooth.    There is one drawback to this player.  There are hardly any accessories to choose from such as armbands, fm transmitters, etc.  I have yet to workout with this player because I can't seem to find an armband that is compatible.  But other than that, this player has lived up to my expectations.  Definitely consider this player when doing your research on purchasing a quality MP3 player.

<Title>Not a disposable electronic device
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This puppy is one of the few portable electronic devices I've ever bout which I'm happy with even after a month from purchase. It does have idiosyncrasies though.  But I'm happy I made the right decision in not buying an ipod. Apple has a history of sticking to their own software packages (remember MAC-OS) in order to gain maximum profit from their customers by making sure they're stuck with them.  Microsoft's "PlaysforSure" format is going to prevail, because it has been standardized and there are a large number of online stores (even Walmart) selling music in that format already. These companies are going to be in competition with each other, which will keep their prices down. Not only that, there are many brands to choose compatible players from. People buying ipods and downloading music from itunes are officially enslaving themselves to Apple. Say their ipod gets lost or something. They'll have to get another ipod in order to listen to the backup of the music they've bought. But if I loose my Sansa I can chose from a wide range of brands for my new player, while still being able to listen to my music backups. Once Apple notices that they have a sufficiently large set of "loyal" customers, they'll start to crank up the prices on their players and music (already Itunes=.99c, while Walmart=.88c).   In the end Apple will include "PlaysforSure" on their Ipods, and will come up with a catchy commercial saying "up until now Playsforsure could only be played on dull little mp3 players, now they can be played on Ipods, IMAGIN THE POSSIBILITIES".  In addition ipods have the famous battery problem too. I don't like the idea of buying a disposable electronic device. Sansa-e200 has four screws I can open easily.

<Title>Buggy, but has potential
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off as one of the other reviewers noted this unit does tend to lock up.  I've noticed it doing this mainly when its power is getting low or when I gave the menu button a less than firm press when turning the unit on.  When this happens the scroll wheel will stay lit with blue LEDs and you either wait for it to compleatly drain the battery or remove the battery to reset it.  To get into the unit you will need a "00" size phillips screwdriver which is a size smaller than many commonly available percision sets sell, so be sure to check for that size.  You WILL need it if you keep this unit.  I decided to leave the screws out and let a snug action jacket hold the battery compartment in place, thereby allowing me to pop it open whenever with fussing with screws. The audio and video quality of this unit are good. The battery will last for the lion's share of a day if fully charged. The fast forward is slow which is bad for people who listen to podcasts or audio books.  If you turn the unit off without pausing a presentation it will not return to that point when it is turned back on. It will not play the video format, or allow the conversion of, a couple of popular vidcasts I enjoy. There is no function to delete audio I'm through with without syncing it to my computer. Audio tracks sometimes disappear or have a "ghost" presence on the menu even though no data is present. File management in general is messy. The difficulties with this player will hopefully improve with time, but like so many Mp3 players it leaves a lot to be desired. Update: the left audio channel on this thing went out after about 9 months of use, fortunally I got the extended warrenty at Best Buy so they replaced it.  I use the hell out of these things, sad to say it's not the first to meet an early doom.

<Title>A Solid Feel, A Good MP3 Player With Minor Problems
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a nice little MP3 player which has a solid feel to it. It has a lot of neat features but it also has a few "issues". The main problem is that it does not always "sync-up" with a computer quickly when you are tryng to load files. Several times, I've had to play with the USB cable connection to get the E250 to be recognized by the computer. But once you have made connection, you are golden! From there it is easy to drag and drop MP3 music into the Music folder on the Sansa player.  Loading photos and video clips is a little more complicated. You have to use the special Sansa converter software which Sansa provides, to change the various video files into a .mov format. It is an extra step but it has worked well for me. Photos are the same way.  The tiny 1.8 inch screen is viewable but it is indeed small. It takes a bit of playing with to get the picture to display properly.  One of the other "issues" I ran into is that some of the folders seem to   disappear when loading files onto the player. But with a couple of clicks of the browser, by going to TOOLS, to OPTIONS, to VIEW, you'll find a place to click on Hidden Files. The folders will return.   The final thing I ran into was using an external micro SD card to expand the memory. I found out that the Sansa e250 sees the music and photos that you have placed on the SD memory but not video clips. So the final solution was to put all the video stuff on the internal 2gb RAM and put the music on the external SD chip.  With all these quirks, the Sansa e250 is still a nice little MP3 player. I like the FM Radio and recorder and it works well. So with the falling prices, this is still a nice choice.

<Title>My First MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player thinking I was going to get just an MP3 player but I got so much more. It has a built in voice recorder which comes in handy in college during important lectures and moments I feel smart and need to say some thing and don't have enough time to write it down. This MP3 player also carries your photos and movies. It came with this compact disk you put in your computer, which makes it easy to up load movies into your player and T.V shows too; which is cool because I got to watch Gridiron Gang and smallville on it lol. It really comes in handy in situations were you're board too ha, ha. The great thing is I got it for $59.99; I dropped it tons of times and it still works. I also bought the clear case for it, it makes it a whole lot better and safer too. the MP3 player it self plus with the clear case is way lighter than an ipod. It also comes with a usb drive to connect and charge to your Personal computer :) pluse theres a wall charger sold for it too; just search it and your bound to find it :) I hope this helps some body :)

<Title>This is garbage--DON'T BUY IT
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this mp3 player for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas. Let me preface this by saying that I manage high level computer programming projects for a living--I'm VERY comfortable with technology. The Sansa requires that you either update the library using Windows Media Player or as a USB external hard drive. It took me three days to make the WMP interface work, and when it did, it was complicated and annoying. So then I just used the USB drive option, and while that worked, it's not something that an "ordinary" computer user would be comfortable with. I loaded it up with music for her, and for the first couple of weeks, it worked just fine. But then one day, she came and told me that she couldn't play one of the songs that she'd been able to play before, and then the next day, that none of the songs would play. I plugged it into the computer, and all of the files on the player were corrupted. Furthermore, there was no standard way to clean or reformat the disk. To make matters worse, SanDisk doesn't provide a copy of the OS that you can download, or on the CD that's included in the package. It's 30 days past purchase, and now all I have is a useless, dead mp3 player. I should've gotten the I pod. Incidentally, if you're buying this for a child or teenager, I recommend the Apple product not only because it's more reliable, but because you don't have to be a computer geek to use it. I have an I pod for myself and my wife, and all you have to do is plug it in and it works--my daughter can manage her own music without my help. That's a plus, and in my opinion, worth the extra money. But please, don't waste your money on this product. It's worthless. And the support from the manufacturer is even worse.

<Title>Designed to Anger Audiobook/Podcast Listeners
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you use your MP3 player for music only, my one star review is very harsh. For the money, it is a decent player if you never listen to anything over five minutes long. However, if you listen to audiobooks or podcasts, do not buy this player. I have used about a dozen different players over the past few years and I have never ever seen one so ill suited for playing lengthy files. There is no bookmarking feature and the fast forward is so slow that it is completely useless. You cannot start and the end of a track and rewind back to your spot either. Worse yet, it seems like the designers almost were determined to make it impossible for someone to maintain their spot on a long track. The record button has a hair trigger and is very difficult not to accidentally touch, and you had better manage to listen to that audiobook on one batter charge, because recharging will also cause you to loose your spot.

<Title>Sansa E250
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned the Sansa c140, Sansa e130, and now the Sansa e250.  First, I like the fact that it is done by SanDisk.  I have evaluated Creative's and RCA's and find them all lacking.  I picked the SanDisk for quality in memory products.    I was in a rush for a trip overseas and was looking for an MP3 player, I did not have time to order one in, so I researched products at local vendors.  I picked the c140 even though is did not have all of the features I was looking for, it was the best available within my timetable.  I got rid of the c140 because it did not have expansion capabilities.  Which when travelling the world, a limited playlists (granted 100+ songs) gets old.  Though it functioned superbly with absolutely no problems.  I went on an 11 day trip over seas and replaced the batteries twice, not bad for the amount of use it got.  But expandibility was my top requirement.  So I got the e130.  I know less memory up front but expandible with easy to find SD cards.  I ended up giving this one to my neice, because I had promised her one and the e130 was no longer available.  Now I have the e250.  This is great, video, pictures, music, recording, and radio.  Nice form, size is nice, weight is great, and it is rechargible, something the other two models did not have.  However, since buying it, I have had it lock up three times and now the left ear has gone out (not the headphones).  Amazon is exchanging it.  The micro SD cards are harder to find and all of my other devices need the SD/microSD adapter for microSD.  The navigation controls is the clumsiest of the three models of the e250.  My favorite features: - I like the controls best on the c140.  It is simple to use and navigate. - Layout of the c140 makes it comfortable and easy to use controls without having to look at it. - standard SD card expansion of the e130. - rechargibility of the e250. - Size, weight of the e250.  I looked hard for a product that was expandible with memory cards and that was light and portable.  The style of the SanDisk products fit the bill.  Of the three different models I have had, the e130 was my favorite.  Too bad it is out of production.  The e250 is an acceptable replacement.

The most significant issue is the computer software interface is very, very poor.  It is difficult to use, hard to manage the sound library on either the computer or device, and downright clumsy. This is a significant negative. 2.  The earphones are tolerable, but uncomfortable.  How much could it cost to upgrade them?    3.  While it has radio, it does not receive am.  4.

<Content>I LOVE this thing... I got it for $149 at BestBuy, and if buying again, would get the 6gig model.  My college kid's iPod died after 1 year (hard drive crash), will be replaced with a Sansa next xmas.  I use it for dog-walking and for long plane trips, have owned it about 3 months, using with Rhapsody for now.  Pros:   easy to use - acts like an ipod FM radio more rugged than ipod, better scratch resistance very cool blue wheel good looking screen, even in the sun expandable SD good (not great) earphones included better price than ipod  Cons: none yet

<Title>Sansa e250 - A Great MP3 for the Money
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little unit does what I need it to do.  I wanted something that could hold enough songs and battery charge to use while traveling.  Although I manage computer hardware, I didn't want this to be a technological nightmare.  Out of the box, it requires no software other than the standard Media Player and Windows Explorer; so ease of use is 5 stars.  Navigation through the menus is fairly intuitive as well.  I really like the combination of the buttons and the wheel.  The buttons are a little small but certainly no worse than any others on the market.  I haven't loaded any pictures or videos yet, so I can't speak to that.  The only issue I have is that the earbuds supplied don't fit my ears.  That's the most common complaint with MP3s so I wasn't surprised.  The other units that I considered were the Creative Zen MicroPhoto and the Samsung YP-Z5.  The Creative unit is a microdrive type and I didn't think it would hold up to the travel abuse.  It was also heavier than the Sansa.  The Samsung was more expensive and the screen did not seem as clear.  Some of the other reviews (including the s/n ratio specs) have indicated that the sound on the Samsung is better, but I couldn't tell the difference.  All-in-all I have been pleased with the ease of use, the size, the sound and the price.

Sweet! -excellent voice recording! -photos too! -nice sized screen! -SHARP looking! -EASY to control with blue wheel! -excellent music quality! -easy to transfer files! -20 hours of battery life! -micro SD card slot for extra memory! -I bought my player for only $144!  I've had this player for 3 days and can't put it down!   I feel bad for those who own the i-pod nano.   The only bad thing I can think of is it collects fingerprints quickly.   Awesome mp3 player!

<Title>Beats the competition
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my wife as a replacement for her old MP3 player.  It was getting old (4 years) and she wanted one that would store pictures and play video as well as play music.  I researched all the players I could find for under $200 ($150 target price) and this unit was the only one for the price that did all three - and it does it very well.  We figured 2GB was plenty of space for pictures, music and one full lenghth DVD and in the end, it was, but just barely (see complaint #2). We managed to put 600 songs (96 kbps - space was more important than quality), 250 pictures and one movie on it before filling it up - we'll get a memory card later to add more songs.  While I was setting it up (breeze to set up, ripping CDs and converting video took most of the time), I only had two complaints, and really in the grand scheme of things - they are pretty minor.    1. I didn't like how it sync'd with Music Match - it was just too cumbersome to load everything into Music Match and sort through the songs - then again, I'm not from the iPod generation - I like to manually organize all my files on the computer to review them and not let some other program do that for me.  Dragging and dropping worked a lot better for me.  2.  Sansa Media Converter - what a pain!  Of course, it should have been expected that a company primarily known for its memory cards would make this converter a memory hog.  The video conversion process took forever and was very frustrating.  First, to save space, I down-converted a DVD into a 160mb .wmv file (same program I use for my Windows Smartphone for videos) - then ran the program through the Media Converter to load onto the player.  I figured it would keep the same size file when it transferred, but guess what?  It blew the file up into a 880mb file!  After some research on the web, I found some cheats to make the file smaller, but the quality wasn't that great - something my wife had to live with.  If you are planning on playing videos - get the 4GB model - it's well worth the extra money and something we should have done, but I'm too stubborn.  I was going to make this work one way or another.  Oh yeah, one last thing on the Media Converter - convert the video into a .wmv file first, otherwise the converter will run almost through the entire video and then pop up telling you the conversion failed.  Before I found the cheats, I converted the video into all types of formats, including Quick Time (mjpeg B) to see if Media Converter would convert the video into a smaller file.  No luck yet, but I'll keep scouring the web for more cheats.  All-in-all, a great product - once I figured out these little tricks, everything worked smoothly and my wife really likes it.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great MP3 player for under $200 (and get the 4GB model)!

<Title>Good but could be Better
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received mine today.  Complaints so far... - Only chargeable by USB cable, does not charge when PC is in sleep mode. - While USB is connected the device is inoperable. - I've already had to reset my device once, it hung up on me. - The buttons are really tricky with the silicone skin on.  Compliments so far... - The price - The screen is very nice - user serviceable battery(take that iPod). ************** FOLLOW UP - Returning my unit.  1. The screen keeps going out and have to reset unit to bring back display.  2. While using in car noticed a thump noise in between songs - not very pleasant.  Also the buttons are hard enough to get at, but damn tricky with the silicon skin on. Hate to say it but may give in to the darkside and go with the iPod.

<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this for my young daughter, but also used by my wife when she is working out at the gym. We just needed a small mp3 player with a nice interface. We have lots of mp3's and wma's, and no aac's. So we didn't need an iPod. This player works well, is small, light and easy to use. Granted, it doesn't have the touch controls like the iPod, but what it does have works well.

<Title>Good hardware, bad software...
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The looks of the Sansa e250 is very nice.    Pros: Certainly have the looks that would make an ipod owner jealous.  Very solidly built, but very prone to scratches.  You can probably shop around and you can get it refurbished for less than $50.  Another nice thing about this player is that you can replace the battery easily.  Music quality is pretty good.  Batteries are available in ebay or thru their website.  Transfer of music is very easy and there's no need to install propritary software like itunes.  You can transfer music using windows explorer or Windows Media player.  You can also listen to fm music and record with a built in mic (you can also record fm music also.)  This is ideal for recording lectures and copy the lecture files to your pc.  Cons: FM reception is pretty weak.  You can't just drag and drop videos and pictures to the mp3 player.  You have to use the Sansa Media Converter to convert them to fit onto the player.  You have to go to every picture to rotate and best fit them.  As for the videos, it is very difficult to convert and even if you did, the quality won't be that good.  You cannot change the theme unless you use something like rockbox.  Perhaps if they improve in the software department this would be a perfect mp3 player that makes ipods look bad.

My son finally took his off because of this. I guess if the material wasn't so rubbery it would be better.  I would still buy it again, I just wish he would leave it on.

<Content>Product is an excellent alternative for some of the more sought after brands. It actually does a lot more than some of the more expensive MP3 players out there and the radio feature give it the edge but since the antenna is apparently built into the earphones, the signal could be a little better. The player interfaces well with the computer and uploading songs was a simple straight forward task. Although some feel that the player has limited storage (I think 2GB is more than enough for the average user) the expansion slot provides may possibilities. The size of the player is just right and controls are easy to use. All in all an excellent item. My teenage daughter absolutely loves it.

<Title>So Flexible Even I Can Use It
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought Sansa MP3 Player (2GB) last month so that I could listen to lectures on my way to and from New York.  It cost me around $100.  Although I didn't install the software that came with it on my PC, I was still able to operate it through the USB port.  I loaded the lectures as well as some of my music from the CDs I have without any problem.  With the software that comes with it, you can get better control of what you store where and how you organize it.  I guess you could also buy music online.  It was still very useful without the software.  One of these days I'm gonna bite the bullet and actually install that thing.  Another feature that I find great about this MP3 player is that it's also a recorder.  It does work better when you speak directly into it, but my friend was still able to record speakers at a conference - about 2 hours worth of speeches that are relatively clear when you listen to them.  The speeches were done over the microphone and loudspeakers.  I haven't used any of its photo and video features - although, I guess, if I had a reason to I would.  I like the product for what I am using it for and the amount of money I paid for it.

<Content>I bought this for my daughter, and I have to say it was a great hit. We were going to buy the ipod and I stumbled upon this in a review and the review really gave it high marks. Well with the difference in price being a good amount I decided to give it a try. My daughter absolutely loves it!! She takes that thing everywhere. Two things that really win it over for her (she is 13) the first is everyone has an ipod and so hers is different and unique. The 2nd is that the Sansa actually plays the radio something the ipod does not do. So I would recommend this to anyone out there wanting an mp3, video player, and a walkman!! It is well worth the money!

<Title>Video clips?  Not really.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported.  However, the video clip capability is TERRIBLE.  They list a variety of supported clip formats.  THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device.  Everything must be convertged.  This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files.  Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings.  Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly.  It will not work.  You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.  1.  You are supposed to be able to import VOBs.  WRONG.  It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone.  There is no way around this bug.  2.  You have absolutely no control over compression settings.  If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate.  The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.  3.  If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these.  There is no way to avoid this.  If you try to join the files, they will not play.  4.  The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.  5.  The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.  This is really a nifty player.    However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future.  You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk.  If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.  I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.  July 11 2006  One individual reports that Sandisk will supply a replacement USB.  I have found no source for the hyped battery replacement.

<Title>FABULOUS!
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Needed to replace my functional, but very clunky first generation Dell Jukebox. Read all the reviews and decided to check this one out. OH MY! What a beauty! And VERY intuitive.   I'm no techie, working off my old Music Match library and this baby was a snap to load/play. The sound is full (I use an old pair of Sony headband earbuds and it sounds great; also have played it off my home stereo setup).   My only complaint is with myself: wish I'd bought the 4G. Thrilled tho' that I can zip in a micro 1G card to expand capacity.   Only issue: limited protectors (as in there's one) so far. I bought a leather credit card case and it fits nicely.   I have no problem with charging via the USB. Travelers might. I just visit friends who have computers if I need a charge on the road ;-) Or, you can buy an IPOD car charger and use the SanDisk USB instead of the IPOD's.   I REALLY love this mp3 player. Only giving up the Dell as it's too big to haul around. Still use it at home, so this was no mercy buy!

<Title>Very Good.... but not perfect. 
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must admit, you get ALOT for your money when  you buy this mp3 player. I have several videos already loaded on which were very easy thanks to the media converter (included cd) screen is excellent- bright and large. Video and sound quality is excellent, although when a song starts off quietly, you can hear a rattling and electrical sounding in the backround which you can't hear when the song gets louder. very sleek and thin design, yet not too fragile like the nano. Scratch resistance is EXCELLENT- a major problem in the nanos.  the problems i have had with mine: when i press the right arrow to go to the next song, sometimes it takes 2 or more seconds to show what song is playing and can freeze up. mine has frozen up 3 times. in whicih i have responded by updating the firmware. the firmware is nice because it doesn't make you delete all the songs off your player.  ONE BIG PROBLEM I HAD- one time i went to the music menu to select a song from the "songs"section when i had chosen my song, it COMPLETELY FROZE UP. i could not press any buttons, not even the power switch. I tried connecting the usb to my computer but nothing worked. the player didnot turn off until the battery died. (overnight) the next day i charged it up and it worked fine- no problems since. the chargeable battery is good. it is easy to charge it- just connect the usb and leave it alone for a good hour and a half.    it is a good choice to buy this player, but, DO NOT BUY unless you buy a warranty. you will end up losing alot of money.  i have a 2 year unconditional unlimited warranty, and i will be returning this product for the SAME thing. i think mine might be defected. but i will remainloyal to sandisk as I have in the past. (this is my 5th sandisk mp3player)  good luck and i hope you have great success with this great product!! :)

<Title>Refurbished
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got a refurbished e250 for my girlfriend and a e260 for me. Tey did not include a case or a lanyard, only included the unit, the sync cable, CD and earphones. both of them work great, really!. I was also surprised that in the back of the unit the word REFURB is engraved in both units.  Overall, seems to be better than the ipod nano.  I really like this MP3 player. Buy it!!!!!!  Just be warned about what you will get if you get it refurbished.

<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Love the features offered on the E250. Radio option is perfect for those times where the same old songs won't do. Compared to I-pods the Sansa is much more compatible for various download formats (audio books, music, etc.) even lets me upload free stuff from the library or other sites. Pictures look great and the option to load up a data-card gives almost unlimited storage capability. The Sansa is easy to use and set-up. I love the E250 and would pick it over the I-pod any day.

<Title>First one was defective, but....
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The first e250 I purchased from Amazon was defective.  The output jack wasn't secure and the slightest movement would cause the sound to crackle and cut out.  Confirmed it was the e250 and not the earbuds by testing with a known good earbud set.  Amazon replaced the defective unit with no hassles (5 stars to Amazon.com and their customer service).  The new one works as it should.  It's simple to use, holds a lot of files (especially with the expansion slot) and is an all around good performer.  The only downside I can think of (beyond the first defective unit) is the blue scroll ring.  It's stiff and doesn't turn too well-could be better designed.  If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 stars.  Overall I'm very pleased with the unit and would recommend it.

<Title>Best MP3 Player I've Found 99.9% Awesome
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great buy for your money!  Not only do you get an easy to use and classic looking MP3 player but headphones,USB Cable, Lanyard, and a protective case are also included.  Loading music, pictures, and videos is super easy just click and drag.  The screen clarity is wonderful and I would compare it with HiDef picture. In addition you can record voice as well as songs on the radio FM tuner!  Pair all that with the fact that you can add up to 2GB additional memory and you have the perfect package.  The only thing I can say that kept my rating from being 100% is the fact that in music mode there is no Stop.  You can play and pause which i guess is plenty but stop would have made my smile a little bigger.  Other than that this is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone of any age!  Also, don't forget there are all kinds of cool accessories that go with it from silicone, leather, canvas and industrial rubber protective cases to Car transmitters and portable speaker docks.  Get yours NOW!

<Title>Great player, great value
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had an iPod, so I can't give you any insight there. But I did do my research, and this MP3 player delivers the most bang for the buck. It does it all, music, pictures, video, FM radio with radio record, even voice recording. You won't find all that in any other players this price. But my big question was, how will it work? Well after several weeks, this thing has worked perfectly!  The USB mode was a little tricky. After reading some reviews, I knew to change the mode to show up as a drive. The problem was, the music folder was hidden! I had to change my folder settings to "Show hidden files" but after that I had no problems whatsoever. I'm glad I don't have to use any programs to sync up, although I like having the option if I go that way one day.  The audio quality is great. The headphones that come with it aren't anything special. I've got some Shure E2s from my in-ear monitor system that I use, and those are great. But the headphones that came with it are perfect for work (isolation of the E2s: great for music, bad for jobs where you have to hear the phone ring!).  The construction is pretty good with one exception. The thumb wheel feels like it could break at some point, although I haven't had any problems yet. I've you've ever used and iPod touch wheel, this will take some getting used to. Other than that, it's a sleek looking unit, and the metal backing is quite nice. I take good care of my stuff anyway, and I definitely don't ever see this thing breaking.  All in all, I don't think you'll find a better player for the money. If you're thinking about buying an MP3 player and can escape the hype of the iPod, the Sansa is definitely the way to go!

<Title>Beats the iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>While I have only had the Sansa for a short time but already I have fallen in love with it.  It offers features not found on the iPod such as an FM radio, voice recorder (can also record radio programs/songs), and the battery can be replaced down the road.  I find moving between menus to be a snap.  The graphics are clear and easy to follow.  The roller is also simple to use with your thumb.  The sound quality is excellent and the in-ear headphones are comfortable.  The device is smaller than I expected and very light even when I have it in my pocket jogging.  The case is sturdy and great looking.  I've only placed two videos on it so far ('The Run' and 'Son of the run' for you Georgia Southern fans) but the software made it easy and the video plays great.  I've experienced none of the freezing others have mentioned. I have yet to record any voice, to me the radio record feature is much more useful.    Overall this is a great little gadget.

So i clean more.  I like it because it has enough memory for my music and his and we can just play our list so we don't have to keep skipping songs or erasing and adding songs.  This is the first mp3 player i've ever had so i can't say it is better than any other but i like it

<Title>This thing is the best there is, but it's not perfect
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player about a month ago after trying out several others and found it to be the best of them all. It's a great player with a lot of good features but it's not with out faults.  Here's the list:  Pros: - Flash memory (a must if you plan on going out - if you drop it, it wont break like a hard drive will) - Excellent scratch resistance on both sides - Great screen - video playback is good, but not perfect - photos look great - audio quality is great - microSD slot - i thought about getting another player to put more music on until i found this feature - up to an extra 1gb is great! - the wheel is nice for scrolling through songs - radio is awesome - voice recording is top notch - awesome battery life - 20 hours no kidding - two usb modes  Cons: - you have to charge it from the computer, so if you're on a trip and it dies too bad. - the usb cord is not normal, so if you lose it... you might be screwed - I keep it in my computer at all times so that wont happen - if your battery is not fully charged, a long video will run slow and out of sync with the audio so you get a japanese voice over effect - no dedicated volume buttons!!! - a dedicated recording button!? who needs that? - plus it gets pressed on accident a lot which is annoying. - start up is too long - the button layout, while getting props for being tactile and not touch, sucks.  The buttons are hard to reach because they're lower than the wheel.  So in a nutshell, this player kills all others in all aspects except for control and the occasional firmware bug.  I still wish it could have a click wheel like the ipod but its just a dream. oh well. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an mp3 player with a lot of features.

<Content>I have had horrible luck with MP3 players, this being my fourth one I believe. My last just kinda, flipped out on me. What I like about this one the most is the exoandable memory option. A plus if I ever run out of room for all my music =) I also like the screen, all my past MP3 players had very small screens, and only showed one color. Another thing I like is that fact I can play videos on it. I haven't tried it yet, but once I get around to learning how to convert them, I will. It's perfect for me =D I hope this one lasts >.&lt;

<Title>Very Solid MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a first rate MP3 player and I've been very happy with my purchase to date.  I primarily use the e250 for Music but have uploaded pictures as well..I've found that loading my pics onto the Sansa was actually quite simple, for either music or picture.  MP3 Player: Most of my music is in the MP3 format and encoded at 192 kps, my Sansa currently holds approximately 510 songs and could probably fit a few more onto it.    Playback is solid and I've been pleasantly surprised with the volume control, although I can definitely tell when a song encoded at 128 is played - volume is significantly reduced.  It's easy to switch from song to song; the player has a shuffle function that lets you shuffle by Album; Artist; All; Genre.  The screen is great, just large enough to easily view song title, album artist etc, but does not significantly drain or hinder battery life.  I would recommend purchasing a set of plastic screen savers.  You have to cut them down to fit the Sansa screen, but when the screen saver gets scratched up you can just pull the plastic off and put another one right on.  They cost about 9.99 for a set of 15.  As mentioned in previous posts, there are currently few accessories and it does not come with an armband, however I found one at BestBuy for 14.00 and it's been fine for me. Although I also agree that the USB only battery charger can be a bit of a drag, I have found a USB Battery Re-Charger.  You connect your USB connection to the accessory and it plugs into your electrical outlet.  It's worked fine for me and re-charges the Sansa in about 60 minutes.    If you don't want to purchase an iPod and convert all your music to the Apple DRM Format (if it's WMA), but you want to purchase a great looking, great sounding, windows compatible player.  This is it.

<Title>I loved it....until it stopped working correctly.
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, I bought this thing a bit more than 2 weeks ago....and for about 1 week, it worked just great (see "positive" reviews).  Then,  I wasn't able to add anymore songs to it.  It loaded up into the player thru the computer and showed up in the drive when plugged in but didnt show up on the songs/albums list.  Its like the song disappeared or was hidden somewhere.    So I took it back to the Best Buy where I bought it and the nice clerk told me that she ALWAYS saw this player returned (out of all the mp3 players).  She kindly told me this after I told her I wanted to exchange it for the same player.  I took her advice and took store credit cus I didnt think she'd lie for no reason.   SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  They may have some kinks to work out.  I suggest either buying something else now and trying some later models of this.  Sandisk may have rushed this to get it out into stores.

<Title>MP3 players are getting competitive
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player by sandisk is a sleek little player that has many good upsides in comparison to the ipod.  It's sturdy and has a good solid feel to it (not a cheap plastic feel).  Navigation of the device is easy and intuitive.  The scrolling circle that controls the menu and volume is easy to use but the buttons take a little longer to figure out with use.  The screen is a good size and the resolution is clear and the colors vibrant.  Battery life is good.  Volume to earphones is loud.  There are some drawbacks to this mp3 that I wish they could thought about before they released this model:  1)There is no separate power jack.  You have to charge it with the USB while attached to the computer.  Which can be a bad or good thing.  while transferring songs, the player charges at the same time but it'll be less convenient to find a USB jack to a computer.  2)Radio reception and automatic radio scan was not the most important engineering priority.  3)Forward and Reverse button that move you to the next song is too close to the scroll wheel making difficult for fat fingers to access.  4)There are equilizer options (rock, pop, hip hop, etc.) but no manual bass boost options.  5)Software support is not convenient to use as the ipod but it didn't take me long to upload my songs, pics, and video.  All in all I gave this player a rating of 4 stars.  It's a good player that I've enjoyed and I hope you will too (I juse hope I don't lose this one...).

<Title>Works great for one week
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received my E250 on christmas and was quite pleased with how it worked and the life of the charge-- until today, precisely one week since I first laid my grubby mitts on it. After loading it with music and leaving about 80mb to spare, I turned it off. I get to work tonight, turn it on, and this infernal machine informs me that I don't have enough free space left to build the database and that 6mb need to be freed. Even if the E250 provided a feature to delete music through the player itself (which it does not), it wouldn't matter because it won't show you any of the files. The files ARE there, of course, you're just not allowed to see them! I then tried to reconnect it to the computer to free up space, but the player didn't register on any USB connections unless it was in MSC mode. Too bad you have to be in MTP mode to have your removal noted by the player. I then went to SanDisk's website to update my firmware-- the only thing that needed updating wasa *manual*-- not software! I then downloaded the Sansa data recovery tool from SanDisk's website-- this tool refused to recognize the Sansa and told me to call customer support. I decided to cut my losses and do a hard reset of the player by following the instructions on the website-- holding down the reset button for 15 seconds. By the tone of this review, I'm sure you can figure out where I'm going with this. Right, no hard reset. Now I'm left with a worthless pile of cables and an equally worthless mp3 player that decided to BRICK ITSELF. I know I'm not alone with this sort of problem, either.  ---EDIT--- Called Sandisk tech support, and they were most helpful. They resolved my problem in under five minutes AND gave me tools to fix it myself if I ever have this problem again. Having nice, competent tech support goes a long way in raising the score, and I consider it a wonderful feature.

<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product and it got to my house today.  I opened it up and I found out that this product like way to many of the current mp3/ media players cannot play normal mp3s.  what I mean by normal mp3s is an mp3 gotten by putting the data from a cd on to your computer.  The only mp3s that it can support is ones that have the special permition encoding like ones bought online.  This product did not even deserve the star I gave it.  If you have a library of mp3s that is all bought online then this is the mp3 player for you.

These are really great except for the fact that everytime I try to put new music on...a little red box pops up on my MP3 player saying..."Synchronize to continue music subscription"...I don't really know what they mean...but being able to record off thine radio is truly a blessing! Blessed art thou, good Lord! So, back to the Sansa...the videos are good quality and the pics are fine! You keep your and I'll keep mine! (iPods are useless) The world revolves around my Sansa...on Mondays, that is. Walking home from school with sleek black earbuds tucked in your ears...a sleek black Sansa in your grasp...and the world couldn't be any better...unless you were sippin' on some Frangelico. (Imported from Italy) Frangelico. Sansa. Earbuds. Miami. This is what makes a good life... May all fellow Sansa owners share in my blessings! Amen to that!

<Content>This MP3 player was the best Christmas present for my child!!  For those who are unfamiliar with modern technology (me), I was able to pick it up & easily figure out how to use this little jukebox.  My little one, of course, immediately started sorting, rating & downloading music with absolute ease!  Good quality sound & video.  Perfect size - not too small; not too big!  I like the added feature of it having a recorder and the fact that it has expandable memory (via micro disk).  AND what I really loved was the price!!  It's worth every penny.  I think I'm going to get one for myself!!

<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I very much enjoy this MP3 player.  The sound quality is great, but obviously the screen is a little small to watch movies on.  The headphones are a little uncomfortable so I would suggest buying a better pair.

<Title>Buy it Now!
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this media player! I've had it for about three weeks now and it's been great. It's stylish, pretty durable, has great sound quality, and shows images vividly as well as video clips. I would advise to make sure you take the player off "hold" before you turn it on for the first time, as it gives you and scare and will say "system shutdown" and not resart again, until you hold down the on/off button for like 30 seconds to restart it. Other than that little scare, I've had no problems with it. Of course the earbuds are kinda crappy, but who uses earbuds anyway? Just get some headphones. This player is a great buy for the money. Go ahead and buy it now!

<Title>Nice price, but the firmware is shakey
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this unit as a low cost way to try out a "Playsforsure" player to use with the URGE music service.  The player has a lot of nice features for the price, however my enjoyment has been seriously curtailed by frequent lockups, and reboots of the player.  The record button is in a really horrible location on the side, which is very easy to inadvertently hit with your finger while you are listening to your music.  I have done this several times.  It wouldn't be so bad if it just went to recording and you could actually stop it, however more often than not the player will lockup if you start a recording while playing music.  You have to hold the power button for 10 secs or so to shutdown the player.  More recently however, my player started a reboot loop which it could not recover from.  Even after removal of the battery, and a reformat/reupgrade of the firmware the player still couldn't recover.  It is now on it's way back to SanDisk for exchange.  I think SanDisk could have a really decent product, but they really need to work the bugs of the software for the player.  An "appliance" like this should not lockup/reboot.

<Title>Sansa Wipes The floor w/ iPlod
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Sansa e250 (2GB) on Thursday August 10th, it arrived the very next day, and I've spent the last 2 days enjoying it!  Setup was a breeze, the sound is very good. (And I have trained audiophile ears, have worked in audio recording studios since the 80's.) I was actually quite surprised at how good the included earbud headphones were.     After charging the battery, the first thing I did was check out the  FM radio feature. Very nice. Easy to program presets.  Reception was excellent. My only beef would be that the order you insert your station presets, is how it will search them. There's no way to arrange them to go numerically up the frequency bandwidth from 88.1 to 108.      Later on I loaded up my first 60 or so songs in WMA & mp3 file formats.  A snap in the "drag & drop mode" .  One thing I must caution people of... Make sure all your meta-data is correct on your song files. I found one or two of my song files hadn't had all the meta-data filled in, so the Sansa player displays "track 8" instead of the song's title.  My fault, not the Sansa player.  All in all, the Sansa e250 is an amazing media player!  Great sound, plays all my music files, I'm not forced to buy songs from only one source, like Apple's iPod, ( I'd say this player wipes the floor with crud like the iPod Nano...) And this is about $50 cheaper than a 2GB Nano. which doesn't play WMA files, or video files, like the Sansa... It's really no contest! This is definitely the better player of the two!  The only way this could get better? On Thursday, I paid $137. on Amazon for it, on Friday, the price dropped to $120.   Oh well, still a better price than if I had  walked in to Best Buy.

<Title>beautiful unit, but....
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is a real nice unit. great features, but here are a few that bugged me. the recording button can be pressed by accident much too easily. it has an equalizer, but not a customizable one. the battery is rechargable & replacable. but not like the c & e-models. they use a AAA. just pop in a new one & you're good to go. plus, you can only recharge via usb. not that convenient if you ask me. the display is top notch. really nice. displays time, pic of the album, battery life, time of song played & time expired. also, it has a slot for mini sd cards for expandable memory. really nice feature there. but if you have a really LARGE library, i suggest something with large memory capacity like a creative zen. i've seen high as 30GB but be prepared to spend. good luck.

<Title>Sound and view screen are great, controls are horrible
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a sansa e250. I mainly use it to listen to FM radio or recorded talk programs (NPR etc.) The files I make are large, usually about 1.5 - 2 hours in length. Here is what I hate about my Sansa:  1. It takes 1 minute to advance 14 minutes into a recorded program. It takes over 4 minutes to scroll through an hour long program.  2. The fast forward and reverse buttons are really stiff. And since the fast forward is so slow your hand starts to cramp after holding the button down after 4 minutes or so (to get atleast 1 hour into the track)  3. The buttons are inaccurate and you have to hit the "sweet spot" just right to get them to function making this thing almost impossible to use while jogging or cutting the grass unless you stop and hold the thing with two hands.  4. The FM performance is marginal when compared to my 3 year old iAudio cw300. To get the best FM reception you have to attach the usb cord. Who wants to walk around with a usb cord hanging out?  I am going to ditch my e250 on eBay so now I am looking for a replacement. Here are qualities (ranked in order of importance) that I am looking for in a DAP:  1. Controls that are easy to use. 2. Fast forward that starts out slowly and then accelerates. 3. A screen that is easy to see. (I don't view pictures on this or watch movies so even a basic screen would be fine so long as it's easy to see) 4. Great FM reception 5. Decent battery life. 6. Bookmarking ability. 7. 1 gb or more. (preferably 2) 8. I would prefer that it have its own have a built in battery. 9. Ability to browse by folder.

<Title>Great MP3 player...
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great sounding player... and I like the features and screen. The memory size is a bit small... but, I don't think that I need more, having the ability to remove playlists and add new music. The expandable memory is a big plus. I can add more memory at anytime.   Some things that I wish this player had or was different. The headphones sound good but, are VERY uncomfortable. A user configurable EQ would be a nice addition to an already great player. Removing music from the player wasn't easy to do at first... you have to show hidden files and folders on your pc if you want to take off the songs that are preloaded.   It looks sleek and is not too small in your hand. I purchased this going on reviews I got from several reputable sources and have to say, so far, I am completely pleased. Picture resolution is really good for the size of the screen.

<Title>The way it mangae your files is a a PAIN
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It is the reading of this posts that brought me to buy this Sansa E250 player. I had it for more than two months, here is what I found.  This player can't organize your data in folders. While plugging into the computers, you can save songs in different folder, but when it is plugged out, then all the songs were listed alphabetically, just imagine how annoying it is to scroll down 150 songs to picking up the one you want to play. You can use the function of album, however, it won't work as you expect. Some albums will not show up. If you delete an album, it will still be shown on the window, and it has one song left there, but that song just has a name, can't be played, I call them ghost files, very annoying. I am not able to view those ghost files even you select to show the hidden files after conneced to a computer.  The payer was dead once, I hold the menu bottom for a long time to restart, fortunately it worked.  The ear bud is uncomfortable, with mediocre sound quality. The rubber ring of the ear bud is easy to fall off.  Reviewing and moving forward is also a pain. If you want to go back to listen to some segment again, it is very inconvenient. If you go fast forward, most probably it jumps to the next song. The speed to review back or go forward varies from time to time, not sure how to control it. Not good to listen to books on cd.  The FM radio works along the lakeshore drive in Chicago, but not while crossing the downtown streets or in Naperville that is 40 miles away from Chicago.  Do I recommend this to my friend, No. The way it manages your files is such a pain.  I have used 4 mp3 player before coming to this one.

<Title>Firmware Issues
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Watch out -- this player's firmware does not, at this time, support the playing of Audible Audio Books.  Sandisk has in the past eventually provided firmware upgrades for their other players to support AA format, but have not yet done so for this one.  So, it is a real pain if you buy this player with using Audible in mind.  (There are file coverters and splitters out there, but the legality is doubtful and it is a real inconvenience.)  Another problem is that the Sansa seems to be confused about rights management.  It won't play some music that I have downloaded from MusicMatch over a year ago.  Media Player does so, and says that I have unlimited rights to the music.  (It is not subscription music.)  But Sansa says that I have to "synchronize" to get them to play.  No matter how many times I do so, it still won't play.  Otherwise, it is a pretty good device.  The spinning, glowing dial is pretty cool, but its movement feels a little bit rough/cheap.    For some reason, when you try to view the Sansa's directory structure on your PC, when connected by USB, the "MUSIC" folder is hidden, even though the other folders (Vid, Photos, etc) are visible.  Have to adjust your folder properties to see it and thus to copy music into it manually.  So, I'd suggest that this thing is too quirky.  Wait six months or a year for better firmware.
