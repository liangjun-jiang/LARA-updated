<Title>Don't Bother with the FM
<Date>Thu Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>FM TUNER (UPDATE #2) I sent my Rio back for a refund.  The unit consistently shuts itself down whenever I press a button.  This started happening after a couple of weeks and Rio said the contacts weren't making good contact.  Rio support fixed the problem when they fixed the FM problems, so I thought it was specific to just my unit.  After hearing so many others complain about this problem, plus it has begun occuring again in my unit, I think people ought to know about it.  The same issues have been stated concerning the 256MB version.  (UPDATE) -- Rio fixed their FM problems by adding a capacitor to the unit.  The FM tuner is now acceptable, pulling in almost as many stations as the IRiver ifp-790 I compared it to.  I would say the Rio, with the fix, is about 90% as good as the IRiver FM tuner.  (PREVIOUS) The FM tuner sucks. Sorry there is no other way of putting it. I went into the top floor of my house and compared it to my clock radio. I am about 25 miles outside Albany NY and the clock radio pulled in 12 FM stations very clearly. The Forge pulled in 3 stations clearly, the other 9 were so weak they were unlistenable. When the backlight is on, these 3 stations are unlistenable until it goes off. To top that off, once going downstairs and outside for a run, the Forge pulled in ZERO stations clearly. That's right, when I go for a run I can not listen to ANY FM stations, without loads of static.  I brought the Forge to work with me (downtown Albany), and the FM tuner pulls in 6 stations very clearly. I took it around the block and the 6 stations all stayed clear. It seems that if you are close to a big city, live in a big city, or are near an FM tower, you should be fine with the Forge FM tuner, otherwise pretend like the FM tuner doesn't exist.  Memory Clearly the 128 MB version is not big enough and I will soon be getting a 1GB SD card. This option is what is keeping me from returning the Forge. The IRiver doesn't have the expandable memory and unless you want to keep running to your computer every day to reload playlists, you need a lot of memory.  Playback Very good. Quality is excellent, even at the lowest sampling rates.  Headphones Definite thumbs down. They fell out twice while doing my 5 mile run. Let me clarify, the headphone for my right ear fell out twice, the left stayed nicely in. The slightest tug is enough to slowly move the earphones out of position. Another 12" of cord might alleviate this problem. Regardless of their quality (which is so-so), they must be replaced.  StopWatch This is why I bought the Forge. Well it's OK, but the lap counter only shows the last two laps you completed, and I haven't figured out how, if there is a way, to view previous lap times. Then I noticed if you take out the headphones from the player ( I did this when the cord got tangled) the stopwatch stops. In fact the whole Forge stopped - its as though the headphones are wired to the power and the player shuts down when the headphones are removed (this royally screwed up my time, but I won't do it again).  It also sucks because while the StopWatch is running and you go to player mode, if you touch the lap counter, it doesn't work - you HAVE to be in StopWatch mode. This is a royal pain because in StopWatch mode you can't skip to the next song, so you have to keep switching back and forth.  Software Clearly excellent. Installed without any problems, easily recognized my Forge and rips CD's with speed. I set up my playlists in no time at all, and selecting artists/albums/playlists is very easy. The RIO engineers got this right.  ArmBand It's OK. I wanted to put the armband on my wrist so it was easier to view, but the armband isn't designed for such a small circumference and it must go on my upper arm. Body builders will have no problem putting this on their wrist.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, the beltclip must go into the ArmBand to hold the player. Neither the booklet that came with the RIO or the 64 page PDF manual has a SINGLE word about how to use the beltclip or the armband. Big, stupid ommission from the RIO technical writers.  Durability Player appears to be well built. I'm not concerned about it's long term durability but I will post back if the player has problems over the coming months.  Conclusion It's an OK player. When (if?) IRiver comes out with a stopwatch and expandable memory, I will EBay my RIO.

<Title>Doesn't work anymore
<Date>Tue Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Memory: I put in a 512M SD card and with the 128M internal, that's plenty for me.  Playback:  Good user interface, great sound, easy to use.  Headphones:  Sound great, stay in place, I don't even feel them while I'm mountainbiking.  FM:  Works great for me, I live about 20 miles outside Albuquerque, NM  Reliability:  Terrible.  I have had this unit for four weeks.  While downloading music, it turned off.  It will not turn back on.  Customer Service:  Worst I have ever seen.  I called multiple times, they had me fax my receipt three times, I have emailed six times, and I still don't have an RMA number so I can return the unit.  At this rate, the 90 day warranty will run out before I can return it.  I'll probably just end up having to buy another MP3 player and I'll be out $120.  Conclusion:  I wouldn't wish this MP3 player on my worst enemies.

<Title>Do not buy! Serious design flaws, poor reliability & service
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the old version of this product (the Cali) and was pretty happy with it, so when it was stolen I groaned but purchased the "latest and greatest."  There is a serious design flaw in this player.  A very slight tap will cause it to turn itself off.  The spring on one side of the battery isn't strong enough to keep a proper connection with the other terminal.  Gym use will easily trigger this behavior.  Google it or check out rioworld.org (which also has a serious contingent of rio apologists.)  It is well known.  I wish I'd checked amazon before purchasing this product.  Literally a few days after the one month limit for a cash return my forge completely stopped working.  I spent 60 minutes on hold today talking to customer service.  It's very disappointing & if it weren't $100+ I'd have to just write it off as a learning experience.  I may still need to because in my time with customer service I have 2 "case numbers" & two promises to get back to me.

<Title>Works great
<Date>Tue Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Let me preface this by saying I bought the Rio Forge for running and working out.  I've owed it for almost two weeks now and I can't see any problems.  I bought the Rio Forge sololy for the purpose of playing MP3s and none of the other features that it has.  I have a watch I use to keep track of my times so I don't need the stopwatch feature.  I don't plan on listening to the radio while I run either, so I don't use the FM tuner.  However, I have turned it on just to check it out and it works okay.  The headphones fit great, the armband keeps the player snug on my arm when running, and the sound quality is superb.  The user interface on the MP3 player is very clean and easy to use.  I have not noticed any of the problems other reviewers have talked about.  My Rio Forge doesn't turn off with a slight tap, nor has it stopped working.  I would recommend this MP3 player if you are looking for a good MP3 player that one can use while running or working out.

<Title>Ack
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>For Christmas I roderered this for my Mom, at first I loved it. She used her S35s (very nice for its time) until it had a meeting with pavement, skidding it 30 feet into oblivion. However, I open the unit it works, the FM tuner could use some work but its probably OK for running. The headphones are good, but they do fall out lots.  However, I thought I was sold on this unit until is suddenly stopped working on the same night I purchased the unit. Rio has not respinded to any of my support claims yet.

<Title>Wonderful
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the Rio Forge player for personal use. I needed something that would not skip. I have had it for over 2 months now and have not had any trouble with it at all. The tracks play fine, the FM tuner has clear reception and can play all of my favorite stations, the USB 2.0 transfer has no problems, the structure of the device is nearly flawless, the headphones have beautiful sound and fit comfortably, it's easy to use, and is very good for its price. The only drawback I have found is that the software that comes with it gives me an error every time I try to load too much music(let the software load too much music from my computer). I have Windows Media Player 10 which has a device sync, so it all works out. Overall the player has great quality and was a great buy.

<Title>Easy to use, good for MP3s, makes nice gift... FM is useless
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>** REPOSTING January 4, 2007:  I posted this review in December 31, 2004 and it somehow got deleted by accident.  Am re-posting mainly for FYI with an update below regarding the crash issues.  I've been playing with the Forge for the past 1-2 months now and overall I'm fairly content, although it could be better. I've also had a chance, recently, to try out the Sandisk player for a bit, so I'll throw in a few comparisons for now, until I get the chance to write a full review on that one.  Main things I was looking for: - USB 2.0 for fast transfers... don't settle for USB 1.1 devices at this stage. Even if your current computer does not support USB 2.0, you might want to download some music at a friend's comp that does... and your next computer will certainly support it. - USB Mass Storage Device any USB-enabled computer will read the Forge's memory as just another drive, when connected. No special software is required to transfer your files, although you can always use your favorite music software to transfer your music. - Flash-based My main purpose for this MP3 player is for the gym and snowboarding, so I didn't feel like risking any impact-damage to a microdrive-based player. Flash-based media has no moving parts and makes it ideal for any sort of activity. You can get various opinions on this topic, but this is mine. :) - FM tuner it's always nice to have an alternative to your own music, from time to time. Also, some gyms broadcast TV audio on a short-range FM signal, so it's handy for those situations. Why Apple never added an FM tuner to their iPods, I'll never know.  So on to the Forge...  First off, everything people have been saying about the FM tuner is true. It's horrible. I can pick up one station pretty clearly... sometimes... maybe... but that's about it. Static galore. If an FM tuner is important to you, don't even bother with the Rio Forge.  However, loading and playing music couldn't be simpler. I was up and running in a matter of minutes. You can load the player by simply dragging and dropping files onto Rio or via Windows Media Player, the included Rio software, or your favorite music program.  Playing your music is just as easy. The easy on-screen interface is intuitive, simple, and loaded with features. The player indexes all your tracks by Album, Artist, Genre, Track title, Year, and when you added it (to play newly added music), so it makes accessing your music a breeze. You can use any program to create your own playlists as M3U files and drop them onto the filesystem. You cannot create playlists on the player itself.  My one pet peeve about the playback system is that when you select "Play All", it typically plays all tracks in alphabetical order, based on the track title tag. If you play back an album, however, it does play the tracks in order, although I'm not sure if this is due to the filename convention or the track number tag info. For the most part, however, I turn on shuffle so it doesn't affect me too much.  Physically, the display is nice and large and is beautifully backlit by white light behind black LCD text, making the text very easy to read, compared to some other players with colored LCD backgrounds. The plastic bubble covering the LCD, however, is another story. Due to it's form, it pretty much picks up reflections from all angles, somewhat negating the nice readability of the white backlight. Perhaps it seemed like a really pretty idea when they designed it, but it really should have been flat to reduce reflections.  Another gripe is the mini-USB jack cover. It's basically a little rubbery plug which has to be completely separated from the player in order to insert the USB plug. I know that someday I will lose this little piece and I will curse the day. I have a similar gripe about the battery cover, which also completely separates from the case.  Wearability-wise, the Rio compes packaged with a little plastic clip that wraps around the player, which then in turn can clip onto the included elastic armband. I think they called the plastic clip a "beltclip", but if they did, it is a total misnomer, because the metal clip portion won't clip onto most belts. Although the clip could be stretched a tad bit, I usually end up just clipping it to a pocket or a beltloop. But it certainly won't clip around a leather belt, for example.  In terms of durability, the player feels a bit fragile. Overall, it feels like there is a lot of hollow space within the casing, making me wonder if it will crack into pieces if I ever drop it. The black rubber in the design is more decorational than anything. Don't let it fool you into thinking that's it's any more shock resistant because of the black rubber areas.  Sound quality is pretty good. I'm not terribly impressed by it, but I'm not disappointed either. The included earbuds are actually also quite nice as well. They are rubber wraparounds which keep them firmly stuck to my ears regardless of any sort of movement and sound pretty good. But then again, you shouldn't be buying any sort of player based on the headphones anyways, so if you don't like them, just get your own pair and be happy.  Battery-life is decent. Obviously this depends largely on how you use your player. I use it on the average of 1-3 hours a day and a single AAA battery usually lasts me a little under a week. Some tips: 1) turn backlighting off or set to the minimum setting 2sec 2) power save to 1min (the shortest setting) 3) when not in use and it's powered off, slide on the lock, so it doesn't get turned on by accident  Memory-wise, 128MB certainly is not enough for anything, in my opinion. I immediately went out and bought a 1GB SD card. Expandability wasn't much of factor foe me, because I was looking around the 1GB capacity range anyways. The only reason I picked the 128MB Rio is because it was cheaper and I knew I'd be buying a 1GB card along with it. With 1GB+128MB onboard, my player currently holds around 230 MP3s encoded at 128kbps.  However, it is this expandability that makes this player an excellent gift idea. Assuming you're on a budget, you can get them a fairly well featured (and popular) MP3 player for an affordable price and still leave the recipient room to expand the player's memory on their own, somewhere down the road.  My quick wrap-up of the Rio Forge: PROS: - ease of use, intuitive on-screen interface with lots of features - large display with white backlighting make for easy reading - good sound quality - player reads and indexes tag information - USB 2.0 - decent speeds.. not the fastest, but still better than USB 1.1 - USB Mass Storage Device - use your player as a storage device and transport any kind of file you want to  CONS: - crappy FM Tuner - USB jack cover is easily lost  now for my mini-comparison with the Sandisk 1GB MP3 player... Physically, the Sandisk does a lot more right than the Rio. Its USB jack is concealed by a rubber cover which still will remain attached on one edge, so chances of losing it are lower. The same goes for the battery compartment cover, which slides over and then hangs on a hinge.  The player's cigarette-lighter shape fits into a transparent latex sleeve, which adds a little padding and protection to the player. As a whole, it feels more solid than the Rio. And although I won't be putting it to the test any time soon (on purpose), it feels like it could handle a drop much better than the Rio.  FM Tuner on the Sandisk is excellent. Then again, anything is better than Rio's tuner, including my aging alarm clock/radio. But the Sandisk really picks up stations quite well and quite clearly. After the Rio, I was beginning to think that most small players would have problems with their FM tuners, but the Sandisk proved me wrong.  The Sandisk also seemed to transfer files faster than my Rio, although I need to do some more accurate benchmarks.  So I bet you're thinking now... well, the Sandisk sounds perfect! Well... some things that I didn't much like about the Sandisk: 1) blue backlit LCD I really like the white backlighting of the Rio. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I find myself squinting at the Sandisk. The display on the Rio is much easier to read due to the backlight, the screen size, as well as the overall layout 2) clunky interface while definitely still usable, the interface is nowhere near as slick as the Rio. Navigation is strictly by folders and not by tag info and menus are incredibly confusing to navigate when you first start using it, although you get used to it eventually. If you're getting a player for someone else, consider the type of person that you're buying for.  But I'll save my full Sandisk review for another day after I've had more time to play with it.  Overall, I like the Rio as a good middle-of-the-road MP3 player, as long as you ignore the FM tuner. Its main strength is great user interface and ease of use and is perfect for beginners and people who don't like to read manuals. Design-wise, I think there is still some room left for improvement, but for the most part, I'm happy with it.  ***UPDATE*** Since I'm re-posting my previous review, I may as well add a few tips from having used the Rio for over a year now...  RANDOM RESETS I see a lot of other reviewers mentioning this type of problem, and while I can't really speak for their situation, my reset problems were resolved by updating to the latest firmware v1.33 from SonicBlue's website.  Originally, I also thought that the resets may have been caused by a loose battery or random bump.  However, in my case the reboots were caused by "bad" characters in the filename, since it would consistently crash for specific songs.  (my particular case was it didn't like parentheses in some of my filenames for some reason).  My short-term fix was to rename any files that were crashing.  However, once I upgraded my firmware to v1.33, I had no more crash issues.  The release notes for previous firmware releases also mention that some crashes were caused by using the Rio Music Manager to load the Rio Forge.  If you're still having reset issues, try upgrading your firmware and not using the Rio Music Manager to load your music.  Personally, I just drag'n drop files into the Rio folder.  FORMAT YOUR SD CARD I upgraded to a 2GB Sandisk SD memory card with no issues.  The only issues I ran into were caused by myself, when I started loading the card with music without formatting the card first.  Windows had no problems in letting me do this.  I loaded it by plugging the SD card into a multi-card reader and then inserted the card into the Rio.  Upon bootup, the Rio would freeze while reading the card.  Once I formatted the card and started over, everything was fine.  RIO STUCK AT POWERUP Prior to updating my firmware, I would sometimes run into this problem after encountering a crash.  I was usually able to recover by pulling the battery AND the SD card, waiting around 60 seconds and then re-inserting and powering up.  Pulling the battery alone for some reason wasn't always enough.  I had to remove the SD card as well.  Personally, although some of these issues irked me, at least in my case, all my problems were fixed by the firmware update.  The fact that I was able to extend the Rio's lifespan by getting a new SD card was also a nice plus.  Once the 8GB SDHC cards come down in price some more, I'm hoping they will continue to work as well.  Overall, it is rather disappointing that the Rio had all these bugs, but I would encourage anyone still having problems to upgrade your firmware, if it's not up to date.  Perhaps that might fix your issues as well.  Hope this helps.

<Content>Updated Feb 9, 2005. I got my replacement and it seemd to go good for about 2 weeks and now my player has just stopped from working.  This thing is a huge piece of junk.  And who wants to pay 6 bucks everytime to see if they can get one that works actually right.  PLEASE PLEASE FOR PEAT SAKES AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Luckily Amazon rocks and gave me a full refund  *************** I guess you could say that I dont' like to beleive other people.  Even though I red the reviews on the site about it being a bad player I went a head and ordered one after reading the review on CNET.  I figured that the problems here could have just been a freak of nature and usually there is a defective one of everything.  Well let me tell ya there are a lot more with this player.  I got mine and got excited and opened it up.  I put the battery in the unit and tried to turn it on.  My player just keeps on trying to turn itself on and turns itself right back off after the screen flashes on.  I'm having another one sent to me so I'll post the new review after I get it but do me a favor and spend a littl more and get a better player.
