<Content>I bought this Mp3 for my daughter for Xmas - not wanting to spend alot because of her age (12)- after ONE WEEK it wouldn't hold a charge, would not power down completely, and had to be reset every time we wanted to do ANYTHING with it!!!!  Not worth the problems!!!!!

<Title>A good little unit

<Content>for the price.  My husband bought this for me from Walgreens when it was on sale.  It's easy to use, although a mite sensitive.  The headphones look like stethoscope ends and are too bulky to use comfortably.  The unit is a perfect match for Windows Media player (make sure you have version 11, with the patches provided on the Microsoft website), and syncing the music from the media player to the MP3 player is quick and easy.  I get barely 8 hours of continuous play, but that's long enough for work.  The sound quality is excellent, and you can fit a heck of a lot of songs on the 1.9 gig (not the 2 gig that's on the package) memory.  All in all, for the price, I found the unit to be worth the money.
