<Title>not worth it
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: cheap, uses SD card, AAA battery, good battery door (the door is not an electrode), button control not a joystick (I can never remember where things are under the stick, old age!), has a hold button.  Here are the unforgivable cons (in my opinion): only plays continuously in serial or with one repeat A-B without remembering where it left off, not even shuffle, EQ mode is horrible the only mode that is bearable is mp3 (this is on an excellent aiwa headphone), displays track number and time left of that track - not even the track name, the button controls are good but they are on the opposite side of the SD card slot hence pressure on the buttons and counter pressure on the card when you push...  This one is not as good as another cheap simple player by JWIN which has all practical functions and sounds good except for the joy stick and battery door seems to want to burst at anytime...  So still I am looking for a perfectly simple digital player...

<Title>Basic MP3 player
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this device for my 6yo daughter.  Nice, basic design.  Uses SD card for MP3 storage.  Card is on a spring lock, so sometimes the card gets ejected by pushing on it, but not a huge deal.  Interface is very basic.  LED display (omg do they still make this type of screen?).  Can only play songs by order they were placed on the SD card.  (i.e. Track 001, 002, 003), no recognition of song name or tag information.  Again, it is a very basic, cheap MP3 player.  My daughter loves it and knows exactly which track has her HSM2 soundtrack, so that's all that matters.  Worth the money (because it's dirt cheap), but personally I couldn't use it or even compare it to an iPod, iRiver or Creative type of device.

<Title>Go with something else
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for a camping trip because it was cheap and I had and SD card already. For the camping trip, it was fine, but I do not want it to be my permanent MP3 Player.   The device is fairly flashy, and very tiny and lightweight. It's about as tall as two SD cards, a little bit wider than an SD card is tall, and maybe as thick as a deck of cards.  The earphones it comes with are strangely shaped and colored, but oh well, it's not a big deal. They were fine quality at first, but started crackling and died after only a week.  The player has an annoying little feature that fades the music in when a song starts. If the artist intended for that effect, the song would already be like that. I don't want my player to add it's own little effects into my music. I will admit, though, that after several weeks i didn't really notice the fade, so give it some time and you might get used to it.  The other sound feature it has is a short little beep between each song that varies in tone by directory the file is in. This is fine and you may not even hear it if the volume is low, but for some reason on a couple specific songs, the tone lasts for 8 seconds. I don't know what is is about the two songs it does this for, but I wish it didn't.  After a few weeks, in the middle of songs at random times (maybe once every few songs) it would make a cracking noise that was quite loud, obnoxious, and actually hurts my ears. It went away for a while, but recently came back for no particular reason.  The interface is simple, but a little too short of features for my preference. You can skip back and fourth through your songs, up and down the volume, set the equalizer, play/pause/stop, and use that A-B repeat feature, which I only ever found useful for listening to ambient rain or ocean waves continuously. You cannot, however, fast forward or rewind to a specific spot in a song, which really surprised me (in a bad way).  One issue I never got to the bottom of was the shuffle mode. I can set it to normal, repeat song, and repeat entire card, but not shuffle. I know the shuffle mode is there, because if I look at the screen at an angle I can see it next to the repeat mode. The user manual says nothing at all about the shuffle mode, so I just have to live without that feature.  One major problem is that the player puts the songs into whatever order it wants. You can put the MP3's into folders and they will stay grouped, but the folders are in a random order. It seems like the player puts the songs in the order that you put them on the card from your computer, but if I try to rearrange them by putting them back on the card one at a time in my preferred order, it doesn't keep them in that line. Most of the time it will put the songs in an album in their normal order, but sometimes it doesn't.  The single biggest complaint i have with this device is that every time you start it up it's like you have just turned it on for the first time. It's volume goes back to the default level, as does the equalizer, and it goes back to the first song on your card. if you only have one or two albums this might be fine, but with 250+ songs like me, it's an absolute pain to go to a specific song.  I would recommend a 42 piece AAA battery pack with this purchase, as it runs through batteries like crazy. One battery lasts me just under a week, and I have picked up the habit of always carrying a spare with me. It can get rather infuriating when you just spent two minutes searching through your songs for a specific one, only to have the battery go out, forcing you to spend another two minutes finding the song over.  Finally, After about 5 months, it is starting to die. The cracking noise that I mentioned above has come back, and the screen is starting to go out. It has three digit spots for volume or song number, and the second digit now turns into a random assortment of lines or doesn't display anything at all.  I would highly recommend going with something else. It is cheap, but even for less you can do better. If you must have it, be prepared to buy something better soon.
