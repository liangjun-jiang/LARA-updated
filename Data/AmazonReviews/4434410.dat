<Title>GREAT MP3 player!!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had one of these for 10 months and I love it! I use it often and it has never given me any problems! Great sound and user friendly. My daughter has an ipod. Although the Zen Nano I have is not as powerful, I still prefer it. If you don't want to shuck out the money for an ipod, don't buy one of the cheap MP3 players. I would highly reccommend the Zen Nano!

<Title>Great  MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for well over a year and still love it. I have taken it boating, camping, shopping, bike riding, hiking, and it still works. I also have gotten it wet twice. I am rough on things, as you can see. I liked it so much, I bought one for my husband and daughter.  It has all the features more expensive MP3 players have, except bigger screen, but cost a lot less. My daughter likes the radio. I just like to take mine shopping so I can ignore all the "Mom, can I get...".My husband uses his at work, and enjoys having all his music. I would reccomend it. It is a great buy.

<Title>My new best friend, but for how long?
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this about 2 weeks now, and I'm really happy with it.  I was able to use all the advertised features within minutes of opening it up.  I also downloaded all my music using the drag-and-drop feature which is a must-have if you don't want some proprietary software converting all your files and then deleting them (I've had this happen!)  Most of the files I have are ripped from CD using software for the Zen Stone since I had some problems finding anything simple for the Zen Nano Plus. The radio is better than the one in my car, and recording both the radio and lectures is very straightforward.  There's only one minor problem with this player (for the price) and that's it's shoddy case.  Don't get me wrong, it's the right size and heft, but within one day the plastic crevices were caked in dust and it looked like the two halves are trying their hardest to split apart.  I might have to duck tape it together because I want this player to last me at least a couple years.

<Title>Few complaints for this economic MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my Zen Nano over a year ago from an overstock-type site for around 35 dollars.  I can't recall exactly but it may have been an open-box return, which might explain the only problem I have had with it (see below).  Having tried other zen players, an old Muvo flash-drive player, and after sampling several different ipods, I have found this to be the best option, as well as the cheapest. The functionality is something unrivaled in most players I've tried.  It includes line-in recording so that you don't actually need a computer to load it.  An FM tuner, with admittedly limited reception, works in a pinch if I need to walk to the store in the middle of a football game.  It has a small microphone that is useful for note-taking, though not much else. These lesser functions are somewhat basic but do not detract from its main function of music playback, which works excellently.  The sound quality is every bit as good as any player I've tried, as long as you are willing to pay out for some more expensive earbuds(sony EX51s are nice but break relatively quickly) than the ones included, which are the same quality as the tinny pieces of junk you would get with an ipod. The player's operating softare includes playlist organization, mp3 encoding (which I've never used), and even a basic equalizer with presets which helps when I change audio inputs from my over-bassed Koss Sparkplug earbuds to my home stereo. I should note that some have complained that there is no gapless playback on this player, which is true although I'm not even sure gapless playback is possible with Mp3s, as they don't usually contain that sort of information (I could be wrong). The interface may provide some problems for those who are less familiar with computers like the elderly or perhaps those who simply don't have the dexterity for smallish buttons (for instance: the very very obese) but I found the interface perfectly comprehensible and transparent, including a faux-scroll wheel, an on/off/play/pause button, and two dedicated volume buttons. The only problem I have found with the player, which may be because I did not buy it new, is that the battery case cover on mine broke fairly soon after I bought it, making it very easy for it to fall off in my pocket.  This is not a huge problem, as it comes with a belt-clip plastic case I can put over it, preventing the battery from falling out.  The downside is that it increases the size of the player by about a third, but this is minimal in my opinion as the player is already a little smaller than the average disposable cigarette lighter. For what I paid for this player, I would still be happy with my purchase if it died completely tomorrow.  It outlasted the more expensive earbuds I purchased for it, and if you are willing to pay the extra money it costs at Amazon, you can return it for a new one if it is DOA, as plenty of electronics are.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I mainly got for listening to audio books and lectures. It plays well and has a long battery life. I haven't had any problems with the device.  The things I don't like are the ear pieces, which are definitely too big, and the fact that it is hard to navigate through the different audio files on the player. And, for some reason, when I download a book consisting of several chapters, it jumbles up the chapters on the player. I need to go back and put them in order with the firmware before detaching it from the pc, so if I forget to do it and take off with my player, I'm screwed as it would be very difficult to locate the chapters in sequence when I am away from my computer.   The above are little gripes that I can live with, ergo the 4 stars.  So, I'd recommend it. For the money, definitely worth it. Hope this helps.

<Title>30+ Albums on 1Gb Nano Plus
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really, really like this Nano. It is small, the file transfer is easy and fast, the sound is great (I have a high end hi-fi, yet am happy to use the lower bit rates to fit on more songs when I travel, 30+ Albums at 64Kb WMA). The battery life is good and I personally really like being able to change batteries half way though a trip away from home or at the office, without having to worry about a charger.   Things are a few things that annoyed me slightly. There is always a small gap and click between songs. It is also difficult to set the record levels when using the 'line in' facility to get a decent volume, yet avoid quite bad distortion.   Overall I highly recommend the Nano Player

<Title>Great player for jogging
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to use a bulky mp3 cd player on my jogs.  After researching mp3 players and what I wanted to use them for, I decided on the zen nano plus.  Apple's equivilent would be the Shuffle, NOT the ipod nano as MANY misunderstand.  Here's why this player beats the shuffle in so many ways: -Price -FM Radio + radio recording! -Built in mic and line-in recording to mp3!  (96,128,192kbps selectable rates) -A DISPLAY -a BACKLIT display -Preset & Customizable EQ -Removable battery (AAA) -Does shuffle come with belt clip/arm band? (really, i don't know) -Mass storage device when plugged into USB. -MS Plays for Sure -Using WMP 10 and Sync, it auto-creates artist/album folders on the device. -About half the size of a pack of Big Red gum (it is really small)   Shuffle pros: Itunes (which i love, but WMP is catching up).

<Title>There are better options
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a Sandisk 1G MP3 player and I am pretty satisfied with it. I got it for five dollars less than this, and though I have returned it twice--once for a better price and once because the headphones shorted out--I think it's better than Creative Zen, which my friend owns. Hers has tiny buttons and an inefficient scroll wheel. If you're looking for a well-priced, easy to use mp3 player, go with the Sandisk m240 models.

<Title>Do NOT buy creative Zen nano
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one a couple of weeks ago on amazon and got a very very bad experience with creative zen nano. I had one sandisk e240 before and I have been using it for more than 6 months and I got no problem with it at all. It still looks like brand-new. Since my wife wants to have one mp3, I though we should try a different brand and then bought one creative zen nano. Nighmare follows. Zen nano is really like a small cheap gadget. The cons from my experience are 1) The battery cover broke within only two weeks.  2) The surface is easily scratchable.  3) No sleep timer included. 4) The lock function is build-in within the software, instead of a direct mechnical switch like in Sandisk. 5) The LCD window is too small. 6) The sound of pressing buttons is too loud and sounds like cheap toys.  A lot of people mention that the custom service of creative is very bad. This is not case for sandisk. The first mp3 I have is sandisk 1gb mp3 player (not e240 series). The firmware brokes once; I just send it back to sandisk and got replacement within 2 weeks without paying any fees. Although both brands are made in China, Sandisk obvisouly has much better design and quality control.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had an I-Pod shuffle and this is so much better!!!  You pay less for it and you get a voice recorder and fm tuner.  I also like the drag and drop ease of moving files to this player.  I-tunes is okay but I work on many different computers and I don't like having to install I-tunes all of the time.  Don't forget that this doubles as a flash drive too!  If you like a lot of bells and whistles as far as buttons go, do not buy this product.  There is one button that turns the player on/off, plays/pause.  Then there is a volume up button and volume down.  The only other thing is a scroll wheel that navigates through songs and the menu.  This is a very tiny player!  Also, do be careful with the battery cover.  It is small and can break.  I haven't had a problem but I have been careful with it.  All in all I love it!

<Title>Great little player for the price
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of online research before I purchased an MP3 player.  I was initially going to buy a SanDisk e200, but the store didn't stock it.  The salesman convinced me this little Zen Nano for 1/3 the price of the SanDisk would be very user friendly.  He was so right!  I was ripping songs from my CD's in no time after loading the software. I only want some music (FM radio on here is great, too!) and don't want to carry around a big CD player.  Don't care that there's no color LCD screen with pictures.  Highly recommended if you're just looking for something small to hold lots of music.  Sound is great, but might buy different eye buds...these are a little large.  I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a player with with features I don't really need.

<Title>Just what I wanted!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first digital player, and I love it.  I have had ZERO problems with it in the first three weeks or so of owning it, and have never opened the manual or installed any software.  I am able to download music from my PC, and books from NetLibrary with no problems.  I have also stored a bit of data on it with no ill effects.  The FM radio receiver is as good as that in my CD player--receives most stations as long as the headphone cable is extended.  Battery life seems fine to me (listened to an entire book, plus music and FM on the included Duracell). I can't vouch for the headphones, as I bought in-ear passive noise-reducing phones to go with it.

<Title>Decent mp3 player for the price!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Today I received my Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus 1GB.  I decided to purchase an mp3 player because I work out at the gym and was tired of running with a bulky cd player that skipped if I didn't hold it while running.  So, I started looking at mp3 players.  I am a big music person and have well over 12,000 files of mp3s on my home computer.  It seemed I would have to buy a costly mp3 just to hold a good portion of my collection on an mp3 player.  I checked out the Ipods, Sandisk and Creative Labs mp3 players.  I did A TON OF RESEARCH ON THESE PRODUCTS.  The end result?  There are bad experiences from reviewers with each brand and every model.  I decided to not throw away hundreds of dollars on a piece of techology that would potentially have an issue.  If you don't care about playing and watching video but just want a compact mp3 player to listen to a handful of music albums on -- this one seems to be the best.  I tried it out in the gym today and it was great.  It is the size and weight of a tiny package of gum (the kind with 5 pieces).  I held it in my hand while running since I don't trust technology to be dangling off my body, however, this one does come with an armband and waist clip!    Pros: +Comes with waist clip, armband, basic headphones, line-in cable, and usb cable. +Lightweight, has screen with optional backlight. +COST!  Save yourself some money! +Customer Service (I called with a question and was put on with a live body in minutes!) +FM Radio +Record audio!  Cons: -For working out, there is a lot of extra cord on the headphones. -Directions.  The set of directions that comes with this is really poor.  It gives no real direction on how to work the software and vague in some areas with how to use it.  I figured out everything through trial and error. -The case that it comes with doesn't actually cover the screen, which stinks because I don't want to worry about scratching it!   In summary, I couldn't find one mp3 player that didn't have an unhappy bunch reviewing each brand and model.  This one is working out so far.  If there isn't a great flawless mp3 player on the market then why waste so much money on an Ipod?  (I didn't talk about spec's in this review because you can learn that from Amazon's description.  You read reviews to read others experiences.)

<Title>Very Reliable For the Price
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Nano Plus is a very reliable mp3 player-- the sound is crisp, it plays smoothly, you can record on it as well as listen to FM and AM radio, and all for a very reasonable price.  Although it is not specifically compatible with iTunes, what I do is burn my playlist onto a disk, and then rip that onto my mp3 player.  When you first hook it up to your computer, it installs everything you'll need-- help, a way to rip audio CDs onto your player, as well as much more. My only complaint is that the ear buds which come with this player are VERY cheap, and uncomfortable.  I recommend you buy a new pair or use old headphones, instead of using their's. Other than that, I highly recommend this mp3 player.  Much better, I think, than any, more expensive player.  A great deal for you money!

<Title>Transparent technology
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted a device like this; something that I could plug into my computer and access just like a thumb drive. When I took it out of the package, there was a CD that came with it, but as I looked at the CD and the standard USB jack in the side, I thought "I'll just plug it in and see what happens." That's what I did, and I was able to drop a few folders on it and listen to music immediately. I never installed the software. In this case Windows XP didn't have a problem with drivers or anything.  More things need to be like this. iTunes and the other software interfaces that are required by other players are a hindrance. Proprietary cables should be banned, as far as I'm concerned. This simple unit uses a USB cable and a headphone jack, and that's all you need. You can put it in your pocket without discomfort. It's solid state (no spinning disk harddrive) so the risk of damage to the unit is minimal.  The battery doesn't last long, and there is no hardware to run this off a car charger as far as I've found. I am irritated that to use this in the car, I must have at least three separate wires going from this to that, which is very annoying, and I'm still running down the battery. I've yet to find a cigarette-lighter mounted FM transmitter with a "line-in" jack all consoldiated into a single unit. This would rid my car of these dumb wires all over the place. Since the screen is small, you have to fiddle with it while driving which is a pain, but to be expected for something this small.  Until I find something better, I'll stick with this quick and easy MP3 solution.

<Title>It's still tickin'
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player 2 years ago and am still loving it! Once you get the hang of operating it (I am not tech savvy and it didn't take too long) it is very easy. My 5 year old has no problem using this player either. She has her own folder on my player so that she can be just like her big sis. The only problem I have is that to find a particular song, you either skip through every song until you find the one you are looking for or go to the menu and search through the folders.  Loading it up is simple...just copy and paste! If you copy a song and paste it, you just get that song (songs are named in the player the same as on the computer when pasting). If you copy and paste a folder, then the same folder is on the player.  I bought one of these players for my 14 yr old daughter 1 year ago. She uses hers more than I do and she still loves it! Unlike my daughter, I could not stand the earbuds that came with this player. They were very uncomfortable in my ears. If they stayed in, they hurt but most of the time they would fall out anyway. I purchased Sony Soft Earbuds - White Model #: SON   MDREX71SLAW from Circuit City for about $50. On the expensive side, but very definitely worth every penny. I could not get them away from my boyfriend, so I bought him a pair as well. I also just purchased the Creative TravelDock 900 Docking Speaker for this player to listen to at work. I have not received it yet though. Over all I believe you cannot go wrong with this player and have recommended it to anyone looking to buy a mp3 player.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am addicted to audio books (in mp3 format) so I've got to have an mp3 player.  I have been using this little gem for about half a year now and I'm more than happy with it. I had been using a Samsung YEPP YP-F1X 512 MB mp3 player (which I was also happy with), but I lost it. I decided I needed more memory than my old unit so the Creative Zen Nano Plus was my choice.  What I love about it (in no particular order): ~ The track will start off where it was stopped. Awesome feature for audio books. ~ Size. Fits in any pocket. ~ Storage. 1 GB is enough to hold two or three books, depending on the size of the books. ~ Can be used as a flash drive. ~ The scrolling. Fast-forwarding and rewinding gets incrementally faster the longer the scroller is pressed. This is a great feature for audio books. ~ The "lock" function. When a track is playing, the mp3 player can be locked so that when buttons on the player are pressed the track is not interrupted. This is a great feature for audio books.  Why it's *almost* perfect: ~ I miss the clip on my old mp3 player that allowed me to attach the player to my clothing. If I don't have any pockets I put the Zen Nano in a cell phone holder that has a clip, but that adds bulk and looks stupid. ~ I seem to go through a lot of batteries. I have been keeping track and, on the average, I replace the battery about every four weeks. I wish it could charge via the USB cable like my previous unit.  The worst thing about it: ~ When the battery is almost drained, the player sometimes loses the ability to scroll and will sometimes not start the track where it was stopped. This means I end up putting in a new battery even though there is still a little bit of juice in the old battery.   I would buy this mp3 player again if I needed another one. In fact, I am going to get one for my brother for Christmas this year. And some batteries.

<Title>DO NOT BUY - stops working after a few months.
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>do not buy this product!  Ignore the 5-star rating - that's from a few months ago.  Immediately after receiving this, I wrote a great review when it was working...  however, once the warranty ran out, the product stopped working!  with fresh new batteries, the player will not even turn on anymore - the screen flashes the logo and starts to turn on then shuts off after a split second.  occasionally if i hold the power button for about 10 minutes, it will finally turn on, but then if I'm listening to music and go to adjust the volume or skip to another song - any button I touch, turns it off and then it will not turn back on.  of course since companies don't care about the customer anymore, most companies, including creative, don't back their product after 90 days, which turns out to be about the life span of this product.  if you don't mind paying $70 for a disposable mp3 player that will only last three months, go ahead, but if you are looking for something that will last longer than three months, look elsewhere.

<Title>Just About Perfect!
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For me, the most important feature of an mp3 player is sound quality. This is where this player really shines. It is simply one of the best sounding mp3 players on the market, with very little background noise and distortion. Warmth, resolution, detail, and clarity allow your music to be engaging and very enjoyable. Play a track with a high-bitrate and this player will blow you away! I previously owned a heavy, 20GB hard-disc drive player made by Apple. The drawbacks were the weight and extremely short battery life (3 hours of play on a good day). This baby is so small, light and unobtrusive that you don't think twice about taking it everywhere you go. Buy 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and you're good to go. Oh yeah, by the way....  the price is right. You can't find a better mp3 player for under $70 bucks!!!

<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this little player!  I bought it specifically for the gym, and it is perfect for that purpose.  I also bought the pricey $99 Bose in-ear headphones which make this player sound fantastic.  However, the included earbuds are probably adequate for most people.    PROS:  takes standard AAA battery; line-in jack for direct recording of non-digital sources such as LP's and cassettes; 5-band EQ with presets; FM tuner with presets; microphone; very good sound.  CONS:  none after 2 months of daily use.  The package I purchased contained everything you will likely need including AAA battery, armband, beltclip, & headphones.  This is my first MP3 player.  I was a little afraid of buying one, or wasting my money on a cheap piece of junk.  However, this player truly met all of my requirements, and exceeded my overall expectations.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  If you have never owned an MP3 player before, and are looking for a player to use at the gym, this inexpensive but impressive little player should delight you!

<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After checking quite a few MP3 player reviews, I decided to buy this one, since the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and because I like its size and look. I found it very easy to install and use. I get songs from emusic and their files move easily and quickly into the player. I also used the software to encode from a CD, no sweat; both the player and the software are easy to figure out. I organize the songs into folders and change the titles ( abbreviate+ give a number to the track)to be able to locate the tracks quickly. Most important to me, as the other reviewers say, it sounds great ( I encode at 220 b/s,  gladly sacrificing quantity to quality). I bought the extended warranty, just in case, but it doesn't seem flimsy. It's probably a good idea to be gentle with the buttons and battery cover, though. The radio sounds good too and catches a lot of stations, a nice addition ( just wish it had AM too). The earbuds are large but sound good. The problem with the backlight making a sound must have been fixed, I didn't notice any, good, I wouldn't want to disable it, it looks cool and is useful. I'm looking forward to hours of musical pleasure with this pretty object.

<Content>This was a great Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter. She loves it! It uses only one AAA battery, which lasts quite a while (she started using it on Christmas morning and still has the same battery in today a week and a half later with daily use). It has an FM radio function, shows you what you are playing, how much time is used, etc. It is full of features and the price is great too. I would highly recommend this item for those of you looking for something small, easy to use, durable, and fun. As for the loading of songs, she picked it up in about 5 minutes, it was no problem. This one is supposed to hold about 500 songs, she is still nowhere close to that many. Well worth the price, a great deal!

<Title>Very nice little player.
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered these for my nieces as Christmas gifts and they were thrilled. So thrilled, I decided to get one for myself. It came with an armband, (not a neck strap as the site may specify) and has a stero connector cable, USB cable, battery, and earbuds (the standard kind that are a little big, not the kind that mold into your ears), and a rubbery case that has a belt clip on it. Really cool - great for the money. I installed the software, connected it to my PC with the included USB cable and about 150 of my mp3s went on it in 5 minutes. It was so easy it practically sucked them off like a vacuum! The kids report they hooked theirs up to their personal CD players and it took the music right off their cds! Super easy to use. Now, for the best part. I don't always care to listen to my player with the earphones, so I purchased a $10 cassette adapter that is marketed for the iPod, but has the standard 3.5 mm stero adapter. Cool, now I can play it in my car instead of burning a mix CD. I also purchased the iFish and right now my player is plugged into it and it's next to my computer, wiggling, dancing and fuctioning as a great dock. Worked out great when I reinstalled windows the other day and had to restar my PC after every new driver installation. I highly recommend this player to anyone. It does not support play lists like some other players do, but when you transfer files to it, just change the name of them to the order you want them to play in, or as I do, just separate them into folders and skip easily back and forth between folders of music. One AAA battery will last you 15-20 hours - incredible!

<Content>I have the 512M Creative Zen so now I'm getting the 1G.  I'm dumping my Sony player with its losy software and my iriver with its hard to use controls.  All I want is a simple player that I can plug in like a jump drive, move over my MP3s from my computer and play and that is what the Creative Zen does very well.

<Title>just right for me
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought one of these for my son for Christmas-I ended up using it tons when I run. Wanted to "test drive" one before getting my own. He insisted I get my own-which I did. The software is easy to use. The device also records live music-he uses that feature [himself performing], I do not. He also rips from his portable CD player to the device. I like to rip cd's from the laptop. 1GB is plenty large enough for my uses. I did swap out supplied ear buds-but only did so because I'm a runner-the supplied ones do work well for other common use. Battery life seems to be fine. i did notice that "boot up" time has lengthened with more folders of tunes-but not a big deal. The battery cover has a very delicate tab that seems to break if one does not carefully re-insert-no big deal for me as I just tape it. The entire device is housed in a soft/rubbery clip cover anyway, so it's not even a cosmetic issue. Lot of features for the bucks, I'd recommend it.

<Content>The tone quality is very good and it is easy to load music and operate. I have owned two of these for less than one year and my wife and I use them daily at the gym.  The biggest problem is the battery cover which has a tab that is extremely flimsy.  No help from the manufacturer unless you want to spend dollars for another battery cover.  I have replaced 3 of them and will never buy another one due to this problem and the lack of service concern by the manufacturer.

<Title>My daughter loves it!!
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 12 yr old was asking for an ipod and a friend told me to check out the mp3 players, which were similar and cost less. I checked around and found this one. I chose this one because my daughter has alot of cd's and this player allows recording of music directly from the cd's through the computer. The downloading feature is also easy to use. My daughter no longer has to carry her cd walkman and cd case everywhere, just this small mp3 player in her pocket. Also she enjoys the radio feature as her cd walkman did not have this feature. The downside is the batteries don't last long, so we invested in rechargable AAA batteries. Other than that she no longer thought about the ipod after getting this!

<Title>Very easy to use
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> This is my first mp3 player and so far I am very pleased with this product. The fact that it uses an AAA battery means that you don't have to put an adaptor in your backpack. If you want to travel light, it is a good advantage over other players which usually don't come with this option. The sound quality is very good. The software is very intuitive to use. I remember that my cousin had to spend long hours to learn how to manage the software iPod comes with so I was a little woried about it. But I did not even have to read the booklet to use the software. You can easily add, delete and reorganize the music.    Initially I thought that this player doesnot have enough volume. Then I realize that the jackphone was loose and you have to push it hard for it to go all the way in. Then I had such a high volume that I will probably use it in half volume most of the time.     The only negative comment I have is that transfering music is a little slower than I expected.

<Title>Great Product but no instructions
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The MP3 player itself was great, it gets 5 stars.  The earphones that come with it were extremely uncomfortable for my 11 yr old son whom I purchased the NANO PLUS for.  I replaced them with Marshallow earplugs from Walmart that a friend suggested as very comfortable.  They were.  They're made by JVC, I think, or SONY.  If you are somewhat electronically savvy you will figure out how to use this MP3 player, but the directions it comes with are pretty much non-existent and the website directions do not apply specifically to this product but to the CREATIVE products which are newer.  I think the player was well worth the price.  I'm having fun loading CD's onto it.  I also tried to use it as a voice recorder, and that works great too.

<Content>This is (was) a great player.  Then I let the battery go dead (fell  asleep on the train), then it would not turn back on with a new battery.  So I had Amazon replace it (they did so very promptly) and this one again worked great.  After several batteries (which I didn't let go dead) I got curious and thought I would try letting one go all the way flat.  Sure enough, it won't turn back on.  I found that if I "upgrade" the firmware, I can get it back to working, but I am returning it.  Too bad, as I was in love with it.

<Title>STEAL THIS BOOK
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here's the deal guys & gals: I can't find anything wrong with this thing:  the thing is cheap, light, comes with all the accessories you need, requires no external software for Windows or MAC and has higher sound quality than most Apple players like I-pod.    Any problems I read in other people's reviews were uninformed and incorrect.  I purchased this player from Amazon.com for only like $60 with free shipping, about a month ago, and I use it with $9 Sony headphones with ear-clips that I bought at Best Buy, because I prefer those to normal ear buds, like the ones it comes with.  CONS: The only downside is that if you want to carry around more than 1GB of music and/or files at one time, you should get a bigger creative labs player.  This is no problem for me because I am a professional songwriter and singer, and I'm always changing out the music I listen to.  I can find no other downside... I guess another potential downside is that if you want to use Apple's .aac/mp4 format you have to first burn them on to audio CD's and convert them to .mp3 or .wma files.  (Note: this problem exists with EVERY legal mp3 player on the market)   PROS: POWER--You don't have to charge it...Uses a AAA battery and lasts about a month with heavy, daily use.  When you are hooked up to a computer the USB powers to save your battery.  Plus, it has plenty of options like backlight, power-save, and contrast settings to further the life of the battery  EASE OF USE/SHARING FILES: Look, all you do is hook it up with the provided USB2 cable and you import/export files like an external drive or folder.  You can share music with your friends, or even use it as a flash drive for school or work.  It creates menus (or you might call them 'playlists') according to the folders that you create on the thing.  I always name mine '[artist] - [album (year)]'.  BUILT IN ENCODING UP TO 160 KPS:  and this works extremely well (contrary to ignorant reviews I've read) if you set the levels correctly out of your source.  I have been using it to rip mp3's of VINYL right out of the headphone jack of my home stereo tuner and they sound @#$% GREAT!  It even comes with the line in cable you need to do this.  FM RADIO, VOICE RECORDING, ETC:  all these other features work great.  The radio gets great reception and you can even rip mp3's off the radio (although you should realize that these will be significantly lower quality than if you rip from the line in jack).  SOUND QUALITY: Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this thing operates at 20Hz to 20kHz which is the approximate maximum hearing threshold of the human ears... I-pod and other players are actually lower quality than this, I believe.  It also runs at 44.1k which means you get no sound degradation if you rip mp3s at 256k from a CD.  Need I say more... buy some of these before the price goes up or they take them off the market.  jb

<Title>Nice device and fast response
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: This device is good, little and I saw it was easy to use.   Possible to use three levels of carpets Awesone sound. Perfect voice record capability Excelent software to "autofit" the MP3 to WMA files and save space. Now with "autofit" I can have in the ZEN near to 550 songs in WMA at 96 btps. Good WEB site for support (software and upgrades)  Cons: -The casing is plastic and seems no to be very resistent.   -The software is suceptible to be losen or affected.  I recomment prior to record music inside the ZED,  format the device utilizing the ZEN explorer (included in the CD). -Once mi device suddenly did not operate. It turn off with new battery. I had to install the new firmware and format it. The problem was solved.

<Title>Wonderfully small, easy to use.
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll try not to repeat what everyone else have mentioned.  Some of the things I have noticed about this MP3 player early on: (1) The display is easy to read for a somewhat small display.  (2) Has an equalizer.  (3) Comes with a lot of accessories like arm band, earphones, line-in cable, rubber case w/ belt clip. (4) Quite a bit of software which I have yet to know what they do. (5) A NiMH rechargable AAA battery will last around 8 hours. Your mileage may vary. (6) Without reading the manual, I was able to manage around the vast menu selection.  It was a very well laid out GUI. (7) I considered strongly the color of the Nano before I bought it.  Once I got the damn thing, it was so tiny, color didn't matter anymore.

<Content>I own a Creative Muvo 256MB and still enjoying it to date.  When I saw the more compact Creative Zen nano plus 1 GB (and the price just keeps coming down!), I decided to order one and was pleasantly surprised! The sound quality is awesome ( I even compared it head to head with iPOD nano with its earphones--I think the ZEN has a better sound!) It is very small, light and came with a silicon case and armband which is just perfect for working out. I have no problems with it so far. In fairness to iPOD nano, iPOD has better and larger graphics but more pricey. Bottom line is, MP3 players are mainly audio players, hence the looks should be secondary.  I have recommended the ZEN nano to all my coworkers and to order thru Amazon, couldn't be simpler than that!

<Title>Great once you learn how to use it.
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Zen Nano Plus but the booklet that comes with it is a joke. ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE USERS GUIDE FROM THE CREATIVE LABS WEB SITE! Once you have read the users guide the Zen Nano is a joy to use and a real value. To me, the Creative labs software and "wizard" are difficult to learn. I just used windows "explore" to set up a folder on the MP3 player for each singer, then used Microsoft Media Player to rip the songs from my CDs, then dragged and dropped them into the appropriate folders on the MP3.  Even the Creative Labs User Guide doesn't talk about folders much.  If you don't set up folders, I assume all your songs land in one big pile on the MP3 player. Once you have set up folders and copied the songs into them, when you are playing music the Zen Nano lets you easily swithch from folder to folder, or you can use shuffle mode. The controls on the player are very diverse and flexible. The biggest reason I bought the Zen Nano is that it uses standard "AAA" batteries, unlike the IPOD, which must be connected to your computer to recharge (unless they have changed it recently). I travel a lot and just take a few extra batteris with me.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I needed simple drag and drop, with a FM radio and a battery that didn't require me hook up the usb.  I also wanted at least 1GB and didn't want to spend $100.  Enter the Creative Zen Nano Plus!  I've used Creative products over the years and never had problems with their quality... this TINY mp3 player is no different. It's small and plastic, but transfers files quickly and effortlessly. I read the short book that came with it and within ten minutes of opening the package I was listening to music files I'd transfered from my computer.  I will be getting new earphones for it (the phones are a bit too large for my ears), but the sound quality improved once I discovered the EQ settings and there's volume left to spare!

<Title>A solid, convenient player
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the small size of this player - it's about the size of a pack of gum (between a 5 and 25 pack).  I purchased it mainly because of the recording feature.  It has a built in mic and you can also attach a line-in recording source.  The built in mic has decent quality and records individual mp3 files so you can download them to your computer for archiving.   Upsides: Nice drag-and-drop transfer of files.  You don't have to use any annoying proprietary software.  Relatively good recording quality.  Decent interface.  Wonderfully small size.  Good battery life.  Downsides:  The line-in jack is not a standard size.  It looks like a 1/16th inch jack and comes with an adapter cord to make it compatible with an 1/8th  inch jack.  Then, if you want to plug in an RCA or mic source, you'd have to have even more converters.  I haven't even attempted to do so yet so I'm not sure how the quality is.  I hope to use it at some point for remote podcasts.  You have to use a separate cord to interface with a PC.  The older version of this player (which I almost bought) allowed you to plug directly into USB (meaning there was a male USB connector built into the device.  I really would like this feature because it would allow you to plug the device into remote computers without having to carry around the little adapter cord.

<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this item for Christmas last year.  I loved it!  It was a good MP3 player for the money. Then, last week I went to use it and the sound was all distorted.  I went to the Zen website to troubleshoot it and went to try their suggestions but whenever I connected the Zen to my computer, the computer locked up.  As soon as I removed the Zen from the computer, it was fine.  So, I was unable to troubleshoot.  So I tried to turn on my Zen to check settings.  Now it won't even turn on.  I went back to the Zen website to contact Customer service.  They wanted me to pay a nonrefundable $25 just to get a return number, with no guarantees that they could fix the problem.  There was no phone number to contact them, or anyway to contact them via email.  When a company makes themselves inaccessible like that, I have to wonder why.  Don't settle for the Zen.

<Title>Good hardware poor user interface
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was wondering why ipods commanded such premium prices until I got a Creative Nano 1GB.  I like its small size and the sound quality is satisfactory.  I intended to use it to listen to books ripped from cds.  So each book should be a directory under which there are directories for the disks.  Under each disk directory there are tracks.  This is no sweat for ipod to handle but stretches the Creative's ability since it does not really understand the concept of directory trees.  Well, it pretends to understand one flat layer of directories but I can tell it is faking that, being a computer programmer myself.  As the result, strange things happen when you actually have layers of directories.  Although I have figured out how to cope in some cases, I wish I had got an ipod instead.  So if you just want to play some songs this is good enough but if you want any organization of the content, ipod is a better choice.

A great player for running/working out with excellent sound quality and durability. Love the drag and drop feature for loading on files and that no proprietary software is required. Also like being able to use AAA batteries. I just rubber band one on the side along with the extra headphone cord (also good for catching the player when it gets dropped -- rubber band holds headphone cord in place so player does not hit ground -- a cheap effective accessory). I also like the FM radio.

One problem I have with earbuds is they are usually too big my ears... so I went to the local hearing aid store and had some custom earmolds made that fit onto the buds --now the sound is really terrific because it is going directly into my ear without any background noise. And since the molds fit into my ear canals, the buds will never "fall" out; if I ever have to replace the earbuds, the customs come off and will go onto the new ones easily (most earbuds are about the same size).  Storage? --1GB is perfect size! You can store a ton of music on this baby--it takes forever to listen to it all! I have 35 Christmas CDs--loaded them all and still had room for more. Christmas is over, with drag and drop, exchanging genre was a snap!  Bought each of my teenagers one for Christmas and they are thrilled!  Love the replaceable batteries.  Recharging is great if you are near a recharger when the batts go out--but that's not a problem with this jewel. (Who needs iPod with all of its proprietary issues!)  I don't think it will, but even if it has to be replaced in a couple of years for whatever reason, I didn't spend a fortune to begin with, so it was money well spent. I would definitely buy another one. Creative has always made good products, so I am really glad I got this one. But first and foremost--the sound is awesome!!  [...]

<Title>It works for my kids- I want one too!
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My mother bought these for my kids ( a 5.5 boy and a 2.5 girl) for Christmas this year.  She bought them so that the kids could each listen to their own story tapes and/or music and we parents could either listen to news programs or our own music on the car radio or enjoy adult conversation.  We have three sets of grandparents that all live 3-6 hours away so long car trips are frequent!  I am NOT a techno person.  So, I was very nervous about getting into these.  I did a fair amount of research and decided the Zen Nano was the best balance of value, storage capacity and ease of use for my kids and me.  They have proven easy to use and durable.  I can even "rip" CD's to my computer and then "synch" them to the mp3 player with no problem using Windows Media Player.  It really is easy!  They've worked out great.  The controls are not fancy but are fairly intuitive.  And my kids are generally happy with just turning them on and listening to one album or story all the way through.  If you turn it off, it does pick back up where you left off which is great.  Neither of my kids can read well enough to get to the album they are looking for anyway.  By the time they can, they'll probably be using the controls with more ease than I do!  They were given a set of conventional headphones because we didn't think earbuds would be a good choice for this age range.  We were also gifted a charger and set of rechargeable batteries.  The batteries only last for a few days during heavy use.  In short, I couldn't be happier with this product.  We've ony had it for about two weeks but already they are indispensible.  It saves us a LOT of arguing over what to listen to in the car AND at home.  I actually came online so that I could buy a third one for myself!  Now I can record all of those NPR podcasts that I never get to listen to at home.  I will buy a car tape-deck adaptor and can listen to my favorite shows anytime I take a (rare, but precious) car ride alone!

<Title>Good for kids
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this unit and was surprised that it only allows you to skip through the songs forward and backwards. I might have missed some other options, but I don't think so. I got this for a 10 year old and she doesn't seem to mind, but if you are looking for the ability to play songs by artist, album, or any other grouping, I could not figure out how to do it.  It works well other than that. It's basically a thumb drive and you can drag and drop (cut and paste) songs on here easily.  It comes with a rubber case to help protect it, ok head phones and a USB cord. My XP found it and installed it quickly with any additional software. It does come with software, but I didn't even look at it.  If you want something more intelligent, then the one gig Sandisk with the 1 gig memory slot works very well, for under $100. [...]

<Content>This mp3 player has good features but with little instructions provided, it is nearly impossible to use.  So far, we have only been able to download a few songs and those were songs already on my computer and has not allowed us to download purchased songs yet.    The buttons are also a challenge to use.  I still haven't figured them out and given the time involved in doing so I probably never will.    I am disappointed in the ease of use for this product.

<Title>Best purchase I've made in some time!
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a 40GB Creative Labs Zen Xtra MP3 player from Christmas a year ago, but that big thing (although it's a great vacation device) sits at home now that I have my 1GB Zen Nano Plus!  Super light-weight, durable, and great battery life, I take this thing with me almost everywhere - to the gym, in the car (which came with an 1/8" auxilliary input for devices just like this), and lounging near the pool.  1GB doesn't sound like much, but it's plenty of room to store all your favorite "current playlist" songs and then some.  If it gets full, just delete some of the stuff you don't like as much.  Two cons (but not worth marking down a star):  1.  Get a different set of earbuds.  The ones that come with the unit just don't cut it.  I got a pair of $20 KOSS earbuds from a popular retailer and they've been great.  2.  There was a high-pitched noise whenever the blue LED backlight came on (i.e. whenever you skipped to the next song, etc).  Thankfully, there's an option to turn off the backlight permanently (which also saves on battery life), without which I would have had to return the unit because I couldn't have put up with it.  Note: I did return the unit once thinking it was defective because of the high-pitched tone, but apparently all the units have this same problem.  I lived with it because I don't mind having the backlight off permanently.

<Title>Overall a great purchase.
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought Creative Zen Nano Plus upon the recommendation of my brother who is pretty savvy when it comes to technology.  It is the smallest MP3 player on the market that I am aware of and seems to be reasonably priced.  I love that it comes with the arm band; great for exercising.  I'd have liked there to be a bit more memory; 500 songs sounds like a lot but it fills up fast and also you may not even get that many if the song file is a larger one.  I was able to fit about 250 songs.  Despite that one little drawback I am satisfied and must say that as my first purchase it is a great one overall.  Would like to compare to the iPod Nano; the iPod Nano has 4 times the space but it also costs almost $200 more.  It may be worth it for a longer term investment.

<Title>A Bargain for the Number of Options
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a bit apprehensive when I bought this MP3 player but the Creative Zen Nano Plus exceeded all of my expectations. The sound quality is great. The earphones are loud at even when set the lowest levels. No, the earphones aren't the most comfortable thing in the world, but they're easily replaceable. Really, I think people like to complain about the earphones because there's nothing really wrong with the player so they're searching for things to criticize.   The software (not needed) took minutes to install, and loading my CDs was simple and even faster. You can choose how to name the tracks on your CDs when you load them as well (i.e. No., artist, title, or a combination of all three) The player also works like a flash drive and if you just have random mp3 tracks on your computer, you can simply drag and drop them into your player. The only thing is that you need a UBS cable to connect your player to your computer (cable is provided). Songs are also easily deleted. You can either do this on your computer or on the player itself.   Another great option is that the number of different shuffle options available. You can shuffle within a folder, or shuffle between folders, shuffle with no repeat, shuffle with repeat, etc.  I haven't used them all but they're definitely there. No, you can't do playlists but I didn't really find it necessary. The absence of the ability to use playlists is another very small flaw in the MP3 player which can be easily overlooked. Really, if you want a "playlist" just put all the songs you want in a folder and listen to the folder only!  You can organize your songs into folders. I haven't used many sub-folders, but you can organize your songs within subfolders. I mainly have folders for different artists and subfolders of albums from that artist within that folder. Then I just have a folder for miscelaneous songs. This structure has worked great for me, especially considering all the playing options that are on the player.   The FM radio rocks. I love having the option of listening to the radio instead of just listening to my music. The reception indoors is decent - about as good as a radio in the same room. I've only tried the option of recording from the radio once or twice but it worked great when I did. It's a cool option if there's some radio program or song you want to record for future listenings.  For all you college students, concert junkies, conference goers, etc., the Creative Zen Nano Plus has a microphone so you can record lectures, songs, and anything else you can think of with your MP3 player. I think the player picks up sound pretty decently over large distances. Of course, the closer/louder the sound, the better the sound quality. Great added option though.  I haven't used this option but you can also transfer straight from your portable CD player to your MP3 player without using your computer using a line-in cable (provided). The only downfall is that the files will be generically named (XXX0001.mp3). But that can be easily changed the next time you are on your computer.  The player also comes with a AAA battery which lasts quite a while for such a small battery. Don't ask me for the exact number of hours it lasts because I don't keep track of how long I listen to the player for every battery used but I can tell you that the small battery has some serious juice. In addition, replaceable batteries are much better than using rechargeable batteries because rechargeable batteries do not work after about a year of constant use.  The player came with a wrist band which I didn't find all that impressive but it's there if you want to use it. The Nano did have a tiny hole at one end to be used with lanyards if you do not want to use the wrist band. The player does NOT come with a lanyard but I had an extra one laying around so I use that instead. I did like the case it came with so it prevents scratching or any other wear and tear on the surface. The case also has a clip if you want to clip to your clothing.   Overall, great buy considering the price. The only two extremely minor flaws was the earphones are uncomfortable and playlists aren't an option. This greatly outweighs the cool options available like FM radio, microphone, price, works like a flash drive, etc. I give it 4 1/2 stars!!!

<Title>Cheap construction, good features
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little MP3 player is based on flash memory instead of a hard drive. Compared to hard drives which eventually die, an MP3 player based on flash memory is a longer-lasting investment. The Nano Plus is loaded with features such as one gigabyte of storage for music or other files, an FM radio, a built in mic and various recording functions. Like most consumer grade MP3 players such as the iPod, the Nano Plus cannot play albums without gaps in between the tracks. Audiophiles who carefully encode their albums using gapless-capable formats may want to avoid this player and seek out high-end players such as Rio Karma. Firmware upgrades could eventually give gapless playback capability to the Nano Plus. Sadly, with all its amazing features the Nano Plus is cheaply built from flimsy plastic. From a design perspective the Nano Plus looks like it could have been engineered by Homer Simpson. It has an odd navigation system that ultimately does get the job done. The overall sound quality is decent--as good or better than any iPod but a far cry from the likes of Cowon iAudio. Dragging music onto the device is simple and requires no special software besides basic storage drivers. It shows up like a regular drive. With only the drivers installed from the Creative web site you can avoid using the included CD. It comes with a soft rubber case which is very useful for protecting this delicate toy from destruction. Be extremely careful if you plan to use the Zen Nano Plus while excerising. A single AAA battery keeps it playing for up to 18 hours. Considering the battery is easily replaceable you could potentially own this device for many many years without it needing service or replacement.

<Title>Awesome!!!  No matter what else you own, GET THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My review can be summed up in one sentence: You can get a BUNCH of songs on this VERY SMALL player and play them for a VERY LONG TIME!  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's, the m230, m240, and m250, and I only gave them 4 stars.  Without a doubt, the Creative Zen Nano get's 5 stars.  It's that good.  It doesn't have all the cool cache' of the iPod nano, but it is without question the most optimized little player I have had the pleasure to review.    Creative has been in the MP3 player business for a LONG time.  Their early offerings came up against a market that wasn't fully matured and able to handle the higher end devices they produced.  Apple stole their thunder and has overshadowed everybody with the iPod.  Creative's higher capacity devices are still too large to compete on portability.  It's funny the way things work out.  If not for Creative, Apple wouldn't have ever had a market to introduce the iPod into.  The Creative Zen Nano is lighter than the competition, and is actually much smaller than the iPod Shuffle.  Unlike the shuffle, however, you can actually see your track names!  The little LCD isn't high resolution, but it's perfect for a player this size.    The controls are simple but effective.  A 2 way toggle wheel let's you forward or reverse from song to song.  There's a play / pause button on the front panel and forward & reverse buttons on the side by the toggle wheel.  Other than a headphone jack and a line in jack, the unit has a USB B port and the battery panel.  That's it.  I think these controls are the best possible for the form factor.  The only potential negative is that they might be on the small size for somebody with larger fingers.  What about sound?  The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo.  As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds.  I've yet to use a pair of standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.  I will say that the armstrap could have been better designed.  Also, this unit definitely does not have the power output of the iPod Nano, and as such may not be loud enough for those who really love to blast it.  But as a result, the power consumption is the best I've seen.  I've gone over a week on a single AAA battery!  For those needing more space, the Zen Nano doesn't have larger storage options. This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Even with a HUGE music collection, I can get a great deal of music on here and take it with me everywhere.  The price isn't a give-away, and this unit won't make it through battle, but it strikes a good enough balance to meet your needs for a long long time to come.  Highly recommended.  Pros -  - great stereo sound - nice capacity - ridiculous battery life!!! - light-weight  - FM tuner ( though it's just average ) - voice recording  - Direct line-in recording!!!! ( for those without a PC ) - ergonomic design  - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible   - USB 2.0 connectivity  - replaceable battery!!!   Cons  - smallish buttons - Average shuffle feature - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled ) - some song transfer issues on older computers  - not enough size options - no slot expansion   (...)

<Title>Good product
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sure I know there are fancier mp3 players out there, but I think this one is ideal for the price. I have had no problems loading the songs or using the device at all. I have only had it for a few months, but can find no fault with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the memory could only store about 200 songs as opposed to the 500 songs advertised. The ear buds also did not fit my ears too well, but this probably would be a problem with any ear buds as they all seem to be the same size. This was easily solved with a different kind of head phone set that I purchased for under $20. In conclusion, this is a good mp3 player to buy as long as you don't have a need to download too many cd's. I am happy with it.

<Title>Adequate MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this Zen Nano Plus after careful consideration, because I wanted a player that could play WMA files, and which had line-in and radio capability.   Unfortunately, I couldn't get the line-in capability to work well -- there were frequent scratching noises in the background whether I was recording from a computer or a CD/radio.   The radio didn't work well inside my gym either, although it may have just been my gym.  Another problem is the lower upper-bound for the sound levels. The volume doesn't go up as high as is often necessary to hear inside a noisy place, like a gym.  All, in all, I wish I had bought an iPod. I have heard horror stories about the fragility of those devises, which you may wish to consider. I know that my nano, which is usually kept in a small digicam case, has been dropped before, and it still works.   So, the end of the story is that this is an adequate player, but don't buy it because of the radio or line-in features, and don't buy it if you listen to your music at higher volumes.

<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall I'm pleased with the Zen Nano Plus.  Pros:  - considerably smaller than most other players  - comes with armband and belt clip holder; armband is good for exercising  - uses one AAA battery, and it seems to last a long time  - easy to drag and drop to add music  Cons:   - I could not get this to work with Yahoo! Music Unlimited "To Go" service, despite a claim on Creative's web page that it would work.  The unit is Windows "Plays For Sure" compatible, but maybe Yahoo Music is not.  I tried updating the firmware and drivers but still was unable to transfer subscription songs to the player via Yahoo Music Engine.  - Small display, but usable  - navigation with the scroll wheel is a bit cumbersome  - supplied headphones are just ok

<Title>nice sound, but easily scratched
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice little player.  1 gigabyte is enough to hold 18-20 albums or so, which makes a nice playlist.  Because it has USB 2, it loads quickly.  The sound is quite nice, but the included earbuds are too large and very rough.  You'll want to replace them, but since this is such an inexpensive player the cost isn't an issue.  Beware that the default load order in this player is alphabetical by song title.  Be sure to use the included media organizer software to change the default and play the songs in album order.  I found that the case, while very good looking, is soft.  The clear cover over the LCD panel is easily scratched, which could prove to be a problem.  I just cut down a screen protector from my PDA and applied it to the LCD.  Problem solved.  You can't go wrong for the price.

<Title>Waste of money.
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted an mp3 player since my sister got her ipod, but I really didn't want to settle for ipod. My mom picked this one out for me instead, and I hated it!   The first day I got it, the part that keeps that battery in snapped. I was alright with it at first since if I put it in the clear clip on holder, it didn't come off. But the belt clip wasn't made to securely hold that thing.  I carried it around at work a lot, and since the belt clip wasn't secure, it'd randomly fall off my belt loop and crash on the floor. The FIRST time it did this, the player snapped in half and the blue casing came off. Also the volume buttons fell out. I managed to piece it back together, but it happened several more times. Eventually, I had no more buttons left and couldn't even turn the thing on.  It was a nice little mp3 player, but had too many bad things about it to enjoy.  Pro's for me: -Being able to play & record radio -Small enough to fit in my purse & such -Idle shut off -Very easy to put songs on & take songs off. Was never a fan of itunes, so the drag&drop method was nice.  Cons: -Would rather it had a rechargable built in battery. I could've bought the most expensive ipod by now just by the amount of money I had to spend on batteries for this! -High pitched buzzing noise that accompanies backlight -Shuffle mode sucks, tends to play the same songs everytime I switch it to shuffle -Takes a while to skip through songs -Scratched easily -Not durable at all, dropped it once & it broke.

<Content>After reading all the rave reviews this item received, I thought it was going to be so much better than it actually was. It doesn't hold nearly 500 songs like the description reads. It holds less than 200 of my music. The shuffle feature sucks if you have lots of songs in one folder. It will play the same song four times in one sitting, while skipping tons of other songs! When I found that it wasn't playing some of my songs, I had to dump songs from several different folders into a root folder just to hear them played. You get what you pay for. I would rather have spent twice as much to get a better MP3 player.

<Content>I purchased three of these from Amazon for Christmas gifts. Three months later one is defective. Because I purchased these in November, Amazon tells me I am over the 30 day return policy and will do nothing about it. They count the thirty day policy from the time of purchase even when it is obvious this was a Christmas gift because I bought three of them. Forget dealing with Creative (the manufacturer)...they tell you to return it to the place of purchase because they have so may hidden charges, even under warranty, that it will cost more to send it to them than the original cost. Any local store would have replaced this without question. Shame on Amazon.

It holds more songs than I can listen to in an afternoon and I have no trouble loading them and deleting them when I want a change.   I love the FM radio that the competition doesn't have and plenty of stations come in loud and clear and it's very easy to record them.  I use the built in digital recorder all the time to record meetings and classes. I slip this into a pocket or clip it on the front of my bra and it's so small I forget it's there. Later it's easy to transfer what I recorded to the computer and burn it to a CD if I want.  It uses one regular old AAA battery and not something special that can't be found or has to be sent to the factory to be changed.  I've had mine 6 months and no problems.  I love it!!

<Title>Love this thing!
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my CZN for over a year and still love it! Works exactly as it should, and even became a valuable tool when I need to move large files between various computers. My only (minor) complaints are: the flimsy battery door (it's not the worst thing in the world if you lose it if it breaks, but I didn't want to tape up my player), the so-so software (not that you actually need to use it of course) and the size (didn't realize how quickly 1gig could fill up, though that's no fault of the player). If this player somehow broke in the end (I've dropped it several times and still good, though I keep it in the included rubber case 24/7), I'd replace it in an instant. This product has made me want to consider other Creative MP3 players as an option for a higher capacity player.

<Title>Jogging Partner
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a hard drive based player.  This was not a replacement for that.  I wanted a small flash drive type player that I could take with me jogging.  I love this player.  All the features perform well. NO moving parts so no skipping music.  I can even listen to FM if I want to.  This player is so small that I dont even notice it in my pocket when running.  I did replace the stock headphones with some "sport neckband" type headphones.  Earbuds tend to fall out when running.  The user interface is pretty easy to use.  This is my new running partner

<Title>Great Style, Size, & Functions
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano Plus could be mistaken for a cigarette lighter.  Perfect size for walking around your neighborhood, but if you travel alot for long periods of time, you might want something 4GB and up.  This easily fits into your jeans pocket so you're more likely to carry it around than a 30GB iPod which reminds me of the Palm V I discarded because I didn't want to carry a man purse to hold it.  ;) The trick is to encode in Windows Media format (WMA) instead of MP3.  I converted my 192kps mp3s using WMA VBR 50 setting and you cannot hear much of a difference.  But the file size now is just half of the mp3 file size, so I can fit about 340 songs on it.  BTW, the player only has 980MB usable space, which peeved me to no end (same scam that hard drive makers got sued over). This player has no playlist function and will play songs alphabetically according to file name (not imbedded ID tag).  You can separate song files into file folders and use that as a simple playlist.  For audio books, you should just label your chapters "author - book - ch 01 - title.mp3" to get them to play in order.  Also, re-encode your audiobook files using mono setting.  It'll reduce your file size by half and save you lots of space. I really love everything about this player.  It does scratch easily though.  They give you a rubber case, but it doubles the thickness.  However, it fits nicely in a metal Altoids mints case.  :)

<Title>Very Good MP3 Player - but is it right for you?
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would have given Creative Zen Nano Plus (abbreviated "CZNP") 5 stars, except for two small deficiences: it does not have gapless playback (see #4 below), and the build quality and controls are kind of cheap (see #9 below).  Assuming it lasts, it seems a very good unit for the money.  Here's why I bought mine.  0. Do I want to make a fashion statement with my choice of MP3 player?  Some people will only buy a trendy iPod.  Buying a lesser-known unit like CZNP makes a different fashion statement, especially since you can choose from 12 colors.  I prefer function over form, but CZNP offers some of each.  1. Do I want more than just sound?  The CZNP is a basic MP3 player, FM Radio, and recorder.  It has a simple monochrome display and controls that make it a good choice for playing music, podcasts, and ebooks, and listening to local radio stations.  It can record from the built-in mike or radio, or from a line input, which may be handy at times.  Some players can play videos, show pictures, etc, and cost a lot more because of the required color screen and larger memory.  I don't need these things and prefer not to spend the money needed to get them.  2. Will I be listening to mostly music or mostly spoken content?  When you switch off a unit while it is playing, or pause it and it turns off automatically after awhile, some units will resume at the beginning of the current track, and others (e.g. CZNP) resume exactly where you left off.  If you are playing music, you usually prefer to start the song over again.  For ebooks or long podcasts, I need to resume where it was turned off (like CZNP does), because it is hard to fast-advance back to where you were.  3. What kind of accessories can I get?  Creative has a set of speakers tailored to the CZNP, and there are many generic accessories that will work with it.  By comparison, there are entire catalogs of accessories tailored for optimal use with an iPod (and may not work with others).  I have what I need, but pine for some things available for iPod only.  4. How convenient is it to use?  MP3 players vary considerably on how easy they are to use.  The iPod is famous for ease of use, though it does not do everything I want to do.  The CZNP has relatively cheap controls that work well enough, and does what I want.  You don't have to be a computer whiz to use it or its software.  5. How long will it last?  On Amazon, click the link "See all 109 customer reviews", then look for the dropdown "Show:" and choose "Lowest review first" and click the Go button.  There are a number of reports from people who had problems with their CZNP, some bad enough to throw it away.  Some are real problems, others might be a lack of understanding how to use the player.    Despite these complaints, the average review is high.  You'll find about the same mix of reviews for most players.  I decided to take a chance.  My unit will be well-cared for.  If I have a problem, I'll update this review.  6. Can the battery be replaced?  CZNP uses an AAA battery which is said to last for 15 hours and can be changed easily.  The iPod Nano has a rechargeable battery that is not designed to be replaced, which means the iPod Nano becomes landfill when the battery no longer takes a charge in a couple of years. There will be millions of iPods being thrown away simply because the owner cannot make them continue to work, which has an impact on the environment.  There are now battery replacement kits for iPod, with tools and instructions, so this concern is lessened for DIY people, but most won't bother.  7. How does it sound?  The CZNP sounds very good to when when I use good earphones like Koss "The Plug", or when plugged into a stereo.    The free headphones you get with it won't give you the best sound, and you should not judge the player on how it sounds with them.  Go buy quality earphones for any new player, as this will make a huge improvement in your enjoyment at relatively low cost.  8. Does the player use flash memory or hard-disk for storage?  CZNP uses flash-memory.  Flash memory is more expensive per MB/GB than hard disk memory, and flash memory players are smaller than hard disk players.  I would not want a hard disk, which I think is too heavy and too fragile for a portable player.  Get a hard disk player if you want to carry a lot of content, but make sure you have a backup.  Get a flash memory player if you want to hold the content you will listen to today or this week.  9. Does the player have enough memory?  I think I can have 12-16 hours of MP3 music at highest quality on the CZNP 1GB player, or podcasts (lower quality) up to 32 hours.  With that much space I can have some new or favorite albums left on the player, and have plenty of room for content that changes (like podcasts).  If you don't use a computer regularly, you might want more memory, maybe even a hard disk.  10. Does the player support gapless playback between tracks?  Some albums have music that flows continously from one track to the next.  Examples: Radiohead "OK Computer", Dandy Warhols, Moody Blues.  The listening experience is disrupted if the tracks have a gap as the player switches from one track to another.  I don't know of any portable MP3 player that offers gapless playback (without Rockbox), though it's bound to come.  The CZNP has a brief gap with no clicks, but it is still somewhat disruptive.  One solution is to rip the album as one continuous track.  The Rockbox open-source technology essentially replaces the firmware on your player, and it features gapless playback.  It is supported on a few players, including some iPods, but not CZNP.  11. Does the player require proprietary software or hardware?  CZNP includes software, but it can work like a USB drive, so you can manage content with Explorer / Finder if you want to.  All connectors are industry standard (though the 3/32" stero line input is less common).  As I understand it, iPod can only load music using iTunes, and other players require software supplied with the unit, or with Windows.  The iPod and others also use proprietary connectors, replacing a lost cable is more expensive.  I would not be happy with such restrictions. Open standards promote flexibility and interoperability.  For me, at a minimum, the player needs to look like a USB drive when I connect it to the computer, so that I can load it by dragging files to the player's file system, and the CZNP does that.  I want to have a program automatically create a custom listening program of various short podcasts that play in a particular order to support Radio on Demand, and I want that to happen by simply connecting the device to the computer, with no keyboard or mouse interaction involved.  I have not found such a program, and may have to write it, but I can do that if I want to.  With an iPod I have no choice but to use iTunes (or replace the firmware with Rockbox).  12. Is the player file-based or tag-based?  The CZNP is file-based: it can play songs in alphabetical order for a given folder.  (It also has shuttle, etc.)  I tried the SanDisk Sansa, but returned it because all content is organized and played on the basis of tags, exclusively.  While my music has tags correctly set to play the way I wanted, podcasts don't use tags consistently enough to play them in a particular order that I chose.  With the CZNP you can at least control the order by putting a sequence number at the beginning of each filename.  Tag-based probably have some advantages over file-based, but only if all of the content you want to play is properly tagged.

<Title>VERY FRAGILE--LOVED IT AT FIRST--DOESN'T LAST!!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Purchased the Zen Nano Plus on 09/10/2005 & loved it! It was great for the gym, running, even did voice recordings of my Dad telling family stories--great features/functionality. I liked the whole package. About 2 weeks ago, I found an almost imperceptible crack in the housing next to the headphone jack. Now, I've been very, very careful with this player over the last year--it's always in its little gel case & I never let anyone else touch it. I contacted Creative customer support, and they pretty much told me to go away. Even though I was still within the 1-year warranty, they wanted $25 USD along with the Zen Nano Plus for repair costs---then they told me they might need more $$$ during the repair process, and I would have to come up with it. I did the math---I paid approx. $150 USD for the Nano last year at this time---now, you can find it online for under $70. I was not about to PAY them for the privilege of repairing an item still under warranty. I am more than disappointed. I don't have buckets of $$$ so I can't just run out & buy another MP3 player. The Nano now has a rubber band tightly wound around its middle so the crack won't get larger & the case won't fall off. This defect was NOT due to "normal wear & tear"---this just shouldn't have happened--PERIOD. If I were you, I wouldn't buy a Creative product unless you also purchase an extended warranty from them or from the merchant. Next time, it'll be an iPod or from another company that appreciates its customer base.

<Title>Pass on this one
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Player started shutting itself off just after the actual 90 day warranty period. Good sounding player for the money, but very demanding with the proprietary software. The only way to get it to work now, until my new purchase arrives, is to bang it on a table top. Then after some undetermined period, it will shut itself off again.

<Title>Full of Bugs - Pass for now
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a Creative fan. I have a Jukebox 3 and a MuVo TX FM which I lost and wanted to replace. I purchased a Zen Nano Plus 1GB and it was glitchy. It showed up in my device manager and after 5 min in explorer but it was never accessible.   I'm no dummy (BSEE) and spent about 5 hrs trying to get this USB device to work with no luck. I suggest you visit the creative interactive support site as see for your self the number of people having problems with this particular mp3 player.  I returned mine to Amazon and went and purchased another MuVo TX FM. Plugged it in and it works fine.   Maybe Creative will fix the bugs with this thing but until they do its hit or miss. Some people have no problems and other have problems that can be fixed with good support (another hit or miss) and still others like myself have players that just will not work. Good luck, D

<Content>Don't believe the negative reviews.  I've had two of them in the house for almost 6 months. No problems. They are great for downloading books on tape and music. Some libraries offer free downloads that will work on this Creative Zen Nano.     They are small and easy to carry around---weigh almost nothing! Email:boland7214@aol.

<Title>A perfect MP3 player--size, sound, or durability
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have researched more than a dozen sites and MP3 players before going for this one. The first thing that struck me was the user reviews. Everywhere it has more than or equal to 4 stars. But there are also one or two stars from some users. From my personal experience with CREATIVE music stuff and this awesome mp3 player, I think that most of the negative reviews are driven by malice and by rival companies/people associated with them. Before highlighting the pros and cons of this item, let me make a point here. One thing what amazes me is that this item is SO much in demand that it has been selling like hot cakes since its inception. I am still waiting for my office depot order placed on Sept 14. Inference? This item is the BEST MP3 in terms of demand, cost, and performance. I have owned SANSA M230, and my room mate owns SANSA E140. Both are good, but don't come anywhere close to this CREATIVE Nano plus. Before I begin to appear as a CREATIVE employee myself, let me outline the pros and cons of this MP3 Player.      PROS: awesome sound. I wanted a decent MP3 player with great sound, simple to use, and decent radio. This MP3 gives you that. I listen to songs by keeping the volume LESS THAN HALF of what is given and, trust me, it is still loud.         The radio is great with 32 presets (more than 32 actually because the stations are like '89..89.5...90....90.5....91) So, you can see that it receives more signals that u can imagine. The voice is crystal clear and doesn't shake when in a car or riding a bike (the radio is a bit shaky in SANSA E140)        I was quite apprehensive about the LCD by looking at the reviews all over the net. BUT, once and for all, there is absolutely NO problem with the LCD (I have read numerous reviews complaining that aspect of it). Now, come on. If someone has sight problems, I can understand that. But someone with normal eyesight (I DON'T have 20-20) can read the text that scrolls across the monocrome LCD. Even the battery indicator (three bars) is easily visible.         As for the operation, it is pretty simple. Two buttons on the side are for increasing and decreasing the volume. A scrolling wheel for browsing thru the menus is visible just beside the volume buttons. All you have to do is scroll it once with your thumb to jump a track. That's it. However, if you want to go to settings, equalizers, etc., press the scroll button and the different menus pop up. They are arranged horizontally. So, to hop from one to the other, use the scrolling wheel. It is that simple. Most importantly, you can delete a track you don't like even while you are listening to it!!!   I haven't tried the recording feature of this MP3 player, so I cannot comment on that. But, personally, I am not sure how much I will use that feature.   CONS: the ONLY thing I see as a con is the earbuds. I agree with most other reviewers in this. They are bigger than what you can think. Don't get me wrong; they are CREATIVE earbuds. So, the sound quality is outstanding. But, my ear hurts after half an hour of listening to music. It is like working out in a gym for the first week: if you can see through the pain of the initial period, then everything settles down. I have got used to the earbuds, but I would recommending buying smaller ear buds for extra comfort.    Now, for other bits of information about this MP3 Player. The AMAZON box came with belt clip, arm band, CD, Line out cable, USB cable, one AAA battery. That is pretty much complete package as far as a normal user is concerned. And, ONE VERY IMPORTANT thing: I have read everywhere that how it is difficult to transfer files to and from the MP3 Player. But, with our natural curiosity and counter-institutional nature, we tend to trust ourselves with some things that we shouldn't. The CD hasn't been manufactured for nothing. When CREATIVE says install it on your computer, do it. It takes only 37mb space on your comp. I am an electronic freak and can safely claim to know some things about computers. I use Object Dock, Style XP, etc. to jazz up my computer and know how to format computers, etc. So, if you cannot transfer files from this CREATIVE Nano, then the problem is with you and NOT the player.    My last observation here would be this: if anyone is apprehensive about buying this after reading negative reviews elsewhere, it's your loss. ABOVE ALL, think of this: if this MP3 player had really sucked, it wouldn't have got consistently 4 stars all over and wouldn't have been so frequently out of stock. P.S...IT'S BEEN EXACTLY ONE MONTH SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND HENCE WOULD LIKE TO TELL INTERESTED BUYERS MORE ABOUT THIS ITEM. This is the BEST MP3 player you can have (it is even better than other editions of CREATIVE). The reason is this: only the NANO PLUS give you a radio in this price range. The other ZEN V series nearest to this price range ($79.99) doesn't have a radio. The next edition that has a radio costs around $150 or more. Anyways, this Mp3 player's radio is loud...really LOUD. You have to reduce the usual volume to listen to the radio. And signal of the radio is crystal clear. I stay in a two bedroom apartment and when I close my door, I sill get good signal. Now for the battery life. I listen to music atleast 3 hrs everyday and have only spent 3 Energizer AAA batteries. Also, this playe can hold more than 220 songs (as reported by many online pro reviews). It all depends how well can you compress your song(s): for example, a 112 bit-rate song will obviously hold less space than 128 bit-rate song. I have exactly 209 songs (including Hindi and English) and have more than 200MB of space left in the player. I used the CREATIVE Audigy song compressor system that came with my DELL Laptop. But you can find other compressing softwares in the market. This Nano also has a "Jazz" category in the menu that changes the listening experience (I did not notice it before). Also, there are equalizers to customize how you listen. So, all in all, touchwood, this is a great MP3 player for an even greater price!!!
