<Content>If this was 2002, I'd say "go for it", but today... I must say "don't bother" -- this thing is small and thin, but the interface sucks, and is waaaay out of date. Not to mention 256 Megs is nothing in today's world. Get an iPod or a comperable mp3 player that is more current technology. This thing deserves to have "Hello Kitty" stickers placed on it, and be marketed to kids.   
<Overall>1

<Title>good product, crap headphones

<Content>Although I like the product overall, I'm frustrated with the useless nickel-sized ear buds.  They are very uncomfortable and do not stay in place. If you buy this product, get a pair of ear buds as well
