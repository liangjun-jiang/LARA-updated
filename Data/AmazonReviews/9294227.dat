<Content>Dependable, easy to use.  Comes pre-loaded with songs that are difficult to get off which takes up memeory space.  Good first MP3 for a kid.  
<Overall>4

<Content>This Mp3 has has very good sound qualtiy one thing that got me mad was that it tells in the cover it can hold over 100 songs but it actually depends on the quality of the song. if you want all your songs max quality it only gonna hold about 58 songs.Overall the sound is excellent,(I cant really tell difrrence between sound quality of Ipod and this Mp3).     
<Overall>3
