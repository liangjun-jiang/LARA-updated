<Title>Excellent player...
<Date>Mon Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is truly an excellent player and a great value for money. The player is very pleasant to look at and seems much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye than the USB 2 version. The flip-type case coming with the player is very smart looking- it does have a flaw in that with the case fully closed, one cannot see the LCD screen. I feel that creative should have thought about this and made a slot for the LCD to peer through. The sound quality is EXCELLENT. However, you would need to get new headphones. The ones coming with the player dont do it justice. The player has the same EAX options as the USB 2. One of the biggest improvements is the software. The creative mediasource was a joy to use. The software was able to recognize the ID tags automatically and list each track by its respective title, artist, album, genre etc... This was a major flaw in the playcenter software. The transfer from the PC to zen was flawless. I was really happy with this pleasant improvement. The battery life is amazing too. I am getting around 12-13 hours with one charge. And of course the battery is user replaceable- a huge bonus. Eventually plan to get another battery for those long trips where u cannot charge. However 12 hours should more than suffice for a trip or your daily needs. All in all i think its a great buy and i am nothing short of very happy with the purchase...

<Content>For the money this player is the best available. Great Sound but get better headphones for it. You'll see why when u do. The software however was not as good as the hardware. The creative media source takes too long to download songs to the player. I recommend the notmad explorer instead. Transfers the song faster better interface (adds your jukebox in the windows explorer). Great buy overall

<Title>Incredible sound with a great pricetag!
<Date>Tue Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Nomad Zen NX fully expecting to return it and buy an iPod. I was having a discussion about the two players with a friend and he suggested that I buy the Zen NX. At $200 less than the iPod, I was skeptical but bought it knowing that if I didn't like it, I could always return it. I have to say that he was right! The Nomad Zen NX boasts incredible sound quality (remarkably better that the iPod), a replaceable lithium-ion battery and a stylish look, though not as sleek as the iPod. The sizes and weights of the two are quite comparable.<p>However, I do have a few reservations... I don't like that all the controls are on the sides. There are none on the face of the player. This makes it especially difficult to navigate with one hand.<p>The scroller/button is a nice navigation tool, but you have to press it dead-on to be able to select the items you are shooting for.<p>The bundled software is a pain to deal with especially if you are dealing with a huge MP3 library that you already own. It's all good if your MP3 tags are correct to begin with, but if not, you are in for hours of tedious tag editing. Because the player uses these tags to sort your files into albums. (Save yourself some time, buy a copy of Notmad from Red Chair Software.)<p>The bundled earbuds are a joke as with any other player on the market. Buy good earphones to experience the true quality of this device.<p>The included case is nice, but it's annoying that it covers the LCD screen.<p>I have owned another hard drive based player and liked that it had a drag and drop interface. Each folder became an album. Not so on the Nomad. It would be nice if this was a fix in future versions of the firmware.<p>My advice? If you are looking for superior sound quality, buy the Creative Nomad Zen NX. If you are looking for something more sleek and curvaceous with a super-expensive Apple logo, buy the iPod.

<Title>Excellent player / Mediocre software
<Date>Wed Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am quite tech-savvy and spent hours researching which player to buy.  In the end, my two choices were the iPod and the Nomad Jukebox Zen NX (30GB).  Size- and weight-wise the two players are almost identical.  Capacity-wise, both give you varied options.  Price-wise, however, Apple just makes absolutely no sense.  For $$$$ less, I bought the Nomad and boy am I pleased!  The player is OUTSTANDING -- superior sound, great capacity, sleak design, light, nice faux-leather cover, and an exchangeable battery, which is key!  The only downsides were: 1) The earphones that come with the player are crap, but for under $$$ you can buy great ones from any top brand, and 2) the software.<p>The Creative MediaSource performs well in basic uploading of files to your player, but it does a terrible job with maintaining tag information.  Since I have a huge library, that means either manually editing hundreds of tags or ditching the software completely.  I'm going with plan B!<p>Besides that, however, I recommend the player over the iPod anyday!  Whoever priced the iPod was out of his mind!

<Title>Excellent Value, Excellent Player
<Date>Sun Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is my first mp3 player purchase.  I had toyed around with an iPod at an electronics store and was almost sold on it.  It was just so cool.  But after thinking things over I decided it wasn't worth the price.  So I started looking into the Zen.  I was close to buying it when the Zen NX was announced, so I held out for it.  I am sure glad I did!  I was able to buy it for less than $300, but even for that it's an incredible deal.  30GB, incredible sound (according to professional reviewers it has the best sound of any mp3 player, including the iPod), well-designed navigation, and cool EAX features.  Unlike some people, I didn't have any problem at all with the software it comes with.  However, I had ripped all my software beforehand with other programs, so my ID3 tags and everything were all set.  I only used Creative's program to upload them to my Zen.  My only complaint with the player is the scroll wheel is a little hard to click.  While the screen is small, it's sharp and easy to read and navigate.  In short, this is the best bang for the buck.  It's a good, convenient size, feels solid, comes with plenty of space for mp3s, sounds awesome, and is relatively stylish as well!  Highly recommended for buyers unwilling to waste extra money on style (iPod).

<Title>The only affordable, quality MP3 player on the market.
<Date>Sun Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Why Nomad?<br><br>Like most, I was introduced to mp3 players by my friend with an iPod. My excitement was quickly crushed when I learned of the ridiculous price tag. This was nothing new to me, however, as I'm familiar with computers and know of Apple's legendary price inflation on virtually all their products - a business model that has, and will continue to condemn them to the margins of any market they do business in.<br>In fact, my decision to purchase the Nomad Zen NX was a result of the now-familiar decision making process that most made in the past years regarding Apple computers - although the apple product is in some ways superior, its simply not worth the disproportionately high pricetag. As with their PowerMacs, I simply can NOT justify paying more for less power - I have here a 30GB mp3 player that costs LESS than Apple's 15G player.<p>About the Nomad?<br><br>The Nomad, quite frankly, is more stylish to me than Apple's iPod - but that's maybe because I never got into their all-white aesthetic. The Nomad's audio output strength is simply excellent and the sound quality is superb. Where the Nomad is beaten by the iPod is in the menu system, where the Nomad is a little too heirachical, that is, having to go through levels of menus. However, it's not at all &quot;Bad&quot;, just not as elegant as the iPod. Overall, however, the unit is excellent, and to me is an ideal player - relatively inexpensive, durable (replaceable battery!), stylish, and with quality sound!

<Title>Brilliant Product
<Date>Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had the Nomad Jukebox Zen NX for about 6 hours now, and quite frankly I'm pleased. After hearing from my brother &quot;you know what mp3 player you have to get, the iPod&quot; I saw this one at Best Buy, along with the over-priced iPod, and thought it was a good looking.  I've already had much trust in Creative because I have a set of computer speakers by them, and they're incredible.  <p>I do have three complaints about this product. The first which has already been listed, the scroll button on the side.  I anticipated this going out, so I bought the 2-yr. warranty. Secondly, the first time I turned my Nomad on after charging.  it froze up on me, and I had to reset it.  I'm not sure if that'll happen again. And lastly, the blasted case with no opening in front for the screen.<p>Otherwise, this product is amazing thus far.  I highly recommend.

<Title>New Paradigm in portable tunes
<Date>Sat Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It's got a good beat and it's easy to listen to barely describes this wonderful little machine.  Setting it up takes about an hour and is somewhat confusing but I was ripping CD's with ease in no time.  Other reviewers are correct on the software but I found it useable and functional.  I was able to intuitively grasp the functions without the manual.  After reading tha manual, the rest became clear.  This device does push your PC.  Quite a resource hog.  Keep an eye on the requirements and get what you need before installing.  By plugging in the USB cable, you become another device and are able to see and manipulate the songs.  Quality is outstanding, but only when recording at the higher bit rates.  I finally settled on 224K after ripping about 8 hours worth of CD's.  I erased everything and started over.  I figure I'll get about 3,000 songs instead of the 4,000 at 128K (default).  That's still plenty, believe me.  The &quot;jog&quot; wheel needs to be either beefed up or redesigned.  When building playlists on the fly, your thumb gets sore and the wheel needs to be pushed &quot;hard&quot; to accept your choice.  The ease of taking 800 hours of music with you and playing any song or album in any order far outweighs any negative points.  Get an extra battery!  About the size of a casette walkman but half the thickness.  Heavy though!

<Title>Good Bang for buck!
<Date>Sat Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My three options were to wait for the Rio Karma, the Iriver HD or spend scary money on the IPOD. I needed more than 20G which ruled out the Iriver and as far as the Karma goes, it's expensive, thick, has taken forever to come out and they've got bugs, so I took the creative route and went with the NX. The reason being the quality of sound. After comparing the IPOD to the NX, the sound quality of the NX is far better sounding using Sennheiser PX-200 phones. The replaceable battery is a nice addition and I'm averaging 12-14 hours of battery time. The ipod my sister uses has about 6-7 hours of usage between charges at the most. Yes, the new IPOD is noticeably smaller, but I care about the sound more than the look and the IPOD just didn't do it for me ( distortion, terrible equalizer, 60W compared to the NX's 100W ). Also, the NX you would think is a brick, but it's only 1 1/2 ounces heavier than the IPOD and still looks tiny in my eyes. The biggest attraction was the price and for 30G's, I think I got a good deal especially with the added 3 year warranty I purchased. Negatives are crummy headphones that come with the unit (Don't even bother using them), the Mediasource software ( I purchased Notmad which is brilliant ), the smaller screen, and the case provided which doesn't have a window to view. Small downsides to a solid unit that if stays reliable I won't have any complaints with whatever else comes out. Just think you've got your entire music collection with you no matter where you go. That's brilliant!
