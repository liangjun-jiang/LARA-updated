<Title>Easy to set up and loaded with features
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my MP3 player and was very happy with how easy it was to get started. The unit itself looks terrific - just like brand new - the red metal case is awesome (and doesn't smudge like the black iPods). After charging it up, the easy to follow directions enabled me to quickly load files from WMP10 and start enjoying the music. The color screen is clear and bight and displays my photos well. Its the perfect size for the gym and comes with a protective cover with belt clip. It also came with Sennheiser ear buds that sound and fit great.

<Title>badly remanufactured

<Content>This seemed like a great bargain. It worked adequately for two days, then began various problems. Downloads didn't work, it skipped, etc.   The refund was very prompt.

<Title>It may become a ghost.....
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved this product for 4 months (it does have lots of gadgets that I love) and then.....for no reason at all my computer no longer recognizes it! Rhapsody doesn't recognize it....It's turned into a ghost although I can see it!   I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....

<Title>disappointing

<Content>This mp3 player was great when I first got it. However, I've not had it even a week yet, and it has begun freezing up and having other various problems. I would not suggest this item.

<Title>Do some research
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The refurb unit received looks as new.  Before and after purchase I strongly suggest you look at discussion threads on the misticriver web site.  You need to understand things like "the ums trick", the differences between the firmware in the US version and the asian version of the player, and the kinds of things that other users have had trouble with.  If you buy one, before you load it up with all your music files, load two or three albums or playlists and get a feeling for how it works.  Then, after reading he misticriver threads, go to the iRiver web site, download the updater for the latest firmware, and do a reformat/restore of the player.  You will end up doing it some time in the future, anyway, so learn how to do it before you fill the player up with all your music.  It works, but it has a personality.  The music quality is great into a pair of circa $30 Sennheiser headphones.  The FM tuner is a great plus if you like listening to FM radio.

<Title>Wonderful While It Lasts
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player has wonderful sound quality, is easy to manage, and is lightweight and comes w/ a convenient clip.  Unfortunately, it broke down 5 months after I bought it.  If your willing to spend the money, go for it.  Just don't expect it to last too long.

<Title>ok mp3 player
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yes it is a good value for the money and the belt clip case that comes with the player is a plus. There is no software to download if you already have windows xp or higher. It uses windows media player 10 or higher. Simply plug in and the computer will recognize the player as an external hard drive. I have not tried all of the extras yet, like the photos or downloading data, I just wanted my music on there. And that is where the problem is. I enjoy having playlists. I was able to figure out how to make one playlist but when I tried to make more, it would just overide the first one that I had. There are no true instructions because they expect windows media to be self explaintory. The player is also recognized by napster and music match. both of which I can not manage my playlist. So if you want to download music and ramdomly play your music, get an ipod shuffle, it is smaller.
