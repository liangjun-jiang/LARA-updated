<Content>This is an excellent low-cost MP3 player which will satisfy all "regular" users. The screen is a little small and if, like me, your eyesight isn't what it used to be, it could be a little strain to read it. The user's guide could go a little more in the details, mainly regarding the explaination for all the -tiny- symbols on screen but if you have been using a tape, cd or whatever of anykind in the last 10 years, you'll figure them out very quickly. My requirements when searching for a player were: -Lightweight -No cable to connect on computer -Comfortable memory, expandable if possible -FM radio -Price max $60.00 It took me a couple of days of search on line but I am not disappointed. On the service side, JR Electronics (it came from them) sent it the day after in a BIG box with impressive padding. A big ++ for them. The MP3 power-users will probably want to go with a bigger -more expensive- one but, for myself, I see no need at all to do so and expect to keep this one for a long time.

<Title>Excellent so far two minor flaws
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Exchanged a COBY at $35 for this at at $49.99 at J and R and after a few hitches everything checks out very well.  Sound is very good and the phones provided are excellent.  The Trekstor 2GB can be booted with an SD Card in the slot provided in the side.    The Trekstor iBeat Extension is a class above the COBY for only $15 more -  2 GB instead of 1GB, SD Card slot, and the mike and voice recording very good. The FM seems good too.   Two tiny problems though. The Mike hole is too small and on the side not front so it does not record the person opposite you very well unless aimed intentionally at them. And, the FM seems so far not to be able to distinguish between 89.9 (WKCR) and 90.0 MHz (WKCR with occasional hisses), though perhaps I will find out how to correct this.  The TrekStor is German but made in China and the pleasing texture of the surface material is suede.  Good appearance except for two slightly cheap looking metal controls. The earphones are excellent.  They also provide a neck strap.  This is quality for a bargain price if it continues to perform well.  Smaller and less liable to be snatched than an iPod.  Was going to buy a Sandisk but would have been without a card slot if I had.  The mike is muffled if not pointed at the source which is a big drawback since casual recording from it hanging around your neck looks as if it will not work very well.  Update after three months: Works fine as an MP3 player, except for oddity that sometimes it just stops in midstream even with a newish battery, so you just have to take the battery out briefly and replace, then it works OK.  Nice surface feel and black satin looks still please. With unlimited expansion through SD cards it seems to be a very good answer to the MP3 expansion problem for a low price. But whether it will mike any good recordings remains unknown, since the menu offers difficulties of navigation and the mike trouble with orientation that I cant be bothered to deal with.
