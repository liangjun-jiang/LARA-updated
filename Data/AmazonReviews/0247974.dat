<Title>Good PMP but not the the best out there.
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got both archos av500 and cowon a2, cowon is a better choice for overall expectation, only thing archos over cowon would be the Look(Digital Camera alike) Glossy screen shaper image and video but would be easy to left thumb print, sound whise is average not nearly as good as cowon, no tuner, battery life is half of cowon a2, so i telling u cowon is better than this overall, cowon own this one otherword, get this one if u must insist u wanna tivo alike schedulo otherwise no reason why archos over cowon, *cowon has superior sound, support alot more file just drag and paste, radio tuner, nice case etc..* This thing cost almost the same as cowon so another reason.  I would gave a 4 star when this thing is out at first but now cowon turn the table around.

<Title>The Good, The Bad, And The Down Right Beautiful
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Throughout all of my experiences of shopping for a perfect portable   media player I have decided that no such device exists. The Archos Av 500 is one of the closest to that high standard.      The AV500 has all of the requirements for a great pmp and then some. However, it also has it's flaws. It boosts a monsterous 4 inch LCD which is one of the biggest save for the Archos AV700 (that supports a lousy resolution).     I purchased the 30GB model and I was impressed right off the bat with the power of the videocorder function but was unimpressed with the fact that there is no middle ground between the 30GB model and the 100GB model memory wise. I really wanted a 60GB version that cost somewhere in between the two.      The movies look spectacular when you connect a dvd/vhs/tv input and record at the right settings, I didn't even try to go the computer route because the AV500 has such a simple recording interface that there is no desire to use the computer as a middle man between the dvd and the Archos. Several dozen recordings later, I thought about attempting to go the computer way and I found a very interesting peice of info that I would like to pass on to you. The resolution recording settings on the archos are VGA (640x480) and a lower version of 512x(something I forgot). However, the screen resolution is 480X272. When the archos has to shrink the picture, it causes some distortion in the picture quality. This happens because there aren't enough pixels for the video resolution. The archos then decides whether or not to show some of the pixels and when the camera is moving or there is a particuarly large amout of detail on the screen then the garbage quality is shown on the screen. If you can find a good dvd to avi converter program (I used the "dvd to pocket pc" program from www.pqdvd.com) then I recomend that you set the settings to have the output resolution to be exactally 480x272. I did this and I recieved a picture resolution that I thought was literally DVD quality. It blew me away! Note: If you go this route then you cannot use the cropping feature.   If you dont want to go that way, then use the onboard recording feature. Be warned that it is very possible to make the recording look like crap so pay close attention.  The way to avoid this is to set the resolution at VGA and keep the KBS at 1500 (the files become a size that about 16-18 movies can be stored on the AV500). This sweet spot is my key to making the movies that I record look on par with DVDs on my AV500's screen (not a tv output). I encountered some glitches (the AV500 randomly froze during a recording process)that caused me to worry at first but several recordings later and I forgot all about them.      One secret hidden feature that I had no idea about was the editing feature of video files. Due to the fact that I wanted as many movies on my Archos as possible and that I typically only watch the action sequences, I was able to cut out all of the scenes of Anakin Skywalker and Padme in Star Wars Episode III to make a 45 minute movie that jumped from one action sequence to another. I am now able to get all of the aciton from any movie into one file roughly 300-700MBs which allows me to fit 50-60 movies on my Archos.     The photo feature is OK. I say "ok" as a way of being nice. The photo feature is there so i can't really complain. However, it sucks. The photo feature has very limited zoom function that becomes quite annoying. The load times are delayed just slightly which made the device seem a bit slow compared to the fact that it can record a tv signal at VGA resolution with 2500 kbs and sound at 48khz.     The device went above and beyond on the music standards. The AV500 automatically sorted all of my music files into categories such as Artist, Genre, Album, ect. The music from the headphones sounds nice but the built in speaker comes up just a little bit short, a very little bit. The control of a built in equalizer was also a very nice touch.     One of the flaws that I came across was the USB host and what it could connect to. My deepest desire was to connect the AV500 to a portable USB hard drive and cut a corner to save me money from spending 700 dollars on the 100GB version but that plan failed. The AV500 flat out didn't recognize the hard drive. The Archos will however connect to a digital camera and a desktop hardrive but no portable ones.     The feel of the Archos (which I should have probably talked about at the beginning of this review) is that of a peice of solid metal except for those lousy buttons! The face buttons of the AV500 are the worst part of the whole device. I can't stop giggling them while I am watching my non-stop action movies.     All in all, the AV500 is the best gadget for your buck. It has it's minor flaws but the tought of overlooking them isn't really that bad. The AV500 out performed every single other pmp that I have tried and belive you me, my quest for the perfect pmp has driven me to nearly try every single one.  (...)

<Title>NEVER BUY AN ARCHOS PRODUCT!
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had problems as soon as I opened the box. The player keeps freezing during play, data becomes corrupt, the sound is of poor quality, and advertising up to 20 movies storage space is not possible. The most I could ever get on my player was 5, and that was when the playback quality was set on low. I tried to have it serviced just 2 months into a 1 year "warranty" and they said it was going to cost me $150.00 to repair. If you purchase this product, you will be sorry!

<Title>Great video but difficult to manage audio with non-WMP applications
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this little beauty for about three weeks now and have been very pleased with the functionality of the video recording and playback on the device itself and onto TV monitors. But for Mac or iTunes users I've noticed two major inconveniences--most annoying, with audio file management.  VIDEO: For Mac users, you may have to do a little research to find the best avi codec to be able to read your video files in QuickTime or VLC.  If you have a PC, it's a synch because it actually comes with the software that directs you to the right codec, but that's not a good enough reason to make your main system a PC.  One mediocre codec can be found at divx.com, but it's not as stable as I'd like in QT.  AUDIO: Archos is designed to sync with Windows Media Player.  Why, I don't know, but for those of us who are used to iTunes or even Winamp (like on my unreliable sony vaio), managing and playing music is a bit of a pain.  The biggest ouch is that it won't play aav (mp4) music files, which means you would have to convert these to mp3--potentially time consuming.  Secondly, I have been frustrated with trying to create multiple playlists on the Archos.  It might do this automatically when synced with WMP, but it doesn't sync with iTunes the way an iPod does, primarily in that it doesn't automatically create playlists.  I tried the plugin that Archos provides for iTunes and the dang thing read my external hard drive instead of the Archos.  Another really frustrating thing is that every time I want to make a new playlist from the music folder, I have to turn the bugger off for the previous playlist to go away.  Just not inconvenient or intuitive!  In terms of music management, Archos is no match at all for an iPod--IF you're an iTunes user.  I do still give this device 4 stars, though, because it's been loads of fun to do video work with.

<Title>Research proves itself
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, so I spent A LOT of time researching different PVPs online and the Archos AV500 came up as top in its class.  Still, after all of my research, I was a bit skeptical in purchasing this device, as there were some obvious cons.  I took a deep breath and shelled out the $500 at a local retail outlet and have never been happier with a gadget as I am now.  This little device is tops.  A solid (i.e. metal) casing houses this PVP which is capable of not only audio and video playback, but recording of both as well.  The first thing I tested was the mp3 player portion of this toy.  Once plugged in via a USB 2.0 port, my computer recognized the device right away and it was as easy as dragging and dropping the audio files into the Music folder on the AV500.  In mere seconds I have loaded the AV500 with about 10 full CDs worth of music.  Unlike some mp3 players, the AV500 quickly (seconds) sorts through its new files after being unplugged from the PC.  My wife has RAVE mp3 player and it can take up to 5 minutes to sort through new files after you toss them in there.  The AV500 was waaaaaay faster.  Playback on audio files is a breeze with the easy to use nav buttons on the face of the AV500.  You can search by file name, artists name, song name, and even music genre.  If you're as anal about your mp3 files as I am, you've probably associated images of the albums to them.  Well, the AV500 will pop those graphics up on its 4 inch screen while playing the tune.  Playback features include random and repeat.  There is a built in, mini EQ, but I didn't mess too much with that.  I did notice that while playing back thru an outside audio source, such as through a car or home receiver, it is best to turn down the volume on the AV500 to about 75% in order to get the best playback.  I've read some reviewers who noticed some noise in the background during playback, but this seems to be avoided if you reduce the volume on the unit itself.  (It also helps if you properly encode your mp3s for optimum playback...don't whine and complain about hissing and background noise if you encode anything under 128.)    Now onto the video....Amazing.  The 4 inch (wide)screen does make this device larger than an IPod, but at the same time, this is not to be confused with a simple mp3 player.  This is a portable DVD player.  It took all of 2 minutes to hook up the AV500 to my DVR and start the recording process.  The TV docking pod acts as a gateway between your DVR (or DVD, VCR, cable box, etc.) and tv, allowing you set it up and forget about it.  Recording is as easy as plugging your AV500 into the docking pod and pressing one button.  I have yet to fool around with the timer options, as I have a home DVR for that purpose, but if I am watching something on my DVR and decide that it's a keeper, I can easily record it into my AV500 and watch it on the go, or even transfer it into my PC and burn it to a DVD.  One downside that I discovered too late was that the AV500 will not playback ITunes video files.  I realized this a tad too late, as I had already purchased and downloaded about 6 episodes of The Office.  Oh well.  The AV500 is 100% compatible with Microsoft's PlayForSure music sites, but the video offering on these sites is limited.  I also sprung for a car mount for the AV500.  $22 w/ s & h off of EBay...not a bad deal.  Other options that I have yet to play with include: TV playback - watch files from your AV500 on your television Remote control Picture viewing Video editing tools Playlist creation  The only cons I can think of are minor 1)	It would be nice if the buttons on the face were backlit.  Very tricky to maneuver in the dark. 2)	The inability to browse the AV500 files while listening to music.  The minute you try to do so, the music stops, but with the built in resume feature it quickly picks back up right were it left off. 3)	The inability to play ITunes videos.  Maybe one day in a firmware update they will address this issue.  All in all, this is a fantastic little gizmo that does a lot.  I know that PVPs are fairly new to the marketplace and with time they can only get better, but for a first generation device, this one does fantastic.

<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, its bigger and heavier than an IPod,  but its worth it.  Add to it that you can use WindowsMedia Player to load and sync  your files instead of that stupid ITunes crap.  So much more control over my files. Music (and more) just the way I want it, not the way that someone else thinks I  want it.  I wouldn't trade it for a hundred IPods.

<Title>Archos knows how to make a great PVP
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...or in this case a true "Mobile DVR."  The Gmini is an awesome device and the Archos AV500 is like it's slightly larger brother with a fantastic 4" widescreen.  It comes complete with a docking station giving it DVR  capabilities and it makes transferring video to this device extremely simple - literally plug and record directly to it.  You can record from DVDs or timeshift and use it like a DVR and record TV shows directly.  Personally I prefer converting the files myself as the video looked better than my first shot at direct recording from DVD.  This also comes with a nice custom case, and all the needed A/V cables.  Did I mention the awesome screen?  Excellent product.

<Title>Now THIS is TiVo to Go
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product gets compared to the iPod Video a lot.  Well, I have both (actually my daughter has the iPod).  If you've got TiVo like we do (or any DVR), the Archos is by FAR the better unit.  Why?  Because it can record DIRECTLY from the video feed.  No messing around with transferring first to a PC, transcoding, etc...  The Archos lets you just plug into the TV and go.  And you can still transfer to and from your PC - very easily - if you prefer to watch there.  I can tell you from the nightmares I've had trying to move TiVo to the iPod that there's simply no comparison.  I'm not picking on the iPod - other PVRs (like the Creative) would have the same issue.  The Archos, as far as I know, is the ONLY unit that lets you skip the computer entirely - which avoids a whole lot of hassle.  It's also a very good music player (and picture viewer).  Yes it's a bit big - you wouldn't go running with it - but as my 'airplane solution' for music and video, it's awesome.  Quality is top-notch as well.  Just buy it.

<Title>Good product, poor service.
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item a few month ago, at the time on Archos' webpage for this item it claims you can attach a digital minicam to it and record live video clips, I have other devices that does exactly what Archos AV500 does, and 80% of the reason I bought AV500 is because of the minicam.  After I got the AV500, made sure everything works correctly, I placed an order via their web store for a digital minicam, now a few month later they sent me an email saying they are not selling the minicam anymore. Now, I didn't exactly check their webstore everyday, but I doubt that the digicam for AV500 was ever sold in the U.S., yet they advertise that item as a feature of AV500 on the U.S. website. And they are still selling PAL version of the digicam all over Europe.  The charger mysteriously stopped working after a month, actually it'd work for about 10 seconds right after you plug it in, then it'd stop charging, I am no expert but it looks like there is a bad capacitor in there, I didn't bother to look for the warrenty papers, instead I place an order online for the charger, that item, too... took them literally months to ship.  I don't have any problem with that product, it just that without the digicam they cheated out of me, it's just another personal DVR like the others I have... now it's just sitting there collecting dust.

<Content>I love this thing.  It is just perfect for doing everything I want to do - to watch my shows where and when I want to.  It took a little time to figure it all out, but it wasn't very hard.  It is just like learning how to use your dvr and hooking that up.  If you have limited time and want to control your options, this is a good choice, and the picture quality is excellent.  I also recommend getting the travel cable, to increase your options.

<Title>They have a problem
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have purchased archos DVRs before and was looking forward to using the AV500. It is true that it has a very nice screen, and it plays the file types that I need. However, within a few days of purchase, the battery stopped taking a charge. After some fiddling, I reluctantly returned it to Archos. It came back after a few weeks, and I was very surprised to see that the content that I had on it was still there! What kind of fundamental repair was this, I wondered. In fact, the device exhibited exactly the same behavior as it had when I sent it out--literally nothing was changed. I reluctantly returned it again, and have been waiting six weeks for a fix. Their customer service is abysmal and keeps changing their story (next week, Christmas delay, etc.) I have now attempted to get a refund, and have been told by Amazon that my period for refund has expired. I have had the device for about two days in total and it hasn't worked, period. I am attempting to get a refund from archos and this really is not acceptable for a device this costly. Don't buy this.

<Content>I bought this 2 days ago and it does everything I wanted.  Record TV, playback onto TV, transfer files from my Digital cam, and rename, move, and delete files on the go, etc..  I love the fact that you can connect it to your computer as a hard drive and just drag and drop files.  I hated having to sync everything on iTunes.  But if you like syncing, you can with Windows Media Player.  You can also "browse" your music files and go through the folders as you have them created (if you did create them) or search by Artist, Album, Genre, etc.  I personally like the folders much much better.  Pictures/videos look fantastic with it's 4" screen and sound quality is great as well (I havn't yet bought great headphones to really test it).  The built-in speakers are nice and clear, but fairly week, so you'll need a quiet room if you intend on using it.  I did my research and this one appeared best for it's price (you can find it for $300).

<Title>DON'T BUY AN ARCHOS!!!
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my daughter.  Within a month after Christmas the battery failed to charge.  I contacted Archos and had to return the unit and not just the battery.  I was also informed that I would probably not get the same unit back.  I received a different unit that contained the previous owners recordings.  This took approximately 2.5 weeks.  Ten days after receiving the refurbished unit back, the hard drive failed.  I contacted customer support and requested that I receive a new unit and not a refurbished one.  I was informed that that was probably not possible.  I find this pretty poor support for a product with a price tag as high as this.  Because I am beyond the 30 day return period from Amazon I have no choice but to work with Archos.  I would not recommend this product or any Archos product for that matter and would warn future customers to purchase a different brand.

<Content>A very beautiful and inteligently built mp3 and pvp. very sharp picture and colors are really great to enjoy but.........but bad and discouraging thing about it comes with a full sized remote without markings, u keep guessing which button does what function and the other thing is its disk type docking station and with that u can not stand straight your DVR on yr table or on top of yr TV or any other surface and in that case your remote wont take any command either and thirdly connecting cables for docking station to TV,VCR,DVD are so short u may need to put your docking station very close to out signals of TV,VCR,DVD or whatever to make it work and lastly battery life is 8 to 10 hours at the most and not as claimed 17 hours. If u buy it buy additional battery for sure...........I returned the item after 10 days, what will u do i wont comment.......very plus of it is quick and easy vedio or audio recording from any source.... and despite of all shortcomings I give it 4 star rating hoping that manufacturer will remove them which is very posssible to make it loveable of every one.

<Title>Great Device, especially for Dish Users
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my unit for about one year.  It's still going strong with no technical issues or problems charging the battery.  Because it's a hard drive unit, I would NOT drop it though.  This device kicks any ipods butt (making video ipods a joke) and for Dish Newtwork users, it rivals any Video unit including the Iphone as far as video options. Very few PMDs have the screen resolution of this unit either.  Those of you who have a Dish Network DVR will love this unit. All your standard definition TV recordings on your Dish DVR can be transfered to your unit 15X faster than playback time.  Instead of taking an hour to record an hour show into your unit, you can tansfer an hour show to your unit in only 5 minutes or less using your USB port.  I love using my Dish DVR to record new movies from HBO/Showtime, etc.  You can also record Sirius radio stations (I auto record Sirius Bests 36 for 2 hours nightly) to your Dish DVR and transfer it to your unit.  That's new Sirius music mixes everyday plus your own CD collection.  To my knowledge, these units are the only PMD that connects to a DVR unit through it's USB port.  This unit is the mid-sized unit.  It truly is a Pocket Dish in that it will fit in you pocket while still providing a large view screen.  The larger unit offers a bigger picture, but will not fit in a pocket, making it a little less portable.  The smaller size is portable, but with less view screen.

<Content>This is a way cool little player. I love the huge screen and 30gb is comparable to the Zune but will fill up fast. The controls are a little flaky, but all in all, great bang for the minimal buck. HOWEVER, I purchased a refurbed unit, which is probably all that's available, and the display went out within 1 day. Archos was good about warranty (save your proof of purchase), but the Amazon vendor (Big City Direct) was useless and took forever to respond. Either way, it was a week and a half before I got the unit back from Archos (paying shipping one way), during which time I kind of wished I'd picked up a Zune.

<Content>I have owned and used this product for 2 years now and absolutely love it. In my personal opinion, this is the last of the best video players/recorders Archos ever made. After the AV500 series, Archos went the way of the Gen 04/05 series and a dearth of accessories, sad indeed. Back to the AV500. It handles all DivX files 3/4/5/6 (with mp3 audio), XviD and WMV. I use it everyday on the subway and it never leaves my laptop bag. One of my best likes is the fact that it uses a removable battery, regular mini-USB connector, comes with an assortment of extra accessories including USB-host cable, leather case, A/V cables, DVR dock.  Since it is a mass storage device, one can simply drag and drop. No proprietary software required and great for Mac users like me. At first, the user controls need some getting used to but once one is up to speed, it's like second nature. LCD screen is a marvel to behold and is very crisp. I always have people (even the iPod crowd) being wowed at the quality of the gorgeous 4 inch screen. Also, it is one of Cnet's highest Editor's choice gadget in its class.

Much better than keeping up with portable DVD players and discs.  Compact for travel.  I have only had it "freeze up" once and I just held the off button down until it rebooted.  Worked perfectly after that.  Highly recommend.  Hopefully price will come down as with all electronics that are new....still a good purchase.
