<Content>Over all, I'm impressed by this little player.  The screen gives very descent video quality, the built-in speaker is loud and clear, and the video conversion software is simple and easy to use.  The provided instruction manual is absolutely useless, it's a series of seemingly random words in what I can only assume is supposed to be English; but the menus and navigation are very simple and loading files onto the player is also very simple.  Over all: two gigs of easy video and music playback for a great price.

<Title>Not half bad

<Content>This player is great for the deal.  Like the other person said, the manual is useless unless you can actually make out what it says.  I have owned it for a few months and it has worked pretty much perfectly.  The charger was kinda cheap and broke almost immediately, but i charge it on my computer with the USB cable. File transfer takes about 5 min for a complete cd.  All in all a great buy if a 2gig is all you need.
