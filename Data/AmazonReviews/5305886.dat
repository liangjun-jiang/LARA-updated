<Title>Plays for Sure -- NOT!
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the iRiver T30 1GB after researching extensively, mostly based on the "plays for sure" feature. The idea is to be able to play all your legally bought, legally downloaded (from MSN Music) songs on a player that is compatible with the whole MSN system -- Windows Media Player, etc.  I was therefore extremely aggravated and disappointed when the T30 wouldn't play any of my MSN downloaded music, or even some other .WMA files.  I spent hours trying to "fix" the problem, then discovered via an online search that this is a KNOWN problem with the T30.  It sounds great.  I like everything about it -- except that I can't play all of my music on it.  Buyer Beware!

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased the T30 to replace my Creative Zen Micro which had bit the dust. I wanted a player that would be easy to use for working out and simple to take anywhere. The T30 has managed that and more.I love just hanging it around my neck and listening anywhere. I have XP and WMP10 - but I use Napster and Yahoo to transfer music, they both seem to work better than WMP10. The battery seems to have a good life, and the sound is great. If I had one complaint it would be not being able to do playlists. This might be possible but I have not figured it out yet. The firmware updates were a slight pain - it amounted to doing a manual update first which was hardly difficult. I am fairly computer adept - but nothing was overly difficult. Hey for $99 this little machine rocks. After I got mine - I bought one for my daughter and my brother bought 3 for his family. My husband is waiting patiently for me to order one for him too. Basically we were very happy and satisfied with the T30.

<Title>Great product, efficient and looks nice
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  I decided to buy this instead of the Ipod Shuffle because two things: - The screen where you can navigate the songs you have in the playlist. - You can replace the AAA by yourself.  The battery life is very good and overall the product is great... I bought this to use it during my work out sessions, so if you intend to use it for this, I suggest you buy the armband too.   Very easy to use, looks nice and the earphones are good enough (if you have small ears you might feel the included ones a little bit uncomfortable)... and the other "complaint" about the earphones is that the color doesn't really match with the rest of the iRiver (the iRiver is read and black, and the earphones are gray), but this doesn't affect my decision to give it 5 stars.

<Title>Excellent - but Rhapsody-to-go set-up was a bit tricky.
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We bought this to use with the Rhapsody-to-go service. We'd been waiting a while for a compatible flash player and so we were excitied to see a bunch of them come out about the same time. We went for the T30 because we'd had good experience of iRiver players in the past.  Overall - we're really pleased with this player. Sound quality is very good as is normal with iRiver players. The controls are a little counter-intuitive, but fine with a little practise - another iRiver trait.  Only real issue was getting it set up to work with Rhapsody-To-Go. This involved an upgrade of the Rhapsody client (which was straight-forward), and a firmware upgrade of the player (which should have been straight-forward but wasn't). Everything's working now but only because I'm a techie geek. Non geeks might have struggled.  Oh - and to all of the reviewers that complained about the non-compatability with Windows 2000, its because modern music services like Rhapsody and Napster use DRM software for copyright protection and it isn't available for your obsolete operating system. Windows 2000 was replaced five years ago - its a bit unfair to mark down a product because you've decided not to move with the times.

<Title>Firmware upgrades permit MPS or UMS
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sometime in the last few months, IRiver has issued firmware upgrades that permit the user to select USB Mass Storage (UMS) firmware or Microsoft's Media Transfer Protocol (MPS).  Initially, the firmware only supported MPS and that ment using Windows Media Player 10 on a WinXP system to syncronize files between the PC and the T30.  If you have ever used Windows Media Player 10, then you know already how difficult and peculiar that software can be.  IRiver listened to its customers and finally released firmware for both UMS and MPS users.  With UMS, its drag and drop just like my other MP3 player.  Using UMS is liberating to say the least.  I guess someone likes MPS, perhaps the marketing guys at MS.   Overall, with the new firmware, its a very decent MP3 player with very good battery life. Anyway, thought you might want to know.

<Title>Read This!!!!
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just found a way to get around having to use Windows Media Player. Good thing, because I was just about to give the player away. Using Windows Media Player, there is no way to organize the music in folders (playlists), so you can just go from folder to folder without thumbing through all the songs in each folder. What I did was upgrade to the latest firmware, and then I double-clicked the player in "my computer" and opened the data file. Then I just dragged and dropped the folders into the data file. All of the music shows and plays in the folders I arranged it in. iRiver makes good players that can be a pain.

<Title>Nice player if you upgrade the firmware
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was one of the first 1GB flash players that supported subscription music services.   When I initially purchased this player, I disliked it. It wouldn't play OverDrive audio books (32kbps), and does not sort files well. I tried the early firmware upgrades, and they did not fix the audio book problem. However, the recent upgrades now support lower-quality audio, AND firmware 1.71 supports Audible.   I don't mind the default MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). It was frustrating at first, but if you use playlists as documented in the user guide, MTP works fine. If you don't like it, you can now switch to UMS (USB Mass Storage) which allows you to use the T30 like an external hard drive.  One thing that still really annoys me is the battery cover. It falls off all the time.

<Title>A good little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I read the reviews here and elsewhere, and noted that the newer firmware versions allow transfers to the T30 as an external "flash" drive, so decided I'd give it a try. So far it has played everything I've tried exceptionally well, no problems. This includes audiobook MP3s (non-DRM) and music MP3s. I've not tried WMA or OGG yet, as I've seldom used them. The software that comes with the player automatically updates the firmware, making this a hassle free task. There are now cheaper 1GB players out there, however this one works just fine and being from iRiver looks as though it will have ongoing support and firmware upgrades for sometime to come - something cheaper no-name players often lack.

<Title>Decent player with problematic Audible file implementation
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for a "do-it-all" player for music, voice and audiobooks. Although the iRiver T30 handles the first two functions pretty well, I advise you not to buy this unit for its support of Audible files. In this mode it works (sort of), but I have discovered several very annoying quirks.  As soon as I use the voice recording feature, the unit:  1) Will not save bookmarks in an Audible file.  2) Will not retain the last position in memory when I exit from an Audible file.  When this happens, the only solution I have found is to completely reformat the device and reinstall the operating system.  As well, when the unit's battery runs out in the middle of listening to an Audible file, the entire file is no longer recognized by the player. I must load a new copy of the file to continue.

<Title>Excellent player.  Exactly what I needed
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player to take on a trip.  I knew that I would be away from a computer, could not "recharge" the battery so that took away the IPOD line that requires access to a PC. This unit has a SINGLE AAA battery.  I bought a pack of LITHIUM AAA batteries for the trip and knew that I could always buy more if needed.  (At home I use rechargeable AAA batteries so the cost for playing is minimal.)  For the two week trip, I loaded my player with old time radio shows, 2 audio books from audible.com (each one more than 25 hours of play) and lots of music. To use the books, I had to connect to the manufacturer's website and upgrade the installed software. Took minutes. Once I did, the books worked great. Could even bookmark my spot and come right back in.  The 13 hour plane flights and days of train travel was made even more pleasant with this little player. The books tend to use more battery time than music, but I still got more than 20 hours of play from regular alkalines and close to 30 on lithium.  The sound quality is superior to some MP3 players I tried, even without using the built-in graphic equalizer. I used the regular earbuds it comes with for a couple weeks (very nice quality) then switched to a LARIAT style headset so I only had one set of cords around my neck.   The buttons are large enough and spaced well so the controls are easy to use. The backlit feature is adjustable in brightness and for how long it stays on. Plugged in a set of speakers (available at any drug store for portable cd player) to this unit at my office and so everyone can here what is on my player.  I HIGHLY recommend this player!  There is NOTHING missing on this player. You will not have to settle when you get this player.

<Title>Nothing to Gloat About
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for an easy to use, low capacity MP3 player that I could easily take with me anywhere. This player fit what I was looking for so I ordered it. Unfortunately, when I received the player it wasn't what I had hoped for. I will tell you the main reasons for this:   Software: I installed the driver easily and my pc easily detected the device. I ran into problems however, because I could not sync the device to my Windows Media Player. The player comes with Media Player however, it is an older version which didn't really agree with my pc for some reason.   Sound: The sound quality was rather poor especially with the radio.   Radio: The device did not pick up radio frequencies very easily even in areas where I know the frequency is strong.   Control Buttons and Menu Instructions: Not so easy to understand.

<Content>Incredibly frustrating.  I was quite happy with my T30 until I recently upgraded my windows media player to version 11.  It became IMPOSSIBLE to add any new music.  There is a firmware upgrade on the iriver website, which I downloaded and installed three times.  It just doesn't work!  I managed to solve this problem only by rolling back to WMP 10.   BTW, I emailed iriver customer support about this problem and waited 17 days for a response.

<Title>great sound
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i orginally wanted a voice recorder to record my D&D group's 10 hr + long sessions, which demanded a larger size availabilty, with at least reasonable sound quality.  I've taken this with me to a trip to visit my brother, and went with his band unit to some schools for an "intro to the instraments" type performance.  i recorded the 3 performances i attended, and wow! resonable size files and excellent recording quality at just the medium setting.  His band now wants a copy.  My only real con for the entire product is that i wish i could use removeable media such as an SD card, but 1GB makes up for that (kinda), a rechargeable lithium battery would be nice too.  the manufacurer (iRiver) has on their website the user manuals for all their products, and support, including the ones not found at their online store, but great for researching to find the product to best fit your needs

<Title>excellent sound quality
<Date>Tue Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my T30 for about 6 months and have used it extensively. I bought it because it has excellent sound quality. I listen to classical and acoustic music from reference quality recordings and always use high bit rate MP3s using good encoders (LAME 3.97). The earbuds it comes with are about average (crappy) but I use Etymotic ER-6 phones which are absolutely fabulous especially for classical music. The T30 has plenty of power to drive the ER-6 to levels beyond what my ears can handle.  The iRiver T30 sounds better than other MP3 players, both subjectively and objectively. I measured the frequency response, noise and distortion and found it to be excellent. With all EQs disabled, frequency response is within 0.5 dB of flat from 20Hz to 20 kHz and within 0.25 dB of flat for most of this range. Noise is below -90 dB and distortion is -70 dB or lower. This is as good as any MP3 player gets.  Playing high quality VBR files (LAME 3.97, VBR V0), the T30 goes for about 16 hours with a NiMH AAA 1000mAH rechargeable. Firmware upgrades are smooth & easy and it can operate in UMS mode which works on all operating systems and enables it to be a USB drive for generic file storage. It also records, which I haven't used much but is a nice plus.  1 GB isn't enough for anyone's entire music collection, but even with high quality MP3s it's more than enough for the 1 week business trips I take. I reload it with new music for each trip. It transfers files at about 3 MB / second so it takes about 5 minutes to transfer the entire 1 GB.  In short - it's compact and durable with the best sound quality you can get in an MP3 player. And it's inexpensive - can be found for well under $100 if you shop around.

<Title>piece of junk
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a different iriver, the ifp 899 which was apparently made before iriver decided to save money every possible way they could, in order to maximize their profits.  the T30 costs almost the same as the 899, but has all the worthwhile features taken out.  You have hardly any control over the quality of the recording you make, way less ability to navigate--you name it and it is NOT in this machine.  Not only that, but after a few months of VERY light use, it started making corrupt recordings which makes it a huge hassle to load them onto my computer and compress them.  Plus, recorded files are ENORMOUS unless you use the "low" quality recording setting--and then their quality is rotten

<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my T30 for about 3 years now. I love the sound quality! It's the best I have ever found in a player of this size. I've tried the SanDisk c150 and another no-name brand which neither could equal the sound quality here. I had to replace the earphones as this type irritates my skin and will cause infections. I always end up buying a different set of earphones like the Sennheiser CX300 which have soft inserts, but that's just me; most will probably be OK with the included phones. My first complaint is that the navigations are not very easy to use. I prefer the setup that comes on the Sansa c100 series which is similar to the iPod. I would love to see this unit revamped to include SD Card capability and a better user interface. My second complaint is that you can't drag and drop files to the unit; you are forced to use WMP or something similar to manage the songs.

<Title>Terrible customer service!!!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A year or so ago I was given an I-River mp3 player by my then girlfriend/now wife as a gift and was thrilled by the sound quality and size/weight, not to mention the fact that by buying I-River I wasn't supporting the all-consuming i-pod hysteria that seemed to be taking over the world. The honeymoon thereafter was wonderful, and lasted up until about 2 months ago, when inexplicably the I-River went into full crash mode, allowing me only the insignia, and nothing else. When I called the I-River customer service, I was notified that since I had no proof of purchase (my wife had lost the receipt) that I would be relegated to paying for technical service (59.99, paid in advance), even though it was well under the two year warrantable period. I was treated rudely at that time, but I understood that it was my fault for not having the receipt and gladly accepted my fate in the hands of their outsource technicians, AV Sense, based in California. The only problem-AV Sense is TERRIBLE!!! They don't explain their procedure for returns (except that you have to send them the $60 via web portal/ Paypal first, before they can answer any questions), their web support is sketchy, with non-existent representatives and no phone numbers for direct access, and when you do get in touch with them, they seem as confused as you. After re-sending it to them twice (and finally digging one of their personal phone numbers out of the bowels of the internet) they sent me back, once again, an mp3 FULL of glitches that once again crashed only days after receiving it. My attempt to contact a real customer service representative from the actual I-River company ended at Peter, who claimed to be the top of the totem pole for complaints and dissatisfied customers. Certainly he would care that a loyal, honest I-River customer had been put through unnecessary headache over and over again, right? Nope. Peter wasn't the least bit concerned, even after I'd calmly and articulately detailed the ordeal, about anything I'd been through.  He didn't seem the least bit concerned that the tech support company he and his company were sending their customers to was wholly incompetent. There wasn't even an `I'm sorry' tone in his voice. He simply said `too bad', and when I asked if I could please contact his supervisor by either email or phone he again said `no, I don't want to give that information out.'  The moral to the story is, if this is the way I-River customers are treated, and this is the kind of support they're giving for their products, perhaps I should rethink my disdain for I-Pod. At the very least, I'm sure they're outsource techs are more competent. And I'm sure they're customer representatives are better trained and more respectful than young Peter.   Just my opinion.

<Title>troublesome little gizmo
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound is good, the transfer of files to and from the laptop are easy enough.  My problems:  * There are only a few buttons to do many things.  What the button does depends on how many times you click it (sort of like double-clicking a mouse), and which menu, and what stage of that menu, you're in.  Only, the buttons don't always seem to work as they should.  So you're always navigating about all sorts of menus and submenus that you don't really want to be in, seeking the menu you want.  * The screen is tiny.  And though it's lit in blue, the lighting doesn't last long.  You can't ponder the menu long before it goes dark.  Maybe iRiver figures that if you're over 40, you're not a valuable consumer for MP3s anyway, so who cares whether you can easily see the menu or not?  Trying to read the menus (impossible at nightime), and then navigate about the menus, clicking and double-clicking, is a frustrating experience.  I'd prefer an MP3 recorder with more dedicated buttons (i.e., buttons that each do only one thing), and a bigger, brighter screen.

<Content>Update on 12/06: I can finally use explorer to find the file. It's a good unit now.  Ken  I got the Clix gen2 but found that line-in recording required me to but another accessory (the cradle).   For Clix gen2, I need to use both the player and the remote to do line-in recording. With this device, the operation is much simple (check the "Ask Alice" support in the Iriver website).   I used the T30 to record music from a CD. The quality is good. Everything will be recorded in mp3 format.  The only problem I had was I couldn't transfer music back to my PC. I record a sermon in mp3 format and tried to upload it to my church website but I couldn't do it. I couldn't see it from Explore so I couldn;t transfer the file. I wish someone can tell me how to do it (it's difficult to get support from Iriver if you cannot find answer in the FAQ section).

I had no trouble setting it up, really, just a plug and play or plug and upload and I've got plenty of music for a bike trip or a long hike. And when I'm tired of the selections, I just erase what I don't want and download new selections. (I really don't understand the complaints about using MS Media Player or Windows XP.)  I will stay with iRiver so long as they make an MP3 player that operates off a Triple A battery. That's why I also have the 2 GB iRiver.   Sorry Amazon, but I don't understand the price listed. I got the 2 GB for just under $100, and the T30 for $80.

<Content>I've tried a whole bunch of different mp3 players, and this one fits my needs better than any of the others.  First, its small size makes it easy to keep in just about any pocket.  Battery life is great, at over 15 hours, and the fact that it takes AAA's means that if I run out of rechargeable batteries while I am out on the road, I can pick up a substitute at any gas station.  Well okay, you say, but how does it work?  Great!  It syncs easily with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  The LCD display makes it easy to navigate to just the item I want.  I can put a week's worth of podcasts on the T30, and it has been serving my needs without complaint for over a year now.  These little guys are getting harder to find now, and I'm going to pick up another one as a spare.  Five stars!

<Title>Great sound, terrible user interface
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this unit mainly for its voice recorder feature, very handy if I want to record myself dyuring music class. As other reviewers have already confirmed, the sound quality on playback is very good, and given that it it it has a mono built-in microphone, recorded sounds also sound good. Also useful at the expense of greater thickness, is its use of AAA batteries.  The bad is the user interface. The buttons are divided above and below the screen, and depending on how you hold the device, the feature you want is accessed either from the top or from the bottom. Not that accessing the feature is always intuitive, in the beginning I was forever having to re-read the manual to understand how to use it. The iPod this is not.
