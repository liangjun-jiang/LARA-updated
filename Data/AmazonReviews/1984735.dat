We purchased this for our daughter. Used to love the Toshiba line. I own their laptop, two high definition tv's, their high definition dvd player, and a regular dvd player.  So, when purchasing the Gigabeat, I didn't hesitate.  Well, the thing turned out to be a lemon. System failure, hard drive failure.  Sent it out twice for repair, both times losing over 1200 songs my daughter paid for.  They told us if it happened a third time, even after the warranty expired, they would replace or refund our money.  Guess what?  It just failed, and they said, tough luck, you're out of warranty.  By days mind you - not months, not years, just days it is out of the warranty period.  Nice company, considering what faithful customers we are..  I will never purchase from, or recommend Toshiba again, and I will take every opportunity I can to let every consumer know what their customer service is.  A Joke.  I will be writing their corporate office also.  They are so non-consumer oriented, you cannot even send customer service an email at Toshiba, nor can you speak to a supervisor.  You have to mail them!!!!!  Yes mail, regular mail, like the post office, with a stamp.  Hello!!!!!!! Aren't they a technology company? No emails??????  What a huge disappointment Toshiba.  Shame on you.

<Title>NO MAJOR ISSUES SO FAR!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a good year before I wrote my review.  I have reached that point with positive opinion on this product.  It is very easy to work with and has lots and lots of storage space!..I like being able to see the album covers when I play songs either on the display or on the TV screen...If I could change anything about this product, those things would be: 1. The battery life: don't get me wrong, It will last all day with moderate use if you are listening to music...apprxmtly 7-8 hours..depending on how you have the device set. (some settings pull more on the battery than others)..If you are watching video, maybe 2.5 hours on a full charge...that might be a little weak as far as battery strength goes in my opinion...But, a simple solution for this is to keep a car charger with you when your using it in a vehicle, and you will never have problems with battery life.  2. I wish it was more compatible with video files and did not have to convert all to WMA format..I found that I couldn't convert some video files...I would get an error message. Also, some files, when you convert them, lose clarity and that defeats the purpose of converting the file in the first place..  3.  I would love if I knew how to make each clip in the video file play continuously without having to manually play each individual video.. If there is a way...I haven't figured it out yet.  These aren't major issues though.. I mainly purchased this to listen to music and audiobooks....you can also run slideshows of your pictures will music is playing as well...I would say that I am overall very pleased with my purchase..

<Title>Mayor Flaw in Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought the S60 and I am totally disappointed. The device is nice and works fine but the way you have to sync the music using MediaPlayer 10 is not working for ripped CD's that do not have Tags. I have audio books that I did place in the Music folder using the FileManager. The S60 attempts to sort them by Artist, Song, Genres, etc. but does not give you a folder view as the F60 did or as any other MP3 player I owned did. This makes this player useless for anyone that likes to listen to audio books and music that was riped from a CD. I liked this device because of size bothy physically and storage but this flaw made me decide to put it on Ebay and get rid of it. It is unfortunate that such a flaw is produced by Toshiba. I even called the customer service and they told me to simply add tags to all my 7000 songs and audio books, Yeah right!!!  My recommendation is do not buy this device until the patched this mistake in the interface design.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am completely satisfied with this player.  I installed the beta version of Windows Media Player 11 and it works great. Takes some time getting used to coming from 10, but it's worth the effort.  One thing I really enjoy about using this product is that it requires no extra software. It comes with a CD, but I just tossed it to the side and let windows xp pro handle the rest.  I did see that some people were disappointed about not being able to put data files onto the unit. Cmon people. Open up my computer while the device is connected. Create a folder and drop your files in. It's not rocket science. This product will work like a thumb-drive.  One minor drawback, but it has not flawed my opinion at all, is that simply dropping media into the device outside the "Sync" routine won't allow the file to show up in standalone mode. I'm sure theres a way this rule can be bent, but why bend something when another method already allows for it?  Buy this thing now.

<Title>A nightmare for me....
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was thrilled to get the Gigabeat (60 gig) and spent hours loading it up. Then the problems began. This is an actual partial copy of my email to Toshiba customer service at the address provided with the product: ........................................................ Just received Gigabeat 60 from Amazon Friday. S/N: (provided)   This has been a nightmare for me. I waited for this product and did not want to go IPOD.   After following ALL instructions and spending hours downloading selected music, pictures and videos - including several VONGO downloaded films which I subscribed to just for your device, I connected the Gigabeat later yesterday to add some more downloads and instead I saw a message on the device stating something like "deleting files" and within seconds EVERYTHING I had downloaded was gone....GONE!   After this I rebooted the PC, reconnected the USB to the Gigabeat and it was no longer recognized by the PC, even though I did get the message asking me if I wanted to use Windows Media or VONGO. When I clicked on Windows Media is when I got the "not recognized" message. Interestingly the VONGO site did recognize and I was able to download films again...BUT I could never get the PC to recognize GIGABEAT when in Windows Media. I even downloaded WM again through the gigabeat software CD.   So, I waited until this morning to try again - since it was after midnight when I finally gave up trying.    This morning (Sunday) I turned on the Gigabeat, the PC and reconnected them using the USB. This time I immediately got a message on the PC stating that the connected device has malfunctioned. Then I disconected the Gigabeat, which said it was connected, and the Gigabeat's screen shut down. It will not turn on at all. It will not even show the battery icon when using the AC adaptor.   I am ready to return this to Amazon tomorrow and ready to write a user review outlining this horrible experience. Your device came with a slip of paper saying please do not return the product and to call customer service. This either means that you are serious about making this product successful, or there have been many problems, or both. Of course, unlike many other tech product suppliers, you have no weekend phone support and do not even begin until 10 am EST on weekdays.    I will wait to call Amazon to arrange the return until 1:00pm EST in case you would like to call or email to discuss. If you email or call and get my voice mail please be sure to leave a direct return phone number....or failing that please state a time that you will be calling and I will make sure I am in my office to answer your call - any time between 11:30 and 1:30 EST.   Again, this has been a nightmarish disappointment for me. I would appreciate a thorough and helpful response.    UPDATE: After I returned the product I received an email response - days later - from Toshiba customer service (Rick) telling me to "swith off the battery for at least 3 minutes" and if this doesn't work to call an 800 number for support. I'm not sure what this meant as the battery has no switch and is not removable. But, of course, I had already returned the product and have received a refund from Amazon.   Some people seem to love the new Gigabeat, but I am not willing to live with the chance that all files will delete on their own at any time. I liked it for the hour that it worked for me. In my opinion, Toshiba has work to do in quality control as well as customer support. I guess I'll wait for the upcoming competing Microsoft product.

<Title>Jury is still out, but you might want to WAIT!
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok... I did my homework and decided the Toshiba Gigabeat was what I wanted.  I ordered it last Thursday and even joined Amazon Prime so I could get it overnighted for $3.99... just had to have it for the weekend.  First, I loaded over 600 songs on it Friday night.  It was great.  While I was listening to those I joined VONGO and downloaded 8 movies!! The next day I tried to transfer the movies to the Gigabeat... TRANSFER ERROR! Oh, but it gets better... ALL my 600 songs were GONE!!!!  Hmmmmm, seems I remember reading about a similar problem someone else had in the reviews.  So I reload the songs and finally get the movies to transfer.  Later that day I record something off TV and try to transfer that.... ERROR!  This is getting old.  Wait, not done.... Sunday I fire it up again and guess what.... yep, all 600 songs are gone again!!  So Monday morning I contacted Amazon and sent it back!  Figured I give it one more chance so I told them to ship me a replacement.  If I have ANY problems at all with this one, it's going back for a refund!  Obviously Toshiba has some quality issues!!! Oh, and when I emailed them (Toshiba) about the problem, I got the exact SAME email back that the other guy did... something about turning off the battery for 3 minutes!!  What a joke!  All I can say is beware on this one... seems to be alot of lemons in the mix!!!  NOTE:  Amazon has been wonderful to deal with on this, so my rating is based on the performance of the Gigabeat, not Amazon.  They paid for the defective unit to be returned and sent me a new replacment the next day, before they even received mine back!!  5 stars for them!!  UPDATE:  I received the replacement unit from Amazon.  I tried transferring movies that I downloaded from VONGO... one of the main reasons I bought this unit.  All I got was error messages!!  After numerous attempts I called Vongo's techincal help line.  "Not our problem, must be Toshiba"  So I called Toshiba's Technical help line.... you know what's coming... "not our problem, must be Vongo!"  So the next day it went back for a refund!!  I'd think twice about wasting your money on this device, it obviously has A LOT OF BUGS to be worked out and I got a real "couldn't care less" attitude about it from Toshiba!!

<Title>Another buggy device
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow after i read the comments on this website I am 110% glad that i returned my Toshiba Gigabeat today. Its uncanny how I've had the EXACT problems with the gigabeat. Transferring audio is easy but keeping them on the device is very tough. When I tried to transfer a video windows media player, it would always get stuck in the converting process at 0%. After 2 hours and still at 0%, i disconnected the gigabeat. When i turned it on, it said "Dumping Information" on the screen. What did customer service say? Turn of the battery for 3 min? BS! This occurs 2 more times after I did this. In addition to this, my battery would abnormally die even after a night's charge. A message would come up on the screen saying that "Portable Media Center is very low on battery and will turn off soon". Then there was an option to click OK, but the screen froze and the only remedy to this was to reset the battery and say goodbye to all ur content.   And what about video quality you ask? lol. It was so bad i thought my vhs had better qualities. Due to the 65k color screen there were numerous color abnormalities on the screen. Horrible night scenes due to lack to color transition made watching nighttime movies impossible to bear. Plus the gigabeat virtually supports no video format. But what about WMV? No. It has no native support for any video file. Even if you try to transfer a WMV file to the gigabeat you will need to convert it. Worse, if you have an divx or xvid encrypted divx and try to convert it on the gigabeat frame-skipping occurs. Atleast the viewing angles are great? WRONG. If you watch a night scene on the gigabeat you will fund yourself turning the screen around.  Why am I saying all of this? You've probably read about these problems many times before this. I am just reitterating my problems just to show you how deceptive this product really is.  O sure you see a 8.3 in cnet, 9.2 on pcworld so it must be a great product. Then you think it looks sexy and its not an ipod. The best deal! WRONG. I was optimistic like this before i bought the gigabeat. Companies and people wonder why many consumers are pessemisstic about products and seek to find anything wrong with it. I have learned that if you want to buy a product you must expect the worst from products.      Bottom line: It depends on what you want. You want portability get an ipod. It has the same capacity, a thinner look, a sexier look and a whole lot more battery life. No FM tuner, but the tunner in gigabeat is garbage anyway. I have manual tuning radios that work better. You want quality and performance? Get the Creative Zen Vision: M. It has greater video support, DivX 4,5, Xvid, Mpeg 2,4 and WMV. It has a bigger and better screen at 2.5 with 262,000 colors compared to the gigabeat's 62k. Better FM tuner, and more features including calendar, contact list, screen keyboard for artist search, organizer, microphone and radio recording.   If there was a zero rating for this product I would rate it just that. I fully recommend that you do not buy it, and if you do then returning it will be the best day of your life.

<Title>An Excellent PMP
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's interesting to see a product get either five or one star.  My experiences have been nearly all positive.  The software seemed clumsy at first, until I upgraded to Windows Media Player 11, which is intuitive and dependable.  It is possible to delete songs, and I have never had any problems transferring music, pictures, of videos to the Gigabeat.  Since I prefer classical music, sound is important.  I previously owned a Creative Zen Touch that distorted with percusive sounds (such as loud passages on the piano).  Those same MP3 files are distortion free on the Gigabeat.  The sound is fantastic! My guess is that the one-star incidents are anomolies.  This is a solid value, especially compared to the Zen and (possibly) the iPod.

<Title>apple can pack its things
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I cannot help but spread my enthusiasm for the player - the 1-stars seem to rely heavily on download-services which do not play a role for me. If you search a player that   - runs smoothly with your music collection (mp3, wma, etc) - has a brilliant screen - plays movies without complaining (even divx after conversion) - shows fotos that can be put on the player directly from the camera  the Gigabeat is your device at a good price.  At this point, accessories are a big minus for sure - there is one single manufacturer that has carrying cases (Noreve St. Tropez), but they cost 40EUR ($51) a piece excl shipping (they are handmade, though ;-)  I am afraid for stands you will have to wait quite a bit (if not forever), car adapters should be easy to find, though, since you can be safe to assume that the player will run with the standard stuff you find at radio shack  however - I have to say how great the player is and how it is worth the hassle to get it (at least it was until july). it is intuitive, the sound is excellent, even divx-movies are converted, the screen is brilliant and the hook-up with the tv runs smoothly (movies are like watching a dvd, seriously).  all in all a great buy - the ipod would force you into itunes and cost way more considering all the "accessories" (i.e. radio, tv-out, foto-transfer, etc.) ipod-people have to pay big money for.

<Content>If you use a subscription service, stay away. Yahoo wma files kill the batteries. Plays for shorter is more like it. I have done tests, mp3s I have made, the battery lasts 15 hours. Yahoo files, good luck on over 2 hours.   I like the interface, the sound is clear and distortion free and it has a huge storage capacity.   As a player, this is a good device. Just stick to files you have ripped your self.

<Title>Battery drains when fully charged
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am returning my unit. Just like another reviewer (read below) documented the battery drains abnormally when switched off. It happens when you actuate the battery 'switch' (it's a miniscule slide button in a recessed opening that you cannot see, you have to use a pin or a needle and knowing that it is in the off or on position move it the opposite direction - one poor design feature in this product). I'm playing it safe rather than having it repaired which Tosh. readily agreed to do. I also have noticed that the battery runs down faster if you play WMA DRM files a lot or move around in the menu a lot. I knew this was not the player with the best battery life before buying it, I would be happy with 8-10 hours with audio. There is a lot to like too. THe sound is great, the interface is great and scrolling to an item in the menu is very fast. It works well with WMP 11 Beta 2. The FM radio reception is mediocre. It would not pull in one of the strongest stations around here for some reason. FM was not one of my requirements anyway.

<Content>I bought mine for $200 but even that was overpriced when you consider that it only worked for around 6 months.  One day it just froze for no reason and all my songs disappered only to reappear a few days later.  Now the unit only works is if it's plugged in which renders it pretty much usless.  Don't buy this piece of trash.  Now I'll just have to break down and buy an iPod.

<Date>Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Toshiba gigabeat when my last mp3 player finally died. I had a dell model before and absoutly love the simplicity of the machine. I like having my entire music collection with me, but i dont use the whole lets put pictures, and watch tv or anything like on an mp3 player/ media player. I really just wanted a simple mp3 player. Well this one is simple, kinda. I like the fact if I wanted to I can listen to local radio stations on it, which is great for those in the gym experinces when they have a tv but you have to set your radio to a certain station to hear the sound.  The battery life isnt bad, I can get about 8-10 hours of music on shuffle. I have however still not figured out how to get a playlist to load on to the player. The quicklist isnt bad, but i miss having 15 different playlists to cover my particular moods. I dislike the fact all the play, next track, or last track buttons are on the side instead of on the front. That being said I am very pleased with the device, and I would buy it again.

<Title>Whatpod?
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my 60-gig Gigabeat for 6 months now and I'm still thrilled with it.  It is the first MP3 player I've had and I don't see how an iPod could be better -- not to mention that there isn't any proprietary format nonsense to put up with.  The battery has been solid -- I have played 2 full length movies on a single charge -- and it has room for everything.  I was hoping that it would function as a portable hard drive but it isn't.    I have not had any problems with file transfers.  I have about 30 gigs of media on it and it takes about 15 minutes to sync.    A few of the controls could be better placed, i.e. the "lock" switch should be farther from the power button so that you don't accidentally turn off the power when you are trying to unlock it.  But overall, this is a great product and I hope that Toshiba follows it up with a stellar second generation.

<Title>Still my first choice in MP3 players
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Gigabeat 60GB for about six months and I have been very pleased with it. The feel and quality are substantive - unlike some others that look and feel like plastic toys.  The fact that the media sync is universal with Windows Media player is a plus.  The sound and picture quality are fantastic.  Controls are simple and intuitive.  I wish you could delete files directly on the Gigabeat but you must be plugged into the PC to do that.  Easily powers my Sennheiser headphones. The battery life is not as long as advertised.  I should have sent it back for that but I like it so much, I don't want to give it up! The trickle charge over USB is handy and quicker than I expected - you do not need to take the AC charger everywhere.  Another reviewer noted the loss of all of stored media.  I only had that happen once and since then have been very careful about making sure that the Gigabeat is done communicating with the PC and ready to be disconnected - no problems since.  I carefully reviewed all of the MP3/media players within this size/price range and I would still buy the Toshiba if I had it do all over again - no hesitation.  Accessories are non-existent but hey I didn't buy it for the accessories.

<Title>Temperamental sometimes, but worth it.
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Quite simply, this is the best Portable Media Device on the market, aesthetically, supported format wise, screen wise, navigation wise, and possibly sound wise. It's  not without its annoying drawbacks: Randomly reformatting if you don't unplug the usb cable correctly, mediocre battery life, error code 5 "return to manufacturer" (when the hard drive cable disconnects after a hard fall), and an equalizer that doesn't work, but even given all those, I wouldn't trade it for any other player.  I've had mine for over a year and only once has it reformatted itself (a big complaint for some reviewers), and you can easily prevent this if you turn the power on the player off before disconnecting the USB cable. Plus it's a rare occurrence even if you disconnect it with the power on.  Though Toshiba no longer supports the player, you can find excellent support on the MyGigabeat dot com forum, including instructions on how to upgrade or replace its hard drive, battery, screen, or firmware. And replacing or upgrading parts on this thing is easier than any of the other big name contending devices. Wanna swap the 60gb drive with a 100 or 120gb drive? Easy as pie. Wanna upgrade the battery to 1200mA to squeeze out an extra 2-4 hours of play time? Just remove 2 extra screws, pop the old one out and the new one in. You're set. None of this non-user serviceable ridiculousness.  Why 4 stars? It's not perfect. But it's close enough.

<Title>Better than an ipod
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have friends who have ipods, they're always smashing them against walls trying to get them to work, or get over errors, they have all complained about itunes and when they have had computer problems they have ipod problems too. Not the gigabeat. All you need is microsoft media player with a sync tab and you can use anyone's computer because almost everyone has this on their computer. The Gigabeat is more like an external hard drive so you can hook it up to a computer and go right into the folders on the MP3 player and delete things (nothing is saved with weird names),this also means you can open your gigabeat from a friends computer and click and drag a copy of all of your music to their computer for them to have. The only thing is if you need to edit a song name or a picture or video that is saved on the MP3 player, you need to edit it on the computer that you saved it from and re-sync the player. It's a pretty simple and very elegant player...don't let the up and down arrows misguide you either, you can still scroll by holding the arrow and letting go when you get to the letter (you will use this a lot because it holds a ton of songs)...  OH the battery life is only about 3 hours so if you plan on getting this for your car I recommend getting a car charger too, they're only about $8.00 if you shop around on line. you can play music while it is charging in your car so it's no big deal with the car charger.

<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my Gigabeat. I bought mine about 1 year and a half ago and it's still working great.   I wasn't a fan of the thing when I first received it but that was due to the fact that I didn't know how to use it properly. I've now gotten a hang of it and I never leave home without it. It's my perfect gym buddy. I listen to tunes while lifting weights and watch videos while on the treadmill. It's awesome.   I use Media Monkey (a program you can get free from the MM site) to transfer music and use Windows Media Player 11 to convert and transfer videos to the device.  I had no problem with the music/video transfer when I upgraded my computer to Vista.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great MP3 player.....When it works.
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product in Oct. 2006 because the reviews were so great and I didn't want to deal with an IPod.  It worked great for about 1 month and then the problems started with the battery.  I would charge it one day and the next it would be dead.  I called customer service and they said to reset the battery.  Some days it worked and some days it didn't.  It was a crap shoot every morning on wether or not the battery would be dead even if I had charged it all night.  I only put up with it because I had spent $250 on the stupid thing and had spent so much time downloading my music library.  It's been a year and after taking very good care of it, the thing dies without warning.  It gives me the message to return to the manufacturer for repair.  If Toshiba thinks I'm going send them any more of my hard earned money to fix this pos, they are sadly mistaken.  I've wasted enough time and money on them and won't do it again.

<Title>Stuck with WMP for transfering music files
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 60 gb Toshiba player a few months ago, and returned it to Amazon. I listen mostly to classical music and WMP makes absolute hash out of classical albums. (Not really their fault; most classical albums have info on them that us completely messed up.)This is not a probem with my Creative player; I just plug it in to a USB port and drag 'n drop the folders I want to the player, then create a playlist. You can't do this with the Toshiba; you MUST use WMP. Microsoft strkes again!

<Title>Fat and easily breakable
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music. The Gigabeat is a very thick media device and by now I don't really suggest you buy it as there are plenty of other mp3 devices for the same price that are much more advanced than this one. The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound.

<Title>Happy with the hardware - but not the software!
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've now had my S60 about two weeks and am getting to know it well.  I'd have to say that while I think it is better than the equivalent iPod for Windows XP users, living with the Media Player software is not fun.  First time I plugged the S60 into the PC - drivers install, everything happy - device manager says all is good.  Only one problem - no S60 visible in Windows explorer or the Media Player.  Consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and when I can eventually figure out the key words to get a useful search, I find the answer.  I end up editing a couple of registry key security permissions and then every thing works fine.  Registry key permissions!  This is like being told you won't be able to start your new car until you've modified the wiring under the bonnet.......  Media Player 10 is functional but limited.  More importantly the MTP drivers it installs give very limited drag and drop capabilities - and won't let you use the S60 for transferring data files.  If a file name doesn't have an approved media extension you can't copy it (but just changing the extension seems to work!).  Media Player 11 is much more functional.  With newer MTP drivers included, Windows explorer can see more of what's on the device (but not everything....), and depending where you copy files to, will either let you copy without limitation, or warn but not prevent you copying a non-media file.  My main use for the S60 is to play mp3 files.  As such all my problems have been in the Media Player.  eg. ID3 tags say artist is John Doe.  Media Player, twice only so far, ends up with "Artist" is John Doe, but "Album Artist" is Doe, John.  S60 handles this by giving you two entries for the same album.  So where does Media Player get "Doe, John" from randomly?  I can only guess it snuck off and retrieved bad info from the internet.  Other pet Media Player peeves:   - edit an album or artist name starting with say "S", hit enter and wham you're back at "A", scrolling down to find the album again.  - set the device option in media player to maximum quality, 192kb/s, and any mp3 it finds below OR ABOVE 192kb/s will be converted to 192kb/s WMA format.  Leave the device set to auto quality, and it doesn't seem to interfere!  - can see the mp3 files on the player and delete or copy them, but can't access them for editing tags.  - can't even see the player in other applications, only the Media Player and Windows Explorer.  The S60 itself looks good, feels solid, and is a breeze to use.  It comes with the ability and cable to download photos off most cameras, a plug pack, and FM radio, so you don't keep paying for extras like with iPods.  While the supplied headphones are utter rubbish (come on Toshiba - it doesn't cost anything more to provide a usable pair), the player gives excellent sound with a good pair.  Video conversion time is typically slow, but (unlike others???) I've had no problems with the six or so I've transferred to the S60.  Oh - and I do like the buttons on the side too (unlike others!!!).  Things I don't like about or could be improved on the S60 include:  - volume control only has 20 increments, I'd prefer a finer resolution.  - display is hard to read in daylight even at max brightness.  - can't delete files from the player itself.  - needs the ability to play files by folder.  - desparately needs the ability to change backgrounds and colour schemes.  Windows default - yuk!  - needs a case and these aren't so common.  - generates quite a lot of internal FM interference, particuarly around 101MHz, until the CPU goes to sleep in about 1.5 minutes.  - and of course the same old file type groans (give us DivX, m4a etc support) and the battery life/charging behaviour groans.  At the end of the day I cannot understand why we can't just have a media player that works by dragging and dropping in Windows Explorer.  Aren't any of the manufacturers listening to us consumers?  I don't want proprietry lock down, I don't need autosync anything.

<Title>Best Portable Video Player
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a man who loves both individuality and simplicity.  When the iPod became the biggest portable mp3 player, I sought out to find a great alternative that could hold several gigs and not give any of my money to Apple.  My friend found out about the Creative Zen, which is a great mp3 player as well.  But both the Zen and the iPod were so overstuffed with useless gadgetry that I just felt overwhelmed.  My gigabeat was both simple and sufficient; and that is why I found it to be the best mp3 player for its price.

<Title>Seems great so far... And *still* does after 1.5 months
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't really give a review yet on the battery performance or say much on all the features as I have only had this 1 day so far, but I like what I see so far... I should mention that I bought the Black 60 GB model...  I took it out of the package and set it up to charge, it took the 3 hours that it says it needs to fully charge.  I went to install anything to my computer (laptop with windows XP MCE 2005), and it says to install mediaplayer 10, even if you already have it as the install would also install a few other items that the player needs to work with the Gigabeat S.  I have the latest version of Media Player 11 on here, and I didn't need to do anything else (no installations of any kind) to get the Gigabeat working with my system and Sync properly.  I also already had the latest updates for MCE 2005 and so I am assuming that if you have the automatic updates turned on, that you would have everything needed as well.  I had never used Media Player for anything but music before (used it to sync with my -now old- Dell DJ 20 (2nd Gen)), but it was nice to see that it would take my files (video and tv) and automatically convert them before transfering/syncing them to my portable.  I love the portable's MCE style, and it's great to use in combination with a MCE computer, though I think anyone with even just windows XP would find it pleasant to use (very easy, as you can't go wrong with "My tv", "My music" etc) even without ever having seen the menu system before.  If you are like me and have your MCE using a TV Tuner to record TV shows/movies, then you will love the nice easy way that MediaPlayer 11 (can't say about 10 as I never used it much and only for music) takes control and adds your files to the player, converts them for you if needed, and then syncs them, and the visual quality is quite good.  I am sure that it could be better, but I was able to watch a "dark" show on the gigabeat with the brightness at 3 (out of 5) and it was not half bad, much better with the brightness up higher though but then you also will have to deal with the added battery loss (just turn it back down after you are down watching to help save battery power again).  And might I add that my TV Tuner has an Antenna Source, though I tend to forget it most of the time (except for anything recorded on FOX as it is difficult to get in clear where I am) as the TV tuner does a great job and it shows in the conversion as well. So if you have a bad quality file to start off with, there's probably not much that can be done about that, but otherwise, considering the device and size of the screen, you really couldn't ask for much more (well, you could, but you wouldn't need much more).  I have been constantly syncing and adding new items to my Gigabeat in the past 24 hours, and I have only had 2 music files show up with an error and that couldn't transfer.  I took these 2 files, converted them from mp3 to a higher bit rate WMA file (used a free trial version of some program downloaded from CNET) and on the next sync, they managed to transfer over as well.  The audio sounds great, though I am using a previously bought pair of Sony earbud headphones (the kind with the round rubber removable earpieces that fit into your ears for a nice fit) instead of the ones that come with the gigabeat, and these are great to use as they will bring out that sound quality for you to enjoy, are comfortable, and keep the sound going into your ears and not other peoples... So I would suggest to get these or something else a bit better quality (than the basic ships with ones) if you don't already own some decent headphones.  So I really haven't said much about the portable player, and I will do so after I get a real chance to test it out, but as of now, it seems great to me, and I have not been having any of the problems that some of the other people were having, and with the prices coming down so much... as low as ($260) even for the 60GB model... I would say it is worth it to get it and try it out.  I would recommend buying from a place that has a good exchange policy, as even though it ships with a sheet saying to not return it to a store, if you do have problems and don't want Toshiba to just "fix" it for you, you can always return it (to Amazon if bought here).  ***Edited on 11/20/2006 @ 12:53 AM***  So I have now had my Toshiba Gigabeat S for just over a month and a half (it seems like it has been so much longer, like almost 3 months) and all I can say is that it is great. I haven't had any more problems with transfering songs (though the re-coding into another file type did work nicely for those stubborn songs that just don't want to transfer on their own) and I have had no problems with the battery life (when compared to what it's specs should be, not by what I would like it to be...) and people should remember that there is that little switch to turn the battery on or off (for if you are not going to use it for a good amount of time and don't want the battery to drain during that time it is turned off). Turn the gadget over, look at the back, down on the bottom... See the "BATT" with "On  Off" below it... Look on the bottom edge where the USB plugs into, it is next to that, to the right, above the little screw. Hold player so you can see the back of it and the bottom edge, the "On  Off" show where you need to switch the switch (hah) to turn the battery on and off - the "hole"  in the plastic piece is your current position...  Again, the battery life could be better but is pretty much standard for most players, the audio and video qualities are also standard, if not more so... Just remember, you need decent/good quality ear/headphones to be able to hear the *real* sound quality from the player, and you should also watch out for the type of media format you are using (listening to) as this has a big impact on the overall quality as well (I try to stick with wma formats as they can get *much* better quality into a file of approx. the same size as a lower quality mp3.  If you LOVE sound quality and don't care that it takes up more space, always convert to wma 128 (MIN) or up to 192 -or is it 196? Dealing with too many numbers, though whatever setting that is around 164 makes a great common ground for size and quality, and this is usually set at 44,000Hz - or is it MHz? Again, forgive my tech details as it is late and I keep getting things mixed up in my head).  Overall, *still* great after 1.5 months and counting. Maybe some people got bad products, it does happen, or ones with faulty batteries. Also, check your music files, to see that they aren't what is causing you problems, and keep it simple.... Stick with Windows Media Player 11. Newest version is non-beta now and I have no problems with the software at all and it is the easiest way to sync your files and Auto Convert those video media files if you haven't done so before hand.  Prices are cheap, when I bought mine, the price dropped the day mine shipped, and then dropped *again* 2 days later. Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund credit for the $54.19 that was the difference. Now you can find the Black 60gb one for around $254 or so from some of these Amazon 3rd party Merchants... So go ahead and try it, if it has a problem, just return it to Amazon (if bought here) and either give up or get an exchanged product and if that second one is still not working for you, return it, get your money back and buy something else.  If the product is not giving you problems, then you should only find slight disappointment with some areas of it, which I am sure you could probably live with. If you are not sure about the style/menu/etc, try and find a store that has a working model (as a sampler/tester) to check it out first. I don't think Toshiba has a interactive working model online (which I think they should have), they might have something that shows a bit of the product, I used one of those for my Sony Ericsson cell phone that I bought, and after using it 2 times in 3 days I fell in love with the phone model (the K750i -unlocked International version) and ended up buying it 2 days later from TigerDirect.  So always look for online interactive models, where you can click on the different parts to mimic you using it, or at least watch a video clip of it if they have one on the website as you will get to see more of what it looks like through the menus, etc.

<Title>GUYS, I'm finally giving up the fight.  wimpy iPod it is.
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for a non-Apple mp3 player with a central-navigation-button that CLICKS.  CLICKS!  Got CLICK?  CLICKING is for MEN who either own a hog (NYSE: HOG), or wish they led a life where they didn't look stupid owning a fat motorcyle (those of you in suits or with military officer hair).  The popular and fairy trend of all mp3 players, both iPods and those thoughtless companies which produce devices modelled after iPods, is to use the sensual button technology, requiring you to pet, feel-up, stroke, caress, massage, soothe, tickle, and finger-blast the front panel of your music player.  I cannot stand those buttons, and if you have any testosterone running thru your delicate fingers, you shouldn't either.  If you feel comfortable with these new age strokey buttons, you should also have no problem proudly displaying a pink mp3 player for your homees, or a dildaically-themed device.  These fingerpuff buttons on the iPod, et all, are squirrely, hard to use, they overshoot, and I feel like a white collar hand-model pansy using them.  Frankly, even if those buttons worked, they still take forever to scroll thru menus.  The Toshiba Gigabeat S, however, not only has the cross-bar navigation button with a strong masculine clickable button that really puts hair on your chest, but also is built on top of a Windows platform that's a dream in terms of user friendliness.  Throw away the instruction book as far as navigating the device, it's that easy.  THEN throw away the Toshiba Gigabeat S.  Yeah, you heard me right.  Send the Toshiba Gigabeat S back to where you bought it for a full refund, cuz everything else about it STINKS ON ICE.  1.  Transferring media still sucks.  Apple figured out, that in order to create a music experience which didn't require you swearing in front of your children, throwing expensive furniture around the room like a teenage girl dealing with puberty, and having your blood boil you into a hospital visit, it was necessary to not only build and design the hardware, but also to build the software, and the internet service TOGETHER-- sorta like having triplets.  You dress them the same, you grow them up the same, you make them like each other and behave, and you get lots of time savings cuz driving 3 kids the same age to the same school and same soccer practise is a nice bennie.  Back to topic, Apple figured this out, and all the competitors are STILL struggling with it.  Tons of problems STILL occur with simple transfers, just like every other player I've had built on "To Go" or "Plays For Sure" MSFT technology.   This is what you get when you have a system where Yahoo or Napster or Windows Media Player provides your music, a Japanese company provides your hardware, and MSFT provides all your software.  It's a nightmare.  I'm fed up.  Been fighting the iPod monopoly since the craze started, since I like subscription music idea better than having to continuously buy music, but it's getting impossible to fight it anymore.  I've torched too much money into technology that doesn't work.  Thanks Microsoft, no wonder Bill Gates quit.  2.  It's a plastic model motorcycle, not a real one:  ie)  CHEAPLY BUILT. I dropped the Toshiba Gigabeat S 60GB on the floor-- ONCE.  Kablooey, the screen busted like a bullet had hit the center of it.  I phoned Toshiba, and they gave me a center to send it, which I did.  When they called back, they said it would cost 325 clams to repair!  Side Note:  A NEW one (in October, a mere 3 months after initial release at the $400 price point), now that Toshiba and MSFT have failed yet again, is now $270 on Amazon which includes tax and shipping.  Can you do math in your head?  $325...$270...$325...$270.  So I said to the phone, "well Toshiba can go "F" themselves for that amount of money", to which they replied, we're not Toshiba!  Apparently Toshiba just sends their cruddy hardware over here, and lets other deal with it when it turns out to be crappola.  So I told the nice outsourced repair people (they were very angry people right from "hello"), either send the device to Toshiba along with my note, or send it back to me.  They said, "that'll be $80, $15 shipping, and $65 for our expert inspection".  So the Toshiba Gigabeat S lasted one dropping.  For reference friends and nieghbors, I've dropped my Blackberry at least once per week for the past two years, and while I have a screen that has some minor scratchies on it, it still works like a charm.  Basically, Toshiba didn't do any drop tests that Blackberry does, and their design is inferior with cheap parts.  3.  MSFT threw in the towel.  Plays For Sure is now over, so Yahoo, Napster, Wal-Mart, Real, and anyone else that decided to jump onto MSFT's bandwagon have been left behind in favor of the new Zune player.  Sorry MSFT, but the Zune doesn't sound exciting.  It's made by Toshiba, and is essentially a Gigabeat S with a wheel istead of the cross-bar, which is why I bought the Cruddy Toshiba in the 1st place.  Furthermore, Yahoo's subscription service is the cheapest around, and money matters.  So unless the Zune subscription (which MSFT hasn't even talked about, so there's no gaurantee it will even offer subscription IF it comes out this November) is cheaper than $10 per month which is likely impossible (Yahoo can make the difference on some search and other ad revs), I am moving to iPod.  Since I am no longer willing to bet on an unsure thing, as I've burned $400 on this POS Toshiba, there's not a chance in Hades I'm going to put more money into MSFT's first experiment with hardware design.    I'm tired, and defeated.  I put my trust in Plays For Sure, and MSFT is now throwing that aside.  What if the Zune is thrown aside too?  Only gaurantee, is that Apple and music players that work will be around a long time.    If I sound like a typical Apple supporter, you must not have caught my drift.  This advice comes from some one that despises Jobs and Apple, from some one that attended CES last January (2006) and was very excited to get a Toshiba Gigabeat S as it seemed to FINALLY be the player we've all been waiting.  I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and then finally in July I got the device which was promised in January, delayed in April, May, June... and now I'm waiting again.  What's the point?  There's an Apple store less than one block from where I write this review.  How long will it take me to take the plunge, and finally get something that will work for 2-3 years?  Sink myself into the eventual monopoly that is iTunes, while watching the much-better subscription model die an ugly death.  Why am I still writing this, and not in the Apple store?  I just don't know.

<Title>Very Worthy Player !!
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I needed a player with no audio recording feature and narrowed my list to the iPod and the Gigabeat S. I've played with iPods before but wanted to go with something new. I read reviews and settled for the Gigabeat S 60  Great decision!!! I'm loving it!! I've had no problems using WMP 10 to sync up with the player as I've read in other reviews.  My one concern was ripping CDs I've created from previous mp3 files, and WMP not recognizing the track, artist, etc.  I was right. It did'nt. But using the album search function in WMP, I was able to find the right albums and it updated all the info correctly so I did'nt have to type in any infomation. Overall...I think this is a great product right up there with the iPod for a little less $$. Pros    - Great looking device.    - Slick and easy to use interface.    - Videos and pics look great.    - Interface to WMP 10 works fine. Cons    - Battery life    - The stupid earbuds!! They sound fine but whats with the different     wire lengths?!?! Since the left one is shorter it keeps trying to come     out of your left ear. WTF!!!??

<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I actually tried to stop shipment of the product after I read the reviews AFTER I placed my order.  It was too late to cancel so I figured I would give it a try even though others have been plagued by problems.  I already belonged to Napster and it immediately recognized the product and music downloaded seamlessly.  I had WAY more trouble (as in I am going to throw this thing out the window)  with Napster's own MP3 player which I bought previously.  I also joined Vongo and downloaded movies without any trouble.  I also was able to download music from Windows Media without a glitch.  I am an E-tard by nature and I really found this to be the easiest MP3 player of the 3 I own.  The capacity is amazing for the price.  It sounds great.  I have had no issues with the battery life since you can charge it with the included AC adapter or right in your USB port.  It sounds great...I bought a cheap $10 cassette adapter at Walmart and it sounds as good as my Boston Aucoustics CD player in my car.  I like the fact that it is not an Apple product and I am not involved with I-tunes monopoly.  The only thing I wish is that Toshiba would make some accessories such as a docking/speaker system.  I really cannot say enough about this product...do not be scared off by the bad reviews...and no, I don't work for TOSHIBA!!!

<Title>Gigabeat Experience
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I purchased my Gigabeat I was looking for a portable device that I could take on my frequent travels with audio capabilities first and foremost but also video (though I was not sure how much I would use the feature.)  Overall the Gigabeat hasn't disappointed.  The process of loading songs onto my Gigabeat went fairly smoothly although early on I did manage to erase all the files and had to reload them!?  My video use has been more limited so far.  The quality of the sound has been good and the display easy to use and read.  I purchased some Shure ear buds to replace the stock ones and they have been comfortable and enhanced the quality.  My primary complaints are twofold: 1) the battery life of the device seems poor in my experience.  Especially frustrating is that it seems to lose a charge even while turned off in my bag for extended periods of time (perhaps it is being jostled and turns itself on - not sure.) 2) I purchased a cover for the device from Zcover and discovered that it was very poorly designed and made.  The Zcover was supposedly custom for the Gigabeat but in fact was not configured correctly to match the locations of key buttons or the power connection and the overall cover was a bit too large for the Gigabeat.  A disappointing product.

<Title>Best thing since sliced bread or something
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third hard drive based MP3 player. The first was an Archos, then the Dell DJ20, but I craved more space for my music and wanted to be able to play videos. I will admit I am a PC person and don't care for Macs, so I wanted to avoid being locked into iTunes. Media Player for Windows is finally where it should have been 4 years ago and it has proven to be stable and quick for me. I did not install the Gigabeat software and use only Media Player. For those of you who have used Red Chair Software's hackware, I was hoping that they would develop something for the Toshiba but to date they have not. If Creative had come out with a 60 GB player when I purchased this Toshiba they would have had more of a chance to compete but I wanted the space.  The player itself has very easy menus. Even I could figure out how to use it.  About the only complaint on menuing I can give is that the scrolling doesn't wrap around. For example, if you seach by song title and it starts with a W you would prefer to go "up" to zip through the Z's rather than "down" to start at A.  It would save time.  The USB port being included on the main unit rather than a dongle like the Cowon unit is a plus.  The lack of iPod-like accessories is a bit perturbing but I understand all those people that bought the iPod would have a larger voice in the marketplace. The unit recharges okay, and with the Harmonics setting switched to Off it doesn't drain the battery like it did with the factory settings. The Dell DJ, a much larger unit, had an endless battery life but did not play videos or have a color screen.  Toshiba may be manipulated by either Apple or Microsoft because they don't have this unit in Best Buy, Circuit City or Target stores near as I can tell. It's hard to sell if you don't have it in the channel.  It is a great unit and I urge you to consider it if you are looking for a hard disk based mp3 player capable of playing videos. It's a Zune without the hype.

<Title>Gigabeat 60 GB - Lots of Room in here
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With so much room it swallowed up my entire catalog of 513 albums, and over 2,300 songs in no time flat and still had over 45 GB to spare! That's including over 1,000 high quality photos!   Easy to use with Windows Media Player (though I'd rather use Real Player). Simple drag and drop adds any files you want.  The video playback is as good as any other media players on the market with a slightly bigger screen to boot.  My only complaint is the volume level is too low. It may be to protect my own ears, but I like my sound loud, and it only gets a 5 on a scale of 11 for loudness.   Overall, excellent product for the money.

<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've just been using the Gigabeat for the past couple of weeks.  No problems with Media Player 11, no problems with sync, very good sound (as good as wife's apple), very nice features, easy to use, holds tons of stuff, can use subscription services as well (which was the key reason i bought it over the iPod).  Ads informed me that it had battery life of 12 or more hours on a full charge.  So far I have yet to make it to 5 or 6.  I put the settings at dim backlight, almost never on after a button is pressed and still found it horrible.  I contacted toshiba, and all they could tell me is that it generally last for 4-6 hours on an average.  My wife plays her Ipod at work for 8 hours and still uses it at home.  Very disappointed as I was really excited about all of the write-ups on this product.  I was really expecting it to be at least close to the ipod and better in regards to subscription services, etc.  Not happy with the battery life at all.  If you don't mind short life on continuous play, everything else about it is very nice.  Maybe I have a lemon in the batch.  I spoke with Toshiba customer service and they blamed possible settings in Media player, but couldn't tell me where to find these same settings.  I went through all the possibilities and couldn't find anything that was set inappropriately.  They also informed me that I could bring it to a service department, no refunds.  Oh well, live and learn.

<Title>Great MP3 player, very sleek and stylish...
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this MP3 player for several reasons: the usual not wanting to be an Ipod drone, desire for lossless WMA playback, and large storage.  The Gigabeat has served me well in the 4 months I have had it.  I suggest (as with any piece of PC equipment) to make sure you have the latest drivers for Windows, motherboard drivers, and the newest version of WMP.  The Gigabeat has not had a firmware update since release but this has been no problem for me.  When I first hooked my Gigabeat up, I had astonishingly slow transfer times and hangups (often requiring restart).  I was frustrated beyond belief and wanted to break/return the player.  However, I caught a quick snippet online about an external storage device performing slowly off a front USB port.  So, I switched the cable to the back, and voila! no problem since then.  So, having a custom built computer, I probably have something hooked up wrong from the mobo to the front USB (another issue).  The Gigabeat has very fast synching in WMP (including 40 MB WMA files)  The menu system on the gigabeat is fast and colorful, the album art is a plus.  Only being able to make a "quick list" in the player once you have the music on is a bummer.  However, you can always go back and make playlists in WMP and just sync them over.  The Gigabeat also has good sound quality.  The only other major downside is a lack of accesories for the Gigabeat.  I found an armband on Ebay for when I work out but the piece of crap isn't skin tight on the player as advertised (not Toshiba's fault).  All in all, I'm willing to take a few downsides of the player and still give 5 stars, ESPECIALLY when you consider the alternatives.  The price on these is at times amazing so don't snooze!

<Title>Solid iPod alternative (if you can deal with quirks)
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Gigabeat about 5 months ago, and I have to say I've been pretty satisfied. I'm not a fan of iTunes and I have all my music stored on my Media Center PC, so the Gigabeat was a logical choice. Sound quality is great, and the navigation system kills Apple's, hands down. The click wheel may be trendy, but the Gigabeat controls are functional. The Gigabeat also beats the iPod in storage convenience...it shows up as an external drive in Windows, and allows syncing to multiple computers (it's much less painful than iTunes).  Video is good, although the WMV conversion process is so slow that it's impractical unless you run it overnight. Photos are beautiful. The radio sucks (I receive maybe 2 stations).  The big killer is the battery life. The problem is a stupid programming decision: pressing the power button does NOT power off the unit. It puts the unit into a low-power standby mode. Thus, the battery is ALWAYS draining, albeit slowly. I bought an accessory kit from Amazon which included a "travel charger" and car charger, both of which are portable (unlike the bulky adapter included in-box), and they've been absolutely vital. The player can hold up for 2-3 days of intermittent usage before it dies, and there's a tiny switch on the bottom which allows you to power it completely OFF if you really need to conserve power.  It has its other quirks; like the one time it cleared off all my music for no apparent reason. Mine also had a pretty bad crash and I had to mail it in for repairs, but the service was quick and left all my media intact on the player. Any player will have quirks, though. The Gigabeat's quirks are compounded by the fact that there is absolutely ZERO documentation on them, but they're not impossible to deal with.  All in all, it's an excellent player--especially if you're a user of Windows Media Center. Be ready to deal with a few quirky issues, but this is the most solid iPod alternative I've seen yet.

<Title>love it
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had couple of these and every one has performed beyond my expectations. The only reason I have ever had to replace it was theft and one unfortunate experience with an airline stewardess and a drink tray (lots of smoke. When I first got it I played with all the EQ settings. I turned harmonics on and my battery wouldnt last for squat. Turning harmonics off increased battery life almost 60 percent. I have never had any issues with it losing my music. It transfers easily and plays every time. If I could combine its ease of use and function with my Wolverine Data ESP's 120 gig hard drive and crisp screen I would have the greatest mp3 player around. My current gigabeat is 9 months old and has been all over the world with me. it gets tossed into a back pack and ran through airport security, people not watching where they are going, and over crowded over head compartments. It is still going strong. Job well done

<Title>Nice on the surface, corrupt underneath.
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had one for six months and have had to send it back for replacement four times.  It has very poor software and no documentation.  It has trouble playing protected files, and the hard drive gets corrupted at the drop of a hat.  Once corrupted, there is no fix except returning it for replacement because there is no mechanism for totally erasing the hard drive and restoring the player to a virgin condition.  There are virtually no accessories and it appears to me that Toshiba may abandon the product very soon, especially now that Microsoft has decided to make Zunes with another company.  (In case you didn't know, the Zune so far has been a Gigabeat in disguise.)

<Title>The pros far outweigh the cons
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did alot of careful research before buying the Toshiba Gigabeat. I hated Ipods, as everyone in my family would call me when they froze or crashed etc. I also am a big fan of Window Media PLayer 11, and hate Itunes. I wasnt sure whether I wanted a Zune or a Gigabeat, but the Zune seemed too new and needed to work the bugs out. I have had my Gigabeat for six months and luckily I have had few problems with it. The hard drive is so massive I have been filling it for months and still have 20GB left!! I especially love its compatibility with subscription services. I used it with Vongo sucessfully (but Vongo's selection of movies stunk so I cancelled, nothing against the Gigabeat) However it is MTV's Urge that I use most often with the Gigabeat, which is also seemlessly integrated into WMP11. I download albums at will, quickly at that. The only problems I have had with the Gigabeat, 1) I have had some issues with deleting unwanted songs. I delete them from my library, but after synching, they are still on the Gigabeat! 2) Not to beat a dead horse, but the battery life is quite diappointing, a compared to what is promised. Turn off harmonics, and lower the backlight time, and that helps, but it still is miserable compared to some players. 3) It did freeze on me twice in six months, but that was easily remedied by shutting the battery completely off by a tiny siwtch on the back. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky, but my Gigabeat has had few of the quirks mentioned in the other reviews, and everyone who has used mine wants to buy one afterward. I love it, and it has become an intregal part of my life! Highly recommended!

<Title>bad choice
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We also did the research and thought this was the best from all reviews read. I bought it in january and it worked for a couple of weeks and then died work--screen froze.  amazon sent a replacement. it worked for well for two months (except we couldn't download tv shows recorded on our PC in Media Center XP), then screen froze and it would only turn on if plugged into the ac adapter. By this time, we had to return it to Toshiba. When we got it back, it was not fixed.  Just sent it back to toshiba again. we'll see.  It's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work.

<Title>Good user interface/Poor performace
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have this unit for about 4 months now. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy again. Good: - I like the MCE interface. It's intuitive and easy to use.  - Small, light weight and portable. - Was cheap when I bought it.  Bad: - Battery life is short (5-6 hrs for music). For my next player, I need something that will last me a whole week of commuting (10 hrs). - User interface needs some more refinement. For example, there's no way to sort a play list on the fly. It is sorted as it is listed in Windows. Since the interface is created by Microsoft, and now that Zune is out, it is unlike to ever be updated. This is a dead end product. The Zune uses an identical interface. Get the Zune if you want this unit. - Corrupted twice when I plugged into the computer for syncing. It happened twice during the first month but none since. It's not a big deal to re-sync the MP3s but for videos, it's a pain especially if you have a lot of videos to re-encode. - I hate the ipod but it got me green with envy when I went shopping for a dock/speakers.  In term of performance, the unit works fine, the sound is good, and it's EASY to use. If that's all you'll need and you can find it for cheap, get it. But for the battery life, lack of assc, and corruption issues, I would not buy again.

<Title>The gigabeat S is just a prototype for zune
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good product, the only thing is that it will delete all the stuff that's on it even if you look at it funny. I have had it delete my all my music and videos and pictures on it that took hours to put on in an instant. And what's worse is it happened more than once, 7 times is to many. So in the end would i recommend this product. To someone I don't like yes. Otherwise I highly recommend getting a microsoft zune. And it is just a really really bad prototype for the microsoft zune anyway, trust me I sold this player and bought a zune. The interface is the same, bigger screen, more color variety. What do you have to lose with the zune, memory? If that is the case you can just wait until the zune 2.0 comes out later this year.

<Title>Fantastic Portable Media Center!
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Toshiba have managed to produce an excellent portable media player that offers a massive specification over rivals. If you have an interest in Windows Media Center 2005/Vista Ultimate/XBOX 360 then this is the product for you as it is fully compatible with all and offers synchronisation of music, pictures, recorded TV and video. The display is very bright and clear and the sound quality from the head phones is great. This product would have got five stars if the USB connector was better and if it shipped with a protective case! Wonder what the Zune will be based on??

<Title>Teensy Videos, an UPDATE
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using flash players to organize my moods and activities with music in combination with Windows Media Player, but recently a change in our household setup provided an opportunity to download our whole music catalogue onto one player.  I selected the Toshiba 60 Gigabeat. It's solid, easy to load and works as promised, and at a very reasonable price, too. My concern surrounded the "video" feature. Why would anyone watch video on a 2.5" screen? Silly idea.  And yet. Programs from the TIVO Series 2 download automatically to our computer. From there it's just a moment to download programs onto the Toshiba and there are many, many programs which work nicely on a handheld device. It's probably not satisfying for displaying an action-adventure, but your favorite series and talk shows are vividly presented. The crisp picture offers bright, saturated color, even to my old eyes.  I considered the Zune, but with half the storage and the unnecessary wireless feature (unnecessary to me), the Toshiba seemed like a more practical solution.  11.26.06 UPDATE: I still give it 5 stars. Love this thing. Not that some experiences aren't unfortunate, but I can see where some people might run into trouble. Consider:  Depending on how your Windows Media Player (or other software) is set up, some files on the ToshGB might 'disappear.' If files don't exist in the 'home' list because they were moved or deleted, then those files might be removed from the player unit when next connected. Check the 'synch' options in your media software.  Battery problem? Maybe -- just maybe -- you have the unit plugged into an outlet that is operated by a light switch. If the switch is off, no power to feed the player (hey, we've all been there). Not the player's fault. Or possibly you are charging the player via USB on your computer? If the computer goes into sleep or hibernate mode, then power charging stops.  Just two issues that might help.  Husband watching the game, I'm watching Jon Stewart. In our particular home space, hooked up to a Tivoli, it delivers beautiful sound for two solid days without recharging. Simple to operate. Lovely to look at. Done.  05.05.07 UPDATE: Still works. Still holds a charge. Still accepts downloads after upgrading to Windows Media Player v11 and Vista software. It continues to be a very fine bit of technology and I enjoy using it very much.

<Title>Dead in 5 days
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>During the first four days of its life I liked my Gigabeat 60. Its interface is intuitive, and the sound is good.  In fact, I ordered a second unit for my wife.  I don't play videos so whatever problems there are there is of no concern to me.  The only problem during this honeymoon was that the battery was dead every morning.  I assumed this was due to operator incompetency and wowed to plug it in every night.   However now, on day five the unit is dead. Toshiba service does not answer the phone, I cannot find any helpful information on the web.  They are both going back.   at in Florida

<Title>DON'T BUY IT if you value your data and time!
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WARNING: At least 8 out of 36, or MORE THAN 22% OF AMAZON REVIEWERS, have reported mysterious software/hardware crashes and subsequent data loss with this unit. Do not buy this product. I, like several others writing reviews of this unit (and its cousin the 30GB model) got burned by the GigaBeat. I'm pissed off about it, but I will be as objective as possible in describing my experience to you.  FULL REVIEW: This unit is slickly designed, has great features, and tons of storage. The Microsoft OS and cross-shaped thumb control interface are both very intuitive...I liked them way better than the iPod jog wheel. Once you install the special-version Windows Media Player software that ships with the unit, it is easy to upload files to the unit and retrieve content from it. The GigaBeat also worked well with my digital camera, enabling me to download photos from my camera to the unit's hard drive directly via a USB cable. I found the battery life acceptable: at least 4-5 hours playing MP3 files.  Unfortunately, this unit is also incredibly unstable and prone to frequent and mysterious data loss. My decision to place my trust in the stability of this unit resulted in tragedy, as my Gigabeat's hard drive failed within 45 days of its initial use and I lost a ton of irreplaceable data. Despite well documented stability/data loss issues with this unit, Toshiba customer service was downright rude to me and provided no assistance in recovering from this situation - in fact, they even acted to prevent me from recovering my own precious data from the GigaBeat's drive!   Don't be misled by the 4+ stars overall Customer Rating. Read all the reviews word for word. As of this writing, including my review, at least 8 out of 36 Amazon reviewers have reported mysterious software/hardware crashes and subsequent data loss with this unit. That's over 22% of customers! Since when is it acceptable to launch such an expensive product into the market when less than 80% of them actually work consistently? Toshiba should be ashamed.   Like any computer user, I understand that disk drives inevitably fail at some point. However, if a vendor sells me a $300 (what I paid) piece of electronics that fails in less than two months, I expect at least an ounce of compassion and respect from their service department. Well, Toshiba sold me a lemon and could care less to help me out.  I will spare all the gory details because I am contemplating taking legal action against Toshiba for putting such a lemon product into the market. But in brief:  1) My Gigabeat's hard drive randomly failed one day when I went to turn on the unit, and Toshiba refused to provide any assistance whatsoever in helping recover the data I had stored on it. They simply told me that all they could do is take the unit back and refurbish/reformat the drive and reload the system software.  2) Despite the obvious existence of a data loss problem with this unit - again, read all of the Amazon reviews - Toshiba refused to refer me to a third-party data recovery company that was authorized to work on the hard drive in this unit, even though I volunteered to pay for any data recovery service charges myself. Something is clearly unstable with the GigaBeat, yet Toshiba has no plans or preparations to help customers that experience data loss. This is inexplicable to me.  3) The unit's hard drive uses a proprietary interface that prevented several data recovery services I hired from accessing the drive. When both they and I contacted Toshiba to obtain a simple part that enabled access to the drive, Toshiba refused to provide it. To repeat...their unstable product caused my data loss, I'm paying for the data recovery services out of my own pocket, and yet they still actively prevented the potential recovery of my priceless data (pictures from a dream vacation that had been planned for years).  To make matters worse, the Toshiba service reps and service manager were cold and unsympathetic at every turn. For example, they refused to tell me the model number of the hard drive in this unit...even though I OWNED it! Again, inexplicable. These are the kind of maddening interactions you can look forward to if you choose to buy this unit and then experience a problem.  I truly felt that on paper the GigaBeat was superior to the iPod in nearly every way. Unfortunately, I overlooked the most important factor. Whatever you do, don't forget to include product stability and quality in your buying decision - and this unit gets a big red F in that department.      CONCLUSION: Just be aware that buyers who rated the GigaBeat positively have not experienced the data loss problems endemic to this unit. That is understandable. Based on features and price alone, I also would rate the GigaBeat as 5 stars. The only problem is, using Amazon as a sample, more than 22% of the people who buy this product suffer from crashes and lost data. To me, that quality record is absolutely unacceptable for an electronics product in this day and age, and every day I regret the fact that I bought this unit before many of the current Amazon reviews had been posted.  So if you don't mind spending hours and hours reloading data on to the unit, potentially having to return it to Toshiba within weeks of your purchase, and battling with horrible service reps all along the way - and you have backups of all the files you put on it - the GigaBeat is a good value. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.

<Title>Awesome device... however.... (read)
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE THING.  The interface is absolutely amazing, looks clean and the screen effecs add an extremely nice touch. The buttons on the side, I think, work much better than a silly-ol' click wheel on an iPod, but that's just me. Now on to why I give this bad(litterally..?)boy a 3 out of 5.  I eaglery opened my package last monday very late night getting home from a friend's place. I quickly looked over the quick start guide.  "...charge device for 3 hours before intial use..."   Gotcha!  I leave it charging over night knowing it'll stop charging when it reaches full. I wake up early next morning and grab the gigabeat, and race to my computer. I install the enclosed disc's software which contains WMP10 and the horfixes nessecary for syncronizing the gigabeat.   Done!  I forget about the usb cable, I run back to my room, snatch up the cable and jack in.   Uploading my library...  Whew! 22gbs of music... I turn on the TV and patiently try to wait for the dang thing to upload all ths songs. about 20 minutes laters, Ding, finshed.  I go to my friends house later on in the night to show off my awesome gizmo and transfer some music to his computer. We have some freinds come over and we decide, hey, lets really try this thing out!@  I plug in my input/output sound cable in my friend's stereo auxiliary port, and oh yeah, music.  Sooo, we're busy all messing arround and having a blast a few hours later... and than... no music.  I look over and click the back arrow. Nothing happens. I try again. Again nothing.  SO I look over at my friend in confusion, and he's like did you fully charge it? I said "yeah", and he said, "doesn't it last 12 hours or something?"  yeah..?  We look at the clock its only 3AM, we had it playing from 10PM almost exactly (9:58ish). So only 5 hours of audio? I give up, and put it on the charger and pass out. I wake up, notice that it's fully charged, and wake up my friend. We let it play through my head phones continously to test it out thinking that maybe becuase it was jacked in the streeo it was draining power faster than the norm. This time it dies in just 4 hours in 45 minutes. I get frustrated and try one more time. 4 hours and roughly 53 minutes.  I gave up and went home, and contacted amazon asking for a replacement. It should be arrving monday, so I will update this.  again, the product is amazing, crystal clear audio and screen, extremely easy to use interface (although it doesn't have a clock which I think is retarded), and the Lock button doesnt feel like its going to break in a million pieces... *caugh*nano*caugh*.  Be back for part two. DUN DUN DUN!

<Title>1 Star on the first day, but I was way off!  Buy it!  DAMN!  IT JUST DIED!  DON"T BUY IT!
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>BACK TO 1 STAR.  READ FULL REVIEW.  Admittedly I was ripping my hair out on the first day I owned this player.  It seemed as though the battery life was terrible, and there appeared to be issues with the way it stored music.  I was completely wrong.  Give the battery a few cycles and you'll be impressed.  Yesterday it lasted over 10 hours.  The one thing that is essential is that you use this player with Media Player 11.  Trust me on this one.  It was MP10 that made my first day hell with this thing because of how it treats ID tags.  WM11 is nothing short of a breakthrough.  You'll love the interface and it's far better than ITunes.  It's the perfect companion to the Gigabeat.  Finally, it was Rhapsody music service that made this player worth it.  For $14.99 you can subscribe to "Rhapsody to Go."  Imagine how great it would be to just grab the latest albums and dump them onto your player...all for one flat monthly fee.  It's really made this player a joy to have.    So there you have it.  With a bit of patience this player is absolutely worth it.  Tiny size, great screen, and an intuitive interface for a fantastic price.    -------------------------------------WARNING!!! IMPORTANT NEW INFO!!! First I hated it. Then I loved it. Then IT DIED. After just one month of ownership I eventually came to love this device. Today I powered it up, and got this message: "contact manufacturer for repair." That's it. It's over. What a shame that such a great looking and functional player has so many problems. Toshiba's tech support is horrific. Don't buy this. Look to the Creative Zen M 60. I had the 30GB version and loved everything but it's capacity. That's my next purchase. I'm done with Toshiba!!!
