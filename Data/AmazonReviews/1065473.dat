<Title>Zune- bye, bye Zen and Windows Media too
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a couple of Zen MP3 players that have worked well for me for a couple of years now, but both have begun to have problems and I decided to take a chance on the new V2 Zune. It was a good decision. This is a great product. All that comes in the box is the Zune, a sync cord, earphones, and brief documentation. You need to go online and download the Zune software to a PC and then hook up the player before you can get it to do anything. This doesn't take too long and the Zune will provide you with some sample content to try out as part of this process. The Zune sounds great, with plenty of volume and a decent set of earphones. The click wheel is intuitive and masterable in just a few minutes use.   As nice as the Zune is, a pleasant surprise is the Zune software. This is really more than just a tool to sync your tunes with your Zune. It is an attractive, intuitive, easy to use full fledged media player as well. It can easily replace Windows Media Player and is better looking than any other offering out there- Apple included.

<Title>Excellent media player
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although the Zune software isn't as user friendly as itunes, the media player itself is awesome and much more useful to me because of the radio.  The last 2 gyms I've gone to broadcast tv sound through fm radio.  Ipods radio headphones really suck.  The new 8gb zune is like an oversized nano or a mini.  The form factor is cool & most importantly I don't need 2 programs to get podcasts on the media player.  I can't wait to get a cablecard media center pc to get episodes of hbo shows and colbert report to watch on the metro.

<Content>i traded in my ipod nano for the zune and am incredibly pleased. the touch pad was easier for me to get used to than the clickwheel of the ipod and the display is worlds better. i also prefer the zune software to itunes, easy to use and much better looking. this makes my nano seem boring and primitive. i would definitely recommend the zune!

<Title>Terrific Product
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the black 8GB Zune and couldn't be happier. The 2nd generation Zune has everything I'm looking for in an PMP and more. The device is light, easy to operate, and loaded with functionality.   - Although my 1st generation Zune's software had a few installation quirks, the new Zune software installed perfectly.  The installation time took a total of five minutes and worked without any problems.   -The Zune marketplace has been totally redone and has a slick new interface. Microsoft has added podcasts and music video downloads to the marketplace.  -The new touchpad is easy to use and actually fun to play with.  There is still a 4-way directional pad, but it feels much sturdier than its predecessor's.   -Setting up wireless syncing with my laptop took less than a minute and works perfectly.  I'm using a D-Link router with WEP and I didn't have to modify anything on my network, or enter my wireless key for this to work.  I was pretty surprised by that.  -Although slower than tethering, wireless syncing is a great feature.  I lose cables on occasion and like the fact that I'm no longer required to have one.  If you're syncing 500 songs, this may not be very practical; but, if you're syncing an album, this is a convenient feature.  -Transferring songs between Zunes works flawlessly.  You can send an entire album to a friend in a minute or so and it's as simple as hitting "send".   -Video looks surprising sharp on the Zune's screen.  Although it's not very big, the image is crisp and very colorful.  I wouldn't recommend watching Star Wars--or any full length movies--on the tiny screen, but video podcasts or an episode of Family Guy would be fine.     Overall, if you're looking for a PMP, you won't be disappointed with the Zune.  It's light, well styled, easy to operate, and has features you won't find in other PMPs like wireless syncing/sharing, and a subscription music service with 3,000,000+ songs. When you combine the Zune with Zune Marketplace, it's a truly amazing product.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys music.

<Title>It's awesome!
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the 30GB Zune and I thought that was great, but it's so big. I'm so glad that they came out with the 4GB and 8GB. I recently purchased the 8GB, which I pretty much just use when I'm working out.  What I really like is that I can download an unlimited amount of music for just $14.99 a month.  I can't wait until them come out with more accessories for the 2nd Generation Zunes.

<Title>Zune vs. Nano?
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned the 4 & 8 GB Nanos...and today I picked up the 8 GB 2nd Gen Zune.  The Zune hardware is much better where it counts for me (sound quality, screen).  The new touch area takes a little getting used to.  My main HUGE dissapointment is the simple and VERY limited Zune software.  It doesn't even list the time for each track.  It's so simple, it's hard to do some simple things like adding a folder to import music from.  Secondary dissapointments include the lack of an EQ (although with better earphones than the iPod, it's not as important), lack of customizable menus, and lack of a...CLOCK and calendar.  With XP and an older 2.0 GHz computer, the Zune software install took nearly an hour (without adding music).  Uploading music to the Zune seems slower than with the Nano.  Time will tell is the positives outweight the negatives over the Nano.  Sure wish it had come in 16 GB!

<Title>Good, but better options available
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zune to replace an iPod that I lost. Bad decision! The battery seems to go out right away, and I never use the Wifi for anything - so I feel a bit like I paid for something I'll never use.   In the end, I bought a new iPod, and have been much happier with it.

<Title>Zune Flash Vs. Nano?
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Definitely Zune wins. Apple, on defence, shipped out their new video nanos with that cute little Fiest advert. But the Nano design is simply horrible It's an ugly little chode, by all standards. The flash Zunes have better screens, they're smaller, and fit better in your pocket, which is exactly what people buy flash players for. Second-Gen Zunes are an underdog winner, for sure.
