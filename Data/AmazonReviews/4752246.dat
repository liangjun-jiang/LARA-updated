<Title>Be Aware Does Not Work with Itunes
<Date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nowhere in the product description (or in the manual) does it mention that there are limited sites to download from.. in fact, there are no sites listed at all.  The manual says to drag music from a music download site to the mp3player.  Although this was easy to do, the player will not recognize any of the songs I downloaded.  COBY customer service was unhelpful.  Call and find out exactly which sites you can download from, or don't waste your money.

<Title>An okay player...Warning: Lead exposure hazard
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the player quickly and was easy to transfer mp3 files...just plug it into the USB port, drag, and drop.  Main Menu is somewhat cryptic, using abbreviations instead of words for each selection.  The little selection nub worked okay but felt a little slippery.  Display is bright and readable with a nice array of backlight colors to choose or cycle through.  The unit uses a AAA battery instead of the more common rechargeable kind thru the USB port.  The real irating part is the earphones.  The phones themselves sounded marginal with little bass and are somewhat large in size.  The REAL problem with them is that the cord insulation contains LEAD and thus poses a health hazard.  I already own Christmas lights that have this problem, but those I handle once per year.  But to have lead in a product that is to be handled daily is unacceptable.  And since I had bought this for my daughter, for sure I will throw the earphones away and buy better, SAFER ones for her, if not send the unit back altogether.  Why 2 stars and not 1?  It's small but not too small, has a USB connection and includes a USB extension cable, nice looking and good display, and easy to use once you learn it.  Instructions are simple (in them you see the lead warning).  Will attempt to post a copy here when I get them scanned in.

<Title>Whoa!
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use this at work.  I do weedeating, and as you can imagine its reallly loud.  I just put it on hold, stick it in my pocket and Im good to go for a couple of hours.  Even at the highest volume (which is pretty ear-drum blasting!) its batteries last.  I LOVE the equalizer, and as for durability, its survived two years of abuse between work, getting left in the sun, having gatorade spilt on it, etc.  I give this a definate thumbs up!

<Title>Got to have reasonable expectations
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>An excellent product, especially for the price.  With a good set of headphones the bass is very acceptable and volume perfectly suited to private listening.  I would very much like to have it a meet all my needs and personal crusades, but hey, for the price I can afford to use another set of headphones; it's not like I don't have a few laying around.  In hindsight I would get a little larger memory device, but for a starter system this is beyond great and if the big kids on the playground take it from me, I'm not out that much.

<Title>I'm not an MP3 person!

<Content>I found this little device a bit complicated and the instructions weren't clear to me. I gave up.
