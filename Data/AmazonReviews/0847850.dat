<Title>The Way it Should Be
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife and I had previously owned two Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 players and had many many problems. Mostly with syncing the songs onto the devices and also some with proper playback. The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod. So we returned the Philips players and got an 80GB and 30GB iPod. Neither has let us down once. They sound great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use). itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do. podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories. It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings. On the 80GB iPod we have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of our outlook contacts and it is only about half full. Not to mention the games that come with it. If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works.   My wife uses the 30GB white version and loves it. it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is much slimmer feeling as far as the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great. We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.) This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player. Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

<Title>Great product, buy one today!  But . . .
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>don't buy it here.  Go to the Apple store either online or a retail location.  There you will get the product and support you need and you won't have to wait a month or so to get that wonderful Amazon message that says they can't fill your order at this time, but would you like to wait?  And after 4 months or so of not getting your new ipod, just try getting your money back from Amazon.

<Title>Great, but has a sluggish interface
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one.  The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input.  When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay.  And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop. Overall this is a great player, and I am surprised they didn't put a faster processor in there.

<Title>ipod or zune...???
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well let's take a quick look at both of them, which one's sexier? well for me ipod is way sexier than zune (besides zune looks really bulky). Zune's screen is bigger, but i guess the screen is not a big problem is it? ipod's wheel make navigating through menus easier, while zune has a pad instead of a touch-sensetive wheel. The wireless thing would be really cool if you could actually keep the songs you receive!! but no, they only last 3 days, and you can only play them 3 times, now that sucks. If you want an MP3 for christmas, i'd really recommend ipod, cause zune just isn't as good as ipod. Yeah microsoft may rule at computers, but they suck at making MP3 and videogames. So that's all i have to say for now, hopefully this helped you realized that ipod is the best MP3 out there.

<Title>Moving on to Bigger and Better
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant "let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel" navigation "aid" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion.

<Title>A Great Buy for Kids and Adults!
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an Ipod video really bad for my thirteenth birthday, but my parents said that it was too expensive. So, you can imagine my surprise of seeing the Ipod video box nestled under the wrapping paper! The first thing I did with it was connect it to our Mac and download the songs from Itunes onto it. The Ipod downloaded the songs quite fast (I was very impressed! It took my sisters nano forever!). I then went to check out the movie store and bought Harry Potter and Napoleon Dynamite. After, I downloade Pac- Man from the games section. I played around on it until my mom said I had to go to bed. I didn't feel tired, so I brought my Ipod with me and watched Napoleon Dynamite under the covers and a couple Tv shows until midnight!                The next Night, my friend Alexis had a sleepover, and I decided to bring my iPod to it (I have trouble sleeping at other people's houses, it freaks me out). When I was in the bathroom changing into my PJs, my friend Mary was in my bag looking for Chapstick that I said I'd lend her. She saw the Ipod in there and showed it to everyone else. When I came out, they were all looking at it, amazed that it could do so many things! When they saw me, they rushed up to me and started asking me questions. The rest of the night went on as normal. We did each other's hair, a couple girls played Pac man and watched Hannah Montana on my iPod (I don't like Hannah Montana! I swear! It was already on iTunes!). When it was finally time for bed, I couldn't sleep (duh) so I got out my iPod. I guess I wasn't the only one not asleep, because my friend Alexis saw me and asked what I was doing. We watched Harry Potter together, and Napoleon Dynamite! When we knew we had to sleep, it was 5 a.m.! This iPod is addictive!                        Of course, nothing can be perfect. I know you didn't want to waste your time reading me babble on about how great the iPod video is. It scratches a lot! I'd invest in a case to protect it. Whe I'm scrollinng through my music, the scroll sometimes stops for a second, not that important, but extremely annoying. Also, the scroll wheel is smaller, which means that it takes longer to go through your music.                 There are also a lot of new features with the iPod video. There's the combination lock, where you can set a password so that only you can get into it. Also, it's the only iPod able to play games and videos (duhhhhhh). REASONS KIDS LIKE IT... It's great on long trips like feild trips, to pass time. All of your friends like it (this can also be a bad thing! It scrartches easily when your friends handle it roughly! Please be careful.) The games are lots of fun when you have free time in school (be sure that your teachers will let you bring your iPods to school.) When you can't sleep, the movies are a great way to pass time REASONS ADULTS LIKE IT... It's functional and practical Very portable You can use it in work while your boss drones on and on (or so my mom says...) My dad says that the podcasts are fun to watch (I like Strong Bad ones) TIPS: Invest in a case! I cannot say this enough! You'll regret it if you dont! I recomend the Belkin Brushed Metal/Acrylic Case for iPod. It comes in Light Green, Teal, Pink, and Silver! I have the Teal one, it makes my iPod video look like it came blue!

<Content>You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to view and show others your photos and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase!

Last month I was looking for an iPod for my sister, which should cost maximum 50-80$ and then I found this one - and fell in love with it :-)  It was in the "Refurnished"-category, but actually I couldn't find any bigger scratches or other problems and now I've already been listening to it every day and it's just great! The battery works really long and the 30GB of memory are just...awesome :-) Thanks very much for this great item!

<Title>Nice video player - try it with TiVo
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What can you really say about the iPod that hasn't been written already. I'll try one thing: as a commuter who own Tivo at home, I love being able to Tivo movies (TCM - Turner Classic Movies - has them without commercials!), transfer them wirelessly to my Mac computer, then export them to iPod-viewable format for me to watch on my iPod to and from work. Much easier than watching movies on a laptop. (If you do this, record the movies "Basic" quality on Tivo and the encoding and exporting will go much faster and the file size will be reduced - and the quality of the picture will be indistinguishable from "Medium" or even "High" when viewed on your iPod

<Title>Mounting issues 
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm the veteran of many IPod models, and have worked with all of them on various Macs and PCs.  My advice is to get the biggest one you can afford, load it up, and don't count on it ever interfacing with your computer again.  An absolutely wonderful device once you get it loaded, but horrific in terms of consistently being recognized by either your desktop or itunes itself.  I'm still happy I have my current 30 gig model since it's loaded with just about everything I'd care to listen to anyway - and for that reason alone it was worth the money - but I'm amazed at how popular a product it remains (especially the smaller ones) given how poorly it fares with both firewire and usb connectivity.

<Content>Excellent product Apple! I've owned this product 2 years from now, and I'm still using it.  There are 2 ways of using it, 1. As a music player 2. as an external hard drive. I like those ideas! that's what made me give up on my new iPod Touch and return back to using my iPod Video.  I strongly disagree that it is prone to finger prints, mine is perfectly clean, like it was new from the box. On, the front, there are absoloutly no scratches, but there are a few on the back.  Pros  -Long battery life -Can be used as an external hard drive -Games -Contacts -Screenlock  Those are all I can remember from the Pros of my iPod, and now the sad part ...  Cons  -Lacks built-in FM radio tuner -Lacks coverflow  I really like this product, I'll be keeping it with me a few more years, then I'll get a new one.

<Content>I always told myself I would never give into the Ipod trend... but last weekend I broke down and bought myself the 30gb black video Ipod. I'm already in love with it... it's my new baby! It's very simple to use, sounds great, and looks good. I love the fact that there are so many accessories available for Ipods too! I was so close to buying a Creative Labs Zen W but backed out because of it's huge size and lack of accessories.  One disadvantage is that it gets fingerprints on it VERY easily- you MUST use a case with it! Another small gripe about it- I don't think you can use wallpaper or a screensaver with it, which is something I really think would enhance the whole Ipod experience... maybe I'm just too new to the whole thing and I can't figure out how to do it- but it doesn't look like you can customize the interface like that.

<Title>I hate this thing
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this thing for about 12 hours now, and I'm about ready to chuck it out the window and let it rust away in the snow.  First thing you should know...there's no AC adapter in the box.  You have to buy one separately.  Yeah, I know, you charge it by connecting it to your computer.  That's kinda handy, since you don't need another AC to plug in.  But it does me no good on the road.  Sure, you can purchase an AC adapter separately, but this is the only device I've ever seen that didn't have one in the box.  Lame.  Second thing you need to know...the installation software is not in the box.  You have to download it from the Internet.  It took 5 stinking hours to download the da*n software.  Yeah, I know...they recommend you have a broadband connection.  But not everyone has access to broadband.  So ruralites like me, who live in an area with no broadband and lousy phone lines...it's going to take hours to download.  They save a couple bucks by not putting in a CD.  I spend 5 hours to download.  I don't know about you, but my time's worth more than $0.20 an hour.  Lame.  iTunes, the software that you're supposed to use to manage your files, doesn't suit my needs.  I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books while I'm driving.  I have all the MP3 files on my computer, from when I ripped them from the (legally purchased) CDs back when I had my iRiver.  All I needed to do was copy them to the iPod and listen to them.  It should be so simple.  You can copy the files to the iPod without installing the software, but you can't listen to them.  Then when you install iTunes, you cannot access the files (until you check the checkbox that lets you manage the files yourself, and find where to Save that change).  Once you do that, you can put them into the Library. Lame.  iTunes also does not let me customize the Library.  I don't need "Movies", "TV Shows", "Radio", or "Podcasts".  I need "AudioBooks", and I can't add it (and I can't remove Movies, etc.).  I also can't create folders in the Library.  All my audio-book files (which were nicely organized in folders on my computer) get dumped into the "Music" folder without the folder structure.  Sure, I can create Playlists for each book, and I can create folders to organize the Playlists.  But I have to dig through thousands of files in the Music Library to populate the Playlists.  And besides, I already have them organized.  Now I have to do it again.  Lame.  And this blasted wheel control on the iPod.  Sure, after some practice I'll get the hang of it.  But you know...you shouldn't have to practice to be able to use it.  I didn't have to practice to use my iRiver, I could use it right away without problems.  If this thing doesn't last longer than my iRiver did, I'm going to be really angry.

<Title>My first iPod
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I have read all the reviews from the "haters" of the iPod and it makes me wonder why these people even bought one in the first place if they don't like it. On the other hand, I love mine! There are a ton of accessories for the iPod and it's just simple to use (Apple's catch phrase of "it just works" that they use for the mac applies here).   I have owned a couple of mp3 players over the years and recently bought a zune to see what it is like in the real world. Let me put it to you this way, the zune is back with amazon. After using the zune for a week and then going back to my iPod, the iPod is by far the better device. Much more simple to use and a "sexy" device (as one reviewer described it).   Apple has always designed beautiful products that are also functional. So what if you have to download iTunes? Most of the people who own the iPod have broadband internet access anyways (and a mac on top of that).   I know that if you spend the money on this device you won't be sorry. My only reccomendation would be to get a case for it (if nothing else other than to not have to carry it in your pocket).

<Title>The best disk based MP3 player bar none
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my fourth MP3 player. I have previously owned a 4th generation, 40GB iPod, a Creative Zen Touch 20GB and currently own a Sandisk 1GB flash player as well as the new, black, 30GB, 5th gen video iPod. When I opened the box and took out the player, I was amazed at just how slim it is. The 40GB 4th gen iPod I had was much thicker. I would think that the 80GB 5th gen model would be about the same thickness as my 4th gen model. The screen is larger and very clear. I orginally just wanted a music player but after downloading some video podcasts (free from iTunes) and seeing just how high the video quality is, I am really glad that I have the option to play videos as well as music. After getting used to the Zen Touch's scroll bar, I forgot just how comfortable it is to use he iPod's click wheel, it is the most natural interface I can imagine (other than voice) and is a joy to use except for the fact that clockwise is down and anti-clockwise is up. I can't recall if it has always been that way with iPods but to scroll down I naturally want to scroll 'anti' (I'm right handed) and I am finding it a little odd to have to do the opposite(maybe it's just me). Sound quality is very good - not better than the Zen Touch, but very good. I wish there was customizable EQ settings but maybe that will come with a future firmware upgrade. Using iTunes is a joy. I know how restrictive it is but I just love the interface and its functionality. I love the fact that after subscribing to podcasts it will download new episodes automatically and then sync then to the iPod; kind of like a DVR series recording feature. The lack of a dock (which came with the 4th gen iPod I had) and also a mains charger is a bit of a pain but I guess the exclusion of these have helped bring the price of the iPod down to a a very reasonable level so I can't complain. Battery life is much better than the 4th gen iPod and I believe that the sound quality is too. One thing, the iPod I got from Amazon looked like it had defaulted to Khazakstanise but fiddling about with the settings (and hoping for the best) enabled to me to change the language to English so don't panic if the first time you hook it up you can't understand a word! The iPod, still the King, as these latest models show.

<Title>great addition/upgrade to my iPod collection
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got into the iPod scene rather late in the game. My first iPod was a first generation iPod that I bought used a little less than two years ago. It was a little too bulk for my main uses which are mainly working out and walking. I upgraded to a new 4GB iPod Nano and loved it. I was starting to run out of space on my Nano, so I was fortunate to receive the 30 GB iPod as a gift. I'm already a fan of iTunes and the various features of the iPod family, bu the new feature that I like most about this iPod is its video capability. Even though friends had told me that watching video on the iPod was not bad, I had my doubts. However, after taking my new iPod on a transatlantic flight and watching a couple of episodes of Law & Order, I have to say that I was very satisfied with the quality of the picture. It sure helped to pass the time. For some reason I did not get the 3.5 hours of video playback that Apple claims. In fact my battery was almsot drained in a little under 2 hours...perhaps my iPod was not fully charged. In any case, it seems that there are a lot of small external power/battery options that will get my iPod across the Atlantic next time. I should note that this iPod is perhaps a little too bulky for my workouts...fortunately I still have my Nano for the gym.

<Title>Only a few minor glitches....
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, this thing is pretty awesome. I am 13 and it holds everything that I need, and I see now that I didn't need the 80GB. I will say that you need to immediately buy a case and AC adapter right when you get it, if you plan to bring it in the car. The case is something you ABSOLUTELY have to have, unless you want a smudged, scratched, finger-printed ipod. Also, I have the white and my friend has a black one, and the white doesn't show the scratches quite as badly. Skip the rhinestones and glitter, girls, because you need a case on your ipod more than you need extra sparkles to show off!!!! But, there are lots of positive aspects to this player as well. First, the screen is alot brighter and I don't know what the people are talking about who say the screen is dull. Remember to turn on the backlight while watching movies. My 17 year old sister has a Creative Zen, and the Ipod is better. But not by much. The ipod has the click wheel and is alot easier to find your way around it and navigate through than the Zen. If you are looking for a media player that is easy to navigate, stylish, fun, popular, and useful, get the 30GB ipod, unless you need a  TON of space, in which case I would recommend the 80GB. I hope you enjoy your player!!!!!!!!

<Title>Great for the music fan, but go to the 80gb model for the video fan

<Content>I have been an Ipod fan for a while and was thrilled to see this new Ipod come out in 30GB with video capability, color screen and the whole works. This is a perfect item for those who want to carry around the bulk of their music but don't have the need for hard drive sized storage. For those like me who have hours of tv shows and movies I like to carry around, the 80GB version is definitly the better way to go. The battery life is excellent and the color screen is crisp and clear, although I still hate the earbuds with a passion bordering on wanting to crush them with a bat.   The casing is sleek, and seems to have mostly eliminated the problems of scratching the first generation Nano's had. The price point seems well suited for Christmas buyers. Think about the type of use you want to get out of it, and then make the your decision. No matter what, you can't go wrong. If there are mechanical issues, Apple will fix them under the warranty, but a protective case is a highly recommended addition. If you know you are going to get the 30GB model, wait a few weeks after Christmas. The price points usually drop a bit as Apple gets ready to start rolling out updated models in the summer.  A.G.

<Title>Nifty
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 30G iPod.  I currently carry in the neighborhood of 5,000 songs with me wherever I go.  Rating songs and making smart playlists on iTunes really allows me to enjoy all my music in a way that would be very difficult to pull off any other way.  The Pod itself is well-built, the menus are easy to navigate and the screen is nice.    Why not 5 stars?  There are a few things that I don't like or understand.  Not only can I not transer songs/playlists from one computer (home) to another (work), I can't hook up my iPod and play them through the second computer at all.  Yes, you can transfer them over like a jump drive but why do I have to go through the extra work of rating songs and making playlists when I've already spent a ton of hours doing it once?  I can also only acquire songs to my library via the first computer.

<Title>What if it's stolen?  NOTHING!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPods are hot.  Because they're hip, because of their size, because of their re-sale value, and because Apple does NOTHING to help if an iPod is lost or stolen, many of them are indeed hot.  Once connected to a computer on the Internet, Apple could *very easily* render an iPod that's been reported stolen to become inoperable, and request that it be returned to an Apple Store, no questions asked.  However they know that by doing this it would cut into their profits.  Instead of returning a lost/stolen iPod, the victim is expected to buy a new one, and the recipient of the "acquired" iPod will likely buy songs through iTunes.  It's not a bug -- it's a feature!

<Title>My second opinion on the iPod
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I hated iPod (something to do with my first one literally blowing up) But I gave it another chance, and to my surprise, it's been working great. I give the actual product 5 stars, but I loathe iTunes, seeing as how I had to delete all my music from it since I ran out of memory on my HD. Luckily you're able to set it to manual sync, meaning your iPod won't automatically sync the content currently on your iTunes account, or in my case LACK of content. It's inevitable, but I'm gonna have to eventually upload all my albums again. A simple "load content from iPod to iTunes" feature would do wonders for me.

<Title>Short Life
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ipods are great when they are working. 30 GB was more memory than I'd ever need to take my whole music collection with me and an occasional movie. On the downside, it is was not very customizable, but that was really minor.  The major problem I had with it was that it only lasted a year. That is really horrible. I don't know if it's the battery or the hardrive, but either way it's not worth the money to get it repaired.  I'd hope the new Ipods last longer.

<Title>The Best Gift EVER!!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my IPOD for Christmas 2 years ago. How cool is it to be able to upload your CD collection .. up to 7500 songs on the 30GB.. onto ONE little IPOD!!?? And never have to mess with CDs and CD cases again! Frees up your shelves at home (no more CD library!!), and makes long commutes to work in the car much more enjoyable!  I have an IPOD dock that is hooked up to my home stereo as well. I can't say enough about how great this thing is! The only drawback so far after 2 years of use- You can't see the touch-wheel in low light or in the dark. It would be helpful if the buttons had a backlight! Oh  and yes it scratches easily, so I think it should come with a case or protective skin instead of having to go buy one! Other than that, great gift!!!

<Title>A wonderful albeit expensive mp3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used my 5G 30GB iPod for 2 years now as both an mp3 player and as a portable hard drive, and it has fulfilled both of those roles well.  The interface is very easy to use, and compatibility is not an issue. Being able to carry 30GB of music around is great!  I've dropped my iPod on numerous occasions-- on carpet, on hardwood floor, and even on asphalt-- and it still works like normal.  My only complaints are that the rear aluminum casing scratches very easily, taking away its aesthetic quality, and also I wish I could take my songs off the iPod without using third party software.

<Title>Great Player horrible support
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Ipod is a great device for a while, but Apple has horrible support for these devices. They were designed to be disposable which means Apple believes you should be willing to drop 250 every two years. I am glad Steve jobs is rich, but it is upsetting that he thinks the rest of the world is. Also, the warrenty says everything about apple's confidence in their product...90 days. If you want longer you have to PAY for it. This is also true for all of apple's products. Thats why I am a PC guy, if I'm oly going to get 90 days I'm not going to pay large sums of money for substandard products.

<Content>At first, I did not think I should have picked up the new Ipod so late in the year. knowing Apple, something new is coming. I picked up the the 30gb hard drive ipod to replace my 10gb one. I mostly go it to play the video. I had to feel it out for a week to see if I would keep it of just send it back. Well it's been a week and i love it.   The screen is brighter and the videos I play on it looks better on the Ipod then they did on my computer. I have not had any problems with the 30gb Ipod.  The video is great and the sound is greater. This thing has the best sound I have ever heard. The Tv Shows and the music sound great.   Apple is a great company the make great products. 5 start out of 5

<Content>Our 9 month old 30GB IPod stopped working, we sent it back in their special box, with the special tape they provide.  They say it arrived empty and they will not replace it.  DHL, which Apple forces you to use, says the box arrived untampered with.  No one will return the box to me, Apple hung up on me (after 5 hours on hold and after speaking to 5 very "apologetic" people who understood my frustration).  Apple stole my IPod.

<Title>iPod Beginner
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I purchased the iPod 30 Gb Video 5.5 geration, I had numerous questions I could not find answers to.  For those just starting here are a few facts:  - I love this model.  If I had known the capabilities I would have   purchased a long time ago. - This iPod will hold about 500 hours of audio.  That would be 38 books having 350 pages each. - Broadband connection (DSL is OK) is best for downloading books.  It took about 1.5 hours to download a 700 page book from [...]. - You can take CDs you already own, import them into ITunes on your comouter, and download them to your Ipod from there.  This includes music, lectures, talks, etc. - Since this model only plays for 14 hours between charges, I bought a Battery Extender.  Be sure to buy the one specifically for this model.  It lengthens playtime, between charges, to 42 hours. The Extender comes with a skin for protecting the iPod. - With the Extender on the iPod, it will not fit most cases or docking systems.  It does, however, fit in the Bose iPod Sound Docking System with romote control.  Icidently, this Bose system is great Bose quality and worth the money.  Bose also makes ear-buds that are incredible. - The ear-buds that came with the iPod were hard and too big for my ears.  Both Sharper Image and Bose have softer ones with better sound quality, fitting ear canals of differing size. - This model plays 3.5 hours of Video.  If you are going to use this source to play movies, you may want to consider the 80Gb that plays 6 hours of video and has 50 Gb more memory. I am happy with this model as I wanted it mostly for books, lectures, and classical music. - I recommend the 3 year warranty for the iPod and warranties, where available, for the accessories. - If you are buying a gaget to hook the iPod to your car FM, be sure it fits your car model.  I have to send back the one I chose for this reason.

<Title>Mixed Feelings
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent Product in terms of design, software functionality, evolution etc etc.  BUT they constantly have problems - I was on my 4th,.. (yes I have taken it back to Apple 3 times, from which they happily give me a new one) G4 60GB Ipod Photo. They constantly stuff up, freeze... I had one of them not work for 2 WEEKS, I tried everyday to start it and I got the unhappy Ipod face,.. I finally located an apple repairer, I took it in I went to show them what was happening and it turned on in the store (WTF???). I asked them to test it anyway. 4 Days later they said nothing was wrong with it.  So I took it back,.. only for it to STOP WORKING AND NEVER WORK AGAIN about 3 weeks later.   All of these models I took great care of, they didn't get dropped,and were in protective hard leather casing.  BUT essentially you are walking around with a portable HD,.. so come on guys,.. I don't go exercising with my laptop,.. and it is fine. In terms of exercise all that shock can't be good for the Ipod. So what do you expect?  So yes they are great things to have... yes my experience are they stuff up all the time, Apple are good with replacements... and YOU SHOULD DEF get the EXTRA APPLE CARE PLAN... though an extra $100 sucks.  Better luck with my G5? We will see fingers crossed.

<Title>Not ready for Prime Time?
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought a 30G for my daughter's birthday.  It lasted about 3 weeks before giving up the ghost.  One day we just couldn't get any response at all from the unit.  We went through all the reset procedures on the Ipod (excuse me, iPod) support site to no avail.      Amazon came through and paid the return shipping on the dead unit and sent us a new one before receiving the old one.  The new unit got here 3-4 days later and probably lasted a whole 30 minutes dying exactly the same way as the first one.    These units weren't dropped or mishandled in any way; so I believe the failures are probably due poor design or quality control on Apple's part.      I've had an Iriver 20G for a couple of years now.  I've traveled extensively with it and no problems.  So it is apparently possible to produce robust HD based units.    Anyway, I feel badly for my daughter because I think she really enjoyed it while it worked but this product appears to be a triumph of marketing over quality. .

<Title>My HD failed just as the warrenty expired!
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When it works, the iPOD is a great product. However, I'm VERY frustrated by what happens when it fails (and it will). Apple's advice? Buy a new one. I bought a 40G IPOD Photo 2 years ago for $500 plus the AppleCare 2yr protection plan ($65), plus $500 worth of iTunes. It crashed 1 month after the plan expired. Apple says there's no way to fix it and suggests I simply go out and buy another one (for $350+tax). No way! I'd never spend more than $100 for an iPOD again. And I'll never buy a hard drive based iPOD again. If I did, I'd be spending an average of $400 a year simply for the luxury of owning an iPOD -- that's nuts.

<Title>Truly stunning:  iPod does it again.
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first of its kind:  Small, sleek, and stylin'  the iPod has many new features to offer.  It now(as you already know) can play all of your favorite TV shows, Music Videos, and even Movies.  It is now also slightly adapted to the gaming world.  Some older classics such as Pac-Man and Tetris have been adapted for the Click Wheel but other new games such as Vortex are truly worth the very reasonable $5.  The iPod video is truly one of its kind and is quite remarkable.    PROS:  Great Capacity  Vibrant Color Screen  Sleek  Next Generation  All-New Download types avalible on iTunes only avalible for this model  Can put already owned DVDs on it using QuickTime 7 Pro [...]  Fits and Syncs perfectly with iTunes unlike some other media players  Almost any accesory type imaginable is made for iPod  Runs on Lithium-Ion battery  CONS:  Short battery life for long trips  Apple Brand accesories are a bit pricy  No way to change dead battery except to send it back to Apple  Scratches and gets fingerprints on it easily  Few accesories in box that would be useful such as charger for outlets(it normally charges in computer USB Port)  Needs a new USB adapter w/ power cord for power for very old models of computer(2000 or earlier ABOUT)  There are more valuable Pros than Cons when you consider a weighted system for iPod score.  I am not a music Guru and use my iPod about once or twice a week but even then it makes a great present for just about anyone at a fairly reasonable price.  Not a "Must Buy" but definately deserves considering.

<Title>Read reviews carefully
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a 3rd Generation 20GB iPod, and have had it for several years.  I use it in the car with a car adaptor, I use it around the house, and I take it to the gym with me, and I love it.  I have dropped it several times, both with and without a protective case, and it continues to work without a problem.  I think the only problem I have had with it is that my computer only has a 30GB hard drive so I had to buy an external hard drive to store backup copies of all my music without completely slowing down my laptop.  This is hardly the fault of the iPod.  The reason for writing is I just think that everyone needs to read reviews carefully.  Everyone I know has an iPod - including nanos, shuffles.  No one has ever had the problems I have read from Amazon customers.  You'd think that about half of all the iPods died, due to no fault of the user of course, and that Apple is a completely evil, unfriendly company.  Now, I'm not saying that these things don't happen.  When you mass produce any product, there are bound to be some that don't work, something we have all experienced.  (My Bissel Carpet Cleaner just died after only 8 months of use.)  However, I think we have also all had experience with people who make mistakes but somehow have an inate inability to accept responsibility for it and can only try and blame others for their mistakes.  I just wanted to say that I have had no problems with the iPod, I think its a great product, and thank god for Apple for inventing this so everyone else can be a follower and try and copy them rather than be innovative.  But in the process of reviewing products for purchase, be sure to carefully evaluate the customer comments to make sure you are getting the true picture.  (This includes even scrutinizing my review, because I'm obviously a big fan of Apple...I'm writing this in my Mac.)

<Title>Why is apple allowed to do this?
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this ipod with the naive idea that for its price and popularity it would be a quality, and at the very least reliable product. It worked as it should for the first week, after which the video playing capacity went dead.  I tolerated this for confidence that this was going to be its only defect, hopeful expectation for a product that I've later come to find has been designed to fail. The headphone jack has suddenly stopped delivering music in favor of distant muffled garble, and the charges last shorter as the battery life already starts to wane.   Anyone who even does light research on this product before purchasing will consistently find that they're systematically faulty, and extremely expensive to support and repair (but why go through the trouble when you can buy the next new model for hundreds more?). It shouldn't be legal for Apple to operate in this manner. It's an insult to the consumer, and a tragic, unnecessary setback on what could easily be a formidable piece of technology.

For no reason whatsoever, the screen has gone black with a silver apple on it.  Can't see what's playing or anything.  I tried all the steps they have to fix it.  Of course they don't.  I went to the website for help, didn't get any, uh other than being told to do the same steps that I already tried.  There is also no email address or phone number to ask for a refund.  This has only cemented my realization that Apple products are horrible and will NEVER purchase one again.  Just more money down the drain.

<Title>Why does Apple do this?
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After spending nearly $250 on an MP3 Player I must ask why Apple feels the need to nickle and dime people to buy an FM player. Creative and Sandisk both include this.  However with an Ipod a $50 add on, clunky headphone is needed to get FM reception.  Obviously Apple knows they could easily and inexpensively add this to their Ipods, but I suppose since Ipods are selling like hotcakes, they feel that they can slap the cost on to the consumer.  I like the product overall but it does irk me that they do this, because in effect, Apple feels it can.

My only complaint is that the video playing length is too short. Though yes, 3hrs is nice, I would prefer to have a bit more (5hrs?).   Kudos to Apple for making a quality product.

<Title>Bravo Apple!
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am completely happy with my ipod video. It is so great! My parents bought it for me for Christmas. I was so happy to get it. I have songs and videos on it already. The picture is amazing! I bought an episode of South Park on iTunes. It looks cool on the ipod. And I bought a movie. That was at 2:30 AM. Since then I haven't been able to download a thing. Probably because today is Christmas and a lot of people got ipods. And iTunes got a lot of people. I bought Pacman too. I like it. I have the 30 gb model. It is black. I thought it would be thick. But it isn't that thick. I am going to buy a case for it tomorrow. Along with some accessories. Since mine has a lot of fingerprints already. So if you are looking into buying an iPod buy an ipod video! Even if you only love music you will still love the video. Even if you don't watch videos a lot. As a conclusion iPods are great! And Apple has got themselves a great product.

<Title>Apple's 5.5 Generation iPod, The Step-Up From CDs
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's no doubt that CD players are still being used today, but MP3 players are still an upgrade from those players. Similar to cassettes...actually similar to an 8-track to a CD player. Everyone knows that the MP3 player market has tons of brands to choose from. Yeah there's Apple, but there's also SanDisk, Creative, iRiver, and so on. But the question is what is more user friendly. I used to own an iRiver H10 and have to say I wasted 300 bucks on that POS. Only in five months the player kept freezing and I'm ending up reinstalling the firmware every three weeks. Finally in July it completely crashed and refuses to add music.  At that point, I stated that I simply REFUSE to buy another iRiver. Not again, to Apple I come. Actually I was a little anti-Apple but it seems that millions of people have iPods and work fine, so why on earth would I have trouble? Well, I have to say, I do like my new 5.5 Gen iPod. There are a couple of annoyances but otherwise it is a very decent player.  What comes with the player is: the iPod, a USB cable/charger, earbuds, and a slip in-case to resist fingerprints and scratches. The USB cable/charger is a bit underrated by these users. Yes you must eventually buy a seperate charger for long trips but the cord was not short at all. Also it's somewhat nice to have both the home charger and USB cable all in one so I don't worry about losing anything. The earbuds are average. The have a clear sound but less than adequate bass. Also if you're using white cords it's painfully obvious that you have an iPod. I'm currently using my new jWIN earbuds that have a dark cord and sound better than the Apple earbuds. The slip-in case won't protect your iPod at all. You should definitely buy a case, which I'd recommend a camera case, they're cheap and get the job done, plus they have slots for your earbuds. However the slip-in case is good if you like your iPod to be free of scratches (like me).  The first step when you wrap your iPod is to download the software. It does take a while if you have dial-up but you, no matter what, will have to use it. iTunes is a fair program and is better than WMP in my outlook. When you have iTunes downloaded you can now import your music and then export them to the iPod. iTunes only goes by ID3 tagging, therefore if you have your music already on your computer you should be mostly set and ready to add. Just drag Music to the iPod and (ta-da sounds goes here), it's on your iPod. It didn't take me long to load my iPod (someone on here said three days, lie I think), I'd use the conversation of 15 minutes per 1,000 songs at 192 kbps. Especially a decent time since I have USB 1.1. It'll probably move faster if you used AAC but slower if you used a hefty rate like 320 kbps. The computer suprisingly ran just as well with no iPod, while when I connected my iRiver H10 it was always a big issue.  When you get your music, videos, and photos on your iPod, it's up to you at this point. The best thing I'd do is get the album artwork for any music you have on your computer already. All you have to do is go to your music, select all, and click get album artwork. You do need an iTunes account but it's very simple to set-up.  The categories on the iPod are set-up very neat, making it simple to find what you want. There's also a well designed search function which is useful if you have a large collection of music.  Otherwise, the iPod has a few extras you might enjoy. Nope, it still has no FM tuner, but I'm thinking who cares if you have such a large collection of music, which made an FM tuner not a big deal to me. It has a clock which is nice but not a biggie. It has the ability to store contacts with pictures which is a good bonus (it would be really cool to see a phone in here or wireless internet on a later generation). It also has a calendar with a built-in alarm, but the alarm isn't very loud so keep your alarm clocks. You can also enter in text files, a good idea if you're a heavy reader. A little stopwatech is also included. And if you want people to lay off your iPod, there's also a screen lock which makes it impossible for people to get in. For other settings, there's a volume limit if your buying this for a kid and don't want to kill their ears before they turn 60. You can adjust brightness and backlight settings to save some of your precious battery life.  The sound quality from the iPod is good, but I found the bassier presets to be too much and distort a bit. My heart-set preset is hip-hop, providing good but not overwhelming bass and clear mids and highs.  The iPod also features games. This was a hit or miss for me. They were fun to play but ran somewhat choppy while listening to music. Not to the point where they're unusable but slightly annoying. If you didn't know you can buy extra games for five bucks each at the iTunes store. A little pricey if you ask me, but I did end up buying Zuma and don't regret it. And of course you can buy music, TV shows, and music videos on the store as well. Movies can be purchased, but the selection is slim so you may want to check out other services for that. Gift cards are avaliable at every store in the world. I've even seen them at Walgreens!  Some annoyances (or bugs) first started on the Click Wheel. I did enjoy it and will more the next couple of weeks but there's no way to change the speed of it. I wish there was because it was way too fast for me at the beginning and was hard to play some of the games and hard to scroll through things. After a week of owning it I've adapted to it but I hope the next firmware update fixes this. It only charges through the USB which can be slightly annoying so you might want to find a USB charger to wall for trips. This may also be not a good thing for older computer users. Mine is only a year and a half old and charged through USB just fine but it might not for computer older than five years. One last annoyance (actually a bug) is that when I disconnect my headphones the song automatially stops. I'm not sure why, it could be friction from the plug, but no other player I've owned has done this before.  For durability, I've only owned it for a day so far so I will definitely do an update but so far it seems to be durable enough for me. I bought a very strudy camera case and use the soft case that comes with the iPod and I'm sure that'll protect it very well. People say it's prone to scratches and fingerprints but I'd say tat both the screen and the iPod are not too prone to scratches or fingerprints, but the back is a complete disaster. I bought the white anyway so if it does get scratched it won't be a huge ordeal.  Although some bugs need to be fixed on the 6th generation, this iPod is definitely a good upgrade from the 4th generation and an excellent upgrade from a CD player. I will update as problems or good things come up, but for now this was definitely worth the purchase and the offical step up from CDs. 4 stars.

<Content>The last reviewer bitched because of the video screen . What if you want to hook up your ipod to a tv, do the "music only" ipods allow for that? If they do then he's right theres no reason for a "video" ipod. I want the cheapest Ipod with at least 20 GB, that alows me to hook up it up to a tv. Are refurbs  anygood?

<Title>Ipod? There's still an IPod?
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>How many of you hate to deal with ITunes? I know I did when I used this device for the little time I owned it. How many of you hate to eject the IPod from ITunes before you disconnect? I did. How many of you are just sick and tired of everyone else having one of these things? Yeah, I'll admit to the hype. I jumped on the bandwagon too. But, I jumped right off when IPod gave me problems. The black screen of death. IPod works for ten minutes then never turns back on. If you want, you can get an mp3 player thats ten times better then the IPod out on the market today. The Gigabeat by Toshiba, the Zune by Microsoft, and other countless companys offer great alternatives to the IPod. I personally have never used the Zune. But, everybody I know says it's great. Way better then IPod. The one mp3 I own that works. lol. Is a Gigabeat. This product is amazing. No ITunes. No disconnecting (unless syncing, but that is every device). Uploads faster then IPod. Way quicker, about 1000 songs in 30-40 min. You can workout with it in ease. If you have used an IPod, you'll never know the difference. Controls are easy to grasp. Even a person without computer skills could master this in a week. I'm a person that likes life to be easy. The Gigabeat does just that.

<Title>Apple iPod Classic 30GB
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the 3rd generation of iPod that I have owned.  At first I was very pleased that the price has come down somewhat since I paid $239 for this and several years ago I paid nearly $400 for just the color/picture iPod.  Apple didn't take long to disappoint me when, less than a month after I purchased this, they discontinued it and was then offering the 80GB version for the same price!  That being said, my observations are as follows:  1)  Nice, sleek design.  Very functional. 2)  Easy to download or transfer videos from DVDs. 3)  Battery life appears much longer than my previous generation iPod. 4)  I've had this for about two months now and so far no problems.  I know this is what people expect, but every single iPod I've owned, I have always experienced problems that required sending the unit back to Apple for repairs.  That being said, buy an extended warranty. 5)  Screen and casing does not scratch as easily as I expected based on other reviews I have read.  As with all electronic items, just be a little careful. 6)  Overall, I'm happy with this iPod, but it's difficult for me to recommend that anyone buys it since the price can drop significantly the next day making you regret your actions!

<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup.   Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly.   I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players.

<Title>Not bad but not superb...
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm lucky my job gives us ipod videos as a job perk after your first month of employment. So I've had this since it was first released.  Pros: After almost 2 years of ownership I still haven't filled up the 30g of memory on it. I only use it for music. Good sound quality Sleek design I've not had the battery problems others have but I have a desk charger at work so I can keep mine fully charged and it does not seem to have the bugs others have had.  Cons: I cannot stand itunes! It is not intutive in the first 2 months I owned this thing I accidentaly wiped all my music off it and my ipod. Also you can only use it to find none itunes music on your intial setup(or if you have to start all over..)It would be nice to be able to do this whenever you want as I STILL use WMA for much of my collection as I dislike itunes proprietary software and want to make sure I have my music in both formats. Because I cannot copy WMA files whenever I like I have to burn my cds, then manualy add them to itunes. Twice the work...  You would think for almost 500 dollars they could give you a dang operating manual! I mean please I'm not an idiot but I swear it took me 5 minutes to figure out to turn the dumb thing ON! And a quick and dirty how to for itunes would have helped me to know what NOT to do so I didn't wipe all my music.  The stoopid thing occasionally goes bugnuts, just this week I was unable to use for two days because I could not get it to my home computer to plug it in there to get it working again...I have a charger at work so the battery was not the problem it just stopped working and this is the 6th or so time I've had this happen.  Agin for almost 500 dollars would it kill them to add fm radio, oh shush all the sattelite folks I have a very nice local station I'd love to listen to on my way into work on the bus. Or how about a voice recorder?  I have had 3 different irivers before I was given this ipod, and I still have the 1 gig I bought before I got this thing cause it has radio and voice recording which I use regularly and that machine costs a fraction of the ipod.(It's not perfect either but at least it had an on/off switch!)  All in all I won't buy an ipod once this one dies unless they do add the features I have on my iriver and dump the proprietary itunes...and never would have bought this in the first place for those same reasons.

<Title>I love my iPod!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why I love my iPod.  I was given an iPod as a present from a friend I had never met, but whom I only knew through email and later by phone. She had uploaded to it a variety of music, from disco and pop to classical. The iPod kind of reminded me of Sony's vintage Walkman. Remember the Sony Walkman back in the 70's? At the time, everybody had to have one. I certainly did, and it was a cool gadget that became a necessity I couldn't live without. But I soon outgrew my Sony Walkman right after high school, and listening to music while on the go became a thing of the past.  Now a few years later, I received by mail an iPod from a person I had never met. The music selection was great, but it wasn't really me to go around my everyday business with an iPod headphones stuck to my ears.  I remember how I used to make fun of Japanese people walking around with cameras attached to their necks as permanent fixtures. I quickly tossed my iPod aside--but not for very long.   I used to download audio books from the internet to later listen to on my laptop. What if I used my iPod instead? I soon learnt how to upload audio books to my iPod using iTunes, and a new world opened up for me. I now could listen to my audio books while cooking, driving, exercising, walking, sun tanning, hiking, biking... I can now easily finish two books a week, when it once took me two weeks to finish a single book. My library has suddenly grown in books that I have read or listened to. My knowledge has expanded, and my time has been put to good use. I actually am encouraged now to go for a walk by the sea, for guess what--it would be a perfect opportunity to listen to Grisham's latest court drama or King's latest horror novel. And my walks have increased in duration, for what fun it is now! And hey, my health is benefiting from all those long walks. And my spirit is uplifted from being outdoors and in touch with nature.   Going to the gym is fun too, for I can now listen to Atkins' and Dr. D'Adamo's diet books. An hour on the treadmill is not as tiring as it used to be, and time seems to flow faster. Am I really spending so much time at the gym? I must be, for hey, my abs is starting to show. Wow!   Cooking is now spent listening to the latest science books. What a joy it is to cook--I never thought it can be so instructive. And yummy my food tastes better.  And at night, just before I go to sleep, with my eyes tired, I might want to listen to a fable, and remember my days as a child, when my mother used to read to me stories at bedtime.   O how beautiful the world has become with so many words to listen to everyday!   What a great gift that iPod was! Though in all likelihood Apple designed it for music, and that's probably its biggest market, the iPod is an excellent tool to listen to audio books. If you love reading books, the iPod will speed up things a lot!!!! Your library will quickly expand with books you thought you never had time to read!  Get yourself an iPod, and all the books you've always wanted to read will suddenly be accessible.

<Content>I wish I never bought this thing !   ---------------------------- NOTE: I expect tons of negative votes on this review, because Apple is flanked by Steve Jobisciples who can't stand to have their precious items criticized with the same scrutiny the rest of the worlds consumer products are subjected to. Jobisciples love all Apple products more than the NRA loves all hollow point ammo! ----------------------------  Despite the fervor about the iPod, keep in mind some important issues and deficiencies:  1. Hard to use with more than one computer 2. Tedious and deficient computer interface to manage the iPod 3. Unreliable song playback 4. Ineffective Apple Technical Support  .... READ ON FOR ELABORATION OF THESE POINTS -----------------------------------------------  1. If you have to reinstall iTunes onto your computer, you'll have to completely format the iPod device and reload it, for my 60GB which has 40GB of music (two thirds full) it takes approximately 6 hours to reload the songs.  2. iTunes is the only interface to manage the songs on your iPod and iTunes can't be used to manage the song file. In other words, if you want to move the song file on your hard drive, you can do so but then you have to find the listing in iTunes and point the song listing to the files new location. Windows Media Player has the capability to refresh its database... ITUNES HAS NO SONG OR SONG DATABASE RELOCATION FUNCTION, so if you ever have to manage the location of song files with iTunes you have to redirect the index entry to every file. If you move a whole directory, plan on spending some time inside iTunes.  3. Some songs on the iPod just stop playing at the same point every time, they play fine on the PC with iTunes or Media Player or any other music player, but they always stop on the iPod at the same spot and skips to the next song, no matter how many times I rip the song again, no matter how many formats. (two songs so far are Moby God moving over the face of the water and New Dawn Fades from his I Like to Score CD.  4. Apple Technical support is about as helpful as hemmorhoids, they're friendly and will sit there and listen to your problem, just to say "I understand" then tell you to reset your iPod back to factory settings (essentially a format and reinstall) and you get to.... reload the songs again.  In short, Apple is behaving as they did in the 80's and early 90's by assuming because they have the market share, their design must be perfect. Similar to how they lost the desktop to Micro$oft, they're going to lose the portable music player market unless they fix some basic issues.  Which is too bad, because it would be nice to Apple hold some aspect of the consumer electronics space instead of losing it to Micro$oft (again).

<Title>Better hope it will go out in the first six months
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally bought this IPOD due to the fact that I am in the military and would like to be able to have the options of watching movies when I'm deployed, or listening to music at the gym.  And it was great at first, but now it constantly freezes up, will not turn on, and if I would like to get it fixed, I am going to have to pay up to $100 dollars plus tax just to ship/diagnose it since it is older than six months but less than a year.  I think that if I'm going to pay a couple hundred dollars for a product, they should at least have full warranty coverage for the first year.  Oh and in case your wondering, after researching it, I have found out that my hard disk is shot and the whole IPOD needs to be replaced.  So unless I decide to pay the shipping and handling fee, I have a $250 paper weight.

<Title>iPod 5.5 vs iPod Classic
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have this iPod 5.5Gen while my friend recently bought the new iPod Classic. I have compared the two side by side and I must say that the new Classic sports only a couple of new features against its predecessor. The price is quite a bargain though. The menu navigation on the old 5.5 is a little bit faster than the Classic. I bet this is because of the slideshow running in the background while navigating through the menu. The menus are admittedly very sluggish on the Classic as compared to the 5.5. Good points though are the "scratch-proof" surface, which I think is rather a compromise in looks for functionality. The coverflow concept is also nice but I just wished the hardware could keep up with refreshing the album art thumbnails while browsing. And don't forget to start downloading those album arts.  Back to the iPod 5.5. Well, this device has entertained me during long drives and has made me sleep for the past several months. It definitely never failed to do its purpose. I learned to love iTunes to make playlists and organize my music. But don't hesitate to use third party software like floola when you need to backup your stuff.  The bottomline is: if you are not one of the early jumpers when a new device is introduced, this device is perfectly cool for you. Honestly, I would've still bought this one now even with the iPod classic around.  Be cautious though, since this is a hard drive device. But I bet you already know that.

<Title>APPLE HAS THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got an Ipod for Christmas 2006 and I instsalled Itunes and it was fine.  You probaly know that when you get an new toy like this you have questoins, right? Ihad a couple and could I find Apple address? NO!  Could I find there email? NO! There was no contact info but at the bottom of the screen it said "contact us". So I clicked on that and what did i find? NOTHING! Overall the product is great it has nice sound quality. Nice screen. Has a lot of memory! It is a great mp3!  But in Itunes you have to have the right athourization to get games or when you switch computers you have to have it too!  I rate the Ipod 99.8 out of 100 and the costumer service a 4.1 out of 100!

<Title>Buyers beware
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife and son went in on a 30G Apple I-Pod for dad's (me) Christmas gift.  I was elated, having wanted one of these forever.  I'm a professional musician and the idea of being able to store my entire CD collection as well as hundreds of  my own studio recordings certainly appealed to me.  Well, my Christmas was ruined by getting a gift that was totally useless without I-Tunes.  My computer's operating system won't run I-tunes 7 which I learned too late is the ONLY way you get anything on or off an Apple I-Pod.  I understand the reason for I-Tunes and I'm sure Steven Jobs is a hero with the music industry.  But it's almost like buying a PC and expecting to run it without Windows.  I have hundreds of mp3 files in my computer that I wanted to be able to take with me.  I was dumb enought to think I could transfer those directly into my I-Pod.  No way.  If you're looking to do same, the I-Pod is not for you unless you have a Mac running OSX and I-Tunes 7 installed.

<Title>Are u Kidding????
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking forward to buying an ipod for myself,until my niece asked me to help her load music on hers. She had a $25 dollar gift card for music and video. The design was light weight and modern 1 star. The functions were excellant video and music at high quality 2nd star. I Think that sums up the pros. Cons- You have to PAY ( even with the gift card) to subscribe to a sight to download music. After paying $280 I was expecting a month or so of a free subscription. YOU STILL HAVE TO BUY THE MUSIC AND VIDEO. Which I puchase from Yahoo and (Walmart 88 cents)* You don't even get a nice discount for your paid subscription. At this point, I knew I would look for a media player with more options then their (monopoly-like loading options). I could not tranfer or convert music to transfer from my PC. I'M BUYING A CREATIVE ZEN OR iRIVER!

<Content>I just purchased this 30GB iPod the other day at Best Buy for a good price. I was immediately impressed how wonderful and compact this iPod was. The video quality is amazing, the sound is amazing, everything about it is wonderful in my opinion. The only bad things about it are the headphones, fingerprints easily, and scracthes easily. For having a wide span of a music collection this just about fitted all of my music. Now i have to go out and buy the accessories for the car, etc. I would highly recommend this to any music lover looking to store a library of music on this compact iPod. 5 Stars!!!!!!!

<Title>Surprised... It's pretty good
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wasn't really that into the iPod craze a few years ago or even today.  I collect music and like reviewing music, spinning tunes and putting together playlists and specials for some of my friends.  Heck, I still hunt religiously for good vinyls (just check the reviews lol).  Long story short, the woman :) knew that I lugged my cd's around with me and wanted to get me an iPod.  But I wasn't wed to the iPod idea or Apple and because I collect, I figured that I didn't really need iTunes, (downloading tunes) and I'd heard the horror stories behind Apple, iTunes and how seemingly obsessed they are with proprietary information.    So I picked up a Creative player instead.  It was very nice... a Zen Sleek.  But it had this nasty habit of crashing... too frequently.  Finally, it just stopped working about 6 months after getting it, so I thanked the heavens for the insurance I got from a popular electronics store, and went ahead and got this 30G iPod and honestly haven't regretted it.  Granted, I thikn the drawback to me was iTunes... I could've done without having to download that program.  But I do like that Apple uses Gracenote, who helps with linking the titles of some of the off-beat stuff in my collection.  Once I figured out how to really use iTunes though, it wasn't that bad of a system... not as good or in-depth as others but I like that you can just go into the iTunes store, get a song from .99, and have it synced to your system, etc.  You can also put in a few tv shows in it (maybe not a few... but many!), like Robot Chicken, etc.    It's not perfect though.  I think if there are any drawbacks, it's that if you use the light, the battey drains quickly.  Also, I think the iTunes store could be organized a bit better.  And the screen scratches extremely easy - if you do get this, you definitely want to get a tough screen protector, and even put that into a cloth pouch.  I have mine completely in a Belkin hard case, and a pouch.  And of course, I guess the iPod doesn't support all MP3 formats, so you have to convert the files.  While you can fool around with that, at the end of the day, realize that you still may need some re-writes to back-up your music if you want to switch away from the iPod in the future.  Last but certainly not least, the sound quality of the headphones in the package are crap.  And that's being generous.  So if you can, you'll want to get a good set of headphones (Sony, Phillips, etc.).  I mean really, I don't know how Apple can use those obnoxious people dancing around with those white headphones stuck in their ears, looking as if they're having seizures when the music sounds like rubbish through them.  So expect to spend at least another $50 on accessories if you get this.  Still, I've been enjoying my MP3 player.  I was pleasantly surprised by Apple and recommend it. Oh... some bits of advice, get the insurance (from wherever you get it) and I'd hardly recommend getting one used.  Also, definitely shop around... I'm still not an "iPod for life" person and if the Zune was around before hand or been more established, I might've checked that one out instead and I think the Creative ones hve improved - the sound at least in the headphones they provided was infinitely better than Apple's.  But as it stands, this one is better than the Creative one I used to have in that it hasn't crashed & I'm enjoying using the store, etc. so I like it.  And I suppose the moral of the story is, the woman was, as usual, correct & it's good to carry so many songs of mine and hear them whenever I want without throwing out my back with them in my record bag/back-pack.

I'm not sure why people say the Zen is so much better, because my brother has one of those and the ipod's screen is MUCH better. The only negative thing is that it still scratches SO EASILY! If you get one, when you are removing it from the box be EXTREMELY careful! Get a case before you hold it and get scratches and fingerprints on it. Also, the ipod never stalls and is never sluggish. I never have to turn it off and then on again! I would definetley recommend this product!

You have to have windows 2000 sp4 or windows XP sp2 or later on your copmuter.  There really is not any difference between the creative zen product and ipod (I have both) except that the ipod is sleeker.  Everyone complaining about having to buy songs from itunes, not an issue if you have cd's.  I have 27gb of music/videos, and I have NEVER bought a thing from itunes.

<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The sound is great, my complaint is that you can't delete songs from the ipod itself. Instead you have to make changes to your playlist on itunes. I figured once it's on my ipod the music is stored so  I deleted songs from my itunes so I didn't have so many songs on my computer. I then added new material in itunes and connected my ipod. But instead I got my older songs deleted and replaced with the new stuff I just uploaded. This makes it impossible to go to friends house and get songs from his itunes. Well you can but it will delete your stuff and replace his songs with yours. I don't even feel like uploading all the cds I had on itunes and keeping all that stuff on my computer. For me I now use my ipod when I go on walks or trips and instead stick to go old fashion cd's in my car which is also a pain too.

<Content>I bought this iPod (Black 5.5Gen 30GB Video) about a month ago. This was the best thing that I could have done. I had an old Dell DJ First Gen. That thing was horrible. The list were all wrong based on the title's of things, and it was very had to get around. But with the iPod, moving around is like a dream and all my music is very well organized and I love there file system. (For example, when going into music and then artists you can see all the artists album and select which album you want to listen or just play all albums. This file system was non-existent on my DJ). Another great feature is the charging and docking just use the same cable which is another plus, the only bad thing with that is if you wanted to travel and are not caring a laptop with you; you would have to buy the wall adapter for the USB cable, which is a bit pricey. Pro: - 30GB for the price - Wonderful screen for watching videos - Love the filing system - iTunes is easy to use and does very well w/ album art - Compatible with almost everything - Dock connection Con: - Accessories are a bit on the pricey side - iTunes software (your pretty much stuck using it, it would be nice to have more options for software)

<Title>STOP WHINING IPOD AND ZUNE FANS!!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, the constant bickering between Ipod fans and Zune fans is starting to get annoying. These reveiws are meant for people that actually own the product, not fanboys who are bored and fell powerful by lowering a products rating. Now that thats out of the way, on to the reveiw.  The Ipod 5.5 generation is a very good product. I bought one for myself afer researching mp3 players for a while. From what I researched, the Ipod seemed to be the device for me. My initial feeling was to buy the Zune, which seems to be a great device as well. My choice was made however by the fact that Ipods have Itunes. This program sets the Ipod apart from all the other mp3 players on the market as of this moment. The Zune's marketplace eventually I think be up to par with Itunes, but for the moment Itunes is dominant. THe interface is so easy to use and has just so much media, there really isn't much of a flaw.  As for the device itself, it works very well. The click wheel mad famous by the Ipod is great for navigating the device and the other buttons work seemlessly as well. The resoultion of the screen is amazing, it's better than my t.v at home! Although it is a bit on the small side, it gets the job done. If you really want to buy a video player though wait for the 6th generation Ipod.(Rumor says it will have a a single ginat screen with all the buttons on it.)I have checked out Zunes as well and they work just as well as the Ipod. I would actually recommend a Zune if you wanted to watch videos dominantly(because if the larger screen.)The Ipod looks stylish although it is prone to fingerprnts and scratches.(Just buy a case those of you who whine about the issue, they are cheap!) I personally like the Zunes look a little better, but looks are not a very crucial buying point for me.  In all this is a great mp3 player. The Zune works easily just as well and looks great. I dominantly listen to music, for I am a musician, and this device met my needs better than I could have imagined. The videos are a great feature and a crisp and great to watch. I bought this player instead of the Zune and Zen G because of Itunes and how easy and great it is to use. Untill the MS marketplace is updated to supporting videos and more media, I would buy a 5.5 generation Ipod.

<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I researched mp3 players for months before I finally decided to purchase the black 30g iPod. I am so glad I did. It is incredibly easy to use and navigate, there are tons of extra accessories available for it, and it has far surpassed my expectations. Not only can I put our vast CD collection on it, I can purchase more music from iTunes, put all of my important pictures on it, plus video, plus several games to play...  I was a bit intimidated when I opened the box but within minutes, I was able to figure out most of the menu and also iTunes. I purchased my iPod from Apple.com because the prices were basically the same but I could get my iPod engraved for free through the website.   One thing that I did notice is that the black one shows fingerprints and scratches very easily. I do not have any scratches on mine (yet) but my friend's has minor ones that come from just being placed on a table and normal wear and tear. I purchased a sport armband to help protect it and keep it from getting smudged or scratched so soon.

<Content>I bought this ipod after having another brand mp3 player for a few years.  The ipod is much easier to use and itunes has really ramped up their store.  There are many movies, tv shows, music videos and songs to buy and they automatically sync to your ipod after they are downloaded.  The only negative I've found is that if you buy a movie or tv show through itunes to sync to your ipod, you cannot save that movie to your own dvd.  So you are paying $15 for a movie you can only watch on your ipod.  Though I did find that you can then use cables to hook the ipod into your dvd player and watch through your tv...  and with 30 gigs, there is plenty of room to keep movies and songs and videos.  I'm very impressed!

<Title>Defective by design
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've now owned two of these.  In the first case, the battery last about 18 months before the unit completely bonked on me.  The battery in this second, later-generation unit, which is supposed to be longer-lived, lasted 7 months before finally giving up the ghost.  When I went to the Apple store for service, I discovered it would take 2 DAYS to get an appointment at their so-called "genius bar".  Rather than service the unit, thereby saving me hours and hours of re-synching my music, they simply replaced it (fyi -- the boxes on wholesale units are marked $129; some markup).  Then they tried to strong-arm me into getting some kind of extended warranty for $59 -- implying that the battery would, once again, bonk out...this time after the warranty had expired.  There is good reason that the State of California is currently serving Apple with a consumer lawsuit.  These products are grossly overpriced and generally defective or undependable.  Somebody could make a fortune coming up with a nice-looking product that did what this does, only dependably.

<Title>i'd buy it again....
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The earbuds have been a problem for me...don't fit well and won't stay in my ears...and the whole scratching issue is not one to be taken lightly...  I've swapped out the apple earbuds for a pair of cheapo sony's that I had lying around and they sound quite a bit better than the originals...planning someday to invest in a pair of noise canceling phones.  I also strongly suggest people ordering this player get a case even before they get the ipod....I have treated mine with extreme care from the moment it came out of the box but have found some minor scratching and fingerprinting that is very hard to remove.  I really think  apple needs to address this issue.  I've never seen anything so hard to keep looking good....and this 30 gig ipod is beautiful to look at...very classy,, minimalist look and you can't help but want to keep it looking good..  Overall, it is, though, an amazing product which does what it supposed to...I'm glad I bought it and would also recommend the Klipsch IGroove docking station to go with it.....,

<Content>This is my first IPOD and I LOVE IT!  I had so many CDs that I hadn't listened to in years.  I put all of them on my IPOD and now I have all of my favorite music in one place. Music is all I have on it so far, but there is plenty of room left.  I was amazed at the quality of sound that comes from the earpieces, and I'm excited about being able to listen to hours and hours (and days!) of music I want to hear without any commercials.

<Title>Music Yes, Movies No
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product so that my 4 yr old daughter could watch videos on a plane.  It seemed more sensible than a DVD player for the same $$, though the screen is small.  She didn't seem to mind the scale (kids love "baby" things anyway) but I DID MIND when the video froze and I had to wait for the battery to die in order to get back to the menu etc.        Also, I did not realize that I would have to buy my own software ($50)in order to "rip" my own DVD's (Avex).  I was able to copy my own music CD's to the ipod with iTunes, but not movies.    Am I a total scrooge not to love my cute little iPod like the rest of humanity, or just a fool for thinking that an iPod would manage videos?

<Content>I recently purchased this iPod from Amazon, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Amazon offers this at a lower price than the Apple store and most online competitors, and unlike some of the online competitors, sells the iPod with everything included in the box.  The iPod is very easy to use and very convenient.  The photos and video features are fun to play with, and listening to podcasts on the go is perhaps my favourite part of having an iPod.

<Title>Its starting to suck
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hello to all. first of all you might want to think twice before you purhase this ipod for a few reasons. the first reason its that when watching videos the battery life drains down completely, i timed my ipod before while watching videos with the light on and it only lasted about a good 25-30 minutes. Im also starting to have this problem of my music getting erased all the time from my ipod. i fixed this problem like 3 times before but now when i update the ipod it stops updating at song #45 and then it gives me a message of unable to update ipod. i even checked to see if those 45 songs got transfered to the the ipod but not a single one of them did. i tried other solutions like downloading the latest version of itunes but still nothing. just stick with a cd player and all your favorite cds to avoid all the headaches and cursing just like i did!!!!

<Title>Now I get it!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We finally took the plunge and got the iPod 30 GB video black for Christmas. We opted for the hard disk rather than the nano because of capacity and the unit would not be subject to rough handling (thrown around, jogged with). The Nano is REALLY small, light and "losable".... We have owned other MP3 players and they all have been lacking in one area or another (ease of use, freezing up, clunky software, weird controls, etc). I have to say that I have been most impressed by this product which at least up to now has lived up to the hype. You have to hand it to Jobs  and friends for once again coming up with an almost perfect product, create and fill a need. But more than the iPod itself we found the whole experience of using the iTunes software, ripping our CD collection and downloading songs to be a pleasure. I will add my admiration for the ergonomics of this little gem.  So why no 5 stars?  Well for starters, like everyone else, I'm frustrated at having to be "nicked" every time I need an accessory to go with it. At the very least, a charging dock that allows feeding the signal to an A/V system would be a nice option. I'd be willing to pay for it as part of the package. Then there's those ubiquitous little (lousy) earplugs...c'mon Steve! This is for listening to MUSIC!! And how 'bout a stylish protective case hmmmm? It does look as if can be easily scratched. We will leave our judgement on the usability of the screen for later. It looks quite adequate for a quick look at pictures (certainly a big step up from cel phone...). Granted I'm of the AARP generation and need glasses to read but I can't imagine watching any video longer than say three minutes.  As long as I'm whining...how about a (DECENT!) FM receiver? And a little recorder? The latter may be hard to implement without messing up the design. Finally as one who saw the arrival of powerful portable "gadgets" with the HP 35 calculator, I am in awe of the progress made in 30+ years allowing us to carry 30GB (80??) of information in such an small, elegant package. I highly recommend this product for those that need the capacity and won't  subject it to rough handling.

<Title>still the best
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, I have three different MP3 players.  This is by far the best.  (My neighbor in the next cubical bought a Zune.  As far as I know he has   the only one east of the Mississippi.  He is anxiously looking for someone else with one so he can try the wireless sharing thing.  And an FM radio?  My cell phone does FM so I don't need it on my iPod.)  Anyway the iPod controls are easier to figure out and navigating the menues is easier than any of the other players I have used including the Zune.  And this is my first Apple product.  I didn't need to read any instructions or require any help to make it work.  The sound quality is superb.  I guess that is why Apple continues to dominate the personal MP3 player market.  (I suggest "London Still" by the Waifs or "Spit On a Stranger" by Nickel Creek as good testing material.)

<Title>Music Lovers Love iPods
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Received the black 30 GB iPod as a gift after owning an iPod Mini for several years. I loved the 4 GB Mini despite the limited capacity and battery life and at the same price I paid for the Mini, the somewhat larger 30 GB iPod is an easy favorite.   The screen is sharp and bright, controls intuitive & easy to operate, and the battery just keeps on going and going and going (as long as you're only listening to music, watch a 2-hour movie and you may have reserve power when it's over, or maybe not).  Pros: Better battery life than the old iPods, nicer screen, not just for music anymore, wealth of available accessories  Cons: larger, heavier than most mp3 players, (but still perfect for a shirt pocket)  Buying an equivalent set of accessories (like I had for the Mini)  BONUS: As of Jan 1 2007, Mac owners can now easily transfer TV and movies recorded on their networked series 2 TIVO to iTunes (and hence your iPod) using TIVoDecode Manager.  As for the gripe about iPod factory earbuds, I love them. They sound fine and are perfect for low-level listening while still being able to hear and converse with the world around you. If one desires audiophile sound quality and isolation from ambient noise, a set of upgrade earphones, headphones, or earbuds is just a few clicks away.

<Title>Music Only!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been wrestling with this thing for three weeks and I'm still having problems with this thing operating correctly.  I will say that the controls are very user friendly and it's easy to find the songs once you get them all on there.  However, the newest version of itunes runs VERY slow.  And I've heard this same complaint from several people.  It takes 10-15 minutes to rip a CD into 128kbps.  If you are planning on putting a majority of your CD collection on this, it may take several weeks.  Also if you think you might like to put one of your home movies on here to show your friends, you can forget it.  It won't work.  There is some software that claims that it will transfer it for you, but so far, i haven't found any that will.  I still have trouble keeping the settings stored in itunes so that when I plug it in to charge it, it won't erase everything on it.  Sometimes it changes settings on it's own.  I would suggest buying a CD player that plays MP3 formatted CD's.  It may be a little more to carry around, but it would be less stressful.

<Title>The Best !! 
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 30gig ipod is GREAT ! I have had it for almost a month now . I wondered at first if it would hold as much music and movies/video's as I would want . I am here to say , it holds a lot . I have completely enjoyed using it . I have downloaded itunes 7.3 , it will even take your old music files and add them to the itunes library  to download onto your player .  I have mine in black and I would recommend finding a good case for it .  When playing Music the battery life is long . When playing video's the battery life is med . When playing movies , you can get thur one movie and then need to recharge or be close to needing too . The picture is so clear and bright . I was completely amazed at how small the screen is but how well I could see everything . This is well worth the money and you can change what you want to keep on and off it . If you are someone who wants to keep over the top huge amounts of music then you might want to go for the 80 gig . I have found that the 30 is more then enough for the average user and again .. so easy to use . Itunes store makes it the best and easiest way to download and play your music .. the earbuds that come with it have a great sound also .

<Content>I wanted to get a new Ipod after my mini ipod was stolen one and decided to go for the 30GB due to the increasing size of my Itunes library.  In all its a very good product.  I particularly like the games function, Texas hold'em which costs $4.99 on the Itunes store is very addictive.  The sound is also very good and plays very nicely hooked up with my stereo.  Plus points:  Games, storage, sound Minus points: scratches easily, even after I had bought a carry case. I would recommend getting a case that covers the whole of the front of the Ipod.

I bought the Ipod mainly for music listening, but the video capabiliies are a nice plus. Everything works smoothly and once I learned about the video converting process there`s no problem with that either.  I wish the battery lasts longer, though  Delivery was fast and hassle free too.

<Title>30GB Ipod Video.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What can I say, It's an Ipod! It's very slim and easy to use. I have loaded 10 CD's, several music videos and other songs and even two movies and haven't used 1-1/2GB of disc space yet. The 30GB has plenty of room to spare and very convenient to carry around. With the white color, all the skins we have look great. I'm not sure they would look as nice going over the black Ipod.

<Title>Best technology yet
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my IPOD.  I can take it for walks, go to bed with it, travel with it, and love its compact design.  It is fairly simple to operate, but I am still working on trying to figure out how to transfer movie DVD's to it.  However, I have been able to place music and audio books on it, in a prompt, well guided process.  The sound is clear and the earbuds fit quite well.  I would have liked ear foam covers for the earbuds, and while I have looked for them, I am unable to find them.  This would be a suggestion for improving the package, that ear foam covers would come with the device.  I would highly recommend this device.

<Title>Problems with "errors"?
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My music downloaded fine, and sounded great; but when trying to load photos always came up with (error .50)or 1418.  I use a PC computer, which is part of problem.  After spending SEVERAL days at Apple support web site, went to their phone #. After several hours talking to an "expert", and changing my computer all around, they decided to have me send ipod back to them.   Received ipod back, and low and behold - SAME PROBLEM.   Called back, and went through lots of same steps, but this "EXPERT" finally found a hard to find spot that DID NOT have the "allow disk" checked.   Checked it, and after a few minor steps- the ipod did allow photos to be loaded.    So far, things working well; but why Apple could not fix this immediately, or before they sell to PC computer oweners is beyond me.   Good luck - hang in there when you see error messages!!!!JD

Make sure you have the memory on your "home base" computer to back up the space on the ipod.  Happy listening and viewing!

<Title>Don't believe the hype
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As we all know, Apple has revolutionized data/music organization. Aside from that, the iPod is just an expensive mp3 player with easy to use controls but definetely not an ideal video player! Who can watch a movie on it's tiny screen without squinting? Not fun... I can tell you that. The generous 30gigs come with some issues as well. The drive mount is not meant to protect the drive from drops, but we all knew that. Apparently it is not suggested that you jog with it either! So, you might just need a flash player, with no moving parts that will stay true to it purpose.

<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod!  I listen to it every night in bed, when exercising, and sometimes I'll bring it to work on slower days.  It is so convenient because I can go from Beethoven to Led Zeppelin to Herman's Hermits to Mario Lanza with a few clicks, as opposed to carting around tons of CDs all the time.  The one flaw is that the battery wears out pretty quickly.  I often charge it for about four hours at a time, and within three hours of playing music, the little green battery at the top of the screen changes to red.  It claims to have much more battery life than that.  But all in all, it is a very good product and worth every penny!

<Title>Great video and audio quality
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not being into portable music, I had not bought an iPod or mp3 player. But then I realized I could use this for playing movies while traveling by plane and not need a portable DVD player. I enjoy watching videos on this so much that I now use it for that at home frequently. The sharpness of the picture is incredible. It would be nice if it had a larger, widescreen viewer (like the iPhone) but it's still very enjoyable. I rarely watch TV, not having cable TV or a tivo (and I hate commercials), so I have enjoyed downloading seasons of TV shows from iTunes and watching them on this. Of course, you have to pay for that but no more than if you bought the season on DVD, with the bonus that you don't have to wait for the season to be released on DVD. You can watch each episode shortly after it airs on TV.  I still don't listen to portable music but I do use this for audiobooks and podcasts, particularly while commuting in the car. I especially like that it automatically bookmarks audiobooks and podcasts, remembering where you left off even if you've played something else in the meanwhile.  Finally, I am very impressed with the design and small size of this device. I have not bought an Apple product before. Apple really knows how to create an elegant, simple design. The other brands of MP3 players in the store appeared bigger, clunkier and less simple to use.   And, of course, buying the market leader gives you lots of choice of accessories. For plane travel, I bought an external battery from Sonnet Technologies that gives it 16+ hours of video, made specifically for this model iPod. And I bought a very nice leather belt-clip case for it from E&B cases that fits it precisely.  I sometimes wonder if I should have gotten the 80 GB model but even with sticking one or two seasons of TV shows on here, I have never come close to filling up the 30 GB. You really can't go wrong if you choose this model.

<Content>I made a deal with my husband that if I could lose most of the weight I gained when I was pregnant, I could get the ipod I've always wanted.  No settling for a shuffle or puny nano.  Well, it took a couple of months - 5 to be exact - but it was sooooo worth the wait!   It is more than I even imagined!  Loading all my music on it can be a bit tedious but it's wonderful not to have to haul around my big CD cases everywhere I go.  The only complaint I have is that I REALLY wanted the U2 version but my husband said it was unnecessary...some people just don't understand the appeal of Bono and the Edge...

<Title>What's Not to Love - Except for Some Flaws - in iPod Video?
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod video is a lovely gadget. Well, that's so amazing that calling it a gadget may even be offensive. It is unbelievable and at the same time grateful to see the evolution from the first generation to the current one, not only in terms of design but also in terms of features.  In my experience, iPod is still the best companion for music, once it provides a powerful sound system and reasonable ear buds coming with it (take care of your hearing!), better than ever. The photo and video functions are interesting, but for occasional use. Watching a full length video on iPod is something I don't really consider very comfortable.  I also agree with some reviews that point out two important drawbacks: easy-scratching/fingerprinting surface and no battery replacement. I even go further - the power adapter should not be an optional item, but one that comes along with the package, without charging us more for that, since this is an item which is essential not only for travelers, but also for the home-stayers that, like me, don't like to turn the computer on just to recharge the iPod.  My hope is that the next generation of iPods will also come with a radio tuner and a WiFi connection which would allow the use of a portable version of the iTunes Store inside the player so we could made our purchases and use the "gadget" with total freedom from a PC or Mac. Who knows?

<Content>this is my first iPod, and i must say that i have been missing out.  it took me a while to decide whether i wanted the 80gb or the 30gb, and i am happy with my decision.  i have videos, music, contacts, calendars, games, you name it, and have only used up about 1/6th of the space.  video quality is good.  music quality is awesome.  i got my g/f the new iPod nano and was jealous at the size for a while, but realized i liked mine much better because i can play video and hold so much more.  i highly recommend this iPod.  and for those of you who don't know anything about an iPod, it can do everything.  my favorite, right now, is podcasts.  they're free, and as soon as a new video or audio clip is released, it is automatically downloaded to your iPod.  and with outlook, you can sync your contacts and calendars.  this is a must-have  Pros: -video -podcasts -contacts -lots of music -search function -accessories are found everywhere -includes an 'on the go' playlist -volume limit control  Cons: -smudges extremely easily, but can be cleaned -i don't think seperate calendars are supported -can't change volume unless in the music playing screen

<Title>Ipod video: overall good.
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, i just got one yesterday and it's really good. ALmost-HD quality video, cool interface, great sound quality, overall awesomeness, games. But I could have given this a 5-star rating if it doesn't mislead you to think you can get more than 3 hours of battery life. Also, there's no options menu where you can delete, rename or edit songs. On Creative mp3 players there is. I have a Zen Micro that has that. It gets fingerprint marks and scrathes so much. IF YOU GET AN IPOD, GET A PROTECTIVE CASE FOR IT AND ONLY HANDLE YOUR IPOD WITH NO CASE UNLESS YOU ARE USING A CLEANING CLOTH! YOU WILL THANK ME :).  Also, dont adjust the brightness too high and turn the click noise off if you want a slightly longer battery life. If you have a lot of movies and videos, get an 80GB because movies take up a whole gigabyte and 30 minute shows usually take up 250megabytes (1/4th a gigabyte.)  Microsoft may have invented electronics, but Apple stole their ideas and made them into better electronics. Apple may have stole Microsofts ideas to make better electronics, but they forgot the little things.

<Title>What you'd expect
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned the 5th Generation iPod, 1st Generation and decided to upgrade.  Battery life is improved over the previous model. That's about all that has changed, besides the fact that it now comes with a different case, different earphones and no instalation CD.  All the other changes are available through an iPod firmware update (such as the ability to play games, adjust brightness, improved search, etc..) and by updating iTunes.  Overall, a great player, although I wouldn't recommend it if you already own the 5th generation iPod (It's practically the same thing!).

<Title>Great Pocket Music Box with Video as a Bonus
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this model of the iPod - it's compact and very user friendly.  The black and chrome model does show smudges and scratches easily, so you may want to invest in a cover or a case in addition to the black velvet sleeve that comes in the box (nice, but you can't hit the controls or see the screen through it).  Other than those minor quips, all you need to do is plug it in to your PC or Apple computer and it automatically registers itself and downloads everything you have in iTunes (with an option to download your photos as well).    The screen in this updated 6 generation is brighter, and the battery life is a little longer.  Playing music without the backlight activated will last over 14 hours.  Watching video or having the backlight on constantly will drain the battery at just over 3 hours.  Not ideal for a Transatlantic flight or one to Europe, but great for domestic air travel and short commuter rides.  You have to think of this as a music player with bonus video feature, rather than as a portable DVD player (even with movies added to iTunes).  If you are in the market for more video seek out the 80 GB model which is has longer battery life and more memory to hold up to 80 features instead of 30 flicks at most.  The unit is slimmer, the click wheel slightly improved, and it's about $50 cheaper out of the gate than the last models.    In the box you get the white basic headphones, a USB cable (no Firewire since the iPods are not Firewire compatible), a black velvet pouch for storage, a quick sketchy instruction booklet, and a docking sleeve for when you get a docking accessory.  There is no iTunes installation CD, so be sure to download the program before you plug in.

<Title>The iPod is great, but watch out the software iTunes 7.0
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Regarding the iPod I agree with the previous comments. Movies and video podcasts are great to spend time in a long flight, however, the battery runs out of juice quite faster than listening to music.  The only problem is with the software. iTunes 7.0 (obligatory for the new 30 and 80 iPods) gave me several problems: couldn't finish downloading a movie (1.6 Gb), the previous music videos that I had bought went "white screen", you can only listen to the music, etc. Check the Apple customer site for other glitches. It seems the software required for the new generation of iPods was not that ready. I am still waiting for answers from customer service. So be aware, you might have problems with the software on your computer. By the way, despite these software bugs, the iPod doesn't have any problems.

<Title>hello kiddies !!
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ipods are the best ever mp3 player. but i mean BUT my ipod is so prone to scatches which means in like 2 years later my ipod is probably going to be covered in a million freakin scatches (unless i have a case or something) and it dosen't have FM radio. i already have 680 that's right a 680 amout of songs and i have lots of photos. so far my ipod hasen't (is that spelled wrong?) froze or crash. here's a list:       pros. :) YAY!!   __________   1. great sound quality   2. big screen (to ME not you teenagers   3. cheap (unlike the 2g ipod nano 8gb that's because flash costs a little more than harddrive memory on the gigabytes)   4. has a search browser like google .        cons :( BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!     __________    1. extremly prone to scatches.    2. NO FM radio!!    3. 7,5oo songs is wayyyyy to much      any way i think this is good to me but i think regular kids should get a so not cool shuffle ( or the nano) it's good for kids but NOT me. the video and movie ipod is recomended for teens (even though i'm just a little kid).

<Title>The Suprise Price and Great Build Make This a Fantastic MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Although there are no large differences between the last iPod with Video Playback (like there was with the Nano), Apple has done some improvements that should be to your liking. Apple suprised everybody by making the price $249, and greatly impacted Microsoft's future MP3 player's price point.  *Technically this is still not the iPod Video, this is still an iPod with video playback; rumors are still buzzing about a Widescreen iPod, but still no official word*   NEW:  -Longer battery life  -Games  -iTunes 7 has movies  -Search feature  -Larger capacity  -Brighter screen   GOOD:  -Great build  -Bright screen  -Battery life on video is double what it was before  -Great interface  -Innovative search  -Games are pretty fun  -Excellent design  -Minimal buttons  -Oodles of potential accessories   BAD:  -Still scratches easily  -Prone to fingerprints  -Sometimes a little sluggish (not as much as before)  -Battery isn't removable  -Still no FM tuner, line-in, or voice record  -Expensive accessories (not many in box)  -Cheap earbuds   BOTTOM LINE: Still at the top of its game months after its original release, and the minor upgrades and tweaks keep this the best MP3 player on the market.

<Title>awesome product/service
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i got this ipod for my birthday , and if you like a lot of music, get it, if not get a smaller version ipod,the music videos are 1.99 on itunes, songs are .99c , and games are 4.99 , movies are more up towards 15/20 bucks, its such a good toy for everyone, i listen to it all the time in high school studyhall/homeroom ,also if your apple earbud headphones crap out (where one side plays the other one doesnt-thats what always happens to me) go to apple support site and they'll next-day DHL you a new set , only catch is you have to send the defective ones back(but the mailer is prepaid so its no charge to send it back), i have the nano , and the video and ive gone through 4 sets of headphones , thats how im impressed with the customer service. my ipod crapped out bc i listen to it 3 hrs a day daily and change songs/volume frequently so one day i got a sad ipod icon and the ipod froze up alot, it was on a sunday night(late) i logged on to apples support site,put it in a dhl dropbox on tuesday afternoon and by friday i had a BRAND NEW replacement ipod(they sent me a prepaid next-day box for dhl to ship it back) the only hassles of that is 1. you have to go to a dhl drop box to ship it , 2. a few days without music lmao, i hope this review shows you how good the ipod is / and what support force is behind it

<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a white 30gb iPod and i love it. I used to have a 2gb black nano but i got a new ipod because i want to play movies on it. It was a good decision. Its so ez to use and i love to watch movies on it at home or in the car...think of the possiblilites. If any of you people ride the bus to school or to sports, its cool to show off your videos. I make my own home videos and they look great on the little screen and you can give one of the earbuds to someone else(thats what i like about the headphones).  ----GOOD---- -good video/audio quality -oh so easy to use -looks amazing in and out of my iskin evo3 case -compact (not as much as my old nano, but still...)  ----BAD---- -movies are better on the larger, widescreen PSP -uhhhhh......its so cool everybody will try to steal it...(if you can count that as a bad  Overall, the iPod is a great buy if you got the money. It will bring many years of fun, um, funness to come. Good day  PS if you want a case (yes you do) i recomend the iSkin evo3.

<Content>Although the iPod is simple to use and the gadget itself rates 5 stars, as a first-time user, I'm totally unimpressed with the iTunes software which you'll need to learn if you want to load that new toy.  The iTunes documentation (including its integrated help) is maddening.  It is absolutely terrible at describing detailed options.  For instance, what is a compilation, what's the advantage of checking it?  How does one save an audiobook? Be prepared to do some web surfing if you want to learn the useful features.  It's as though it's intended to be learned by someone else.

<Title>Best Music Invention Since the Violin
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second iPod purchase. Previously, I was one of those longtime Mac users who didn't understand why Apple was fooling around with music players. But when my car's CD player needed to be replaced a few years ago, I bought an iPod as a cheaper substitute. And within a few days, I came to an amazing realization. I could download songs one at a time (or whole albums) from millions of choices and carry them by the thousands in my pocket. Within a few months, I was able to recover most of a large and long-lost record collection with improved, near-CD quality. It's just extremely easy to find, compare, and download the best recordings from Apple's on-line iTunes Store, vs. the hours of fruitless searching among the racks of local record shops. And everything about the iPod design is really "cool." I especially liked the 30 GB version with its video capabilities and bought the second one in black to distinguish it from my older white one (which seems to have suffered a bit from being dropped. Some of the songs have "hiccups" -- little skips or stalls.) This newer 5.5 Generation model seems to operate faster and more smoothly than the older one, which means my wife will have it on days we go in different directions -- which was part of the deal in buying two.

<Title>Overrated
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This IPOD has a lot of problems and in my opinion is NOT worth the inflated cost. Here are my problems with it.  1. It doesn't support FLAC, OGG or any other high quality transfers.  2. The video function is a pain and difficult to use, unless you want to pay high costs on itunes for movies 3. The battery is not nearly as long-lasting as they suggest, and they are prone to die after a year leaving you with an expensive repair. 4. They scratch very easily.  5. They often freeze and I have found that the IPOD can't seem to handle over 15 GBs without freezing constantly.  6. They often need to be "reformated" which means that you lose all of your music collection from the ipod and must start again.   But, my biggest gripe is how fragile these things are. I bought mine from best buy on warantee and within two months the IPOD headphone socket was messed up and I had to bring it back, they couldn't fix it so they gave me another one. Now a year later, I am having more troubles because the IPOD often refuses to sync. I have lost my entire collection of IPOD library countless times and need to re-enter all of the albums again which is a huge pain. I bought this thing for convenience and I am wishing I would have just kept my portable disc player!  Buy a cheaper portable digital media player you wont regret it!

<Title>Good Player 
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this product, i traded in from a previous player and I cannot say i am dissapointed, however I am not all togther impressed. Never the less it has easy software, looks great, and plays well. The gapless play is something i am very happy about that the Zune did not have  The screen is small compared to my Zune however it is much clearer and shoes pictures well. A major plus of this product is all the little extras like the games, puitures, and video. I personally enjoy the games which you can get from itunes for a small fee. I have not tried the movie capabiities, but itunes has a large library of different movies, videos, and shows to pick from. Overall this a sleek player that is very user friendly.    The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is this product has to many menu's to scroll through to get were you have to go. In addition, this thing scratches so easily, I kept it in the protective cover until i  got a case, but that did not stop the silver back from getting scratches from me just resting it on desks and tables,  if you can look past that like i did you will enjoy this product.

<Content>I have throughtly enjoyed this apple product.  This is the first apple product I have owned.  I enjoy the ipod.   Though it has been really expensive with all those accessories.  I have had mine since May-June 07.  I just started experiencing problems with it.  It does not want to shut off.  Apple will tell you to hold the off button for 30 seconds.  Sometimes it works, most of the time it does not. Plays movies, music and videos rather well.  I do not know that many songs.  I have a total of 959 songs on this.  When catogorizing the songs, it is alright.  Though I have found many duplicated songs on my ipod.  Quite frustrationg, but I general work with it. I am overly happy with my apple ipod.    I would reccomend this product to others, but make sure before you buy that this is what you want.  I have researched buying this product and comparing others for several months before purchasing.  Itunes can get rather expensive after awhile.  But in the end I would rather own all my music than have to pay a monthly  charge just to sync it.  I find that more frustrating than anything.  I found that Apple Customer Service isn't all that bad.  But every experioence is different.   Very happy with my ipod.  The only reason I gave it four stars, is because of it freezing and not wanting to turn off.  Other than a great product.

<Content>Tons of space which seems never ending...  Video quality is excellent, although I think the Itunes Software should:  a> Come as a CD with the product (currently you have to download it) b> Allow for video format conversions (MP4 so it can play on the IPOD) c> Should allow you to sync with more than one PC, and let you choose which is master (IPOD or PC) similar to active sync with your PDA's.  I am using it in conjunction with the Dension Ice Link Plus with Active Cradle in my car - and find it amazing!  CD's are a thing of the past

<Title>Overall NICE, with Pros and Cons
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Beautiful display, bright with vivid color.  Plays movies well, displays photos and holds lots of music.  Great sound, nice slide show, user interface is super and unique to iPod.  Don't waste your money on cheap Chines knock-offs if you want good quality, buy the iPod.  Cons:  Apple should have provided a wall charger...having to leave this connected to a powered-on computer to charge is rediculous.  Apple's wall charger is outrageously priced, a good one is available for a few dollars elsewhere (get one that is micro controlled so you don't over charge the battery).  I don't like that the unit is sealed, so I cannot replace the battery or hard drive myself.  The battery lasts a long time when using as an MP3 player, but doesn't last long when watching a movie.  The instruction manual that comes with the iPod tells almost nothing...go to the Apple website and download the full manual.  Using iTunes to connect to the iPod is NOT, I REPEAT, NOT intuitively obvious.  I had to call Apple tech support to ask them how to get songs, photos and movies onto the iPod.  This was poorly thought out, a great weakness on Apple's part, the iTunes interface should be redesigned.  The folders on the iPod are hidden from the user, download an application from the internet that allows you to see what's on the iPod and allows you to take files off directly, without having to use iTunes.

<Content>My first "MP3" - and wow, why did I wait so long?  REALLY glad I bought this instead of the nano, which was my first choice.  (Now I'm wanting one of those little Shuffles - grief!!!!!!!!)  Actually got a movie to watch on it to see how that went, and hey, not bad at all!!!!  (Fortunately, I picked a movie I had never seen, Step Down, which gets a 5 star rating from me!!!!!)  It has worked flawlessly, no more hassles with CD players - I think I'm in love.   The 30GB is perfect for me.  And the controls are great - except I haven't figured out how to slowly fast forward or slowly back play - if it can't do that, I will be a bit disappointed - but I did buy it to listen to music and in that regard, I couldn't ask for anything more.  Very, very glad I picked this one.  Apple makes awesome products and has for years.  Well worth the money.

However, I am dismayed at Apples' reluctance to allow for price competition. (price controls). At this point in the life product cycle, the price should have come down on it's own.

<Content>I recieved this iPod as a gift a week after it was released. At first I was a bit leary to the fact that it could be buggy. HOWEVER, it has proved to be the best piece of equipment ever.  So how much does it hold you ask?  Well let's just say it holds enough to allow you to listen to 1 song every day for the rest of your life.  If you want to get crazy and buy a 60 gig, then you will most likely still be listening to music 20 years after your death.   Videos play VERY nicely on this iPod. Sure it is small, but on long trips you will want it.   Battery life is the ONLY thing that is faulty. It's supposed to last a little over 10 hours without the backlight on.  I listen to my iPod for about 5 hours with no backlight and my battery is dead.  Whether it is mine or not, the battery wears down a bit too fast.  Though I must salute Apple for creating 500 different chargers, so you never live a moment without your music.  Overall: 9.5/10  My Recommendation: DO NOT buy the 60 gig iPod. 750,000 songs is enough to last you.

<Content>I got this, my first Ipod, at the end of April. I loved it, however, it broke down less than a week later. Worried about the warranty, being in Costa Rica and the product bought in the USA, I called the local apple dealer. She replaced my Ipod within 5 days with a new one! I'm now enjoying it every day in my car. Love the Ipod and, even more, the Apple service!

We are in 2007 and we should be getting WI-FI, Wireless sync feature and touch screen with this thing because of the price we are paying.  Come on APPLE wake up! Oh yeah it is a video IPOD but you have to go through a lot of pain just to sync your own home movie to it.  That's right because it will only accept APPLE format video.  GOOD LUCK!

<Title>Great iPod
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this iPod over my old 2nd Generation Nano.  Don't get me, wrong I still use the old iPod for my alarm clock, but that's about it.  The iPod video is amazing and when I watch tv on it, the screen is so clear and bright that once you start watching it, you forget about the size of the screen you are watching.  The 30GB is enough for me, the 80GB iPod video is too much space for me and I mean come on, are you really gonna listen to 20,000 songs and over 100 hours of video on a 80GB iPod?  The 30GB is more than enough for the average user.

<Title>iPod virgin will never look back!
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, I love it, love it, love it.  I've never had an iPod or MP3 player before, but lugging CDs around was becoming increasingly irritating, so I took the plunge and have been quite happy with ease of use, etc.  A few minor negatives - no mains adaptor included (bought one for $20)so had to spend first month or so recharging from the computer - not practical when travelling a lot.  The wheel does mark quite quickly; and the case I bought to protect it has actually rubbed a graze on the surface! Also has an annoying tendency to reorder tracks alphabetically with accidental change of visual display (compilation albums)- initially baffling to someone who hasn't used iTunes before!  Some basic instructions or tips in a mini-manual would be useful - again, as an iPod virgin, I had to work out a lot by trial and error.  That said, it's very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and I can honestly say it's changed my life!  I can carry my entire music collection anywhere, and with the right accessories, I can play it stereo style, or in the car, recharge it in the car or from the mains, etc.   One of my better investments!  Not convinced by the new iPhone, though - won't be updating for a while...

<Title>Nice but easily scratched
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am completely satisfied with my iPod. It sounds good (especially if you change those horrendous stock headphones), it's easier to use than my dad's MP3 player, and the iTunes interface is second to none. I also like being able to use it as a flash drive. Useful for lugging essays and projects around (I'm currently an undergrad in college).  I only have two qualms with the iPod video. First, watching video on the iPod is completely impractical since it seems to drain the battery within a few hours. Not heart-breaking since I bought it for music and not movies. Secondly, though, the faceplate for the iPod video is VERY easily scratched. It's almost rediculous how easily it can get scratched. It also got damaged from the case I bought. Still working but I'm almost embarrased to take it out of the case now. But it's something I don't mind just as long as it provides me with good quality music.

<Title>Apple Keeps Bringin' It!
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zune a couple of months ago and was very pleased with it.  When I got the iPod for Christmas, the Zune went on the shelf!  The iPod display, though a wee bit smaller, is much brighter and clearer and the overall design is better.  The 'click wheel" is a much easier interface than the Zune's and the iPod's sound quality is far superior.  It's little wonder Apple's stock price is soaring and Microsoft's is flat-lined.

<Title>Worth the money
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was in the market to replace my ipod shuffle, and originally picked up the Zune. The Zune however only loaded about 10% of my music, no matter how I tried, so I returned it the next day and exchanged it for the 30 gig 5G ipod w/ video. Aside from the lousy ear buds, everything else about this player is great. The sound is good, as is its ease of use. Despite the 2.5 inch screen, the picture quality was top notch. Perfect for my commute to work and home again. Best of all it  loaded all of my music (which is all legally purchased, something the Zune didn't seem to care about) which is the main reason I got it in the first place. The cloth holder kept it scratch free until I bought a case to protect it in. All in all I like it quite a bit, even though I am still not fond of itunes. There are other programs to use however.

<Content>This was my first leap into the world of iPods and it fits my needs perfectly.  I love to listen to books on CD and just continue to load them up, listen to them and delete them.  I have dozens of music CDs on it and even more playlists, I have pictures to show off my kids and love to get the podcasts of the news.  I have thousands of songs and now I can get rid of all of those CD's that had just 1-3 songs that I cared for.  I am so pleased that I went with the higher memory from the start.  I have heard that this product is easily scratched so I simply ordered a clear case for it before I even ordered the iPod and the case has kept it scratch free.  Love it!!

<Content>I purchaed this iPod 30GB for my wife for Christmas.  Imagine my displeaure when she opened it and it has never functioned.  We tried all the fixes recommended by the Apple web site.  Then called customer service (you get a person in the country of India).  Be prepared, you will be on hold a long time!  They issued a repair authorization.  iPod sent, returned in three days...the SAME machine.  They said it had been repaired, but it did not work, same issues as before.  Called customer service and after an hour convinced the supervisor representative that it was defective.  He again sent authorization to return the item, and promised a completely new machine.  Got it back again, the same machine, same defect.  Returning the item to Amazon for refund.  Totally unsatisfied with my first Apple product, and the Apple customer service is worthless and a waste of time.  Save your money and try the new Zune.

<Title>techno-challenged
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this in order to not fall too far behind technologically. I really like the way it functions. The only problem is that the instruction/owners manual is not included with the item. Instead it is viewed via one of the apple ipod websites. I am suuuper busy and haven't had time to download the instruction manual therefore I don't know exactly how to download music to the ipod.  I have done it once or twice but am not sure how I did it. I figured out how to download music to my ipod on line library. But not how to transfer the results to my ipod yet. It also did not come with a case, which has to be purchased separately. Same goes for the gizmo that allows you to play the ipod through your car radio.

<Content>I'm really happy about this device. This is the third Ipod I'm buying and I have had no complaints far.  The few things which would have to be improved are the photo viewing and file storage.  There needs to be some kind of zoom function for the photos. And in addition to this the way te files are named and stored is a bit wierd. It becomes extremely difficult for one to locate the track names without going through winamp or iTunes.  On the whole this device is really gud.

<Content>I guess I'm biased, but I've had Macs since 1995. I own 4 right now. All linked to Airport and still working fine. When the Old white shuttle (that I got as a hand-me-down from my son) stopped syncing, I went with the 30 gb iPod. Of course it stored all of my music, in the correct iTunes Playlist configuration, which I've always loved; it also has every photo I've every taken since 1998 (over 10,000), plus hundreds of scanned images in all of their appropriate albums.  The coolest accessory for me is the AV Connector. I can take all of my images to someone's home, plug it in, select an album, and sit back to watch a slide show of photos from 35 years ago or yesterday, with music. Just ever so easily cool. And it fits into my small purse. AMAZING!!

If you want an mp3 and video player that's easy to use and well designed, then the iPod is for you.  Sure there are many choices out there, but none give you the user experience that the iPod, combined with iTunes does.  I considered getting the Zune because of its low price and features.  However, too many people are having problems with them not working as advertised.  So, I chose the iPod 30.

<Title>Not all that.
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't get me wrong from the title. The ipod works well and it's quality is good too. The problem with the ipod is iTunes. And unfortuantely, you need itunes to run the ipod.  Itunes is perhaps the worst piece of software ever developed and they make you install Quicktime. Quicktime is another piece of junk that always wants to conflict with other media players. I own 4 portable music devices. My first was from Dell. Although not as hip or attractive as the ipod at least it was plug and play instantly. The Windows Media player interfaced with it in a flash. Simple...simple...simple!  So I get a 30gb ipod and a nano for Christmas. My son got a nano. I can't tell you how many software issues we have had. I've also had to restore his ipod once already during one of Apple's updates. Great stuff huh?  Using the ipod after the fact is no problem. Plays great and so on.   After I got the ipods and started having software issues I read a review site about "ippod killers" and there are many out there. Personally I'm going to look into the Zune player from Microsoft. MS is so much better at the software and 3rd party people focus on it because it rules the world.   Apple, you need to get on board with the masses or get left behind again. I think it's great that you came up with a stylish piece but make the darn thing user friendly with software.

<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is sweet.  I was torn between an 8gb Nano and this 30gb video because they are basically the same price.  I'm glad I got the 30gb.  I use it mostly at my desk at work so size of the device is not a primary concern.  Neither is the supposed durability of flash over hard drive.  Besides, this unit is still pretty compact. I loaded up 950 songs and have used about 6gb so far.  I don't plan to watch movies or anything but I like the video feature mainly for showing clips to friends.  I bought a clear rubber "skin" to protect it from scratches and I have already dropped the unit once.  No problem whatsoever.  It landed on a carpeted floor but it was commercial carpet which is not the softest.  I was considering a Sansa or a Zen and I'm sure they're decent players but I know I love my ipod.  The navigation is simple and syncing with iTunes is easy.  I do find iTunes somewhat sluggish on my P4 2.8ghz PC.

Before i had this iPod i had the iPod shuffle (1st generation) and it wouldnt store enough songs and i wanted something bigger, so me and my parents decided to split the cost for this one!

<Title>I am done with you Ipod! 
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Attention possible Ipod Buyer! Please be aware that the Ipod you are about to purchase will likely have sever technical issues with it someday.  I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I have had my Ipod for about 2 years and have a love hate relationship with it.  I love my Ipod because I use it everyday; on my way to work, at work and on my way home.  I love music and I love listening to music.  I really like the way the I pod works, but it has problems.  About a year after getting it and enjoying it with all my may many songs on it, it started giving me an error something like Cannot copy to or read from "Your Ipod's Name here" and that was it. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. I was in shock and did not know what to do.  I was foolish and did not buy the 2 year warranty.  I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was NOT I talk to some guy and told me that they CANNOT help me if my Ipod is NOT under a warranty.  Fortunately, I was able to figure out how to reset it and reloaded my music.  All was fine although after being able to reset and put my music back on it, I started getting the errors again.  I finally stopped trying to do updates because of all of the errors. Now, because of the new Itunes, it asked me if I would like to erase all of my music and replace it with the new library.  I unkowingly, did and now have no music on my Ipod.  I am done with you Ipod!  Done I say! I will find a new source to provide me with my music needs and move on! This has happed to everyone I know that owns an Ipod of any type. Seriously, I am not joking here! So If you don't want to get ripped off, I would reccomend something else.

I can listen to all my 60's music, hear my books, etc.  There's even a daily podcast download for yoga !!  Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that separating different items in different folders is rather complicated, at least for me an aging baby boomer.

<Title>iPod, the hero of Cupertino
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod is an excellent device.   It looks cool, is light, and integrates with iTunes, which is nice.   It lacks FM Radio and Wi-Fi, but hey, you can't miss what you never had.   They could have made it a little more smudge-resistant.   Also it does not come with a dock.   The charger has to plugged into the computer.   Once it plugs in, the iPod thinks that it is syncing.   The screen is too small for good video playback.   And the battery life when watching a video isn't good.   But the good stuff outdo the bad so I give it a well deserved 5.   Apple is the head of the MP3 craze!

<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't quite get why this product is so popular compared to other products.  For my purpose, iPod isn't worth the money I paid for.  I wanted primarily to watch videos on trips.  I wish I had done my research...  The videos must be in apple format (like .mov) or convert them, which takes forever to do.  The battery time was no way near as advertised, the sound quality is okay, but not what I expected from such an expensive device.  The thing is too heavy to carry around for jogging.  Also, sometimes it hangs up my system when hooked up to my computer, which I resolved by having to research how to set the iPod in disk mode.  It's my first iPod, and probably will be the last.

<Content>This thing really is great.  Make sure you download Videora Ipod Converter to get your movies/tv shows in the right format to watch on the ipod.  Itunes is simple enough (although annoying and scary if you ever want to pick up a couple songs by syncing up to someone else's itunes..."woops, there goes all of my songs").  Basically, though, it is great.  Video doesn't drop frames and is never choppy.  I wish it supported Ogg for audio, but I guess that is a minor complaint.

<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had been shopping around, checking several review sites for good MP3 players that didn't cost an arm and leg for my 15 yr old son.  I have stayed away from IPOD for yrs just for spite/cost always too high.  Now they have come down to more reasonable pricing, but found BEST price with Amazon by far, even compared and watched Ebay for weeks.  The quality of the music videos he has downloaded are awesome and are better than HDTV!  I was super impressed with the sleek stylish look and ease of use - even for me.  Now if they would only come down with the pricing for accessories for this model and more options, that would be idea.  He absolutely loves it and I like the price for all you get.  I have been converted!

<Content>Because we are parents - buying for a teen - and are not users of iPods ourselves, we aren't particularly knowlegeable inthis area, but we were very surprised to get the iPod and realize it came without any of the accessories.  It seems reasonable to assume that it would come with the earpieces so that you could actually listen to it!

Don't bother paying extra for more space; unless you're a music-and-movie hound or exec, save your money because you'll STILL be VERY happy.  One note:  invest in a charger that doesn't require connection to a computer...just in case.

<Content>Amazon had it at my door in 2 days.  Setup was easy and it worked perfectly...until my wife disconnected it when it said "do not disconnect."  Restoring it online is supposed to get it back to normal, but the process takes a few minutes and loops back to where it starts.  I checked Apple online forums, and many people claim the same problem occurs even whithout the accidental disconnect.  I'm taking it to an apple retailer, but am worried because Amazon mixed up receipts and I wound up with someone's book receipt.

<Title>Simple and Efficent
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If I could, I would give the Ipod a 4.5 star rating, because it's definitely not perfect (i.e. 5 stars). Is it the best digital music player out there, value and feature wise? Probably not. A few years ago, when buying my first MP3 player, I did extensive research and settled on the IRiver H320. Now, this was when the iPod was a black and white, music-only (well pretty much) machine. The Iriver offered video, photos,recording capabilities and even radio at about the same price.  Two years later, the Ipod still hasn't caught up to many other MP3 players in the features departmnet. Apple obviously had the technology to add things like a radio or recording capablity to the Ipod but isn't. Then why choose the Ipod? Quite simple really: Simplicity and Efficency.  Most people who use the iPod don't want to spend hours learning how to use their music player. Unlike some other music players (like the Iriver) the iPod is extremely easy to use. Converting videos and photos is a snap (I reccomend a converter like Videora Ipod for converting videos) and Itunes makes it easy to make playlists and find album art. If you don't mind losing out on features like recording and radio, the iPod is probably the perfect player for you. It's great for people of all ages, and is stylish and compact. If you want something with more advanced features and don't mind losing out on the "trend" factor, I reccomend doing a bit more research and chossing something more like the Creative Zen.  All in all, the success of the iPod proves that great marketing and simplicity of use can win over an audience more than fancy features. The addition of video to the iPod has really increased it's appeal, and if you want something that is simple and fun to use, go with the iPod.

<Content>I've been happy so far with my iPod. After researching for months other product brands in an attempt not to fall into the iPod trend, it seemed that Apple was the only one that had the lemons and bugs worked out of the mp3 player, so I gave them a shot. Battery life is impressive and exceeds my needs. The only minor complaint I have are the earbuds seem rather cheap and tend to fall out easily, but I guess that's to be expected for someone with little ears.

<Content>I bought a shuffle in September which is great for working out.  I bought a Nano in October which my wife "borrowed" so I bought the video IPOD in November.  I have had it for a little while and love it.  I am able to download my favorite podcasts much easier and the fact that I can listen to them whenver I want is great.  The ability to buy single songs that I like on Itunes without having to buy the entire cd is also great.  How often do you buy a cd and only listen to 1, 2 or 3 songs.  Lastly the video capability is great.  I thought the screen was going to be too small but after watching a couple of movies and videos I will always travel with it and leave the dvd player at home!

If your hard drive fails and you can't recover it, then if you install a new hard drive and install Itunes, when you plug your Ipod full of music to your computer, all the music will be erased, as the Itunes have nothing.

<Content>With its full color screen it can pull up album cover art work, videos, and podcasts. It also has a larger screen and longer battery life. The previous generation iPod which I have has less battery life and can't handle video. The click wheel makes this super easy to operate and the battery life is phenomenal. With the iTunes software to rip music it takes only seconds and the compression algorithm Apple uses in its software means you can load up several days worth of music and barely make a dent in this iPods storage capacity. I bought this for my fiancee as a birthday present and it was by far her favorite present.

But even still, with the 400 songs I have on there now plus a few games I'm good for now. BUT, now there is a BUT to this. Even though I love my IPOD, there is a downside. I have the games on here, as well as 2 extra games that I purchased, I can't seem to coordinate the controls. I've tried different ways to get a better handle on how to work it right, but it's just not functioning right. I would love to get that under control and maybe I'll be able to win the games.

Pair this with a good set of speakers, like the Klipsch dock, and you can ditch your space-hogging media and dinosaur sound system. bonus features: storing all my media online for backup, and the ability to plug in other earpieces besides the buds it comes with.   Still can't figure out if it has an off button, tho.. guess i have to read the directions.

<Title>Impressed ...
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been using a Creative Zen MP3 player, but after a year of use it had started to malfunction.  Being that I had outgrown its limited size anyway, I began looking for a new one.  After much research, I decided to go with the market leader in Apple.  Now, after several weeks of operation, I am thoroughly satisfied with the product.  It works exactly as described.  The screen images are bright, crisp, and clear.  Its battery life is adequate.  Being that I already used the iTunes program, that was not a problem.  However, if one is unused to its setup, iTunes may take some time getting used to, yet it is unquestionably the best media library player on the market.  The Sync option makes things very simple with updating the iPod.   The controls on the iPod are enormously intuitive, quickly grasped by everyone.  They just make sense!  One particular little thing that I especially liked was the ability to play particular composers on the iPod, as I listen to much classical music, this was very helpful.  Given the plethora of podcasts available, the iPod allows one to delve fully into this rushing river of information on virtually any topic.  Its thirty gigabyte size is quite capable of holding huge amounts of music and podcasts.  The screen's clarity and brightness allows it to handle the display of pictures and videos with ease, and the screen is large enough for most people to see everything clearly.  Music is clear and pleasant, and easily tailored to special genres through the built-in EQ.  The iPod headphones are hardly the best on the market, but more than satisfactory if one isn't a hardcore audiophile.  All in all, I am thoroughly satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it!

<Content>I love it. I resisted buying it over 2 years, and even contemplated getting some other MP3 player other than IPOD. But, finally gave in and got one for myself. Everything is good, but I wish I-tunes was a bit more allowing in terms of manual management of music on IPOD. On the other hand, may be I need to learn more about that aspect in I-tunes rather than blaming it.

<Title>Apple stinks
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I do not have a 30GB, mine is an older (2 years) 20 GB.  I actually only used my ipod for 7 months and then it stopped working.  When I tried getting support from Apple, they told me my warranty was expired and since we didn't purchase an extended one, they couldn't help me.  They said it was probably a hardware issue and they can become corrupt at any time.  I paid $300.00 for an ipod and cannot believe that after using it for 7 months it just stopped working.  I am so unhappy with Apple I will never buy another product from them again.  They dominate the market, charge a fortune for their products and then refuse to help unless you pay another $60 for an extended warranty.  Plus, I find it hard to believe they cannot explain to me how one day it works and the next day it is corrupted.

<Title>I love my iPod... back up, back up , back up!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To the reviewer who complained about losing his music... itunes has a very simple backup program built in... just burn your library onto a dvd and there's no problem if your hard-drive crashes. And yes, electronic gear can have problems... I bought the two-year extended applecare direct from the online apple store... cheaper than Amazon. You get unlimited support calls and they fix it if it stops working. However, I couldn't beat the price of the iPod at Amazon... and no tax or shipping charge! PLUS, this is one cool music / video machine! I am really enjoying the fantastic picture... downloaded some tv shows and had a blast watching them in a waiting room. Also, with an adapter you can play your movies, tv shows, and photo slide shows on your large screen tv. Oh, and don't forget about podcasts... I'm getting programs and music I used to miss on NPR downloaded weekly for FREE!  Buy it, you'll love it!

<Title>iPod 30 GB video
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What I liked -  The looks! Can't think of anything else!  What I didnt like -  1. Its just an MP3 player. It doesnt have FM or a voice recorder. My creative MP3 player (Zen) does! 2. The video doesn't seem to play nomal formats like avi or mpg. You need to purchase a software converter to be able to play these formats! 3. Too expensive for a product with such low features 4. The iPod once hung when I connected it to my computer for charging. In my "creative zen", all I need to do is remove the battery and put it back in.. and I am good to go! But with the iPod, the battery is in accessible. So I had to wait for it to lose all its charge, so that it switches off on its own and then restart it!

<Title>Katrina Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I heard that the Ipod 30 GB could play movies and videos, I decided to purchase it for my daughter.  Upon receipt, we tried to downloads movies and videos onto the Ipod.  Nothing worked.  I took the Ipod to a local well known store in my area to only discover that they informed me that I pretty much have to know a super computer geek to by-pass the system to download movies or videos or pay the high cost that I-Tunes offer for the already converted movies and videos to download.  If I had known this before I purchased this particular Ipod, I might not have purchased it.  Each movie cost about $12.00 each and up.  As long as my daughter wants to download movies and videos, Apples keep taking from my pocket.  $280.00 was enough for the item, but now the cost only increases.

<Title>Poor Reliability for iPod Video
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is our second iPod Video to fail soon after purchase.  Fortunately we bought this one from Amazon, and it is on the way back.  The first was bought from an Apple store; they insisted we make an appointment to come in to get it looked at, then they denied the warranty because of minor marks on the case (which is famous for getting marked up). Then they offered us a trade-in for a refurbished unit - for $250 difference, more than the cost of a new one at Amazon.  If you buy one, don't buy directly from Apple - make sure you get a return policy.

<Title>Nice but still needs improving
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son got this for Xmas, and has been very pleased with it, so far. But there were still some issues to be aware of. First, the battery play is short and dreadfull. Also having to leave your computer on just to charge this isn't sensible either. Be prepared to shell out 30 bucks plus tax for an AC charger. I'm assuming that the battery life will be an issue as well, it's always been an issue with ipods. Second, this thing is a scratch magnet. You better get a protective case for it. If you ever have any issues with it and need to send it in (don't bother taking it to the Apple Store), they will use this unavoidable wear as a ploy to nullify any warranty, and claim the malfunction to be from physical misuse or damage. A quality case will cost you about 25 bucks or more, plus tax. I enjoy the click wheel, especially when scrolling, but it can be touchy and cumbersome at times. Overall, this is the best multi-media player on the market, although I had the opportunity to see the Zune in person, and it has potential. Hopefully it does well, because competition in the market place is always a plus for the consumer.

<Title>Apple Lover!
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband and I both had iPods prior to receiving the 30 gb video iPod for Christmas. I have a mini and my husband has a 2nd generation 20 gb iPod. We also each have a shuffle. We haven't had any issues with any of our iPod products. We now have 5 iPod products in the house. I have downloaded over 800 songs, 4 music videos, 3 movies, and some Christmas photos into our latest edition without any difficulty. The first thing I did, like with our older iPods, was to buy a protective case. That's just part of owning  an iPod. We also have an Apple laptop and our main computer is a Mac and we have never had trouble with Apple service, in fact it has always been a pleasure dealing with them. I also know that it's just a fact that the battery life of the video iPod will not last as long since playing movies and videos take a lot more "juice." My video iPod lasts a long time without recharging when I am just using it to play music. I, personally, love Apple products and in my experience with family and friends it is usually operator error when something goes wrong. The Apple website has lots of online help for those who need it.

<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this I-Pod through Amazon, new...it did not work. I went to the Apple Store who replaced it. What does Apple replace it with? Most likely a re-furbished model. While it works and I like it, if I wanted to purchase a re-furbished model I could have done so and saved at least $35-50.

<Title>A few pros and cons, but overall very happy with it
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far I'm very pleased with my iPod. For me the plusses were:  1. Plays videos (I have many small clips I use for research).  2. Supports MS Word files (although the print is small, it's still readable).  3. Several TV shows are offered on the iTunes website that I like, such as those from the Nature Channel, History Channel, and Discovery Channel, and I can purchase the episodes that I missed and watch them at my leisure. Usually full-length TV shows are $1.99 each, which I think is reasonable.  4. The music capabilities are of course top notch--although that's the least of my needs--but it's nice to have when you want it.  5. Songs are usually 99 cents each, which is fine, too.  6. Although I didn't own an earlier iPod, people say this one is brighter, and I would call the screen brightness quite good. If you set the screen at half brightness it will save battery power and is still bright enough to see clearly.  For me there are only a few shortcomings, such as the mirror-black finish being too prone to fingerprints. The plastic screen is susceptible to scratching, but not being glass it's less likely to break. The battery life is still a bit limited (although I've read it's better than before).   The synching process has few quirks that you need to learn to use the device well (such as manually ejecting the iPod if one enables disk usage). If you click the box to enable disk usage, the iPod screen will keep saying "don't disconnect," which makes you think it isn't through synching yet, but the computer screen interface will tell you when its through, and then you can eject. But the first time it's sort of confusing.  Movies are somewhat expensive at $9.99 each, and the family oriented movies (such as Toy Story and so on) are $14.99 each, which I think is too much. I rarely watch movies more than once, so it's not cost effective for me to purchase movies unless it's something I really like and want to watch it during a plane flight or something. Audio books also seem to be almost as expensive as the original book.  But overall it's a great device and well worth the money. Finally, the PDA features, although not as sophisticated as those of a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC, are good enough for it to double as a PDA.

<Title>This thing blows chunks
<Date>Sat Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After owning one of these things for an inglorious three weeks, I cannot *believe* how popular the iPod is.  Why would you buy an iPod? To listen to music. That's the primary thing it's for. Given that millions have bought one and are perfectly content with them, I figured it must work properly. And in my mind, for a music player to work properly, it must have GOOD SOUND QUALITY! So imagine my surprise when I import some tunes onto the thing, and the bass sounds like a mix of mud and gravel, and the guitars and vocals are crackling and distorted. Nothing even close to the full, clean, dynamic sound I was accustomed to hearing from a CD.  I don't have expensive stereo equipment, and I'm not a sound technician or anything like that. But the sound on the iPod was so inferior to a CD that listening to music on it was far more frustrating for me than it was enjoyable.  I took mine back to the store. I'll happily return to carrying my Discman and 24-CD holder around with me, since they make me smile and bob my head to the music rather than grimace and shake my head in disappointment.

The company does not stand behind it's products and woe betide the unsuspecting consumer who pays a lot, only to find his/her iPod broken just days after the warranty expires.  Hard luck on you!  Look elsewhere for a personal jukebox that is much easier to put your music in and which will last longer, and give far more value for your dollar.

<Content>The iPod was good and easy to use but there was something that got me a little angry...   Problem: If you touch the back of iPod or hold it normally like you'd hold a phone the back would get your finger prints and it'd be really annoying and the front to but you wouldnt need to touch the front often except for the button in the middle  Soulution: I bought rubber iPod thing over it and then i could hold it normally, so i suggest for people who hate getting scratches and finger prints on it, get rubber case or normal case or iPod Sticker Design or something to be able to use it normally and no finger prints or scratches!

Still have not played with putting my own videos on it yet thought. for the size of the screen, i am impressed, great picture and the sound is good-but get better headphones, the bass repsponse is poor on the ear buds supplied. I do not mind the ipod not having an fm tuner because that is the reason i bought an ipod in the first place.....the radio sucks usually!!!! secondly i do not mind that it does not have a voice recorder because that is a dumb and useless feature anyways...my memory works fine. why would i need a device to help remind me of something?????

<Title>Ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great MP3 player but with numerous drawbacks:- 1.  Inconsistent battery quality.  Have charged it 5 times, once battery lasted 8 hours, then 4 hours and now 3 times 2 hours, sometimes even less....using sound only not video.   2. Can only charge ipod via USB on computer so when computer goes into sleep mode Ipod is not charging so will probably affect its charge.  This problem could easily be overcome if Apple would provide  a DC charger straight from the mains...however they do not because they want you to buy one...upwards of $30. 3.  Frequently stalls or freezes for no reason. 4.  Earphones are a nightmare...always falling out especially when running or cycling...I now use ducttape!!!

Of course the color and design are great, and it really is a pleasure to use. Videos are beautiful.Great sound. I'd say invest in a good cover so you can keep it looking good and a better set of headphones,then enjoy all the cool things you can do with this one...It's great to have so much music, photos and videos handy.

<Title>The best music system I've ever seen!
<Date>Sat Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to think of Ipods as expensive MP3 systems for the "IN" crowd! I wasn't going to shell out that kind of money just to be in!   Then I discovered Ipods were supported by Bose with a Sounddock and the Wave music system.  I plan on putting a SoundDock in the bedroom, family room and kitchen - a $900 investment.  In those rooms, which I use the most, I can plug my Ipod in and have background music with Bose quality; in addition to being able to have it at the gym or the car or wherever I am.  Then I started doing research on Ipods.  There were several negative reviews on the ipod nano, but this one has gotten great reveiws and the few negative ones I've seen I can live with.  In addition its only what $40-50 more than the nano and you get 7500 songs instead of 1000!  Great deal!  The Itunes software is the best I've EVER used!  Its very easy to operate yet it gives you several different ways to manage and view your music. I never again have to be bothered with Windows Media Player or Real Player! I prefer the album view, it gives you genre, album and artist up top and below displays the current album you are playing.  The party shuffle is great also!  It automatically selects music from your library and plays it for you.  Its like a continuous shuffle every time you use it!  What a great product! I don't need anything else, I just hope it's supported for the next 20-30 years! If its digital the Ipod can handle it!

I think most of us realize that such sales are not only dangerous and insulting to our communities, but also illegal.  Please join me in boycotting Amazon until they clean up their act and abide by Federal laws concerning the interstate sale of dog fighting videos.

<Title>The iPod is good, but iTunes is Brilliant
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned three different mp3 players in the past year or so. The iPod is not much different from the others. Yes the navigation is different and its so simplistic, much like everything else "Apple," but that is it, simple as that. I, personally, just love iTunes. It's by far the best working music-management software out there right now.  Pros: -Works almost flawlessly with anything you throw at it. -All the things you can get for it make it very personal to fit your needs. -Interface is and always has been so great and easy to use. -Syncs with iTunes like a charm. (getting old I know) -The new screen is bright and crisp, I personally have it turned almost all the way down to preserve battery. Cons: -It gets really annoying if your computer gets a B-SoD (Blue Screen of Death) or locks up with iTunes running, you might lose your library and you will have to make your playlists and choose your songs all over again. -Contrary to what Apple says, after fomatting you really only get 27gbs, and that is lame. -There is no way to edit playlists, so if you want to make changes you have to do so on the host computer through iTunes and then sync them up.  -iTunes has a very hard time with any video you do not buy from their store, it will take some getting used to before you get it to work right. -Once the battery is dead, you are screwed, theres no replacing it and since its Lithium-Ion, You are looking at about 300 full charges until the battery starts to fail.  Overall a 4 out of 5. It's well worth the money but remember the Apple company is only human and even the overworshiped iPod has some things to work out. But who am I to complain, I have one too.

<Title>It just plays music.
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never thought I'd buy an iPod (or any mp3-type player) but I have to do some really monotonous tasks over the next few months so I figured, if I don't need to concentrate, might as well listen to music.  Its obvious that a lot of thought went into the layout of the iPod.  What I thought was most ingenious is the way the control always defaults to the volume setting.  Someone at Apple realized the "normalize" or volume equalize feature of iTunes doesn't really work (nobody else's does, either) so if you're going to be adjusting the volume frequently, might as well make it easy.   Sound is pretty good.  No better than my $55. Discman but instead of having to listen to a single CD from beginning to end (horrors!) I now have 3 weeks of music with no repeats.  I thought the earbuds sounded pretty good but the left one kept falling out of my ear (I'm can hear diehard Apple fans saying my ear must be disfigured since everything Apple produces is flawless).  Got a pair of headphones and I'm in business.  iTunes can be a hassle but its worth it to be spared the pain of .mp3 tags, folders, sub-folders, file naming conventions, etc.  So long as you do everything the way Steve wants you to, you'll be rewarded.  I don't plan to use it for video but I downloaded a free podcast.  Frankly, it reminded me of those ads you used to see for the entire bible on a microdot but if that's the way you want to go to the movies, more power to you.  I do wish it would behave like a normal hard drive and let me transfer any type of file (easily).  To be fair, I should have realized that, like any hard drive, the iPod has to be formatted differently for Mac or PC (yes, I have both and yes, the G4 causes a little less grief than the Dell.  Neither is insanely great.)   So far, I'm very pleased. Its less than half the price of an iPhone, yet my music will never be interrupted by a phone call.  Now, that IS cool.

<Title>Apple Delivers, for less
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a 3G ipod for several years, but it was stolen out of my car.  if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have felt a justifiable need for the current (5.5 G) iPod.  After the horrible ordeal of getting my car fixed (cracked windshield, smashed passenger side window, scratched up cabin, broken power outlet), getting a replacement iPod for myself turned out to be a silver lining.  it's an awesome piece of hardware for anyone who needs   - High quality portable audio on your person or in your car.  - Games and videos to pass the time when you're travelling or waiting.  - Organize your music collection while you listen.  PROS:   - At just over $200, the price was right.  That's pennies a day for the amount of use I get out of it.  - Super bright screen: amazingly bright compared to all previous iPods.  Even with  my "crystal clear screen protector" installed, the screen is still easy to see in all but the brightest direct sunlight - and it works fine under all indoor lighting circumstances.  - Video plays back flawlessly on the 5.5 - earlier versions seemed to have some jitter.  - Gapless playback really works!  - Battery life indicator works fairly well - it didn't work properly in the 3G.  - Click Wheel doesn't suck : the integrated controls on the clickwheel take a while to adjust to if you used a 3G or earlier iPod, but they work flawlessly once you're familiar with them.  CONS:   - Buttons don't light up when the backlight is on; that was the best feature of the 3G. Now you have to use the reflected light from the screen to see the buttons in a fully dark envrionment.  This means you won't have an easy time using the UI at a glance (driving at night, for example when you can't look away from the road).   - Battery life is still poor, although improved from earlier models by about 30% in real world performance.  Maybe the battery is 2x as good, but the brighter screen and full motion video both use much more juice.  I recommend using the 30GB model because of the smaller form factor and longer battery life (fewer platters on the drive = less juice for every rotation).  This means you'll need to dock the iPod at home, use a charger in the car, and bring an ugly but useful Belkin backup battery pack on plane flights longer than 4 hours.   - LCD is still vulnerable to scratches.  You MUST get a screen protector of some kind.  I did my homework and tried a variety of things before going with the "Crystal Clear Screen Protector" for $10.  it was a pain to install - you really need to be in a totally dust free environment or have compressed air and ionizers all around you to get the lint before it sticks to the underside of the screen protector.  It has virtually no stretchability and very close tolerances, so if you're off by a milimeter or a few degrees, you'll see your mistake - also it won't ever look perfect around the click wheel.  On the plus side, proper installation does look very cool, is totally clear, and cleans up nicely, all the while keeping your ipod front surface and screen in virgin condition.

My only complaint is about the ear phones.If you have small ears,as I do, they are not comfortable, and you lose sound because they don't fit snuggly in the ear.

<Content>first off the new iPod (5.5 Gen) has these new features -The screen is 60% brighter -Has a search feature -I think theres one more i just cant remember  I'm going to do a Pros and Cons table  Pros- -it can play music (duh) -It can play videos -It can display pictures - Games are awesome -Many accessories out for it unlike other mp3 players (i.e. Zen, Zune, etc...) -Nice screen res -30 gigs is probably enough unless you have ALOT of stuff. i have 122 songs, 4 full length movies, 11 full episodes of shows, 14 30 (or close to 30) second clips of things, and 2 games that i bought. That only used 3 GB. -Click wheel rocks -It organizes things great  Cons-(only a few) -You don't get all 30 GB you get 27.8 because of software and stuff -No radio -Only .mp4 videos work on it. Meaning if you have a DVD you want on it you're going to have to download software to put it on your iPod. I can help with this -iTunes is REALLY REALLY laggy while opening  Overall this is a great product and you should definitely get it if you're looking for an mp3 player

<Title>Great concept - flawed execution
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The actual iPod is really a nice piece of gear, with a well thought out simple user interface. However, as a new user I felt great frustration at some start-up issues:  - Setting up the initial connectivity to my home PC: My PC would not recognise iPod as a device. After many wasted hours trying one solution after another I just gave up and used my work laptop. Not ideal as you are tied to one PC forever. From looking into the apple newsgroups (and trying many of their suggestions) it seems that this is a very common problem. Since all my other USB devices work fine I assume this is an iPod issue rather than one with my PC - iTunes software not included in package: You can not use iPod without having iTunes on your PC, but you are forced to download a very large file from the internet to get this (no CD provided). To me, this is a big cheek - since many people will only want an iPod to listen to their own CDs there is no automatic requirement for a broadband internet connection, so why put this restriction on it? What would someone do without any internet connection or a very slow one?  - iTunes limitations: Why is it necessary that in order to listen to my CD collection on my iPod that I am forced to keep copies of all the music files on my PC? I don't want it there, but if I delete it after synching to my iPod, it will be deleted from the iPod when I next synch.  - iTunes national limitation: You are only allowed to register with the iTunes in the country you live in. I live in Germany but can not buy things from the US or UK iTunes store.   These were my main initial frustrations. After having given up on using my home PC and resigned myself to iTunes limitations, I find I really enjoy using the actual iPod itself.

<Content>I'm probably one of the last people on earth to buy an ipod... I finally did and really enjoy it.   I've uploaded all my CDs, and have made audio files out of some of my cassettes as well.   Maybe there's a way to do this that i'm not aware of, but it would be nice to be able to turn on/off shuffle for an individual playlist from within the playlist menu from the ipod (as opposed to doing it from itunes, or having to go through the entire system menu to turn on/off Shuffle for everything).   My one peeve is that an AC adapter is not included, but is considered an "option" to purchase, and that Album artwork for some classic, popular albums are not available.

<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well i have been looking at all the different mp3 players on the market for the past 2 yrs. So when i first started looking into getting one i wanted something i could afford, was practical, but was well designed. At first i was anti ipod and at the time Creative mp3s came second to them. I was probably going to get like a 256mb or 1gb creative player just to listen to when i go walking/ running. Then I recieved graduation money so i just splurged on the zen micro which wasn't to my liking( too bulky and cheaply made.  Fast forward to 11/2006 My parents surprised me with a 30 gb video ipod in black for my b-day. As i mentioned before I had always been a bit wary towards the ipods I thought they couldn't possibly be well organized with so little controls.And for some reason i disliked itunes. But these things are so simple besides the wheel on the front there is just a controls lock, socket for headphones, and on the bottom the usb thing to charge it.  Pros: sleek, well made (chrome back, scratch resistant plastic on the front), bright and colorful display, easy to manage songs and video, itunes is awesome, sound is amazing, stores so much media- this thing is a great investment Cons:not the best companion for excercise(buy a arm band or a sturdy rubber skin to protect from nasty falls), the wheel takes about a week to get used to, the middle select button should be raised higher than the wheel: you might acidently hit fast fwd instead of select because you cant feel the diference- too flat, battery can go fast, especialy when watching videos, chrome backing gets cloudy from fingerprints (wipes off easily though. This thing is a beauty. Make sure to back up your music on itunes and have a nice grip on the thing. Mine only took one mighty fall on tile, the the face plate was a tiny bit loose bit it seemed to sorta click back into place-works the same though. Ipod is the way to go.

<Content>This is by far the best mp3 player. Every mp3 player sucks compared to an ipod. I am an owner of many mp3 players and this is hands down the best one. Itunes is easy to use, it can convert pretty much any type of music format. And to top it off, its the loudest music player i ever owned. Every other mp3 player i owned had WEAK sound. The docks are pretty good too. I can charge my ipod while listening to amazing quality sound, great during sleep. Much better than the Zune because I don't have to pay 15 dollars a month to download music. I rather purchase music when I want it because everyone knows that good music doesn't come out every month and that most people dont download music every month, especially when they have enough music.

<Title>STILL the Best MP3 & Video Player (just don't use iTunes)
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After owning an iPod Mini (2nd Gen) for several years, I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present, and she absolutely loves it. She uses it with the iGroove dock while cooking and exercising, and it lets her watch child-inappropriate TV shows (we have 4 young children) whenever it's convenient.  iTunes is a horrible piece of software, and you would be better served by using Winamp (free) to interface with the iPod, and Videora (free) to convert videos to iPod format. If you don't believe me, please try Winamp + Videora; you have nothing to lose except 15 minutes.  Once you get past iTunes, the iPod is outstanding. The aesthetic appeal of this device exceeds all of the hype and renders the clichfactor insignificant. Its sound and video quality are very good, and 30GB is more than enough space for most people and most occasions.  My 4GB iPod Mini suddenly looks clunky and outdated, and doesn't have nearly enough space.

<Content>I have so much storage I don't even know what to do with it all right now, but it will be useful in the future, I think. So I think the product may stand the test of time.    Even though it's user friendly, there are lots of options I'm not sure how to use. A manual with pictures or even a VIDEO DEMO---seeing as that is one of the features---would have been perfect.  In addition, it seems that you need to purchase accessories like FM transmitters to use it to play in your car or home stereo---it does not come with these items.    They also don't tell you that it needs to be CHARGED! So you need a charger either via your car or remember to plug it in to your computer before it's too late.

<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 30 GB has all the capacity I'll ever need.  I put on all my favorite songs from about 500 CD's, 1300 songs and only used 1/5 of the space.  Hooking in I-Tunes and loading the CD's on my computer were both very easy.  Sync with the I Pod takes just a few minutes.

<Title>Made A Convert Out of Me
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had always maintained that the MP format could never do justice to the music that I wanted to hear.  I admit the snobbery prevented me from even listening to see if such was the case.  My son wound up getting this same Ipod for his graduation from college and I began to listen a bit to his.  I liked the flexibility that it gave him with regard to CD's ( I have a large library).  The music was indistinguishable in quality over the earphones from that of my stereo playing the cd directly.  Long story short - I purchased one for myself and am happily sorting and building playlists and am quite content.    The Apple software that you download needs to be improved.  It is a bit limited in database functions and could use some flexibility.  Using the Aux jack on my car stereo I am able to use the Ipod easily in the car.  Next step will be to hook it up to the house stereo.   Shortcoming - only irritating thing thus far is that you have to purchase separate accessories to recharge the battery if you do not have the computer handy for the USB port.  Good product - good price.

<Title>Love it-  of course!
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For a long time I thought iPods were stupid wastes of money, just expensive toys that would soon be obsolete and worthless but that millions of people would buy just to be "in." I finally decided to get one for work, and thought maybe it would be a good way to relax with my music, but I didn't really expect a whole lot from it.   I was delighted to find that it is a wonderful tool, can go for a long time without charging, has an alarm and four standard games, has an extremely clear picture and sound clarity that is unbelievable, and is lightweight and can be stashed in almost every bag, briefcase, pocket, etc. that I have. It was a great investment, and since my dad bought one at the same time as me, we saved about fifty dollars by buying two at once through Amazon rather than Wal-Mart or Apple.    I love my iPod!!! ^_^ =D

<Content>I've used several different mp3s over the years, and I finally broke down to buy the iPod.  After a couple weeks and an exhausting trip to Asia where I needed tons of tunes and podcasts, I'm thoroughly satisfied.  The iPod features easy to navigate menus and a nice display.  You can even load your entire photo album using minimal space  Although the video playback is a nice concept, i found the small display to be a bit of a strain on the eyes.

<Content>Pros  - iTunes is simply the best place to download media from for your portable media player. - Has an excellent variety of accessories to choose from - Looks nice - Software is easy to use - Interface is easy to use  Cons  - Supports fewer file formats than others - More of a mp3 player with video capabilities than a Video player - Fragile - Comes with the bare minimum of accessories - Lacks features it's competitors have, while usually outpricing them, such as: - No FM Tuner - No Voice recorder - No built in speaker - Can't be used as a hard drive  Basically, I give it 4 stars for iTunes and it's accessories.  If you don't intend on buying online or buying accessories, I suggest the Zen Vision: M.  If you want a PMP (portable media player), I suggest looking at the Cowon A2, Archos's line of PMPs, or the Zen Vision: W.  They have 4 inch wide screens which is much nicer to view movies on and most can be used as a DVR and also have a lot of nice extra features.

<Title>great item, but too limiting and unreliable
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I really like my ipod for listening to my music collection and am happy with the sound quality I have had it for a month and run into two major problems already.  My first ipod froze and was unable to recover after two weeks and thankfully the store replaced it for me.  I bought a service plan with it (I recieved it as a gift) for some peace of mind with the new one. The second and VERY ANNOYING problem is how limiting the apple format is.  They aren't compatible with library audio book files -- meaning that if I want to listen to audio books (one of the exciting aspects of getting an mp3 player for me) I have to buy them instead of being able to "borrow" audio books from my library. I actually now have to buy ANOTHER small mp3 player to do this. I think it's about time that apple and microsoft reach some kind of resolution so that purchasers of the ipod don't get shut out -- should owning a 300 dollar ipod prevent you from doing something that a 59 dollar 512 mb player will allow? It's very dissapointing to me.

<Title>Nice...4.5
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a slick little thing. Even though I already had a good MP3 player, I jumped at the chance to get this. I had to see what all the fuss was about. I have to say, that I'm very happy with my black 30 GB IPod video.  	 To start this player has about 10 GB more capacity than my other player (a Creative Zen Sleek Photo) and it has the ability to play video files. On the strength of those two features alone I purchased this. The $249 price is very reasonable for such a nice little gadget and the IPod has integrated well into my network of devices and computers.   The simplistic user interface is one of its key strengths. It organizes files well and ITunes is probably the best software anybody will find for an MP3 player. The IPod's best feature (my favorite) is the album art display for each song. This is a cool little touch that almost makes up for the fact that artwork is not as enjoyed on downloaded albums. The photo viewer is quite nice with little to no image degrading. It plays videos seamlessly. I had no problem loading two episodes of Star Trek: Voyager and enjoying them at work. And the extra addition of games is really nice. Pac-Man looks and plays great on the IPod.  two flaws...  The bass response is not great. The EQ on IPods still hasn't evolved to the point where low end bass distortion is eliminated. Sound Check (IPod's volume leveler) does not do a great job, as I still find myself with my hands on that scroll wheel every other song. You may want to volume level all your songs before putting them onto an IPod, but this is time consuming. As far as the EQ is concerned, I have found the electronic setting to be pretty decent.  The headphones may be a fashion statement but they are not great quality headphones. First of all (and most importantly) they are prone to slippage, so one has to deal with hours of monotony trying to get them to fit right. Buying a set of padded ear buds helps a great deal but they are something that should be included with the IPod. Secondly, the jack itself (which connects to the player) suggests that the headphones will not last a long time, so it's best to invest in a better set.  Even with those things, I'm satisfied that I have the best MP3 player on the market and I hope that it proves to be just as reliable as my Creative player has been.

<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Please note that this critique is not of this particular iPod, it's for all iPod videos.  The problem is that they force you to use only particular video formats.  Therefore, if you have a digital camera that makes videos in AVI formats or any WMV files, good luck.  Unless you really have nothing else to do all day, you will get frustrated by the sheer amount of time it takes to put non-iTunes video content on your iPod.

<Content>I Bought this thing because of all the hype. I felt like it was time to upgrade after enjoying my Creative Zen Micro for almost 2 years. Well guess what... I'm going back to Creative Labs. The first thing I noticed is it doesn't sound as good as the Zen.The battery life is horrible compared to the Zen. I don't like the click wheel and I hate the I-tunes software! Creative's software is straitforward compared to the Apple's. Every time I sync the Ipod I don't know what to expect.The last time I did it, it erased all of my songs, but it kept the podcasts!  I've had it with this thing, I'm going to get the Creative Vision:M 30 GB which can do more and better for the same price.

<Content>I have been using the 30gb iPod Video for several weeks now. Everything is awesome but the battery. that is why I gave 4 stars. By the time, you need to convert your video's format to be able to watch them. And it takes forever. While you are watching a movie, the battery is playing 2.5 hours at most. And while you are listening to music, it is 10 hours at most.  Even though I am pleased with other things, the battery makes me disappointed.

<Content>I received this as a Christmas present. At first, I thought this would be nice to have. As I started to set this up, I realized why I never wanted one. First you have to download iTunes. Then you have to import all the songs you want into the library, then sync the iPod. And the "Do Not Disconnect" never goes away. Then trying to delete songs off the iPod takes a miracle from God. The control dial is so sensitive, the earplugs are cheap and don't stay in your ears. I hate this thing!!! Give me CDs any day.

<Title>One Month to Failure
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The one I bought lasted a barely a month. By the third week the battery would only hold charge for about an hour. By the fourth week, it wouldn't hold a charge at all.   You can't simply replace an ipod battery like you can, say, a cell phone. You have to send it in for service and then they send back another used ipod; not the one you had, so it won't have the songs and data on it that you had on yours. That's seems just silly for mere battery replacement. Imagining doing that with your cell phone when the battery wore out!   As an alternative to mailing in your ipod, you can take it to an apple store if there is one near you. More than a few ipods come in for service apparently since you have to make an appointment just to drop it off at an Apple store for battery replacement. Then the store mails it off for service so the wait to get the ipod back is about as long as when you just mail it yourself. But instead of mailing it back to you, they promise to telephone you as soon as the the unit is ready.   You can't move songs from the ipod to a computer or disk, only from a computer to the ipod. You have to buy aftermarket software to move songs from the ipod. That also seems like a silly design nuisance.   The DAC (digital-analog converter) chip is pretty good but the earphones that come with the ipod are quite bad. You definitely need to upgrade to something better if you like high quality sound. Luckily there are lots of aftermarket earphones and headphones available.   If you want to play your ipod on your home stereo, apple and other folks want to sell you special "docks" with a special connector, etc. and you can easily end up spending $60 to $130. Actually, all you need is an cable that has a dock connector on one end and audio rca-plugs on the other and you can get those from cables-to-go for about $4-$18 last time I looked.   The front plastic and rear-cover plating is very soft are very high gloss and relatively soft. This includes the screen. iPods show fingerprints easily and scratch very easily. You can buy films or cases to cover the iPod to reduce prints and scratches.   Overall, the unit is pretty easy to work but understand the battery quality and battery replacement issues. Some other MP# and AAC players share some of these problems and other don't. Definitely shop around and compare price, features, accessories, and service before buying.   UPDATE regarding replacement of 1 month old battery. The Apple store said they would call as soon as the iPod was ready for pick up. I found out you can look up repair status on line and when I did I found out the repair was completed 4 days ago. I called the store and they confirmed the iPod was indeed repaired and ready for pick up. They couldn't explain what they hadn't called me for four days.   At the store when we took it in for service, they said they'd give back the same iPod. They didn't.  They said they'd return it with all the music on the returned iPod. They didn't.  They said they'd call when it was ready for pick up. They didn't.   The repair charge was $214 (or about $20 less than the iPod cost new). That's what we would have had to pay if we were one day out of warranty. Lucky for us we were only one month into warranty -- if you call that luck.

<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for christmas, i was disapointed. I dont really like the styling, i found myself holding it like a pane of glass because i didnt want to dirty it up. Itunes kept switching my sinc preferences making it really frustrating when i had to troubleshoot. I had multiple problems, both pretty major. first off im using windows xp, i know all you apple people are pissed at me for complaining about them not working well together but apple is advertising how well they work together and i bought in. until the ipod got stuck in a restore loop, i had to go to the apple store where they fixed the problem and said if it happened again there was no other option but to bring it in, sorry if i like to fix my own problems instead of driving 20 minutes. the second problem was that after sincing  the music didnt show up on the ipod, when it was plugged in the amount of space that should have been music was under "other" i had to go to the apple store again where after one guy tried to figure out what was wrong the next guy said "hey we dont work with windows here, so i dont know what to tell you" pissed me off for weeks. the experience made me worry about itunes in general which i have used for years, almost switched but found out that the new zune sowtware can convert AAC if its not DRMed by apple. I cant claim which is better because i havent gotten my zune in the mail, but as long as i dont have to return it as soon as i take it out of the box i will be sold.

<Content>Got this as a gift for Christmas from Amazon. After receiving the iPod (my second after my old iPod died), I plugged it in charged it for 6 hours. I used it for maybe 30 minutes, then turned it off for the night. Woke up in the morning to find that not only was the battery totally drained, but it had reset the clock and calendar to the year 2000. I recharged it now for 8 hours turned it off, and left it over night. Came back to in the morning and it had once again totally discharged. I am now returning it as I think it's defective. I have to wait now for Amazon to receive the broken iPod, then ship me out a new one. Ugh...This is the last time I buy something from an online retailer. The return process is too much of a pain.

<Title>Better than its predecessors, but still has a way to go
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this item for Christmas and it was my third Ipod.  Like many have stated, electronics aren't perfect and I must admit--despite being a self-proclaimed "Mac Fanatic"--it has had issues (I highly recommend buyers purchase the accompanying Ipod extended coverage protective plan for 2-3 years for an additional $60).  Personally, since I also own a Nano that is flash drive-based, this hard drive Ipod features gears inside one can hear churning occasionally, which can sound disheartening because you don't know if that's good or bad (trust me, I'm positive everyone else knows about this sound when you press Play as well).  The Ipod has become synonymous for being the epitome of mp3 player perfection; and it's definitely sexy.  I can definitely agree with most that the battery life of this enhanced 5.5" generation model is definitely better than the previous one, and the screen brightness is much brighter.  Still, a 2.5" screen is too small for extended movie use, especially when many movies these days (available on iTunes) are widescreen only, which cuts the screen viewing experience down much more.  Overall, a definite improvement from its predcessor--but I'm sure the future holds much better improvements for Apple's Ipod.

<Content>I purchased my Vision M at the end of July. Six months later, it's broken and at the factory repair shop (waiting for ten days and counting) and I'm still waiting to see what comes back. (A scratched refurb?) The Vision M was my second MP3 player. I bought it because it's highly recommended, and I find Apple's dominance in the market to be objectionable. Vision M was satisfactory until it broke: I like podcasts and I have been using `Juice' (a podcatcher) to retrieve podcasts automatically without too much trouble.  I found having 30 GB on my machine was worth it so I didn't have to spend a lot of time selecting albums and predicting what I would want to listen to in the future.  I installed in-line equipment in both our cars so my wife and I could listen to our players through the car audio.  My wife liked my Vision M so much that we decided to get another player.  That's when I checked out the latest iPod generation 5.5 and decided to give it a try.  I found the new iPod to be much slicker, and I overcame my fears and submitted to Apple's dominance.  Turns out iTunes isn't so bad!  There are exclusive podcasts at iTunes and even though it's a "Walled Garden", if I had (or may have to yet) to do it over again, I'll go with the iPod--it's thinner, lighter, slicker, and iTunes ain't so bad after all.

<Content>We are using this ipod on a daily basis which is more than I thought I would.  I wish you could perform song deletions or selective play on the ipod itelf but that will problaby show up on future generations.  Good product I think most who buy will be more than satisfied.

<Title>Needs Next Gen Revisions, But Currently Still the Best Player
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, apparently my walkman is now obsolete.  No one sent me the memo.  After a lot of research, talking to dealers and friends purchased this MP3 player.  Alot of in depth reviews on this out there, I'll give you the highlights of mine.  Pros-very versatile, robust with a ton of memory, well built and actually more attractive than the other players on the market.  I-Tunes does not require membership (yet) and allows you to transfer digital media (MP3, CD and video) and will recognize most discs you put in. Otherwise you'll hafta manually type album, name, artist etc.  The unit itself comes with a large (for an MP3 player) screen and built-in games.  I-Tunes must be aquired from the official site or transfered from another computer. I-Tunes allows you to drag and drop songs from your list to the iPod without havig to retain them on your computer, saving computer space.  If you need to restore the player due to errors however, you'll have to reload those selections to your computer.  Cons- Has a mediocre Equalizer and output is far less robust than a portable CD or Cassette player.  Most use the factory ear buds and are quite content.  I prefer wide range ear cannons though. Needs a glass face, not plastic with poor scratch resistance.  Hard disks on these units can seize and are indeed fragile.  Refurbished units are available with "debugged" hard disks online.  Battery life is very exagerrated, under normal use you'll get half of the advertised time between charges.  The box data is under really, really ideal situations.  When the battery wears out, you'll be stuck getting a whole new iPod due to lack of factory support or really high replacement fees, if not under warranty.   Comes with cloth pouch, ear buds and USB 2.0 compatible cord.  Mass market has many low cost peripherals, much more than are available for it's competitors.  So, ho-hum, if you're forced to portable digital this is the one. My iPod is full of vinyl record, Stereo-8 and Open Reel transfers, thanks to my Sony CDR.  After 4 months with it, it's still the best one.  Recommended.

<Title>new IPOD with video
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my son, watching the prices daily for a month to find a slight sales price and finally there it was at Amazon.  The package arrived timely and my son loves the gift.  THere is sometimes things to be said about names you recognize as high quality and so far, this IPOD has been a good buy.

<Title>Still the head of the pack
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPod has always been innovating to create a whole new...blahblahblah. Okay, it plays music well. Great audio quality-simple straightforward (but aging and sluggish) interface. Great screen (although its small). iTunes is great-easy to use, simple. Also, the games that are offered for download in iTunes are quite impressive. It plays music better than the Zune. Software is better than the Zune. The rest - the Zune does better (design: i prefer the iPod's minimalism, but that's subjective). Still a scratch and fingerprint magnet, still no radio, still no voice recorder, etc.  Bottom line: if you want the BEST music player - go with the ipod if you want a mediocre music player with extra bells and whistles - go with the zune if you want a video player - get a portable media center or something  **UPDATE** Over one year later: still working as new. Very reliable. Very impressed. Not planning on upgrading to the newer line anytime soon

<Title>Apple 30 GB refurbished ipod
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod is descent. It had hardly any scratches, it looked fairly nice. It works well, except I'm still having trouble loading videos on it. Either I'm not doing it right or the sound just doesn't work. Overall it was worth buying.

<Title>Ipod's great

<Content>This was a great deal for an Ipod.  I highly recommend Apple's Ipod for anyone choosing an mp3 player as we now have three in our home - 2 Nano's and this 30 GB version.

<Title>not the best but OK
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPod from Apple is not the best portable media player in the world. it does not support many features like playing all kinds of video files. it does not have built in radio. The only plus is that it looks nice and cool and it has a wide range of support products like cases, speakers etc. from other manufactures. And if Itunes is not open to all countries than this feature is completely useless for people livieng outside the USA. I use it instead of a cd changer in my Dodge Caliber

<Title>Superb design, simple interface, but there are other options!
<Date>Thu May 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ubiquitous ipod needs no introduction, pretty much everyone is familiar with it. And while the ipod offers a sleek design, simplistic interface, ease of integration with itunes and loads of accessories, the ipod is neither the best nor your only option as it lacks many features of its competitors including fm radio, recording capabilities, customization, and it ties you in to the itunes ecosystem. So while the ipod is a good device for what it is, I suggest you be open minded and do your research to find the player that fits your needs and provides the features you need, instead of just going with the "gotta have an ipod to look cool" mentality. And if you're looking for a simplistic mp3 player with video capabilities that has a wide variety of accessories and ease of integration with itunes then by all means the ipod is perfect for you. And if you value aestetics over features, buy the ipod. But if you're looking for a more feature rich player with more capabilities I suggest you look at some better options (the Creative Zen Vision: M, iRiver Clix, and Cowon D2 come easily to mind). And I also recommend that if you are looking for a player to work out with than don't get a hard drive based player like the video ipod as you'll just end up shortening its lifespan, instead look for flash based players like the ipod nano or other brands, which again offer more features for the money, like iriver or samsung.
