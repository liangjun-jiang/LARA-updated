<Title>Wonderful for travel
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent gadget for travel.  It is very easy to use.  You can quickly transfer all of your photos to the ESP and then reuse your memory card.  It is fun to sit around with friends and look at the day's travel pictures.  I carry pictures of my family and pets with me and look at them when I am traveling and (if appropriate) even share a few with people I meet when traveling.  It is amazing what happens when I look at my pictures on an airplane - the Wolverine ESP becomes the center of attention and everyone wants to see it and then buy one after they see what it is capable of.  For me, it is as much a camera accessory as is my camera battery charger.

<Content>I took this device on a trip to France and used it to back up 3 cameras - 1 with an SD card, 1 with an SDHC card and 1 with a memory stick card. All told, I backed up about 10GB of images without a problem with plenty of battery power left. The ESP worked flawlessly.

<Title>Perfect for the purpose
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm an amateur photographer shooting only monstrous RAW formats (13 MP, from a Canon 5D). I bought the Wolverine to transfer the pictures from the CF card to a portable hard drive while in vacations. The transfer speed is adequate (faster than any laptop I used previously) and it does open the Canon RAW formats, just like advertised. I'm very happy with this. The mp3 side is average, but I don care too much (I have smaller players which I carry). I did test some movies - clips downloaded from Internet and works fine, except the ones protected. The charger is good for 100-220 V, so I had no problem using it in Australia. The CF interface is not the sturdiest, attention should be paid when the card is inserted or removed. Recently tried the Wolverine with an SD card from Canon G7, it works just fine. The radio has no antenna - only through the audio output. If nothing plugged in, there is no signal. The built in speaker sound just like a cell phone speaker.

<Title>Best gadget I've ever had
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing.  I recently went on vacation and never had to worry about filling up the memory on my camera and then having to plug into my computer.  I just shot them and immediately loaded them into my Wolverine.  And I'm putting all my Netflix movies on here to watch when I go on vacation in a few weeks.  I love it.  Love it.  Love. It.

<Title>The Epson Alternative
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked up this storage device for a recent trip, and it was great to have.  This unit makes it easy to download from flash media cards. If you're a traveling digital photographer you gotta have an external storage device as a back up for photos, and this one is great unit to have.  The price is right especially in relation to the pricier Epson devices.  It also does double duty as a media player, for those MP3s/videos that you want to access on the long flights.   Just two minor points: 1 - There's a small joy stick that sticks out - it's easy to accidentally press this button if the unit is in a shirt pocket. 2 - I wish the carrying case was a bit bigger, so it could stash the usb cable and small ear plugs.  Other than that this is a great unit to carry around.....

<Title>Wolverine ESP on location
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The concept of the product is good.  Functionally, it works as advertised.  I recently purchased the 80GB version and used it on location where electricity was scarce.  I uploaded as many as 10,000 photos daily while camping.  I was able to review my photos with ease.  However, upon my return to my studio, the hard drive within the unit failed completely, unable to recognize the primary partition.  My 63,000 plus photos which I could not re shoot were gone.  Thank goodness for third party data recovery companies.  Wolverine tech support was sympathetic and helpful, saying that I should have taken two units with me on location.  They  quickly replaced my new unit with a refurbished one.  Many hundreds of dollars later, I was able to recover my data, but my confidence in this product was shaken.  How can a new unit, less than a week old, always hand carried, fail so completely?

<Title>Just what I was looking for...
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Wolverine ESP mainly for use as a backup for my laptop for storing pictures while on an upcoming European vacation and cruise.  I was intrigued by the large viewing screen, the 80 Gigs of memory, and the built in card readers (one for each of our two cameras).  The trip is still 3 wks off, but I have tested it with a trip to Disneyland, and family gatherings.  It is EXACTLY what I wanted...and more.  I still haven't gotten used to the little 'joy stick' control, and at times I will push it in instead toggling L or R, but that is a minimal concern.  And it seems like the battery wants to run down pretty quick, so I guess I better buy a back-up before the trip.  It doesn't have alpha-numeric key pad capability, so when you 'back-up' your cards they are saved exactly as named by your camera.  It is then hard to tell what is what if you have a lot saved folders.  But then you simply download the pics to your PC, create folders with easy to understand names, and upload the picture folders back into the ESP.  That way you can quickly get to pics of events, or kids (or in my case...grand-kids) for sharing.  I have taken it to work several times (using it as a portable hard drive) as it easily fits in your jacket pocket or it has a belt loop on the case (OK, that is a little tacky...but it works) and then have shared pictures at the same time.  Very cool little toy.  I can just imagine the first night on the cruise when we meet new people at our dinner table, and they ask if we have pictures of the grand-kids...boy do we! LOL  The built-in game, FM radio and MP3 capabilities are 'fluff' as far as I am concerned, and figure it would just be another battery drain (but wait, I'm getting a back-up, so maybe I will start using those features...especially on the long plane ride!)

<Title>Does not support MPEG-2 files
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If all you want to do is backup photos this is a great product.  If you hope to also use it as a portable media player be warned - it does not support .mpeg2 files which is the most common mpg format for video.    It will not play videos taken on some digital cameras.  The resolution is far poorer than that on digital cameras so you are best off reviewing photos on your camera.  In short, if you want a spare hard drive to store your photos on, buy it.  Other than it's pretty much useless.

<Title>Love this item.
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a serious amateur photagraher.  I was looking for a way to store my digital photos from my two digital camaeras without buying numerous cards or bringing a laptop PC.  Each camera is a different brand and uses a different card.  After charging up the device, I was able to quickly download the pictures from each camera.  The device is intuitive to use and I did not need to read the directions and was able to use it in a few minutes.  It allows me to preview the pictures on screen also.  I even downloaded some music and a movie.  For my uses (photo storage) this is an exellent item that beats bringing along a portable PC. There is plenty of storage space and this item performed flawlessly.  I would defintely buy this item again.

<Content>I have had the Wolverine ESP80 for about a month now. It is well made, very reliable and based on other similar units the best value I could find. It is compact enough to fit in my camera bag. I would recommend this unit.
