<Title>Large size good price
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Outstanding hard drive space for the price, the ear buds that are included are of excellent quality, and I'm completely addicted to it.  The best feature is putting my entire music library on shuffle and listening to things I've ignored for years.  I'm still not always crazy about iTunes but I'm getting used to it.  It's completely changed the way I listen to music.

<Title>beyond expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was virulantly anti ipod. They were for noobs, kids, non tech savvy. I had an iRiver H320, which could be hacked, rockboxed (alt operating system), had line in recording and FM, and a big geek factor.  It played videos before ipods (albeit choppy quality and totally a gimmick). It is drag and drop from windows explorer, no itunes interface needed - well that is a superior feature ipod just doesn't have. I loved that thing. I still have it, but it is only 20 gigs. iRiver doesn't make them any more or support them. it is heavier and fatter than an ipod.  Enter my 80gb ipod video. Form factor - A+. slim, light, portable. Usage factor A. simple, slick interface. click wheel a bit too sensitive, but you get used to it. Video - A++ - biggest surprise for me. Thought it was a gimmick, but video quality is amazing and you can easily output to a TV. Even on 50" HDTV screen, videos are great - VHS quality. With some qeek abilities, you can find excellent free software online (DVDshrink, Videora) to enable you to rip any DVD (or captured youtube video with Videodownloader) to mp4 and have it on your ipod. 6 hours video is plenty.   accessories - A+++. Sets these apart from other brands. Bought a Belkin Tune Talk Stereo, and it is now a digital recorder, capable of 3 hrs of recording live music or ripping old lp's or cassettes to digital. speakers, chargers, cases: huge assortment online for any taste, budget or functional requirement.  80 gigs - what can I say? HUGE storage ability. nothing else comes close.   itunes software took me a while to get into, but it is easy and just fine. I still prefer "UMS" ability to just drag and drop from windows explorer onto player as though it were a hard drive, without any extra step in between. But itunes has some advantages for music management.  all in all, totally satisfied. (But I still use my iRiver now, almost exclusively as a digital recorder) Rockbox is coming for the 80gb ipod, however....!

<Title>Excellent for school
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm at college frequently and sometimes I have several hours between classes. This is perfect for those times when nobody is around to talk to and you need some long term, or short term entertainment. The screen is a little small, but its not painful to watch. With an 80gb capacity, I managed to cram 600 hours of video onto this little guy, which will give you about 300 movies, or 800+ tv show episodes. You can cram probably double the amount of music on here if you don't care about top audio quality (as if you can get it through the regular ear buds anyways). The games are excellent, especially tetris, which has kept me addicted for many hours. You can listen to and skip through music while you play your games as well. It is the absolute best investment if you frequently travel or have a lot of downtime on the go, especially if you don't have the space for larger electronics like a laptop. I do not recommend using the itunes store for anything but games, however, as all of their products come with DRM that will only allow you to play it on the ipod and your PC,  which means when you want to buy a new player, you are out of luck.

<Content>I have to say, I promised that I would never buy an iPod, but after the addition of an 80GB model (and the capability to play Pac-Man!), I was finally wooed. The effortless podcasting integration is also a winner. I had a Creative Zen Vision M, but this model is over twice the size and is thinner. I wish it had more filetype compatibility, but it is so easy to use. This is a winner.

<Content>Having this expensive toy is certainly something of a "what one wants, not needs" thing, but what I personally appreciate about it is the portability of it, combined with its ease of use. I can stash my recorded TV shows, all music, pictures, and every single piece of music owned in one spot, and view these here if needed. Play it thru my car's plug in or on speakers, or even jst headphones. It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of the wheel dial and how to use it. One big plus is how it updates so easily when I plug it into my laptop - and charges too!

<Title>Excellant Apple product

<Content>I've had a different mp3 player but sold it to go with a video iPod. I don't regret making the switch. I've loaded it with books on tape, tv shows, and music and it works well.  I'm not fond of the click wheel but I'm getting used to it. By biggest quibble is iTunes. Since it's a free program I try to cut it some slack but I dislike it's organization scheme - much prefer Music Match. And while this review is supposed to focus on the product how can one ignore the program that makes it work?

<Content>80 GB Ipod arrived in non working condition. Seller would not replace,reffered me to Apple support. Item was repaired and returned in 3 days but continues to have problems. I had to buy extended warranty from apple ($60) because I know this unit is a dud. On it's 3rd trip back to Apple repair for same problem (Static/distortion through headphone jack & Docking interface). Item arrived quickly and what appeared to be good condition from seller but with all the problems I've had I wish I would have bought locally so Item could be returned/replaced instead of repaired. Was not worth the $50 I saved by buying online. Seller has little to no control over this, unfortunate experience with my first Apple product for me.

<Content>I received this iPod as a Christmas gift - I would never have gotten it for myself.  I mean, who needs 80 GB of MP3 storage and the ability to play TV shows and movies in a miniature screen?  Aparently, I do.  I love this thing.  I have loaded tons of music on my iPod, a season of SouthPark, some old Star Trek episodes, and I have 60 GB space remaining.  Plus, the screen quality is remarkable!  This is a very cool device - and I am not an Apple fan.  One thing - I am told they scratch easily, so I was quick to get a case for it.  I suggest the iSee case by Contour Designs.

<Title>Ipod...not bad, not bad at all
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, let me start off by saying that I too was once one of the many people who were determined to be completely anti-ipod. When I bought my first mp3 player (a 40 gb creative zen) I strayed as far from the ipod as possible, not wanting to conform and be like everyone else who had them. I had my zen for a little over a year and it really was a terrific player; easy hardware and software, no silly click wheel, organized my music perfectly. I guess I should mention that I'm also one of those people who has yet to increase my music collection digitally. I'm still old-fashioned in the sense that I prefer to buy CDs instead of downloading music from the Internet or from a music service. Anyway, like I said, the zen was great but it didn't hold pictures, store videos, or even have a color screen. Not to mention, it was quite large and bulky. That's when I decided it was time to seek a new mp3 player. The zen was so easy to use and I didn't want to part with it, but it was definitely time for an upgrade. When looking for a new mp3 player (what would be my second) I did my research, trust me. I knew that I didn't want to lose any space so I narrowed my search to players that stored 40 gb or more. That's why I ruled out the Zune, which, though attractive in many respects, only had a 30 gb version available. After hours(seriously, I probably spent a full 24 hours overall) of intense research, I narrowed my options down to the 60 gb Toshiba Gigabeat and the 60 gb iAudio. Still not wanting to submit to the conformity of the ipod, at first I was leaning toward the Toshiba Gigabeat. It looked like it was very user friendly and had all the same features as the ipod and more. But then when reading the customer reviews I saw that users suffered from frequent crashes of the mp3 player and lost entire music libraries. Plus tech support was not very supportive. The iAudio was also very enticing, especially because it included an FM radio component. But then I noticed that it had a maximum file limit of 10,000 files. Even though it advertised 60 gb, the iAudio really only offered 40 gb because of this limit. That brought me to the dreaded ipod. The size and popularity of the thing finally won me over and I purchased one. Although I'm losing credibility in the non-conformist department, I'm really glad I made the purchase.  Pros: great battery life bright screen, crisp, clean picture tiny! easy software with itunes (and for me who still uses the cd method, all i have to do is pop a cd into my drive and itunes automatically asks me if i want to add the tracks to my itunes library, it's really simple) the click wheel really isn't that bad, just a little getting used to holds a crazy amount of media, music, photos, videos, 80 gb is all i'll ever need  cons: you can't actually do anything on the ipod itself, like organize music, delete songs...everything has to be done on the computer doesn't come with a charger, you must charge through your computer and often times the warning "do not disconnect" comes up on the screen until it is completely charged  In the end, I really like the ipod. It's worth the money. I'd recommend buying a case before you take it out the box though, because it is unbearably prone to scratches (not pretty). Also, make sure that you don't charge it when the battery is only half or a third of the way empty. Wait until the battery is completely empty before recharging and this will preserve the life of your battery. The ipod really is a great buy. If you're like me; a music addict, then you won't be disappointed. Hey, sometimes being a sheep isn't so bad.

<Content>No problems.  If you don't know what it is by now, your in trouble!!  One of the best features I love about the Ipod (and I'm not sure which models have this features), is that I can do a photo slide show, by syncing a folder of pictures and a song playlist.  I went out to "Five Below" and they had a $5 A/V cable that connects from your speaker jack of the Ipod into your TV.  For the holidays, I put family slide shows together and it was a big hit!!

<Title>Go with 80 Gig if you have movies in mind
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, you will find the anti-Ipod group will find something wrong with all apple Ipods. I've been using Ipods for around four years and my first Ipod still works fine. In fact the oldeset Ipod I have is permanantely placed in my car. Now the new 80 Gig, buy it if you plan on downloading movies and TV shows. Some of the shows I watch happened to be broadcasting at late hours. For example I love Jay Leno, so I purchased 20 episodes of his show for $10.00 from itunes ( I think that's the cost). I travel quite a bit and killing time is priceless. I use to carry a laptop plus all the movies I wanted to watch in a case and sometimes even a portable DVD player. The convenience factor is amazing if you are willing to pay the premium price. Although I wish they have more movies in the Itunes store along with a cheaper price tag (that's not going to happen anytime soon).

<Title>One star docked for the freezing issue
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This new Ipod is a great improvement in general over the 4th generation.  I'll agree that there is a minor problem with freezing up, but it's likely a very well known problem to Apple and it will get fixed in a firmware update sometime relatively soon (they're probably focused on getting Itunes working correctly right now - now THAT is something that is in desperately need of updates to work correctly.)  In the meantime, I think I've discovered a very simple, temporary, albeit unwieldy fix: don't use the Hold button.  I have found that nearly every time I've pause my 80gb Ipod and then used the Hold button, I've unpaused and unlocked only to find my Ipod frozen.  Since I stopped using the Hold button, no freezing.  Inconvenient?  Definitely.  You'll have to weigh which is more annoying - having your Ipod play randomly in your pocket if it gets bumped or whether you have to center-button/menu reset it all the the time and lose your place in your songs.

<Content>This is a great product.  It does what it says on the can, however you do need to make sure that you arrange your music well on the PC prior to importing it as the IPOD wants to be the king and control what you do.  Its a little bit "big brother" in the way it prevents you doing things like burning your own CDs etc, but I manage that via WMP and then import it to itunes.  Seems to work quite well.  Great product, not sure how to get movies onto it yet but time will help.  Highly recommended.

<Content>I waited all this long to own an ipod and now I feel this 80 gig ipod is worth the wait. It has met all my expectations and I am really a very happy ipod owner.  One cool enhancement that I am very happy about is its bright display compared to the older ipods. I store my dvd movies in the ipod and watch them while working out. The clarity is excellent. The new search feature is good too. I can get to any of my favourite albums in no time thanks to the search.  The only thing i hate about this ipod is its ear phones. They don't fit into the ears thanks to the 'cool' design changes that apple made. Then, they got rid of the foam cover just to make things worse. As these covers are not sold seperately, you are forced to buy another set of ear phones from one of their accesory vendors.  Overall, this is the ipod i like and would recommend to everyone. And I wish Apple would do something about the earphones :(

<Content>If you plan on using all the features of the Video Ipod - Videos, pictures, games, and of course music this is the one to get. Easy to use as all Ipods are, and plenty of space. However, even thou its slightly thinner than the 60gig, still kinda of bulky. I use my Ipod mini for jogging or activities in which the size of player matters. This Ipod has been a great addition to my car stereo, especially for those long road trips.

As an owner of 600+ CDs, I was tired of lugging around two cases back and forth to work full of CDs, only to want to listen to one I didn't bring.  So 80 gb of space is ideal for me.  Now I'm never without any CD in my collection, with plenty of space on the hard drive to spare.  Only (slight) problem I've had is the freezing issue.  However, it's never frozen on me during playback, just twice as I connect it to load songs on.  But it's still not that big a problem to warrant docking a star rating.  Enjoy!

I love having this to listen to all my music and watch all my music videos, TV shows, and movies all in one.  I would seriously recommend it.  Plus it's mainstream, so there are lots of add-ons you can buy for it.  I use and would recommend erightsoft's SUPER (freeware video encoder) to go with it.  It encodes to the right format (.mp4) at great quality at a variety of resolutions.  And if you have DRM complaints, just don't shop at the itunes music store; don't blame this device for it.

<Title>Works Exactly as Advertised
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 80Gb IPod is awesome.  I have been a PC person for many years but this may make me think more about Apple.  The IPod does exactly what I expected.  The sound is terrific.  I have about 6500 songs or about 25Gb of music.  That leaves plenty of room for as many movies as I want.  Even the ear buds sound great.  Plays great in the car with a FM transmitter.  The real beauty is that it syncs up with ITunes and no intervention is necessary.  The only hiccup is that ITunes does not have a feature to re-sync itself with the music on the hard drive (3rd party SW is available for free).  I highly recommend this product.

<Title>I love my iPod!
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The thickness of the iPod is probably 25% thinner than the 60 GB iPod Photo, and it is noticeably so.  This makes it easier to carry around in your pocket (if you don't have a case).  The screen is larger.  This is noticeable as well, and is a welcome upgrade to previous versions.  The headphones that ship with it have been upgraded.  Nothing spectacular, but if you are familiar with the older iPod headphones, you'll notice that these are a little more streamlined.  Just a visual difference, not an auditory one.  One complaint: There is no longer support for a remote control.  The audio input into the iPod is a single circular hole, and not the circular hole with the small rectangular hole right next to it.  This really annoys me because I can no longer use my remote and store my iPod in my holder while I am working out.  I suppose this was intentional by Apple to move people away from using one iPod for everything, and forcing them to an iPod nano (or a shuffle) if they want to use it to work out.  Well, I guess it worked, because I had to buy a shuffle so that I could control the iPod from my hip, because it just wasn't feasible for me to take it out of the case to raise the volume or skip the song.  That annoying debacle aside, I love the product.  On a separate note, the video playback works really well.  There is one neat thing, however, that Apple doesn��t make it easy for you to find out about: You can actually output video output from your iPod to your TV, and it looks great.  Your iPod is, in effect, a personal video player, and you can play your movies and TV shows on any TV as long as you purchase the Apple cords (which run about $20) or use the exact same cable that shipped with an iPod Photo.  Just hook this cable up to the iPod, and then to the video and audio composite inputs on any TV, and then adjust the following iPod setting.  Go into your menu for Videos Then click on  Video Settings then click on TV Out and change it to ��ON�� or to ��ASK��.  (��ON�� means videos won��t play on your iPod screen, only your TV, and ASK means it will ask you every time you play a video �Vwhich is what I prefer.  If you want to see it on your iPod just choose ��No�� when it asks you ��Output to TV?��, or choose ��Yes�� if you DO want to do see it on the TV screen.)  This function is really cool.  Now you can download TV shows on iTunes and take them on the road and play them in a hotel room or at a friend��s house.  This really makes the video iPod MUCH more useful.  I wish I had this when I was a consultant and traveling a lot: this would have made my evenings on the road a lot more enjoyable!  Oh, one more thing.  This iPod plays games as well.  There are not so many to choose from yet, but you can pick things like Pac Man and Tetris.  My favorite, however, and the only one that seems truly optimized for the iPod control wheel is Mini Golf.  I highly recommend that as a game purchase.

<Content>SO FAR, this product is preforming as I'd expected. The only thing I'm disappointed in is it doesn't seem to have a "photos" tab/section like it does Movies and Music where you can isolate photos you want to store on it.  The battery lasts surprisingly long time.  I bought an APC extended life (10 hour) portable batter for it (about the same size as the iPOD...last 10 hours), but have yet to need to use it and I've watched a full movie (2.25 hours) and still had plenty of battery left.  My last Photo iPod's hard disk bought the farm WAY too early and the cost of fixing it was over half the price of a new one.

<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are a lot of MP3 players out on the market but this is the most marketed version of them all.  The advantage of mass marketing is the availability of any accessory you ever need or can imagine.  That is why I chose none other than the 80 GB and the 30 GB IPOD video.  Since we also own the Bose speakers, I figure that we should have both MP3 players branded by Apple.  Initial set up requires charging the unit which is through your USB cable or the Bose speakers.  I chose the latter.  Next, I proceeded to download iTunes.  Set up was easy and I just added my library by dragging it into the iTunes window.  Sound quality is very good for a compressed format but still doesn't compare to the actual CD.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  The simple design keeps me from messing things up.  Playlists are easy to set up.  I converted a DVD to see what it looked like on the IPOD.  I can say that it's not bad looking to watch a movie (micro-style).  I may download some TV shows and other videos from iTunes in the very near future since it's convenient and priced appropriately.  I do recommend getting a screen protector before even opening the box so you don't get a nasty scratch on it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYGTM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9917419-1952141">Belkin F8Z085 Protective Overlays for iPod Video</a> The bubbles are a pain to get out but scratches....are more intolerable.  I got a plastic Ascent 18 Case which works well and is very durable.  It even has a stand. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I3MHCS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9917419-1952141">Agent 18 VideoShield Case for 60GB and 80GB iPod Video</a>  You cannot go wrong with either the 30GB or the 80GB versions.  Downloading Podcasts or Vodcasts are so easy.  It's so easy to subscribe to programs. That is the greatest advantage to getting the Apple.  I highly recommend this product.

<Content>Getting a video onto the iPod takes QUITE a while, and it's pretty complicated. Also, ALL of your songs better have their correct ID3 tags, or you'll get the 'Untitled Artist' syndrome, where all of your songs will be titled incorrectly. Another drawback is that you CANNOT get the songs/photos/videos off of the iPod after you put them on there, you can erase them, but you cannot just drag them off onto a computer. Other than that, I like it. Nice, clear, bright screen, pretty simple interface.

My wife used a cd ripping service that takes your CDs and converts them for you to MP3.  Saves tons of time and the music and data are far better than with iTunes.  I don't use the ear buds that came with it.  I am old school and have studio head phones.  Now I need to get a stereo hookup so I can listen to the music  on my hifi stereo.  Can't recommend it enough!

<Content>How come you don't own one already?  EVERYone has one of these things. C'mon, you're not "cool" unless you got an iPod, man.  I bought the 80 gig black one cause I think black electronics are slick. I went with the 80 gig version, cause you can NEVER have enough space in electronics. So last year I made the leap. It's nice.  Sounds fine - depending on what you're playing it on - some speaker systems are better than others - but it's a great thing to have. No more burning CDs, or using my CD changer in my car. I use a microphone jack in my car stereo and a $12 cable to plug this thing in. This thing takes scratches and fingerprints like crazy though, so in no time yours will look like you've had it forever. There's a reason why these have sold so well - THEY WORK THAT GOOD. The iTunes setup is nice, the functionality of the iPod is unparralleled in simpleness, and it just looks cool. Mine has frozen up at odd times now and then, but it hasn't been a huge issue.  It's a slick thing.  Are you STILL reading this?  Dude, get thee an iPod, NOW.

Haven't downloaded a movie yet, but for music playback it performs well, and also for photo storage/slideshows.  Being new to Apple products, I wish it came with a few more details in the instructions.  It would have been helpful to know right off the bat how to disconnect it safely from iTunes after syncing without having to download the manual first to find out.  The earbuds were not very comfortable, and I had to get a different pair.  Overall I would highly recommend it. It is definitely the coolest electronic toy I have ever had.

<Content>After many years of my mother trying to convince me that I wanted a iPod, she gave me one for Christmas. I was excited because I like to listen to radio programs and I knew that some of my favorites were now "podcasts," though I still wasn't sold on transferring all of my CD collection onto a little media player. After the first few days of using my iPod, I was HOOKED. I now have over 1,000 songs on my iPod (and I'm still not done transferring my CDs), 70+ podcasts, and some of my favorite television shows. I am selling most of my CDs since there are over a hundred that I only like one or two songs on. The convenience of these things is amazing. And how about that video screen? The picture is amazingly clear - I've watched quite a few television programs on it already. I'm sold.

<Content>I bought this iPod as a Christmas present and for my partner and I'm still being told how much he enjoy's it.  I originally thought the video aspect would get old but after purchasing a simple program for under $30.00 he is having a blast with converting our video's to iPod format and watching his favorite shows.  We had heard that the battery life was a problem when viewing a full length movie but we haven't had any problems with this.  The monitor is a nice size and the color and vividness of the display are great.  With 80 GB's we have our entire music library (over 6,000 songs) and several music video's, sitcomes, and a couple of movies, and there is still plenty of space for more.  He couldn't be happier with his new iPod which means I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

I love being able to run through all of them as I choose different albums to those favourites I always pick up. Haven't yet tried downloading any films but guess that's the next step. Highly recommended

<Title>Excellent Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned a few iPods in my day, but this one is by far the best.  The battery life is great, even when watching videos, and the screen is bright and clear.  Even through it's a little larger than the 30GB, I have enough space on this one for the player to double as a backup hard drive for my important files and documents.

<Title>Apple 80GB Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the Apple 80gb Ipod to replace the 60gb Ipod.  I needed more space and wanted to have the video functionality of the new Ipod.  The new design of the Ipod is sleeker and weighs considerably less than the older generation.  The functionality is a little better:  song accessibility, scrolling, video playback, etc.  The display and sound quality are excellent (for Mp3s).  There are a couple things I didnt like.  The new Ipod seems more difficult to operate.  Unlike the older Ipod, the scrolling wheel really has to be pressed to make an operation occur.  In addition, I thought I was purchasing the Ipod that showed the alphabet along the bottom window for faster scrolling through vast song databases, but the 80gb (5.5 gen) isnt it. Either way, this is an excellent product for people who have a vast music collection and want video playback. For the price, the Ipod can't be beat!

<Content>I had the iPod mini but it became too small for my needs, so I decided to get the bigger one, the 80GB iPod video. I chose a white one and my husband the black one. Needless to say they were our christmas gift! Until now it has a great, great performance: no problem at all, huge capacity, excellent video quality, easy to hang on my neck. It's my daily companion with music, podcasts and movies. We even use it at home, with speakers, instead of the old sound equipment. If you are trying to decide which one to buy, don't hesitate: go and get the bigger one, you won't sorry! (As you can see, english is not my mother tongue, I apologyze)

<Title>Not a good piece of technology....
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I first of all just want to say that I DO NOT DISLIKE APPLE!  I am not a      and this is simply a review from my opinion of this product.  OK here we go,  Pros:  1. Fairly thin device; personally i dont think this is important but some people do. 2. Large memory capacity; put whatever you want on this baby cause you probably wont every fill it. 3. Out of box has a nice look to it. Cons: 1. The Circle Wheel; Its a nightmare, i eventually got used to it, but i still mess up with it constantly.  Hurt my finger after awhile of going in circles.  Why not a line instead of a circle??? 2. Itunes; I absolutely cannot stand the Ipod format.  Apple needs to get rid of this retarded copyright protection.  Its just frustrating to have to convert over 15 gigs of music to their format.  Also this program bogged down my system. 3. Picture Quality; while the quality of the ipod is good, i have seen much better.  (Zen Vision M: 60 gb) 4. Scratching; this may just be me, but this thing scratched so badly even without anything being in my pocket. 5. Price; this just isn't a cost effective player, i've seen better players for less cash per gig out there. 6. Sound Quality; alright this company ISN'T creative, but the sound needs to be stepped up a bit.  Overall:  I would not suggest this product.  Due to having more negatives than positives i think that Apple needs to make some serious adjustments in order for this product to survive another couple generations.  Mostly software detracts from this machine.

<Content>I received my 80GB iPod as a Christmas gift.  It is my first iPod and I love it.  I have pictures, music, and movies stored on it already with plenty of room for more.  The picture quality is much better than I expected and it is easy to use.  I recently took the iPod with me to a doctors appointment, in case I had a long wait.  My doctor saw it and loved it too.  I think he will be buying one for himself after playing with mine.  The ear buds that come with it sound good, but didn't really stay in my ears.  I immediately purchased a set of Bose earbuds that come with 3 sizes in the package.  They work much better.  I love my iPod and look forward to adding more stuff.

<Content>I received the 80GB Black Video iPod for a present.  Actually, I wouldn't have paid for it myself, but as a gift a great product to receive.  It has frozen on me once and after I reset it, it has worked great ever since.  I use it to run and work out with and I see others using iPods as well.  Definitely a hot product on the market, with a recommendation of the JBL music dock.  Great battery life and I also use it to back up all my files on both of my computers!!  The down side, is you have to manage songs yourself and I wish it was done automatically, i.e., genere, artist, year, etc...

<Content>Absolutely love my 80gig iPod. Like many, I debated whether it was cost effective to spend this much for an mp3 player, now after owning it for about a month I can say emphatically yes! The extra space is wonderful, allowing me to load thousands of songs on it, and over 5 days worth of tv shows/movies. (And still have significant free space to boot.) Video playback is excellent, as is the audio sound. The perfect companion for travel or downtown while waiting for a meeting. If you're debating it, I think you'll find it is well worth the investment.

<Title>The iPod that couldn't.
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The rating should be "0" for something that wouldn't function properly. Just before Christmas, I purchased this 80gig. ipod and the Altec Lansing IM9 for it to fit into from Costco.  I had been wanting something to hold a lot of lesson plan material (40-50 cds)and maybe some music.  After downloading the Apple info from their site, I tried to copy all my cds over to the ipod.  Unfortunately, it would only play just a few lessons from the first disc and none of the others.  The controls also seemed very sensitive at some times, and balky at others.  After trying several more times (without success)to get my mp3s all transferred over, I felt that this unit must be defective.  For almost $400, one would expect a better quality control.  Had to return the speakers too, since they were dedicated to the unit. But what I did hear from them was great!  Judging from most of the postitve responses here, I may try it again.  Looks like Amazon has the better price now too!

<Title>Excelente! Ojo con el ITUNEs y compren los accesorios de una vez
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Me decida comprar un IPOD cuando anunciaron que estaba disponible el de 80 gigas y entonces aprovechpara liberar el espacio de disco duro de mi portatil. Muy bonito, simple de manejar, intuitivo pero:  - No trae ning�n accesorio, solo los aud�fonos (es lo m�nimo: es un reproductor de m�sica!) y el cable para sincronizar (la carga se hace por este cable v�a el computador y es MUY LENTA) - No trae manual, indicaciones ni nada que le ayude a uno a aprovechar mejor el aparato - El itunes, (programa que se baja de internet y que se usa para sincronizar el aparato) es un desastre!, reorganiza la m�sica de acuerdo con lo que encuentra, con lo que uno queda con el DD del computador desordenado y se pierden las horas invertidas en tener la biblioteca de m�sica al d�a. Por favor seleccionen la opci�n NO MODIFICAR LOS ARCHIVOS DE ACUERDO CON LA BIBLIOTECA. Es mucho mejor el Windows Media Player, 500%, permite tener mayor control, detalle, actualizaci�n e im�genes de los CDs, es m�s simple! Ahora voy a tratar de averiguar si igualmente puedo usarlo para sincronizar mi equipo. Si es as adios ITUNEs, aunque eventualmente pueda usarlo para comprar m�sica nueva v�a internet!  Accesorios recomendados: NO al cargador de pared, es un desperdicio de tiempo y dinero; SI al cargador de carro, fundamental para los que pasamos horas en el carro, carga r�pidamente: recomiendo el Kengsinton que es a la vez transmisor de radio y permite escuchar la m�sica del IPOD en el radio del carro con solo conectarlo!; SI al cable de audio y video que permite presentar las fotos, videos y m�sica en cualquier aparato dom�stico corriente (TV, Equipo de sonido...); NO a los parlantes Bosoriginales IPOD, suenan bien, son port�tiles pero... cuestan mucho dinero para lo que se usan, con la mitad del precio puedes comprar un equipo de sonido SUPER �ltima generaci�n y con entrada para aparatos reproductores y escuchar la m�sica del iPod a todo volumen con mayor salida de audio!, es cierto, no es port�til pero seamos sinceros: cuantas veces al a�o vas a la playa o al campo y necesitas llevar unos parlantes para escuchar tu m�sica mientras caminas?

With a CD player, I have to change CDs for different music, but thanks to Apple, I can download my music from my hard drive and put them on the iPod, now I can choose mu songs without having to change CDs, and it's very lightweight too, a very big investment to have.

<Content>I bought this as a gift to myself for getting out of debt. At first, I was going to go with a 30GB model, but I share a computer with less space than this, and so I decided to get the 80GB for storage purposes, I had over 10GB of music on my computer and wanted to free up the space.  The first unit I bought actually stopped working properly after one day...it was accidentally unplugged from the computer and after that, despite resetting and even rebooting it from the beginning, couldn't get it to function again. It basically took on a mind of its own, and would randomly pause and the menu button stopped working...I took it back to the store and exchanged it, and the second unit has worked flawlessly since then.  My only problem is the casing...it's so cheaply made. I couldn't find a cover I liked, so after only four months my iPod's casing is extremely scratched and dingy looking.  Overall, though, I'm very pleased with this product!!

<Content>Worth the wait! While the world was going iPod crazy a number of years ago, I was put off by the price and I was never crazy about getting a device exclusive to APPLE. I was also turned off from being restricted to using iTunes. I did like the buzz of MP3 player and I got a 20GB Creative Labs player and loved it, that was until I filled it up. But don't get me wrong I loved it.  A friend told me about a 30GB iPod player, which drove me to the Apple website. I then learned of a 80GB that was on the market. Needless to say I purchased it within a week. Cut now to about 3 months since I had it, I now have about 7,000 songs on it, photos of my family and I have been adding movies, and tv shows to it as to multitask at work. The ability to transfer DVD's to the ipod makes this device so much more worth it.  The capacity is great. ease of use is excellent and iTunes is so great and easy to use and organize your music, video, and photo collection I firmly believe this will be the last MP3 player I will have to purchase. Worth  every penny considering what it holds.

<Title>Great product, needs more video formats and battery options
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With 80 GB you are pretty much set if you only mean to save music. However, if you wish to save videos the options are limited as to formats (there are some free video converters online that are useful).  In addition, the only way to charge it (unless you buy an AC/car adapter separately) is through the USB port in your computer, which is not that great if you travel constantly and don't carry your computer with you. The batteries are not replaceable, which is something else that Apple should begin thinking about making more flexible.  Overall, it is a great product. The features are great, as well as the ease of use.

<Title>Love my iPod, loathe iTunes.
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The bottom line is that it is a great machine, but fundamentally it is limited by iTunes.  I hate to say it, but even Windoze Media Player is better than iTunes.  Both MusicMatch Jukebox and Media Player will either semiautomatically (MMJB) or automatically (WMP) search for music and synchronize the data as the MP3 tags change.  Also if you have WMP and MMJB, they play together relatively nicely.  At least they don't go out of their way to step on each other's toes.  If you edit tags or change the classification of music or otherwise change the metadata on an MP3 file with MMJB, WMP sees it automatically.  MMJB can be told to rescan and rebuild its tables.  Not iTunes.  iTunes demands to be your one and only.  Commandment #1 should read: the iTunes media player is a jealous media player and thou shalt have no media players before me.  Getting iTunes to work the first time was simply a nightmare.  I ended up with literally thousands of copies of files on my iPod.  Actual copies of files, they took up space and you would play an album and every song played twice.  I called customer support and was asked "did you try to delete the files?"  Yeah, sure, I am going to go in and delete 2000 duplicated files BY HAND.  I mean I have a lot of songs, that is why I bought the 80GB model...  iTunes does a pretty good job of synchronizing its own view of your media collection but Apple forbid you should use MMJB to edit your tags...  Apple has a home run with 5.5G iPod and a serious turkey with iTunes.  iTunes is without doubt the worst of the media players at helping you *manage* your files. (The only good news is the "gapless" feature.  One would not think it would take so long for the media players to figure out that a dance mix should be played uninterrupted without inter-song gaps... However, be forewarned, gapless playback is only as good as your ripping.  If the end of song 1 did not rip *exactly* into the beginning of song 2, you still hear glitches.)

<Title>Best portable music player in the market
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this iPOD recently to replace a stolen 60 GB iPOD.  Although I consider that this iPOD is the best portable music player in the market, it has plenty of room for improvement.  These are the improvements that would earn it a 5/5 stars: 1)Be able to transfer songs from iPOD to iTunes.  Currently you are only able to transfer songs from iTunes to the iPOD, but you need cumbersome 3rd party software to transfer songs from the iPOD to iTunes. 2)Change to replaceable rechargeable batteries as opposed to the current internal non-replaceable battery.  Most PDAs in the market today have this capability. 3)Have iTunes be more customer friendly, and let customers re-download previously purchased songs later in the future.  Lets face it, most us do not backup our hard drives as often as recommended.  Although one is the only one to blame for lost data in case of a hard drive crash, I do not understand why iTunes cannot let one re-download previously purchased songs.  Most other online software will let you re-download programs indefinitely. 4)Have iTunes have a bilateral concern for piracy and copyrights protection.  iTunes has a way of identifying iPODs by their serial number.  However, they cannot help me in refusing to accept future song purchases and transfers to the stolen iPOD  My guess is that it is not their concern how or by whom they receive the money, so it is not in their best interest to refuse business from whomever stole my previous iPOD.  We will see what the future holds.

<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Though I haven't had it long, the 80GB Ipod that I purchased from Amazon has proved to be exactly what I wanted.  I have imported my entire CD collection onto it plus some music that I purchased from Itunes--11,530 songs, to be exact--and have used up only half of the memory.  On a recent road trip we were caught in a snowstorm and were on the road for over six hours.  I had purchased adapters for use in the car so I put the Ipod on "shuffle" and let it go.  One hundred songs later we were home but had had the luxury of a wide variety of music plus the added modicum of some surprise which I find superior to the "one CD at a time" routine.  Overall, I am quite happy I own the Ipod.                                          Jim Kearney

<Title>Love the 80 gig iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was a johnny come lately to the iPod. My first one was the iPod Photo, and i bought it on clearance when Apple went to 30 gig and 60 gig models (pre-video though). I loved it. I had purchased a 20 gig iPod for my then girlfriend and we enjoyed using it together, but I wanted my own. That was two years ago. My iPod Photo had seen better days, but worked and worked well. Yet, it missed all of the new features. After all there had been several refreshes since my purchase. For Christmas 2005 i bought my then Fiancee an iPod 5th Generation (so called iPod Video) and she really fell in love with iPod then; and I was jealous. Last Christmas my step-daughter's iPod died and i bought her an iPod 5.5 and now both of them could play games, videos and see their photos. I was still using my trusty iPod Photo. Well a few weeks ago i got the green light from the wife to finally replace mine....... and i am so glad I did. I knew I would like it, but man I didn't know the half of it.  The ability to watch videos... specifically the news and video podcasts is fantastic. I now can watch the nightly news anytime I want. It is also much smaller, even though I got the 80 gig version. If you use the case it comes with it will slide gently into your shirt pocket and there is enough friction and tightness to keep it from sliding out. If you haven't looked at one since the old days, then you will love the thinness and the bright screen of the newer iPods.  Do I worry that a widescreen (iPod phone like) will be released soon, yep.... but this really works for me and i don't want first generation anyway.

<Title>It's my 3rd iPod and it keeps getting better!
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love to watch TV shows and movies on my iPod. Before I had to sit for one hour to watch my favorite shows, now it's like reading a book, whenever I have a little time time I watch some minutes of my show. And best of all, I just plug it to my TV set and the quality is amazing! If you are looking for storage capacity go for it!!!

<Content>This is my second iPod, the 80gb is just for more memory. Everyone in my family has an ipod and it is a great product. The kids and my husband listen to music, I am an audiobook fanatic. I had a problem with the switch on the one I just purchased. Amazon had it replaced before I had returned the original.  Can't beat that for Customer service!!!

<Title>Simply the BEST
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Buy it. I mean, iPod is the best mp3 player you can buy, no doubt, iPod has change the world, the places you go, the number of ipods you'll see. why choose iPod? well, because it has received a reputation, and it is simply the best.   now, are you doubtful whether buying the smaller versions (in capacity)? there's nothing you can doubt, i mean, for 50 dollas you get much more space, is there really anything to doubt? NO. lots of space doesn't hurts nobody, maybe it is a bit bigger, but trust me, you won't notice, there are more benefits in having greater disk space over size, besides there is nearly no difference in size.  i had the the ipod just before the ipod color, it sucked not to have the titles scroll sideways, nor the albums or artists (only the title scrolls in "Now Playing"), now they all scroll. another thing that rocks is the search option, and the letter that appears when scrolling, to make you know where are you. the display is bright, and i just realized its in the half, so you can meke it really bright. another thing that i use a lot is that when you touch the wheel the light turns on and lets you see which track is playing,whereas in past generations, you needed to change the volume or click the wheel to make it turn on.  for me there is no disadvantage in buying this ipod, because i had the past generation, the last one before the color ipod, , which implies that i have the AC adapter, which is a must have for the ipod. however if you don't have the adapter and you don't want to buy it, there is no problem, you can charge it easily through USB.   in conclusion, this ipod is really better than past generations, you must have an ipod nowadays, it is really usefull. just buy an ipod.   SUGGESTIONS: you MUST buy a case, want a suggestion? BUY iskin's claro case, see my review there, it rocks...REALLY.  hope this helped

<Title>80 gig ipod white
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>if you want to buy a MP3 player   the question is not what brand should you buy    the question is which ipod suits your needs ipod is the best PERIOD!!!!!! I love this ipod. it's easy to use, easy to setup and easy to undestand. apple has taken the brain work out of it. the only bad thing I can say about the 80 gig ipod  is that mine turned out to be 74.5 gigs(i use it with itunes on a pc  running windows98) but that's typical when you buy a storage device for example  my comp has a 30g drive but it actually is only 27g as we speak i put over 200 cd's on the ipod  which turned out to be about a tad less then 5000 songs  and it's only one quarter full. buy ipod  you won't be sorry

<Title>Just got mine today.

<Content>The LCD screen is amazing.  Clear, sharp, and packed with colors.  TV shows were not only viewable but enjoyable.  (I wasn't expecting much from the LCD).  And 80GB of disk space?  HUGE!  My iPod ate my entire collection (22GB) and still has space for more!    The click-wheel feels snappier than previous versions (had a 1st gen).  The unit is slimmer than previous versions.  I still can't get over that screen.  Like having a crystal-clear HD TV in my pocket.    One note:  The unit comes with earbuds and a USB cable.  Separate AC power cable is not provided.  Finally, the packaging of the iPod is thoughtful and well-designed.  A work of art on its own.    Buy one ASAP.

<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Going from a 1gb MP3 to a 80gb Ipod is a birthday dream come true! I would have given the Ipod a 4 or 5 except I was taken back with the fact that for over $300 you can't get a manual...at least on cd! I had to give the name of my first born and an arm just to be able to print out a copy online! Mind you it is 72 pages (my paper and ink)! I successfully loaded over 500 songs and audiobooks from my laptop but my daughter accidently deleted them when she plugged the Ipod into the desk top to add some of her music..Oops!  I am trying to reload them from my Itunes library..don't know what the heck I'm doing????  My audiobooks were loaded with the songs instead of in the audiobook folder, therefore they play when I'm listening to songs..how annoying!  I've gotten several IPod how-to-books and DVDs from the library and they all say that you can fix these issues but don't tell you how..just pure frustration!  I've even logged onto Apples' online IPod bullentin board and a few other people have similar problems but no one is giving instructions on how to get it done!  I'm waiting for one more manual (2007 edition)from the library and perhaps it will hellllllp!

<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This ipod is probally the best one i had besides the 30gb that i purchased a few months ago. my 30gb went bad and i could not get it to work, everything i had in it would erase all the time and i had to sync the ipod everytime this happened. it would also lock up on me evertime and never figured out why. now i recently purchased the 80gb and i have not had a single problem with it, i have over 4,000 songs in, tons of pics, and boxing video clips. the most valuable thing i got in my ipod is the 120 episodes of the old batman tv series which is well over 20 hours total and i still have like 39 gb left. much better to get the 80gb than the 30 gb since the 80 gb is only 100 bucks more than 30 gb. thats like having 2 30gb ipods and 1 20g ipod, get this and i promise that you will get your moneys worth.

<Content>I am an early adopter of the iPod. I started with the original 5GB unit and now I'm on my 7th iPod. I have a 30GB 5th generation unit I just gave to my son and bought a 5.5 80GB unit today. Having learned form past units, this one went into a protective case as soon as it came out of the factory packaging. I have 55 movies and 3300 songs and 700 photos stored and I've got 18GB of free space left. The battery life is incredible, plus I have a MacAlly extrenal battery to replenish the internal battery as I play movies. I decided to buy a new iPod now as I saw the iPhone and I'm going to pass on the first generation this time around. The 5.5 screen is brighter and crisper and much easier on the eyes than I had expected. It syncs to my desktop and give me good video with my .mp4 files. I'm going to buy a   5.5 30GB model before Apple quits making them. I've had bad units from Apple before but they always provided replacements quickly through AppleCare or whatever replacement plan I purchased.  Remember to treat these products with care and respect., and they almost always deliver!

<Content>Purchased the 5.5 80GB ipod to replaced my gen 5 that I left in my car over at temps below freezing, this is not a good idea.  ipod continues to be the best consumer device that I have.  The video is clear, there is no problem viewing a long format video.  Sound is  very good.  Integration with iTunes is seemless.  The 80gb ipod is perfect for someone is traveling a lot.  Use it in my car driving to work (4 hours/day) and while on an airplane.

<Title>So far, so good.
<Date>Mon Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first ipod I have owned.  In fact, it is the first mp3 player I have owned, unless you count the $20 one I picked up at a CVS store two years ago.  I decided that if I was going to make such an investment, I was going to go top of the line.  After reviewing and researching for about four months, I decided on this model and bought it last week.  So far, I have been VERY pleased with the ipod, as well as with itunes.  Since the ipod didn't come with an extensive owners manual, I found myself spending an extra $21.99 for "Absolute Beginners Guide to iPod and iTunes."  The book is available here at Amazon for $14.95.  I had no trouble "sync-ing" my iPod, and I very quickly learned the ins and outs of iTunes.  I have downloaded several music videos, tv shows, and a short movie. I found the picture to be as clear as that on my laptop, if not better. The design is smooth and sleek and I love the wheel. Like most everyone else, I have complaints about the earbuds, they are too large and hurt my ears.  I purchased a pair of sony clip-ons, and those too hurt my ears; so I am still searching for a suitable set. If anything changes in my feelings about this product, I will re-post, but I doubt that will happen.  This is my first experience with an Apple product, but it will not be my last.  I am already considering purchasing two shuffles for my children, to be their "first iPods."

<Title>iPod for a geezer.
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>All of my four children have iPods - hell, I gave them to them.  Now I have one too-again my purchase.  And I've bought more for Christmas gifts to neices, etc.  Well, it's incredible that this little thing carries my entire CD collection - that's 18 GB of music - and plays it with reasonable clarity.  I hate the fact that it arrives without a User Manual, but that's now true even for Excel.  It has no reasonable search capacity that I've been able to find, so I know the song but forget the Playlist and then can't listen to it (18 GB means 4600 songs, tough to browse).  And why can't I delete a song on the iPod and have that deletion Synced with iTunes?  And of course, the curse of all iPods is the "Do Not Disconnect" message that seems tatooed to the screen whenever I connect it to my Mac.  Having said all that.... there's no doubt this thing revolutionized the world of music.  I'm a train commuter, and the white earphones are ubiquitous.  (Although the silly Apple restrictions on purchased music are idiotic - I bought the CD or I bought the song... what's the difference????).  My solution is I don't buy music from iTunes.  Apple should junk the "Purchased" thing all together-you buy it, you own it.  Nuf Sed.

<Title>80 GB? Why?
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So why do you need 80 GB? When I bought my Gen 2 iPod, the idea of 20 GB seemed amazing. How could you ever fill up a hard drive that big?  Well the truth is I did. It took almost two years and all of my friends CD collection but the poor little Ipod was full. Lots had changed too. The video iPod promised portable entertainment, and it would scoop up al your photos as well.  So why get this huge hard drive if it took two years and many friends to get the original Ipod full? The answer is because this one will fill up as well. Video files are huge, and prices are falling and the price differential between a 30 GB iPod and an 80 GB iPod are not so great that extra capacity is a clear loss. If you have 20 GBs in music already, that leaves precious little room for more music , photos and video.  This iPod is more than you may need now...but not for long.

<Content>This is an incredible creation. I have upgraded on three occasions, going from 30g to 60g and now up to 80g with video. Being the first brand new ipod purchased, I would advise anyone who wants to buy new to buy it through Amazon - you are protected and the price is tough to beat. I received my first one and it stopped working after a day. I let Amazon know and they sent out a new replacement and it has been a dream. Get yourself an Amazon credit card and you can save another $30.00 on your purchase.

<Title>still the best
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What can I say? - It's an iPod.  Of course its great.  Although its not perfect.  If Apple would change just a couple of things, this would be absolutely indispensable instead of just really really nice to have.    It would be great if Apple would let the owner dictate the hierchy and structure instead of being locked into using iTunes.  Although I understand why they do it this way, it decreases the iPod's value by forcing you into iTunes.  I don't mean they should leave the foundational programming up to the owner of course but rather allow you to organize, structure, and play your music collection using the iPod but completely independent of iTunes.  Also, there's no excuse for not having fully functional and controllable EQ capability on a unit like this.  Although it has improved over previous generations (now you can choose categories of EQ such as "rock", "pop", etc.) it still needs full blown EQ capability.  Even a simple 10-band EQ would be awesome.       But all told, it really is still the best portable music device going.  The video is great.  The interface and functions are simple and user friendly.  It's small, sleak, and attractive.  And it's 80GB!

I hope Apple will support much more kinds of video files. iPod supports only MOV files. So I have to convert every video files to MOV.  It's really stupid.  Creative's digital audio players support many kinds of files.  So, if you use one to watch video and movie mainly, you should buy Creative one.

<Content>I used to have a 20GB dell dj (same thing as ipod) and I was a little unwilling to pay for an iPod. Seeing as how all the MP3 player accessories (radios and what not) only work with the iPod, I decided it was time to bite the bullet. Five seconds after I was playing around with it I knew the iPod was simply a superior product. There is so much more you can do with it than just listen to music. I got the 80gb video because I need it to store my design files on for college, but i'm not gonna lie, I did put a couple movies and this season of The Office on there, and it looks amazing (I had been one of THOSE who said I would never use it for video...that was before I saw one on there). I love my iPod!

<Title>Nice new features
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before getting the 80GB G5.5 iPod I had a 30GB G5. This new iPod I have has some slight improvements over my last one, but also some problems. There are a few new features like a search, which I had been wanting in my old iPod, and plug and play, instead of the CD install that I used last time. But this new iPod seems to take a couple more seconds to load songs then the old one. Also it has frozen once or twice in the short time I've had it, which is something that never happened (believe it or not) with my G5. I gave the old one to a friend so I was able to compare them still and it wasn't just my imagination. But all and all those are very small complaints and I am very happy with the new features and extra gigs.
