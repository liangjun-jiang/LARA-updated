<Title>Two outta three ain't bad
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased three of these as Christmas presents. My eight-year old loved it...until she realized the lanyard clip didn't work (we then used a twist tie to hold the lanyard on), the key ring thing broke, and then the player stopped playing altogether! She did not abuse this in the least. We returned it for a refund. The other two are still working fine but don't get nearly as much use. I also recommend buying a rechargeable player, as this one eats batteries. We replaced my daughter's player with a ZenV by Creative, which I highly recommend.

<Title>GRAY Centon 1GB MP3 PLAYER FM TUNER
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like this product.  I have this small player hooked up to my car amp which is 1500 Watts RMS.  It really gives clean cound with the mp3 music downloaded.  Thge radio gives slight static where the signal is weak, but the radio plays OK with the supplied headphones.  Nice colors on the screan and nice features like equalizer, repeat, speed of sound play too!!!   My friends like it.  I will really like to get one with maybe 4 gigs memory.

<Content>This is extremely hard to use and confusing. Mine came without instructions. I accidentally pressed the "hold" button and have never since managed to get it off hold.

<Title>Loaded with cool features that are hard to use.

<Content>If you're looking for a low cost MP3 player/ digital recorder you found it. I wouldn't recommend this product for its advanced features because they are difficult to use.  My Favorite feature: The Headset is built-in to the lanyard. This means the ear buds aren't yanked out of your ears.  Coolest Feature: You can record songs off the FM tuner and play them back later. ROCK ON! Worse Feature: Play/Pause button, if pressed for a millisecond too long, will pop you out of whatever you are doing and start recording.
