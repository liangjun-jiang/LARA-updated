<Title>Great MP3 Player, Great Price
<Date>Wed Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I ordered this little guy last week with a 512 MB JumpDrive Sport. I like this because I have about 6 hours of music and this is the only player with choices. I used to have 2 choices - an Ipod (Major Overkill) or a 128 player that will only hold 1/4 of my music. I had to cut the bitrate back on my music to 160 kbps, but I haven't seen (I mean herd) a difference. If ifill up my card, i can buy another. The earbuds are also great. They have good sound. Thanks Lexar! Great Idea!

<Title>Cheap but flaky and lacks key features
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>An MP3 player that uses a USB drive for storage is a great idea. Unfortunately this player is just something Lexar through together to sell some extra JumpDrives with no attempt at creating a quality player. It's flaky and lacks some really basic things that should have been there.  I was looking for a low cost, high capacity, flash based MP3 player. What I got was...  Pro: * Cheap - 1GB player for about $90. * Large capacity * Convenient - Copy some files to the JumpDrive and away you go.  Con: * It's flaky. It won't read the tags from about a third of my MP3s. It locks up about once a day, often with an ear-splitting shriek that has me ripping off my earphones. I have to pop out the batteries to reset it. * No hook, loop, etc for carrying. It's your hand, your pocket, or nothing. This is really basic and it's incredibly lame that it's missing. I'm using a small cellphone beltcase. * Doesn't remember the last song played. I can put in 1GB of music but I have to start listening from the first song every time it gets turned off. Again, really basic and how did they manage to leave this out? * Navigation system sucks. If it was quick and easy to navigate then the first song thing wouldn't be so bad. It's neither quick nor easy. * When set to random, cause how else are you gonna get to the last song when you have to start at the beginning every time, clicking FF to go to the next song goes to the NEXT song. I.E. it goes from song 20 to song 21. If it's set to random then FF should randomly jump to a new song. Basic, yet Lexar did it wrong. * The display should show the artist and the track title which it should get from the tags. It should not show JOE SAT->3.WMA. Again, basic stuff that Lexar did wrong.  Other Comments: * I saw other comments about the drive being loose when put in the player. It does have some wiggle that they should have worked out but the drive doesn't come out easily so it's not a big deal, for now.  Overall: * If you're going to swap a bunch of low capacity drives then this player might be okay. If you're going to put in one high capacity drive don't buy this player.

<Title>Great player for the price
<Date>Sat Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Love the player mainly because of it's versatility and cost.  What hasn't been said about it already?  Here are a few notes of mine:  1) I bought the JumpGear MP3 knowing it supports only MP3 and WMA formats.  As an iTunes user, I was disappointed that the only mp3 player on the market that plays mp4 (AAC) files is the iPod at more than 6 times the cost of this one.  :(  I got the impression from the Lexar website that the JumpGear MP3 has flashable firmware so hopefully they will provide support for the mp4 format in the future.    2) At least one reviewer noted that the on-screen display showed the file name and not the song name and artist name from the ID3 tags.  I quickly discovered that the JumpGear MP3 player does not recognize ID3 tags later than v1.1.  With iTunes I just have to right click a song and "Convert ID3 Tag" which is a pain but worth it to view track info on the player.  edit:  when navigating through the songs and folders the screen shows the filename.  When the song starts playing it shows the song title and artist from the ID3 tag, from all versions.  My mistake.  :0  3) At least one reviewer noted a disappointment with the EQ settings and that there wasn't much bass.  I have never been a fan of earbud headphones because, first of all, they are never comfortable for me, and second, they just don't provide much bass.  I unplugged the headphones and ran a line out directly to my stereo (through a 20-year old receiver and bookshelf speakers) and the bass was overwhelming, I adjusted the EQ to a setting with less bass.  My deduction is that the earbud headphones provide inadequate bass and the player itelf is excellent.

<Title>Good, but it needs a few key improvements
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Good:  It sounds good, even with the ear buds (which are surprisingly comfortable).  It seems solid enough, something that is hard to judge by pictures and reviews.  But I suppose the best feature is that it turns your thumb drive into storage for an MP3 player.  It does this just as expected, and with the ridiculously good deal I got on a 1G thumb drive, cheaper than just about any other player with half the capacity.  The bad: navigation is awkward.  There seems to be no quick/easy way to go from navigating the menu to adjusting volume, or from navigating one menu &#34;folder&#34; to another.  Also finding a specific file is complicated by the almost DOS-like abbreviation of the files - for example, a file called Favorite Band - track 01 would look something like this on the screen while navigating: &#60;-FAVORI-&#62;01.MP3-&#62;  During playback, the full tag is displayed.  This is a nice afterthought, but it seems that they missed the point.  It is really missing an &#34;up&#34; button for navigating the options and directories.  Waiting for a selection to time out, go back to its default state is going to annoy just about anyone used to a hierarchical file system.  Adding on an option to display only folders containing supported file types would go a long way toward making it a cleaner interface.  Really getting down to picking nits:  there is no &#34;off&#34; button.  Also, the buttons are not aligned in what must be the industry-standard, by now: Rew-play-FF or something like it.  It seems almost arrogant to do it any other way, but Lexar did it like this: (top to bottom) play/pause, Rew, FF.  And now that I think of it, there is no stop button, which could have doubled as an Off.  Not being able to pick up on the last file played is an annoyance.  This is probably tied to the missing off button (no way to differentiate between a passive and active power-down)   The overall result is that you can enjoy the hybrid features of the MP3/storage device with this setup, but it requires a little more work than expected.  I am not sure how this compares to an MP3 player that could double as storage - I think deciding how important having non-music file storage is to you will get you halfway to deciding if you will like this player.  I am happy with this one, although I am disappointed by how much better it could have been.  I expect that some third party company will take a different approach and be far more successful - rather than being an add-on to their line of thumb drives, they will add support for other file types (Ogg and FLAC, if anyone is listening) and manufacturer's thumb drives, make navigation easier, and sell gajillions of them.  So if you already have a Jumpdrive sport, and patience to make this work for your needs, you have a winner.  If you would like to have a simple MP3 player/storage device, this would again suit your needs, but it may involve compromise.

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Good:  It uses a jump drive. You don't need any software to load the files - just windows explorer.  Great on battery life. I'm getting 15 or so hours on two rechargeable AAA.  The Bad:  I use it primarily for listening to audio books. For the first little while I couldn't figure out the order it would play files (it was skipping all over the place). Finally, I learned that it plays the files in the order to which they were written to the jump drive (you can set up a folder structure on the jump drive which the player recognizes - nice). Meaning, that using windows explorer, you have to copy the files over one at a time (windows explorer will copy the first file you've selected, then the last file, then the ones in between (or something like that). So, once I figured out that little trick, I was all set.  There are a lot of "features" in the menu system I cannot make work. There is something called a "bookmark" but I can't determine what it does.

<Title>Not Mac compatible
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Jump Gear 512 MB for three days, and it's already stopped working. The LCD window is lit up, but I can't FF or REW, and the volume doesn't work. I tried logging onto Lexar's chat support, but was kept on hold for 20 minutes and I quit out. There's several things I don't get about this (Lexar's instructions don't help much). First of all, when I drag and drop MP3 files from iTunes to the Jump Drive, I end up with a  .M4A extension, instead of MP3. Not sure if that matters. I'm interfacing with an iMac running OSX 10.3, and am unable to find an app to help manage my files. Also, I can't play more than one song in a row: after each song, I have to select a new tune and press play. Except now the player doesn't work at all.  I hope I can return this thing.  UPDATE: I finally got through to Lexar. The JumpGear is not Mac Compatible, I was told, and you cannot drag and drop MP3s from iTunes. "Our marketing dept. needs to be made aware of this fact," I was told.  UPDATE to UPDATE: Received an email from Lexar customer support today. Now they tell me I can drag and drop iTunes generated MP3s, but that the unit I just purchased is defective and needs to be returned to Lexar. These people are clearly clueless about their Mac customers. Unless you are PC based, stay away from this product!

<Title>This is a lotta bang for the buck
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Controls worked well. Easy to set up. A little tough to sort files...hints: 1) build folders (albums or playlists), then its easier to select in the MP3; 2) name songs something that only uses 8 letters (days of DOS!); and 3) BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BONKING THE HEADPHONE PLUG WHEN PHONES ARE PLUGGED IN!!!! I cratered mine by dropping it on the plug. The little internal plug broke off and now I gots to buy a new one...which I will because this thing is so cool for the bucks. Much cheaper to replace than an Ipod!  This is a good buy (unless my other one breaks too!!). By the way, the jump drive is something you need for your data anyway, so you are half way there if you buy the jump drive for data then slip some (lots) of MP3s or WMA's onto it!!!

<Title>Easy and convinient...converts my jump drive into mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is a pretty good deal for converting my jump drive into a mp3 player for a low cost. It is easy and convinient to use. So far, I only have it for a few days but I like it so far. The only cons is that is is made of plastic that looks like it is pretty fragile. The menu control is also limited and the play list is set by the sequence you put in the songs. But overall can't complain.

The earphone jack completey fell into the player. So amazon gets me another out right away and now it's not reading the jump drive correctley.

<Title>Junk
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Though this player's stats look good on paper, and the concept is a great one, do not buy it. I recieved one for Christmas last year, and the headphone jack fell INTO the player after a few months. Lexar sent me a replacement, which did not even work to begin with. They sent me another one, the headphone jack broke on that one too. After this they refused to give me a refund, but replaced it with their newest model mp3 player, the LDP-600. I am waiting to see if their are any defects, but this is a much nicer player. In closing, stay away from the Jumpgear, I loved it while it worked, but it is far to poorly manufactured to warrant any price.

<Title>Average MP3 player with some major annoyances
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Lexar jumpgear MP3 player for a very good price with a 128mb jump drive (about $20).  Despite the incredible price I must say that there are some major annoying features that make it only about average when it comes to MP3 players. I also purchased an Irock ezmp3 for about the same price and that player did have some advantages over this one (although it does not have an LCD).  *** The postitive points of the Lexar Jumpgear MP3 include: ***  - A nice blue backlit display that displays the song title and other information (the Irock only has 2 LED's and NO display)  - A decent (though basic) navigation system for finding songs (the Irock does not have this)  - Sound settings for equalizer (although none of them provided much bass... even if you switch to other headphones or speakers).  The Irock has no equalizer settings although the sound quality is comparable in both units.  - The jump drive can be used independently so in case the player ever fails at least you still have the USB drive.  The Irock has an SD card slot but it ALSO has 128mb of INTERNAL memory.  - the volume control is nice and easy to use with on screen representation.  - It will play MP3's and WMA's (although you have to download a patch from the Lexar site for it to play WMA files).  The Irock only plays MP3s   *** The drawbacks of this unit include: ***  - very frustrating jog wheel control that doesn't always respond to input.  What is the point of the jog wheel if it only works about 60% of the time?  - Minimal amount of buttons and no real way to tell what you are pressing without looking or memorizing the layout. The Irock's buttons and layout is much simpler and much easier to use.  - The player does not remember the last song played so if you have a lot of songs it is very frustrating to have to go through and find the point where you left off.  The bookmark feature is useless unless you want it to remember a specific point in a song only while you are listening to that particular song.  (The irock at least remembers the last song played although it has no naviagation or bookmark system)  - There is NO strap, clip, or any way to carry the unit without an extra case.  This is VERY frustrating because one of the big uses for an MP3 player is to be able to listen to music while performing other tasks.  Also the design of the player is not great to hold because the plastic seems delicate and is shiny so it will get fingerprints and smudges quite easily.  (The Irock case seems more durable and it has an integrated neckstrap)  - It seems like it will not hold up with much abuse.  The Irock model seems bulletproof in comparison to this Lexar.  - Sound quality from the headphones is only average. A lot of users said this has excellent sound but if  you have used any other players you will know that it is only average (about the same as the Irock).  - The battery cover is not hinged on the Lexar so there is a chance you might lose it.    Overall the Lexar is not a bad MP3 player but it does have its annoying traits.  If you are looking for a cheap and durable player that is easy to carry then the Irock Ezmp3 would be a better (albeit plain looking) choice.  If you are looking for (or already have) a jumpdrive then the Lexar Jumpgear is a decent buy.

<Content>but I think this product is great.  I've been on several 6 mile jogs with it, jostled it around, sweated all over it, and it still works like a charm.  And so far its played every MP3 I've feed it.  Battery life is better than other players used by some of my buddies.  If it does get dropped and broken.  Its only $35 to get back in business, as long as the Jumpdrive doesn't get damaged.  I like that concept.    I use some of my drive space for data transfer as well, the user interface allows me to "surf" to whatever folder has the MP3s I want to listen to at the time.

<Title>Good value, but a few limitations
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  Its a good value for the money.  I didn't use the ear buds that came with the unit, preferring my sports style mini headphones.  The unit has excellent frequency response.  The display is very basic - showing the title and some basic information only.  The unit works only with USB drives that fit in its small slot - and not all USB devices will, though you can use a USB extenstion cord for this purpose though that's a pain.  Its nice that it will find the MP3 or WMA songs on a USB drive that also has data files (i.e. Word docs, PowerPoint shows, etc.), so you can have data and songs on the same drive.  For its purpose, which is a basic good-sounding player with minimal features, it works great.  If you drop it, it doesn't break easily (I have done this several times).  It gets about one day out of a set of batteries.    As an "El Cheapo Delight" MP3 player, knowing these limitations, its a good value.

<Content>I have to say for the most part, I enjoy this mp3.  It's easy to use and has decent sound. Compared to other mp3 player, it's very inexpensive.    The negatives are:  You can't create playlists and the player does not always play the songs in the order you load them.  The volume is too soft on some songs and can never get really loud. You must use a lexar drive, it won't recognize other brands.

<Title>In This Price Range, It has No Peer
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Lexar Jumpgear for about a year. I sounds surprisingly good considering the price. As for durability, again, I've had mine for a year. Advantages of this unit are...  If you already have a Lexar jumpdrive sport, you can get a MP3 player for under $40.  No annoying DRM crapola to prevent you from listening to your music  Doesn't require some dubious proprietary interface in order to transfer music files from your computer.  Isn't limited to any particular operating system. You can drag and drop files from whichever file manager you use. You can even do it at the command line (shell) if that is your wont.  It is very good for exercising and such. Since it's a flash drive, you don't have to worry about jostling it around. Also, it's only $40, so you don't have to be paranoid about it.  You can easily switch 1 gigabyte jumpdrives, assuming you have more than one, and have a different music catalogs for different occasions or different people sharing the same player.

<Title>JumpGear MP3 Digital Music Player - great as long as it doesn't break
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased one of these for my teenage daughter in December 2004.  It has been just the ticket for her.  I particularly like the fact that space is not a limitation -- just purchase additional jumpdrive sport drives that can be swapped in and the capacity of the player becomes limitless.  $35 to turn flash drives into a decent MP3 player is an excellent value. She also likes the shape of the device (she much prefers it to the iPod credit card shape).   And now for my one complaint -- we have now had two of these things bite the dust, both in exactly the same way.  The headphone jack is not very sturdy.  Around June 2005, the jack basically "fell" into the player so there was no way to make a connection with the headphones.  We investigated opening the player up to see if we could manage some kind of repair, but had no luck.  We were disappointed, but we were otherwise very happy with the player (and I had just purchased a new 1G drive for her!), so I just went ahead and ordered another one player to replace it.  Then in early December 2005, exactly the same thing happened with the replacement player.  So now I'm out $70 and she's got lots of tunes loaded up with no way to listen to them.  What started out as a terrific $35 value is starting to get pretty expensive.  Right now I'm weighing whether it is worthwhile to invest $35 every six months to keep her in wearable music....  (Of course, I went through similar problems with the CD players that rarely had lifespans exceeding 6 months, so perhaps I should just keep quiet and order a 3rd Jumpgear MP3 player).

<Content>I received the Lexar Jumpgear MP3 for Christmas and loved it. The LCD screen was sweet and sound quality wasn't that bad. I read several reviews complaining about this product but there were a few good ones...I decieded to get it anyway and Buy.com sent it within three days of Christmas which is pretty good...well 30 days later, EXACTLY 30 DAYS LATER WHEN THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT, it stopped working. Completely. It freezes up on the startup screen and I have to remove the battery to stop it. I tried everything from bran-spaking new batteries to reformatting my 256Mb Thumbdrive. The Thumbdrive works fine but this Jumpgear MP3 SUCKS!! I hit play and it freezes on the startup screen and it will never go away until you cut the power. I swear companies make things that work until the warranty ends...Buy.com WILL NOT respond to my emails and Lexar won't either...I may have gotten a lemon but there are too many Jumpgear lemons I've heard about out there and I'm just trying to help you SAVE YOUR 40 BUCKS!!!

<Title>Good Product for Beginners and Athletes
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I've never had an MP3 player, so this is my first and only. If it's the best out there, they have lots of room for improvement. Let's begin with the positive. This thing is light, easy to carry and pretty simple to use. If you don't like learning a bunch of "electronic stuff", don't worry. If you can plug in a jump drive, you are set. Windows Media player can rip all your songs and you just copy them over to the jump drive. Turn it on and hit play. It's that simple to get started. If you want to do other things like create play lists, set book marks, it can do all that - you just don't have to. You can get a 1GB Jumpdrive Sport from Lexar and hold 5 to 15 albums (depending on the quality you rip and the type of CDs you buy). It really has good sound, easy controls and has made me a MP3 convert. There's no hardrive, so you can run, jump, skip or ride horseback and it doesn't flutter a bit.  What don't I like? Well, it would be nice if it had a clip, hook or velco to attach it to you. As it is, I stick it in a pocket. Unfortunately, the earpiece plug is a bit on the loose side and if you bend over wrong, the sound breaks up because it gets pressure from the material in your pocket. Secondly, it pauses between tracks for maybe 1/10th of a second. The problem with that is, and I don't know if other players share the same problem, but if you have a CD where track one and track two were meant to run together, you now get a definite pause between them. It does not smoothly transition from one track to the next. Third, as someone else mentioned, the controls are pretty simplistic and have no memory. My 1GB drive has about 375 songs on it. When I want to go to the middle, it takes some time to get there since you have to hold the button and fast forward there. If they complain about a car crash with my cell phone, they're really going to hate it because I was fast forwarding my MP3 player. If it did nothing more than remember where it was when you shut it off so you could continue from where you were, I'd be happy. Next, the forward and reverse controls take too long and are nor intuitive. Well, maybe they are intuitive, what they aren't is compatible with a CD player. If you are listening to a song and hit "back", it goes to the beginnning of the song. On this player, it goes to the previous song. If you get a cell phone call, pause it, then go back and start it, you have to go to the previous song, then back to the one you want to hear. Also, the pause button does not last long enough. If you hit pause, it waits about 30 seconds, then shuts off. You can't have a conversation, phone call or listen to the news using the pause button.  All-in-all I am pleased with it, but it is very unsophisticated. I will likely move up and buy a 40Gb something, but I will keep this around for "rough" listening.  if you want to see if you like MP3 players like this before you buy, rip some CDs to your hard drive, plus earphones into your soundcard and play them with Windows Media Player. Outside of not being portable, this is exactly what you'll get in a credit card sized player that fits in any pocket, goes where you go and plays a long time on a pair of batteries.

<Title>concerning jump drives not being read
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just got the JumpGear today.  Not blown away, but not bad considering you can buy the lexar jumpdrives at pretty good prices.  And if you already have a jump drive, this is a very good way to get a mp3 player without paying a bunch.  Some have mentioned that the player won't read their jumpdrives.  After having the same problem, I contacted tech support and it seems my problem was that I converted the file format on the jumpdrive from fat32 to NTFS to increase transfer speeds.  According to tech support, the jumpgear will not read NTFS jumpdrives.  So if you are having problems in this area, see if you reformated the jumpdrive - that may be the problem.

<Title>Comment/Question on Jumpgear
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Comment: This will not work with Lexar non-Sport drives e.g. Lexar Media 512 MB JumpDrive Secure USB 2.0 (JDS512-432). This is because the slot where drive slides in only allows the slim line shape of the Sport drives.

<Title>Ok, I made a good decision with this MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yeah, it has all the functional limitations that everyone describes:  no on/off switch, no play stop memory, etc.  But, it's meant to be simple with minimal functions.  My player worked right out of the box.  Just what I payed for.  As for all the people complaining about the headphone connection...  My headphone plug takes more force to push in all the way than I have experienced.  The larger insertion force is probably due to the intended use of this MP3 player - portable, exercise, etc.  A correctly inserted headphone plug should not have any of the small diameter brass visible once inserted properly.  Only a thin ring of brass will be visible - the largest diameter of brass on the headphone plug.  Try this out before giving up and contacting Lexar.  Also, as for the connection of the Jumpdrive to the player, the looseness that some have complained about is just part of the USB connection.  These connectors are not meant to be firm, unmovable connections.  If they were, you would need a screw driver to remove your Jumpdrive.  On last thing I just discovered.  At least for my player, the documentation is wrong.  To access the "menu", do not press and hold for two seconds and try to move the toggle.  Instead press the toggle downward in the center quickly.  This should get you into the menu.  When ready to select something, push the toggle in quickly.  In order to see that selection has been activated, look along the top of the screen.  What ever you are changing will show up at the top (except the defaults).  To get out of the menu, press the play/pause button.  Hope this helps some of you.

<Title>For day trips
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When my tiny Compaq iPAQ MP3 player, a backup to a much larger and trusty Archos Jukebox, died unexpectedly (after three years) I looked around for something for day hikes, canoe rides, walks around the mall, short car trips, etc. and settled on this because I have a large Jump drive.   I wish Lexar had made it possible to turn off the power and remember the last track played, but the easy to use menu system makes it pretty easy to select files and albums.  The bottom line is that the sound from this thing is very, very good. As typical of devices of this kind the documentation is pretty bad. But the sound is  clear, with  lots of range, and with better volume than  my other players. The earbuds with it are also extremely good for headphones of this type. Plug it into your home or car stereo and you'll collapse on the floor. The Lexar puts out serious sound.  So, if you want to load up a bunch of cd's for a day's outing this thing can't be beat. It is playing my MP3pro (highly compressed) files like a pro, and it's only a couple of seconds to load a folder at USB 2.0 using Windows Explorer. Oh, and I like being able to use commonly available rechargeables instead of propietaries prone to inevitable death. So far battery life seems extremely good; easily a day's outing.   My sense is that if Lexar wanted to it could turn this into a mega-killer by making some minor fixes (I don't have a clue as to whether or not it will accept firmware upgrades), and accomodating other drives, but as it is a very nice add-on to Jump Drives, which are now selling for as little as $19.95.   Note: after several months (my initial review was back in March, 2005) I like this product more and more. I have taken it on several very long trips and get great battery life. When I want to change tunes I just borrow a computer and offload new ones from a dvd loaded with many, many hundreds. I can also keep critical files (passport photos, med info, addresses) on the Jump drive. A perfect package at very low price.

<Title>For what it is, it's very good
<Date>Mon Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll try to avoid duplicating information found in other reviews, except to say that I think that Lexar did a good job of providing a serviceable product at quite a low price.  If you keep your eyes out for a good deal on a JumpDrive Sport or two, you can have a lot of solid-state storage for a low price.  The "manual" for this is short and often incomplete.  I don't think it mentions that the JumpGear will play variable-rate .WMA files, and that's important.  For typical portable music uses, the variable rate compression will allow you to use the 40-75 kbps rate supported by Windows Media Player, and this equates to an average rate (over a bunch of songs in my experience) of about 64 kbps.  The sound at this lower variable rate, though, is reasonable, and probably about what you'd get from a fixed 96 kbps rate.  The bottom line is that a 512 MB JumpDrive will allow you to store about 225 average songs at a quality level that's acceptable for non-critical listening.  One reviewer was complaining about a 30-day warranty, but that's wrong.  The packaging that comes with the player is a little confusing, but it implies that the warranty is actually 2 years.  Checking out the Lexarmedia.com site you'll find that the warranty is indeed 2 years (though it's one year on some other Lexar digital music players).  Lastly, I was impressed that at this low price they include batteries and a pair of basic earbuds of reasonable quality.

<Title>It nullifies its best feature
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for a battery operated MP3 player that had the max storage that I could get.  Non-batteried players require a wall source to power up, which for travelers/hikers/distance people is not readily available.  Using the player with a 1 gig Jumpdrive, I had the kind of storage I needed to put a huge amount of songs in my pocket.  Unfortunately, the larger the capacity, the more its main drawback stands out.  200 to 400 songs is nice, but if you have to remember which one you played last in order to skip forward to it every time the unit is powered up . . .  much too primative for the market today.  Best for 24 hours of sea shores, rivers or rain storms, but not albums.  Otherwise, good sound, sturdy construction, and long battery life.  I really wish I could give this player 5 stars, but if you keep a pencil and notepad handy you'll enjoy using it.

<Date>Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a poor college student trying to save all avaliable money for a laptop, so I did not want to go spending much on a mp3 player.  The user guide: http://www.lexar.com/mp3/JumpGear_Quickstart.pdf  Suggests that one may drag and drop music onto their jump drive in order to add music.  Well, it doesn't work, at least not for mine.  I sent my first Jumpgear back b/c of this problem.  It just keeps freezing up.  They sent me a replacement (and btw, the only proof of purchase you need is a print out of your order history from Amazon with your name on it) and it is having basically the same problem.  I finally decided to try the alternative method for transferring music to my device (via sync on the Windows Media Player) and it seems to work just fine.  At least for now.  My only remaining complaints: 1 - The display on the lcd, when you transfer via sync, shows file names such as 06Reme->.WMA  and 05Trah->.WMA  instead of entire file names, so unless you are just good at guessing, you really don't know exactly what the song is that you are selecting to listen to. 2 - The off button is hard to fine unless you have done your research, I just let mine die through the power save for the firtst few weeks.  You can turn the device off by holding down the "play" button and waiting for the message "goodbye" to show up on the screen 3- I wish I could drag and drop!!! :'(  Pros: 1 - Does exactly what you need it to do- play music.  I will probably get a more expensive mp3 player one day, but this will definitly satisfy my craving until then 2 - Ultra Portable- More portable than an IPod.  I can easily put this thing in my pocket with room to spare. 3 - Good customer service.  I had lost my original  packaging, and receipt, but they still took my first one back and replaced it promptly. 4 - Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.  Great for the penny pinching college student.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall I'm really happy with this player. It's very inexpensive, expandable, and having the separate jumpdrive makes it extremely flexible. This player is great.   I only have two complaints about it.   1. The files you copy onto the jumpdrive aren't necessarily played in the order you expect. It turns out that the files aren't played in the usual alphabetical order. They are played in the order they were copied onto the jumpdrive. If you copy entire folders, the files aren't necessarily copied in the right order. To get around this bug I wrote a short Perl script that sorts the files and copies them in the correct order.  2. There is no really good way to bookmark stuff (yes there are bookmarks, but only per file). I listen to a lot of audio books and it would be nice to be able to set a bookmark per directory in addition to per file. I have to write down where I left off and skip to that spot the next time I listen.  While these issues are somewhat annoying, I would still buy this player if I had to do it over again. It's a great little device.

<Title>Disappointing, inexpensive device
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After using it for 3-4 hours, I think I made a mistake.  Pros: Drag-and-drop is slick and easy Dual puropse (w/the JumpDrive on my keyring) Small form factor Standard batteries (not proprietary)  Cons: Volume not loud enough (have to re-process mp3s before I load them) Earbuds are low, low quality Sound quality is marginal, even at 320Kbps w/good phones (or on my Bose system) Navigation is confusing at best, silly at worst It does not remember the last song it played - starts at the beginning of the playlist on power-up. Needs clip, pouch, lanyard, etc.   I wish I'd have paid a little/lot more for another brand of MP3 player. It's a decent stop-gap solution if you need something very economical and already have a JumpDrive Sport. It's a lousy solution, in my opinion, if it is going to be your only/primary MP3 player.

Then I started to sync the jumpdrive through Windows Media Player and I have not had a problem since.  No skipping, great music quality.  I now even put it through my car stereo with a tape (from a cd player adapter) and it sounds excellent.  For the money, its a great device!

<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a typical student and for me this is great. You can put your homework on your mp3 player and it's small and compact. Biking from place to place would be a nuisance with a bigger player, but for me, it's just right. There are some cons such as I have been having trouble getting the TITLE of the song up when the song is scrolling on certain cds I have ripped, but other than that, this is well worth its money. The earbuds aren't the greatest, but at the low price of this player *even with the memory* it's well worth buying another pair of headphones by sony *I suggest* So yep, I reccomend this!

<Content>A nice small device with a lot of features for the price, at the push of a button. The fact that the jump drive slides right in the unit is also a plus. I've experienced no problems with it and even found a holder/carrier for $9.99 which has a belt clip.   My only minor issue is that it doesn't have an optional A/C adapter, but if youre at a pc, you can just take the drive out and play it directly through the usb port on the pc to save your batteries.   Nice work Lexar.
