<Title>Loaded MP3/Video/JPEG/FM radio player 
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing can do it all, including recording video from a VCR, Camcorder, DVD player, etc.  (The video files are stored as ASF, which I believe is very similar to WMV.)  The video quality is very good and it can be played back on a TV with the standard AV inputs.  The built in speakers do a decent job, but like all MP3 players, the music sounds best through quality headphones.  The FM radio option is really nice.  Battery life is outstanding.  The unit has 512MB of memory built in.  I added a 1GB SD memory card, so all together I have 1.5GB of storage.  A 4GB SD card can be added instead, giving a total of 4.5GB!!  I really can not think of any significant negative comment.  A few minor things... the simple fact that the manufacturer is totally new to me and it did not include any protective case.  I often complain about the menus on MP3 players, but this one has a very easy to use menu system.  This device is very sturdy and will easily fit in your hand and pocket.  Despite the small size, it will handle almost anything in the audio/video area.  I would recommend the Cavalry Pocket Multimedia player to anybody interested in a unit that can record audio and video and allow them to take in on the road.

<Title>Many features, poor quality and no support
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This might be the worse device i bought. While unpacking it it looks nice and actually the plastic of the cover doesn't look that bad but that must be the only decent part of this device. User interface is kind of akward to use but the worse is that offers very limited options. As a music player lacks any choice in play modes. Screen has a very anoying flickering band across the whole screen, but is the supported video format what prevents this unit to be considered a decent video player. It only supports ASP files MPeg4 SP at 30 FPS, which provides a quality that you really could not enjoy in an screen this size and makes files reaaaallly big. A standard tv series chapter would not fit in the built in memory. Nice touch using a replaceable rechargeable battery but it would be really nice if it lasted more than two hours (for music and a bit more than one for video) or if at least it would not drain by itself without using it overnight. Screen is bright and gives a good picture except for the flickering mentioned above. It is a good concept wasted in a really poor quality device that is the one thing in my life that i really regret purchasing. BTW. Thanks to the first person who rated this for encouraging to make this mistake..:-(

<Title>Very Nice Unit and GREAT price
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product becasue of the Video In feature.  This is the only sub $200 PVR that has video in that I have seen.  First thing you notice when you power up this device is the LCD.  It is amazing.  Very bright, crisp and detailed.  Video playback looks great.  I cant believe one person gave it a 1 star review.  It sounds like either he is comparing it to a much more expensive recorder, or he does not have a clue.  This PVR can record directly from any video and audio source and records at 30fps!  The mp3 player works equally as well and I love the idea of having the flip out speakers.  The included earphones or fine, but it sounds really good when using an better quality headphone.  I also like the FM tuner which no others pvrs have.  I have a 2 gig card installed and use it as an external hard drive to bring my work files home with me.  I have not really used the audio recorder yet so I cant really comment on it.  Overall, the CAPP06 exceeds my expectations, and at only $129, its a bargain.  Just wish it came in another color besides white.

<Title>This Thing Does It All!
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The one star review must be a joke...this thing is great!  It can record TV directly to a video file at 480 resolution and 30fps!!!  It can record high quality audio (48khz) from either a line-in or its built-in microphone!  It can play videos, mp3s and never miss a beat on the gorgeous screen.  The battery life is good and the connection via USB with drag-and-drop simplicity is EXCELLENT.  I slapped a 2GB card in mine and I can watch videos all day long!     AWESOME.  BUY THIS PRODUCT AND THROW YOUR OTHER PLAYERS INTO THE GARBAGE

<Title>Poor quality. Poor user interface
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will answer the questions that i had when deciding wheder to purchase it or not. Plays video> yes... for 2 hours at the most unles you have it connected to the wall. Plays audio? Yes but the options are very limited when it comes to shuffle, no playlist, no entire folder playback, plays radio?L> yes, but only the closest radio with a lot of static. Records tv?yes, resolably good, same as audio recording (mic not too sensitive) batery life? Not even close enough to my minimum (At least 6 hours of video playback and around 12 hours audio playback)DO I RECOMMEND IT? noooooooo. (maybe for $25.) Interface is way too limited and you can't use internal and external mem at the same time. COMPONENT QUALITY IS REALLY POOR even though the plastic of the case doesn't seem that fragile. Screen is very brigh and with good resolution but flicker is really anoying. Buttons are really cheap too. I liked the speaker concept though! If it would have higher quality components and a better interface, it would be a hit...
