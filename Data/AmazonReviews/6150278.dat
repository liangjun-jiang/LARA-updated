<Title>A breeze to get started
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I'm realitively new to MP3 music, but with the software included it was very easy getting started. With in 15 - 30 mins I had music recorded on my player. A great feature of this product is that it will play WMA files also which are half the size of MP3 files which makes this player able to hold 2 hours worth of music. I am very happy with my purchase and the quality of the product.

<Title>Beautiful but Flawed - applies to the psa play 120
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This review applies to the psa play 120 which is the same as this but with twice the memory.  This little player has lovely lines and texture, is very tactile and robust. Unfortunately it is spoilt by some quality and functional issues.  Good points: Looks and feel. Sound quality is good. Has a good quality armband - but it does slip (slowly) down if you exercise wearing it on your upper arm. Has a belt clip - You can use either the clip or the armband but not both at the same time.  Bad points: If you leave the battery in the player it runs down, regardless of whether or not the player is switched on. This is really annoying - but there is a firmware fix available on the web.  The remote is difficult to operate and gets confused. I have not used it since the day of purchase.  The headphones are not suitable for the sporty purposes of the player. They are the most bizarre in the ear design that directs the sound forwards and backwards rather than into the ear- if you run with them you get inerference from wind noise. You need better headphones - Koss (s)portapros are great.  The software is not very flexible. E.g. I have not been able to get it to recognise files that it didn't record itself.  Connecting with the pc is either unreliable or complicated - i.e. when the software fails to communicate with the player, either it is doing something wrong or I am - impossible to know which. I have found a usb port that seems to work consistently now - I suspect it is my mistake rather than the software's.  If you record mixed cds (i.e. DJ mixed) the player puts small gaps between the tracks on playback.  The lock player facility is incorporated into the on off slider switch between on and off. This is crazy - its too easy to switch the player off when you are trying to lock it.   When you pause the player, it suffers from long term memory loss - after a relatively short time it forgets that you paused it and starts at the beginning when you press play.  Despite these flaws I have not tried to get it replaced, because, after all, it is quite a lovely thing.

<Title>Good player for the sports minded and inexpensive
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>The player was great for it's size and and quality I really like teh fact that it uses the samrt media cards which has the smallest size of all the memory card out there.  The software is not very functional I don't evn use it I use the MS Media 7 player which is much betther to use.  but it holds a tone of music( in WMA formatt ) and the cards makes it easy to carry a variety of music with you.

<Title>Not recommended for runners
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was initially very excited about this product. It is very light weight and ostensibly ideal for runners. It's meant to be used by athletes. However, it has broken 3 times now, all when running. When I run with it, either outside or on the treadmill, it gives of electrical shocks! The first time, the shock was so strong that the whole player shorted out and I had to send it back to be fixed - it wouldn't play anymore! This was just one week after I got it. The second time, just the headphones got damages, but they had to be replaced, because no sound came through them anymore. This last time, the shock was so bad that half of the internal memory was wiped out, and it no longer supports the external memory card. I would not recommend this player to someone who is looking for something durable and reliable.

<Title>Inexpensive, but not Incompetent
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a very very good mp3 player.  The price is it's best feature.  But I am a student, so money is more important to me than anything else.  I do know enough about mp3 players to tell you that the quality is great, and the hardware is mint!  The LCD is crystal clear, and the head phones rock.  The only thing I found disappointing was the software.  I found it primative(which is good for people not to familiar with computers).  I don't even use the software for anything except downloading the music (there are other features like skins and playing songs [something like a cheap winamp]).  <br>To summarize all this, the system is great, the software is easy to use, and in my opinion, it is a GREAT buy.<p>ps.  You can only upgrade it to 96MB, not 128MB like some websites say!

<Title>memory lapses
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>i got this because i was looking for a decent player to work out with.  because it only has 32 mb built in, i bought a 64 mb mmc.  the player worked great until i put the memory card in.  then when i tried to work it in both my computer and my parents, i was told there was no memory at all...when i brought it back to where i purchased it, they gave me a new one, and i tried a different brand of memory card-maybe that was the problem.  nope, once i formatted it, i was told once again there was no memory.  and when i tried to contact the company, i kept getting forwarded to different people, and just decided to scrap the whole thing, so i returned it all.  it was a lot more hassle than i wanted.

<Title>There is one drawbback
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The built-in 32mb with the psa(play)60 gets you about 25 minutes worth of music(not the 60 minutes that is advertised) if you have decent quality mp3s.  The sound quality is great and I have yet to hear the device skip. The only drawback is that most people do not realize that you need to download firmware from riohome.com so that you can have the choice of internal and external storage. This piece of information is not on the cd that comes with the device when you load Audio Manager. After visiting a newsgroup, I found out about the firmware and have been able to download to the 32mb MMC card I purchased for the device.  I have no complaints with the sound, just with all the grief that went into getting 45 minutes worth of music.

<Title>Theoretically good - practically bad
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Pros: mp3/wma playback, size<br>Cons: intermittent connectivity to PC, battery drain problem, loose LCD display, flimsy back cover<p>This player's specs looks nice at first: mp3 and WMA playback, 32mb upgradeable to 96mb, small size so you don't look like techno-dork, and I only paid $30 for it on Black Friday. Sound quality is good after ditching the supplied headphones and the LCD is nice.<p>But...<p>Even after the latest firmware upgrade, the battery discharges even when turned off - I'm lucky to get a few days worth out of it [only using it 1 hour/day]. <br>The back case is a bit flimsy and looks like it'll break off any day due to the constant changing of the battery. <br>Default software had problems connecting to Win98, Win2k, and WinXP - had to get the original Rioport with Nike PSA drivers...then use compatibility mode in Win2k and XP to trick it into working.<br>Default software makes it a pain to transfer songs to the unit: only exception is if ALL your MP3s have ID2 info PROPERLY entered.<br>The LCD hangs separately from the unit so it's easy to get it tangled onto anything.<p>Bottom line: not worth even the $30 I paid for it.

<Title>No Support
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I would not buy anything from RIO again. I have owned two of their MP3 players (Rio 600 and psa[play60). Both units broke within a month of purchase. As for the psa[play60 I can not get a customer service person to return my email. I have written 3 times in a two week span with no help. On their website they list the psa[play60 as a &quot;legacy&quot; product. I think they meant &quot;good luck getting these products fixed&quot;. I would recommend not buying any RIO product.

<Title>Told by Customer Service to &quot;Take it Back&quot;
<Date>Sun Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was extremely excited when I saw an MP3 player made for the runner.  I bought the item and anxiously downloaded some music to load.  However, when I plugged the player into the computer it would not recognize the hardware.  I tried everything as suggested in the owner's manual.  Finally I called customer service and was on the phone and computer with them for at least 30 minutes for two nights in a row trying to make the thing work.  I downloaded numerous software upgrades...all to no avail.<p>I was finally told by the frustrated customer service rep. to take the player back and exchange it for another model.  The service rep. blamed the problem on my machine running Windows Me.<p>Needless to say....I cannot recommend this product.

<Title>don't waste your money and time
<Date>Tue Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have never written a review before but this product is so bad that I felt obligated to save others.  I had to return the first one as it was defective and now the second one is so quirky that I can only use it less than half the time.  It drains batteries in about an hour, the handheld does not transfer songs without crashing the audio manager at least 90% of the time.  If you have hours to waste with the phone support then this is a product for you.

<Date>Mon Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've previously owned a RIO600 and broke it so I bought the psa60. I haven't seen the same problems others have stated before, although I made sure to download the software and firmware updates.

Definetly a feature to look for before you buy if you are a runner.<br>3) Yes, the software included in the package leaves a lot to be desired.  Try using the free downloadable MUSICMATCH jukebox instead.  You can download a software update from the the MUSICMATCH site that allows you to transfer songs to the player.<p>Hope this helps...

<Date>Sun Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have the model 120, but somewhat similar.  As others have noted, you cannot get the number of minutes as claimed.  However, it holds an adequate amount of music for the average workout.  The sound quality is as good as you can ask for considering you are using walkman type headphones.  The only complaint I have is that the customer service is HORRIBLE.  As a matter of fact, there is no customer service/tech support.  (I'm not kidding...)

<Title>i'm on my fourth one - AWFUL
<Date>Sun Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I'm willing to let go one or even TWO bad units, but now I'm on my fourth one and Rio/Nike can kindly go where the sun don't shine.  The pros are easy - form factor, decent design, lightweight - but the cons are MANY, and they are all known issues:<p>1.  Even with the firmware upgrade, battery life will drain down even when off and the headphones are unplugged.<br>2.  The Nike Audio Manager software is very, very buggy - feels like a .08 version beta.  The interface is clumsy, the songs don't transfer easily (sometimes just quitting), etc.<br>3.  The Windows Media plugin is only marginally better, but all of the units I've had had issues on three DIFFERENT computers all running ME or XP.<br>4.  Even though the psa is supposed to recognize MMC media, it's hit-or-miss.  Out of my four units and three different cards, on any given day a combo wouldn't work.  <br>5.  Tech support and the RMA process is ridiculous - it takes 9-10 weeks to get your replacement.  That's a whole season, and in Chicago, 9-10 weeks is all we get of good running weather.<p>Don't buy this.  Really, don't buy this.

Nike chose to re-release the psa[Play line of products with Philips, because Rio couldn't deliver a working unit.<br>I have just sent it my 2nd unit, to have it replaced, and it has been 8 weeks. All of sonicBlues phone numbers have changed, and all of their emails have changed. And when I dial their NON-toll-free support lines, no one can help me, because its a legacy product.<p>Dont waste your time. It might be a cheap unit, but you dont get your money worth. Although it will likely work for the first 3 months, it'll will be forever a pain in your thigh after that. <p>I will never buy from Diamon/Rio/SonicBlue again.

<Date>Thu Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bough two of these last winter dirt cheap for my brother and me. We both got them working with no problems, though I did have to update the firmware when I added a MMC card. My brother lost his, and bought another, and I've bought another RioSport so my husband can have the now discontinued PSAPlay 60. <p>Granted, the software is quirky, and the MMC card can slide out of place so that it's not recognized. The battery does drain and must be changed frequently. The clip mechanism is kind of flimsy.<p>However, this is a vast improvement from the last dirt-cheap MP3 player I bought (and could never get to work as promised), and it gets hard, hard use every day. I love it!

<Title>A combination of bad quality and worst customer services
<Date>Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The device I bought worked for three months, then went out of sound. Then I realized how bad the service is. First, their service phone# is not toll-free, and it's not in service any more because SonicBlue bought S3. The bad things keep going. The SonicBlue customer service phone# from their website is  not toll-free either, no one ever answer the phone. Then the only way to communicate with them is e-mail. The automatically returned e-mail never answer the correct question you ask. Finally some real-person retruned the e-mail and asked to fax the information to them. Then no further response any more.

I have never been able to get it to work with WINDOWS XP and now that I have upgraded my Windows Meida Plyer to the newest version of 9.1, it will no longer work on my office computer.  I'm stuck with songs that I have been listening to for months now.  The sound and quality of the player is good, I love the fact that it has an arm banch, but software and hardware compatability are TERRIBLE!!!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!

<Title>Worst Product EVER!
<Date>Sun May 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this thing awhile back because it was small, light, relatively inexpensive (at the time), and was moisture resistant, making for a potentially excellent workout MP3 player. I was BADLY mistaken; this product is inherently flawed. Rio repaired or replaced it no fewer than six times over a one year period; I have also personally repaired the player three additional times in the four months following. The headphones are total garbage; they broke the first time I wore them. Rio replaced them no fewer than SEVEN times. When turned off, the battery continues to be drained for some reason. Once you install a battery don't expect any more than ~24 hours of life out of it, tops, even if you don't actually turn on the player. The case is made of flimsy-feeling plastic. If you want to see track/playback info, you'll need the (clumsy) included remote control as the main unit has no LCD screen, and the remote is not lighted and has the world's smallest buttons. The player reportedly can use a CF card for memory expansion but (a) it won't use a larger-than-64MB card, and (b) card support is REALLY spotty. I've tried at least a half dozen cards and haven't found a single card that works consistently in the unit. I will never buy another Rio product again, EVER. The ONLY saving grace that this MP3 player has: When thrown against the surface of a pond, its rounded shape gave me 12 skips across the surface. My best throw yet.

<Title>BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The whole nike-phillips [SIC] thing has been discontinued, thank god.  I think this product's selling point was that they were rugged and you could sweat all over em and they still "work" (term used loosely). After returning my unit two times, I finally got a version that "worked." The saddest part of all is the fact that there is no random feature. In addition, all songs are played in the order that they were written to the device. These two *features* make the device seem cheap to me.   The device's CASE is built really well, but the electronics suck and I believe the headset is intentionally designed to break easily. It has two major weaknesses at either end of the cord and the plug protrudes about two inches out of the unit making it prone to bend and break there, not to mention weaken the soldered connectors inside the headset's port.  I have hated this product since I first bought it. I even got it at a closout price and felt I was ripped off. Ideally, it was a great idea. Realistically, it sucks very bad. Nike keeps getting worse by the minute.
