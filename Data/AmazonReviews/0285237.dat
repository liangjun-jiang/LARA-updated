<Title>WARNING- DO NOT BUY!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I would give this 0 stars if i could. Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought this item last winter and the headphone jack recently stopped working.  I sent RCA the player for a replacement.  Let me tell you that the people that work there are incompetent.  They first said that I would have to pay $69 for labor and that it would take 7-10 days for me to receive my replacement.  10 days went by and I called them back, and they said it had not yet shipped but that I should expect it shortly.  12 more days, now three weeks total, and I called them back and they told me that they had sent back the original to me because there was something wrong with the Serial number.  They said I should have received it, but I had not, and they had no idea why.  Three days later I called back and apparently what they told me before was a mistake and that they had not sent it back to me.  In addition, the mix-up was because the headphone-jack breaking was a KNOWN problem and therefore I would not have to pay the $69, but that it would take another 7-10 days.  12 days later, more than a month now, no replacement so I called back.  Apparently, its on back order, and they could not give a range for when I should get my replacement.  At this point, I no longer want to deal with this company so I ask for a refund, which takes 6-8 weeks.  I would rather wait to get the refund and buy a different product, especially since the headphone-jack was a KNOWN problem, which means it would probably happen again.  Do not waste your money on this device, you WILL regret it.

<Title>Treat it like your computer..
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my lyra for several days now, and well the first day all of the con's were there.  &lt;> slow menu change's &lt;> out of sync audio &lt;> ect... Then I had a thought, the lyra's a usb hard drive, and all of the "disk access" related issues have a easy fix....Defragment the HD.  Over a usb 1.0 connection it took me 9.5 hours to defrag it, but once that was done the menu's are more responsive, and the files load quicker.   Treat it right and it will do all it can for you.   Just don't bad mouth it if your wanting it to do more then it was designed to do, for being the size of a paperback it does a lot.

<Title>Another product built to break
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>CONS: Can't really use while walking/running(too big). Headphone jack stopped working. Most of the time it had 5 minute waiting period (frozen) for loading songs. You cannot scroll music while listening, hence going back to the menu and having to wait the five minutes again. The knobs came off so i had to select songs only by growing my fingernail long enough to reach the selector. If you still are adamant about buying this, MAKE SURE you carry around a paperclip to reset this device for its inevitable freezes. The best part is...it stopped accepting the charge from the power source. What a piece of garbage! PROS: 20 gigs/plays/records (some) video / looks nice and feels good when it is shattered with a hammer

<Title>DONT LISTEN!!!!!(and dont mind the spelling)
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cmon People!!!!!!All the geeks of 2005 reviews are idiots!!!Im not gonna say my Lyra rocks but it is good. It may be heavy and a little big but it does all kinds of things.Download all the new stuff from RCA web page and its great!! Look ignorants, If YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A LYRA JUKEBOX THEN YOU ARE A CIVILIZED PERSON. Dont drop the THING. OF COURSE IT WILL BRAKE EVENTUALLY! IS LIKE DROPPING YOUR CAR FROM THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. And this is the reason it comes with the ugly leather case. Take care of it. Youve just spent 300 dollars in somthing then you should take good care of it. So, the lyra has an awsome screen, a bunch of EQ's, perfect quality in music and excelent resulution for the pics. Just one detail, if you love listening to music more than lokking at video and pictures and dont really want to use the office documents folder where yu can keep all kinds of stuff, then get the iAudio X5 which is really great also. Another detail to geeks, if you dont like it CHANGE IT!!!!!You have like a 15 day guarentee for free. I recomend the Lyra jukebox for older people above 18. For the majority of young people, smaller things such as an ipod or and iriver are better. But I still think lyra rocks. Buy it, but be PACIENT!!!!!   Somtimes americans are so......never mind.

<Title>Save your money and get an iPod
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this a year ago thinking it was a step above the iPod because it played video and pictures.  Besides the fact that the new iPod can now do both, I was still wrong.  For one thing, this Lyra is quite bulky, making it very inconvient to bring around wherever you go, which is what I like to do.  Another thing is its much more difficult to sync to your computer.  You can use it with Windows Media Player, but whenever I tried to add even a few cds worth of music it seemed to take forever because it had to convert all of the files (even though they were alread mp3's)  Navigation is another feature that the Lyra is bested by the iPod in.  It takes so long to scroll through all the artists on the Lyra.  You just have to old the down button for what seems like hours to get to the artists in the middle of the alphabet.  Playlists are another things that the Lyra just does not do well in.  The only way I ever figured out how to make playlists was on the Lyra itself, and this took forever. Youd have to go through and select the songs you want (which as I said earlier, takes forever scrolling through the songs) and then add them to the playlist. But you can only have so many selected at a time, so it enlongated the process further.  Battery life is just not acceptable.  It seemed to last a good amount when listening to just music, but viewing pictures or videos drained it much quicker.  I'm not sure you could get through a whole movie on one charge.  The final thing was after just a year of very light use (it was too heavy to bring with me too often), it just died.  Wouldnt turn on or anything. Now lucky for me, I had bought the extended warrenty at Best Buy, and when I took it back, they gave me the new 30 GB iPod video, which as I have mentioned, enjoy and use much more often then the Lyra.  So save your money and buy an iPod instead.

<Title>Consistently unreliable hardware - best to avoid this one
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>None of our units proved durable enough to use anywhere else but at home using headphones, connected through USB to the computer, or to the TV/Stereo using the line out. After going through the reviews last year, we initially purchased a matched set of these for two teenagers for Christmas '04. The first unit was DOA out of the box - the seller replaced it, no problem. We since have had the other original unit replaced, and then the replacement replaced, due to the known headphone jack problems. This was after lengthy phone calls with RCA customer service and a lot of run around on the first replacement. Now, the replacment for the original DOA has the same headphone jack problem AND will no longer connect to external power and charge. RCA initially said they'd replace it as well, but after 3 weeks with no communication or replacement delivery from RCA, we called back and were informed that there are no replacements in the system to send. A refund was offered in December '05 with a 6-8 week turnaround. The refund was finally received in June '06 even with our frequent follow-up contact - it turned out that RCA-Thompson was holding the refund at each review tier for 6-8 weeks. This was definitely "not ready for prime time product". After the customer service experience, I would not recommend an RCA product to anyone.

<Title>Great Item!!! but.....
<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The style of the RCA RD2780 is awesome.  It can do lots of things: record tv shows and vhs and DVD movies.  copying music is fast!!!  I just have two concerns though...I just purchased this last November...so I am still learning how my Lyra works...it's just frustrating when I try to listen from one song to the other, I always need to press the Menu button or the on/off button when I choose another song.  I just recently recorded a Dvd movie, dont get me wrong, the movie was crystal clear...but...when I try to test to skip some scenes...I couldnt do it.  when i try to press the forward button, the machine goes to pause...Hope you Lyra RD2780 fans could help me out on this...I would really appreciate it!!! but over all,  I love my RCA RD2780!!!  It's cheaper than the Ipod and it can do lot's of things too for a very reasonable price, so go ahead,  buy one and you'll know  what I'm talking about. (by the way, you can also store and see photos!!!)  Hope this would help you...God Bless

<Title>Avoid this player
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seemed like a really good buy - under $200 for a 20GB A/V player,however, don't let the disk drive capacity and the recording features fool you....unless you don't intend to listen to MP3s on it.  The biggest annoyance, one that puts you off using it, is a migraine causing loud click at the start of each track. It is there no matter what volume you set the unit to.  Secondly, it takes forever (a minute or two) to start playing a track from the menu. Third...don't leave home without a pin to reset the unit every now and then.  It just would not turn on.

<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The first day I got the RCA player it broke. The warrantee doesn't cover anything, but the hard drive. Then we followed the instruction to update the item and it freezes up. We were put on hold "long distance call" for half and hour and then found out they have to replace it and they said that as to big of expense for the company. This is a pile of BS from GE and RCA!!!! It is a pile of trash.

<Title>Now it's 1 star or less
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased an RCA Lyra model 2780 in early January. This unit worked as expected for about 2 weeks before it exhibited what I found later to be a known flaw with the model, a faulty headphone jack.  I contacted RCA/Thomson to attempt to find a place to repair the unit, to be informed that it needed to be sent in to the warranty center. So I posted it to the warranty center with the specified copy of the bill-of-sale, and was informed that I would need to wait a week or more for the company to "receive" it.  Once it was received, I was then informed that it would not be repaired, it would be replaced. And that they were allowed one month to replace the unit. So I waited one month. Upon finishing that month, I was informed that the company would be paying me the cost of my unit, that this was the only option. So I re-sent in the bill-of-sale to a fax number. I was then told that it would take 6-8 weeks for them to send my refund.  Yesterday (3 weeks later), I was contacted by a supervisor and informed that I would not be receiving a refund for my defective property because it wasn't purchased from a recognized dealer of RCA Lyras. And today I am informed that I will also not be receiving my defective equipment back from RCA/Thomson.  So far, Thomson has repeatedly misled me about expectations, wasted hours of my time in dealing with a poorly-staffed and poorly-managed call center, and I'm now informed I can receive neither my property or a refund from Thomson.  Not only will I not purchase another item from RCA/Thomson, I will be letting people know through a variety of online and RL connections exactly how poorly their product is made and supported by the company.

<Title>Not Bad, Needs Work But Well Worth The $$
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>If you want this thing to work correctly, you've GOT to upgrade its fimware! The RCA site is now up with current firmware and a complete manual. I suggest that you print out the manual. Believe me, you'll refer to it much over the 1st few days as you find out what The Lyra can do.<p>I bought it on 11/19/03 and haven't looked back. It takes a while to get used to the feel of the controls and to what does what, but after a couple of days, it's almost 2nd nature. Some functions are not yet available but will come in future upgrades. I look fwd to them. They will make The Lyra really worthwhile to own. <p>I usu watch it when I have a break on the workroom floor, usu 1 hr out of 4 hrs. It fits well in my apron pocket and isn't heavy. Where ever you stop the playback, The Lyra 'timestamps' that spot so that you won't have to FFWD to that spot again. Upon your return, it asks you if you want to start where you left off or start @ the begining of the show. I might have to reset it once or twice/day, usu after entering a lot of commands in rapid order. The video is good as is the sound. I use the low rec mode and the picture is close to tv quality, which is more than fine for one person watching an hour or so @ a time. To rec, I hook it up to my DVR's tv out, set the DVR to play and the Lyra to rec for the duration of the show. The Lyra's screen shows what's being recorded. After the rec period elapses, The Lyra shuts down after saving your file. I don't like that you can't name the file, but that's supposed to be one of the firmware upgrades. It won't rec DVDs directly from your DVD players' out plug, but it will play DIVX encoded files (ie, owner purchased ripped DVD's, for your own personal use, of course).<p>As for the MP3 audio, it's close to being as good as my iRiver flash player. Nice, crisp, and loud. I work in a nosy place and can hear it just fine. Also, nice leather carrying case. On a down note, I'm not sure where they are getting the battery life info, but my LYRA gets about 3-4 hours (video)before it poops out.<p>All in all, $$ well spent!

It is easy to record videos and the quality is good considering what you are watching it on. Sound is very crisp and loud. The pictures are clear as well.

<Title>I love my Lyra ... :)
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I found the negative reviews to be extremely unhelpful. I recorded a movie from my Tivo onto the Lyra and it plays back perfectly. The sound quality was outstanding. Nice surround effect. The picture quality is fairly good but not outstanding. It's definitely good enough to give friends the wow factor.<p>Recording from Tivo allows to you to &quot;backup&quot; movies. Of course you can not &quot;backup&quot; copyrighted DVD's from a DVD player. Unless, of course you get a Macrovision- disabled DVD player off the internet. Seriously, with a Macrovision-free DVD player you can backup YOUR DVD's (that you purchased) to the Lyra and have it for long trips. I found that 40 hours is the maximum video hours alloweable when using the &quot;High quality&quot; video setting and the &quot;192 kb/s&quot; - best audo setting. The Matrix Reloaded which was 2h 30min used up 1.10 GB.<p>My computer with Windows XP,  recognized the Lyra instantly as a removable drive when plugged into USB port. Very nice. So you can just drag and drop files into the three main folders-&quot;video, photo, audio.&quot;<p>For the reviewer who said, &quot;there is no signal, unable to record.&quot; The video source, (Tivo, dvd player) must be on play or the Lyra will not recognize. If it's on pause it will not see the source.<p>However, some MPEG (not sure what MPEG format) clips I downloaded fromt the internet was not a &quot;recognized format.&quot; Supposedly the Lyra will support &quot;AVI and MPEG4-SP.&quot;<p>MP3 playback is outstanding. Excellent sound quality. And it loaded very rapidly via USB to the Lyra. I wish I had  USB 2.0 on my computer because the Lyra does support 2.0.<p>For those complaining about screen quality- you would have to purchase a laptop with a excellent video card and LARGE battery to have better screen quality. I think the picture is fine considering the size and form factor. Any better will require a heavier larger battery. Ie- buy a laptop and lug that around.<p>I love my Lyra, considering it's size and price...:)

<Title>Can Anyone compare the Apple iPod to The RCA Lyra A/V
<Date>Fri Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Disregard the stars...Sorry people this is not a review, but I didnt know how else to get peoples attention on this. I wanted to know how this compares to the Apple iPod becuase I have the 20GB iPod and I ordered this as well. I know that with this product you can watch videos and such, but as far as dependebility and study-ness how does it look? Because with the iPod there are no moving parts (except the button which you flip to lock the buttons) and that means that there is not risk of &quot;breaking&quot; the iPod (except if it accidentally hits the flor from a high enough place). SO if anyone can post a review which tackles this question I would greatl appricieate it. And again sorry for me posting it in the review section

<Date>Sat Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Yep - <br>Quick story:<br>Bought on the day after Thanksgiving.  Returned a week later.<p>Longer story:<br>Although the there are a couple good points, there are many more bad ones.<p>Good - pretty sharp screen for size, nice recording features (has straight RCA in and RCA out), on the whole nice set of accessories (although the leather case is ridiculous), lots of space (20gigs)<p>Bad - slowest OS I think i've ever seen on a portable - it will randomly say &quot;saving settings to hard drive&quot; and pause for a good 30sec - 1 min, takes around 10-20 seconds to start playing each song or movie, cumbersome controls (if you want to use it as a convenient MP3 player, you have to hold it in two hands and go through the whole interface any time you want to change a song), can't browse through songs while one is playing, can't create playlists on the unit itself, start up time to record video is variable (from 10seconds to over a minute) so if you're trying to record anything off tv, its tricky to time the starting, audio lags on recorded video after 10 to 15 minutes (loses sync - gotta love watching mouths move and the words coming out after like a poorly dubbed foreign film), leather case is bulky and pretty much impractical short of keeping it &quot;safe&quot; for storage (who wants that on their belt?!), only .avi movie files recorded with mpeg-4 video and mp3 audio codecs can be used (plus the asf format it uses to record), and finally, the most annoying thing - half of the features in the OS come up with an annoying message saying &quot;feature is not available, look for in future upgrades at www.rca.....&quot;<p>Overall - RCA rushed this out to capture the xmas market long before it should have.  While the video is relatively clean and a good step for portables in general, the negatives greatly overshadow it.  Trust me, i loved the idea of video, and if all you're looking for it that, this could (COULD) be somewhat useful, assuming you're patient enough.  However, if you have any plans of using it for music also, and don't have unlimited patience every time you want a new song, this is not the one.  I ended up taking mine back and getting a beautiful new 3rd gen iPod last night, and while there's no video - wow, every accolade apple has gotten for this is warranted (and this is coming from a very anti-apple/mac, die-hard pc guy)<p>and as a note to those who say the new firmware fixed problems, i'd just like to say that I had the newest upgrades for both the software and the lyra itself, and i still had all these issues

<Title>Delivers what it promises!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was skeptical about this product. Unlike most new products that the manufacturers scramble to release before the holidays, the Lyra A/V jukebox is bug free. Some reported bugs like freezes during fast rewind, etc. were fixed by the latest firmware. There are many fancy features that the unit does not support yet, but will support in the future. But the main features that, I'm interested in, work flawlessly. The unit can record from any video source with rca a/v out (tv, vcr, satellite receiver, etc). The unit plays back video recorded directly from an a/v source OR DivX encoded video transfered though the USB interface. The unit can also playback video on a TV. If you're planning to buy this unit, do yourself a favor and also buy a copy of DrDivx from Divx.com. DrDix can encode any DVD into DivX format directly playable by the Lyra A/V jukebox. If you travel a lot, with 35-40 movies on the palm of your hand, this gizmo is your dream come true!!!<p>Impatient, non-computer-savvy people are giving this unit a bad name. Those who don't know how to rip a dvd, or re-encode a video file to various formats, I suggest you stick to a portable dvd player. This unit is not for you. For the rest of us, this is what we've been waiting for!!! An added PDA functionality would have been nice, but I am happy with what this unit has to offer!!!

<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Don't think you are going to transfer your DVDs and then hop on an airplane to watch! The unit shuts down after giving you a warning if you attempt to copy any DVD or VHS to it.<p>The unit arrives with obsolete software. You get to spend the first hour downloading updates, installing new firmware and new drivers before the main features are operational. (The unit comes with a sheet explaining that this is necessary.)<p>Then, after installing the new software you find that many of the features will be available in a &quot;future release.&quot; The menu options are there for new features, but if you click on the menus you get a vaporware promise of the future. Don't even think of using the built-in equalizer or tone controls: touching those buttons brings up more &quot;future release&quot; messages.<p>&quot;Please wait&quot; takes on new meaning with this unit. It seems to need a 10 second pause frequently.<p>The controls are wiggly and flimsy. The buttons are randomly sprinkled along the front, ends, and top of the unit in a pattern that defies logic.<p>The menus are awkward and obscure. I never could get a movie that was playing to stop nor could I get back to any menus once a movie started. I literally had to power cycle the unit to get to the menus.<p>The unit only supports MPEG-4, so you cannot RIP movies to MPEG-2, DIVX, or AV formats and play them.<p>No, you cannot read a DVD using your PCs DVD player and save it onto the unit and play it. (Seems like that would be a basic feature of the unit.)<p>The picture quality is acceptable, although the audio quality was a dissapointment.<p>This unit is bleading edge. It really is a version 0.1 product. I am sure that with three hardware revisions and four major software releases it is the type of product that we will all take with us on trips and on the road.<p>I'd pay a fortune for a version of this that works, but the one I purchased is going back to Amazon pronto.<p>Havging waited for the unit for 6 months, this was a great dissapointment.

<Title>RCA Lyra  RD 2780 AV Jukebox leaves a lot to be desired
<Date>Tue Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The unit is fairly compact, but certainly not pocketable. The screen is reasonably nice and so is the audio along with the 20 GB HD capacity. The problems lie mainly in totally inadequate and clunky software, which has to be updated on-line right after purchase. It is very counterintuitive and extremely deficient. One cannot even perform the simple operation of zooming in and out on photos. They can only be displayed in one, fixed size.<p>Alhough it seems logical to be able to load DVD movies into the unit, that has proven to be impossible. It might be done with an MPEG4 encoder (which RCA did not see fit to include), but straight out of the box - forget it. Since the video playback feature is by far the main atraction of this gizmo, a serious oversight like this renders it practically useless.<p>It might record off a TV set, but frankly that seems like too much of a hassle to me. I would much prefer to do it through my computer's USB 2 port. In short, the Lyra is going back to the store. Hopefully units such as this, will soon be available in an improved version and for less than $400.

<Title>I love it!  But it does have problems...
<Date>Wed Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been carrying this unit on my daily 2-hour commute since buying it two weeks ago.   I record programs I want to watch on the hard drive of my DVD recorder in my absence, then copy to the lyra. Saves me the cost of recording shows I don't want to keep permanently to DVD's just for portability. Wish the timer recording feature allowed selections of smaller than 1/2 hour increments, though. The video and audio quality are plenty good for me.<p>But...  the fast-foward bug is NOT fixed.  I have to reset the unit several times daily.  It should have come with an attached reset accessory.  Plus the leather cover has to be removed to reach the reset hole - not good planning.   Also, the cover's see-through plastic over the display ripples and reflects light so it's sometimes a struggle to have a glare-free picture.<p>Battery life is not impressive -- under two hours for me so far.  <p>You can't name files using the unit directly, but you can re-name in windows explorer when attached to your PC.<p>On-line customer support is non-existant.  I've sent two inquiries -- one about buying additional accessories and the other reporting the FF bug remaining -- both replies came quickly but basically said they weren't equipped to respond. <p>The buttons are quirky - and if you don't push in the precise direction, you won't get the result you want.<p>Despite the problems, I really like this unit and will be keeping it.

<Title>The Guy who asked keep the iPod, answers his own question
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>As the title says this is from the same person who asked if it is wise to keep the iPod or trade it in for the RCA Lyra A/V. Ok first off the idea is really good: to combine both audio and video in one compact unit, every electronics persons dream, but this does not live up to it. At first it seems cool, but the more you look at the negatives the positives go away.<br>      <br>Positives are that it can play video, it can play music, has a cool interface, stores 20GB of stuff, it comes with everything you need so you dont need to spend extra money, and it can record stuff from the TV, VCR, or DVD(with the DVD you need the right "tools").<p>Negatives are that its super bulky so you cant just carry it around for fun, it cant be used as just an mp3 player becuase turning the thing off and on may damage it and it take a while for the stuff to load, the product is not complete so it cant just be used out of the box becuase you have to download some stuff, and the video quality is not good. If the video quality is what your concerned about, like I was, then dont get this product wait for the next generation ones like these to come out because it will get better.<p>All in all the product was ok, but if you want to compare it to an iPod, the iPod is the way to go...for now.

<Title>Awesome Toy...
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just recieved this RCA Lyra for my 14th birthday...llike another reviewer, when constructing a *wish list* I looked into the acclaimed IPOD and also competitive Archos MP4 player (similiar to the RCA LYRA). Probably like most of you, from reading reviews, good and bad, this item is a lot to spend your money on. I hope this review changes your mind. This incredible device strives where other competitors fall. Easily able to move files, audio, video, pictures, and word documents onto the device is amazignly simple. When looking forward to the device, I was expecting a screen lacking crystal clear picture =yet I recieved a detailed picture on a small, yet sufdficeint screen. If questiopning to buy this product I  encourage you to do so. Although not able to record live TV like the archos, this device can rtecord dvd's and vhs's as well as cd's. You can plug the device into any car to hear it through the cars internal speakers as wells as put in output into a television.

<Title>ABSOLOUTLY EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW, please read-informer
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this for Christmas from Circuit City instead of an ipod. I thought I was being unique and was a shrewd researcher. I didn't want to go with popular opinion of buying an ipod to fit in with the popular opinion. Well I was wrong, this is a difficult to use, frusterating product. THE IPOD WORKS MUCH BETTER. On the Lyra it easily loaded my jpg photos but it took a long time to view them. To rename them it took much time. Also it supposedly supports MP3 format. I mistakingly loaded music from iTunes onto it in MPA4 format which would not work, then I labored for hours converting all my music to MP3 and loaded it onto the lyra. I put in my headphones then turned up the volume but nothing would play. There is also supposed to be something on it that prevents you from recording hollywood made dvds onto it because of absurd copyright infringement, [...] The unit also has A RIDICULOUSLY SHORT BATTERY LIFE OF 4 HOURS which doesn't seem so bad until you are on a car trip or airplane flight or are just sitting in your room to listen to music for a couple of hours. It seems to die almost instantanousely. Oh yeah, I neglected to mention it is bulky and weighs down your belt and resembles a 80's cell phone. Well not quite, but it sure DOES'NT HAVE THE BEAUTY OR EASE OF USE OF AN IPOD. I returned this item to the store the day after I got it.  WHY SHOULD YOU BUY AN IPOD INSTEAD...... I recomend to you that you buy the ipod mini over the regular 20GB model of ipod because the mini has the compactness we all deserve. It holds between 90 and 100cds which for most of us takes about 5-10 years to collect. For the person that buys 1 or more cds per week or participates in music "clubs(pay for 1cd, get 120" or isn't afraid to pirate 1000 more songs please buy the 20GB or 40GB version of the ipod.

<Title>Better than iPOD & Archos - buy this!!
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got this for my son for his teenage birthday.  He wanted an ipod, but they're just so antiquated already.  He loves this machine, and all the buds are clamoring over it because he can play movies, funny TV clips, all his favorite music, and show photos.  It also can play stored movies and music onto a friend's TV or stereo, or do a slideshow from our camera's CF card.  Also comes with a tape adapter to play your music on your car's tape player. The size is still pocket-sized and not too heavy (around 12oz.).  The video screen is excellent and shows up much better than the Archos models.  Comes with nice earbuds and has great sound quality. A HUGE plus is that it comes with all the accessories you need:  case, USB cable, two audio/video in/out cables, self-contained battery, tape player adapter, etc. Has 20Gb memory, and if you go to the yahoogroups user site, you'll see that alot of techhies have upgraded their Lyras to 80Gb without much difficulty.

<Content>Yes, It is bit complicated to learn to use at first- But the time spent learning how to work it is well worth it. I wanted something I could record TV shows "on the fly" without using a computer, as well as my music files and this does it dandy! As for looks, it has a look and feel of quality- real chrome trim sets off an overall classic good looking design making it appear to be something in a far more expensive class. The price is great, and for what you get I would choose this over an Ipod any day. Connecting to my 3 computers went fine on Win98, Win ME, and Win XP Pro.

<Date>Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>2 Lyras broke at the same time. RCA support required me to send them back at my own expense for replacements promised back to me 10 days from the day RCA received them.  After 27 days from the day they received them, I decided to call for the status.  They said they were backordered with no delivery date in site.  I requested my money back.  They said the could not start a request until exactly 30 days have elapsed.  They said IF a refund was approved it would take 8 to 10 weeks to process the check. Now I'm out $280 including tax and shipping without even having the units in hand for paperweights or skeet targets. Also tech supoprt said it supports 1 gig sd cards but aftger testing many brands and sizes I found it only supports 256k cards.   DONT BUY RCA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Don't buy a Lyra AV Jukebox - it is a piece of junk
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I reviewed my Lyra on this site a year ago after buying it.  It has good functionality and was quite good at storing photos, the principal reason why I purchased it.  However, during that year, I found much not to like about this product.  It has a short battery life, only fair sound, is rather large and many of the small buttons, particularly the volume control, are hard to accurately press.  None of these problems are that bad but what is bad about the Lyra is its unreliability.  It has a flaky operating system and froze up repeatedly during the year that it worked.  At times, it would not accept a download from a compact flash card until it was reset.  One brand of compact flash card crashed the Lyra everytime I tried to use it.  When I bought a new camera with an xD card, I purchased a CF adapter to download photos to the Lyra.  Bad idea as this arrangement only worked 1 out of 10 times and on the other occasions also crashed the Lyra.  Finally, after 13 months, my Lyra developed the well-known "USB Transfer Mode" failure where it stays in transfer mode and will no longer boot.  RCA will exchange it for $100.  Forget it, I have no desire to start over again with another Lyra that is certain to give me trouble and fail prematurely.  I finaly did what I should have done originally: I bought an IPod photo and I am extremely happy with it.

<Title>Decent
<Date>Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This jukebox isn't too bad. It works as a harddrive, in fact, the storage on this device is actually a labtop hard drive. It uses music match, which isn't too bad. You can also just drag music/video/pictures onto the system. The screen is pretty nice. Pictures and video come out pretty clear, although it only plays mpeg video files.  It records from the tv also. This is a really neat feature.  What i hate about this item is the battery. I would say it lasts about 90 minutes of continuous play for music. For video, its much less. However, if you turn it on or off, it cuts down the battery time by about half. I wouldn't reccommend this simply for its battery life. Its horrible.  The menu is also slow, and can be hard to navigate. You cannot navigate through the menu while listening to music, which is highly annoying.   When recording video, the audio and video is not always synchronized. RCA def. needs to fix this.  Overall, i would not reccommend this device, not until RCA releases new firmware.

<Title>Very dissapointed...
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, the battery life was supposed to be 8 hours. After then initial charge, I was lucky if I got a complete movie out of it.  Initially, support was responsive to my problem, but I ended up waiting an additional 30 days for my replacement unit as they were on back order.  Upon receiving my replacement unit, I found the battery life to be comparably short (to the first)- this after several hours re-creating my folders and play-lists.  So I learned to live with the brief battery life, but two weeks later, the unit dies completely.  I'm sure my experience is not indicative of the typical quality for this unit, but it's been quite dissapointing nonetheless. I have heard the battery problem is not unique to my unit, so don't expect 8 hours. I do hope your unit last more than two weeks, though.

<Title>Is it me or are a lot of you just stupid?
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok well, I'm 14 Years old, and i have had my Rca Lyra Av for a few weeks (for a birthday present), and i think that everyone that has had a problem with this device is either ignorant or stupid, or both.  Yes it isn't perfect, but a lot of your problems are solved from using your head.  If you want to copy Dvds from your dvd player, and it complains about copyright protection, you need to plug it in and start recording, unplug it at 6 secs, and plug it in again at 11 secs (make sure its still recording)  Right, now some people obviously need to update the firmware, if it can't play Mpeg-1 files or anything other than .avi format video files. You can just download it at the rca site.  Yeh alright i gave it a 4 because it won't play ALL the formats i'd like, the buttons are crap and the battery isn't great either. Also, The interface is a little bit slow, and you can't navigate the menu while listening to music. Also i wish they could have included an andapter for australia, because i've had mine shipped from the states.  So, anyone thinking of getting this, i suggest this over the ipod, although if you just want it for music, go with the ipod 20gb instead (they are about the same price here) Its got a nice screen, plays video as well as music, its not too big and looks nice enough (not as nice as the ipod though)  Buy this if you want to stay resonably future proof, all my friends have ipods which will be probably left behind when the future approaches. There are going to be better devices than this, but not for this current age.

<Title>Little promise, more disappoinment
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Waited six months to get a device with more promises than hardware. I bought it mainly for the photo function and the video playing ability. Video can be played but only in Mpeg-4, not mpeg-1/2 as promised. Quality of video is okay, but that is not the point. All 3.5" screen could give you a reasonable viewing experience.<p>Accessories are rediculous. The designer of the case should, let's say, lose his job. The ear plug on the car kit does not even fit the device (it is for phones rather than headphones).<p>Basically, RCA rushed this device out without even thinking that it will ruin its reputation, if it had one.

<Title>Pretty darn good - worth it for me
<Date>Sun Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Okay, I bought this as sort of a Portable Digital Video Recorder, and so far, so good. Some of the comments by other reviewers are correct, there are some issues, but pay close attention to what they say. <p>Pros: After I downloaded the new firmware, which you have to do, I hooked it up to my TV and recorded the PSV v. RKC soccer match on Fox Sports World. Set at the medium quality, the 2 hour match (including half time) took up about 1 gig. I watched the first half on the Lyra screen and it was pretty darn good. I stopped it at around the 20 minute mark, turned the Lyra off, started it back up and the match started right where I left off - very nice.<p>Cons: When I got to half-time I tried to fast forward and the unit totally froze up. I had to shut down and then it lost the place I was in the video. Sigh. This is just basic functionality that should work. <p>I then hooked the Lyra up to my laptop and watched the match again through windows media player (Windows XP Tablet edition) and was able to 'scroll' through the video with no issue. The quality (again - medium video quality setting) of the video was great! The best part was that I was watching this from the device, I didn't have to copy it to my hard drive. <p>My main issue so far is that the OS is slow. But, for what I'm using it for that doesn't really matter. <p>A couple of other thoughts:<p>1.) I'd love to have a timer that I can set that will wake-up the device to tape something while I'm at work. <p>2.) The unit has a compact flash card slot and I have compact flash 802.11b wireless card... I'd love to be able to 'stream' content from the device across my wireless home network. <p>As I mentioned, read the comments by other reviewers closely. Don't compare this device to an MP3 player like the iPod - if you just want an MP3 player, get the iPod. If you want a multi-purpose device, this is worth the money if you don't want to wait for a future release.... <p>Finally, seems they should be able to fix all the issues with future firmware upgrades, I hope they release these with some regularity.

I dislike musicmatch because it tends to place all of the songs at the top level directory on the device while the RCA synch feature mirrors the pc hard drive - which is organized they way I like it.

<Title>Buggy, buggy, buggy
<Date>Sat Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really wanted this to work - it was the first affordable unit that had all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's so buggy that it makes the unit unusable in certain areas.<p>One of the reasons I bought the unit was to use it as a digital wallet for my digital camera. That is, I wanted to be able to take it on the road with me and dump photos off a compact flash card in order to free up space for more (I shoot 6 megapixel uncompressed photos at about 8MB each). Unfortunately, none of the three CF cards I have works in the unit (yes, they're all Type I and formatted correctly). Inserting them locks the unit up. <p>On the video side, I wanted to be able to watch the clips off my other camera (Canon S400) on the unit. Converting to mpeg 4 is a hassle, but not too bad with Virtualdub (though I can't get sound since I can't seem to be able to encode the audio into mp3). However, every time I try to watch one of my videos, the unit locks up. Interestingly, if I watch one of their sample videos first, my videos will play fine. Talk about buggy. <p>Other annoyances - the unit routinely takes 10-20 secs to do some tasks while you get a &quot;Preparing hard drive&quot; message and the UI is pretty non-intuitive, though tolerable once you get used to it (get a &quot;back&quot; button, RCA!). <p>The concept is great - if this thing did everything it's supposed to do, I would love it. Unfortunately, the execution is severely lacking - I realize it's v1.0, but I have rarely seen any released electronics product this buggy.

<Title>Very cool, but requires patience and a high GeekQ
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>As many other reviewers have stated, this device is really cool.  Essentially for the same price as the Apple iPod 20GB, you get Video, too!<p>BUT... RCA was clearly not ready to release this thing.  You have to be fairly A/V and computer saavy to fully use this thing.  First, you have to update the firmware and the software that came with the unit.  Then you have to figure out how to dump video to this sucker.  You could always encode off of the line-in, but that's too pedestrian.  Most of us want to capture video - in my case from a TV tuner card - and dump the TV show or clip to the Lyra for later viewing.<p>The problem is you can't do this with the software that comes with the unit!<p>So I went and bought a fairly inexpensive package, Roxio's VideoWave, and tried to create my shows.  Still no good, because until they update the firmware to support the widely available codecs, you *MUST* encode in AVI format such that the audio is MP3 and the video is either MPEG-4 SP (standard profile) or DivX.  I only have MPEG-4 Version 1-3 codecs on my brand new box.<p>Luckily, you can save yourself a lot of time and hassle by just going to the following site and downloading the *FREE* DivX codec:  http://www.divx.com<p>Now everything works fine, and I only spent about $50 for the additional software, which will be useful anyway for creating videos.<p>If you already have capture software, the only thing you have to watch out for is to make sure you can specify the audio compression algorithm (MP3) when creating an AVI.  Some (many?) packages simply use uncompressed PCM audio, and that won't play on the Lyra!  Besides, it will make you AVI file substantially smaller if you compress the audio.

The battery is good for 4 hours of watching video so it gives me enough time to watch a full length movie on a plane ride. And who cares about the firmware?

<Content>This will not be a comprehensive review but rather a few points I do want to enter into the fray. <p>I have a love/hate relationship with the RCA Lyra A/V Player.<p>As a tech gadget lover (but not wealthy enough to buy many of them)I think this purchase will definitely give me more than my money's worth by the time it's all through. As such, it delivers on it's main functionality- video (most of which I have recorded off my TV thru the included RCA cables), audio (a nice mp3 collection) and photos. <p>The thing I hate about it most at this moment is having to wait for new firmware releases, of which the Lyra is in need of. <p>Battery life: I've consistently gotten 4 plus hours from the device, but I was told I'd get 12 hours audio and/or 4 hours video. I have yet to come close to the 12 hours of audio. <p>Backlight: It doesn't turn on/off on the timer set like it's supposed to, ergo, I have to turn the backlight off in order for me to conserve battery, yet it still doesn't seem to conserve battery. Frustrating. <p>Even with these qualms, I still stand by the product. It serves me well and I know this product will have a bright future. It's only on firmware 0.14.10, so the software engineers have a long way to go to make it as good as it can be. I look forward to seeing it's evolution into what I desire and expect out of my gadgets.

<Content>I chose the Lyra RD2780 because it could play videos and had a color screen.  Why pay the same price for a monochrome iPod?  lol.  I haven't had any problems with playback or crashing since I update the firmware.  File transfers are easy.  Just drag and drop and that's it.  You don't need any special software besides the device drivers.  This is my second Lyra (different model) and I must say I am truly a fan of all RCA mp3 players.  The only drawbacks to this mp3 player is that it is very bulky and the screen isn't as big as it seems.  It's 3.5" (I believe), but there's two black side borders of the screen to make it seem bigger but it isn't.  Anyways the screen is a good size.

<Date>Fri Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have already exchanged my Lyra for a replacement because the first one locked up. The second one has taken 2 fatal hardware crashes. Functionality wise the rocker buttons are the worst. I never know what event if any will be processed and it takes forever for the event to be processed. The next issue is the shuffle all functionality is poor. With over 2000 files I should never hear the same song very often. However, the first song played each session is always the same and the same song repeat between sessions. I have heard the same song 3 and 4 times a week. My guess is this file number is used as the seed to the random file number generator, therefore the probability of generating the same file number increases dramatically. I should also be able to shuffle all songs for a specific Genre.

<Date>Sun Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found this product in the Sharper Image Catologe and thought I had to have it. It records movies, TV shows, music, etc. But I was perplex as to how the video from a show or movie is transfered to the player. I was assuming the A/V cords, like the ones you set up a videogame system or DVD player to the TV with. If that is then I was definetily going to get it, but I was confused by the reviws above. If anyone knows how video is transfered, please leave a review telling how. I'm going to be checking back to this page as much as possible.Thanks.

<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hey im only 14 and wow i just got it for my birthday and it is one of the best products ever.I read this review baord for about one week before i biught it. Let me tell you if you have any doubts forget them because i was thinking th same thing then when i got it it proved me worng. This product delivers everything it says and my friend has a ipod and this is supier to its sound. If ur worried about not being able to record dvds dont worry, you can! Just read the other reviews and they will help you greatly. The screen quilty is very sharp and clear and playback looks great on it. Be sure to get the firmware upgrade and trust me its not that hard to figure this thing out, come onim only 14 so you should be able to do.Well good luck and have fun.

<Title>Why RCA jukebox/Video Player is Amazing
<Date>Mon Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well the ipod is a popular item(featured in 50cents music video P.I.M.P)and the Sony Digital Walkman is featured on a commercial with Macy Grey singing "Walk this Way",Aerosmith's best song the RCA 20GB jukebox is much better. It is a lot better, has 5X the GB of ipod mini, you can watch movies on it(3.5in color flat screen)and import your dvds onto it(holds 80hrs worth of video):unfortunately you have to record the movies onto it from your DVD player and not your computer. I suprised myself be finding such a superior product. It may be a little more difficult to import songs from iTunes but includes 2.0cable for imports of the same speed as both Sony and Apple. It costs the same as the 20GB models of the Sony and Apple but again YOU CAN WATCH MOVIES ON A FULL COLOR HIGH QUALITY FLATSCREEN. IT HAS LESS MEMORY THAN IPOD PHOTO BUT CAN DO MANY OF THE SAME THINGS FOR HUNDREDS LESS($279+tax at Circuit City vs. Ipod Photo which I'd estimate at $400) PLEASE BUY THIS SUPERIOR PRODUUCT,BE COOL,START A NEW TREND.

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
<Date>Mon Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So I bought this lyra thinking it looked pretty cool in comparison to the IPOD, and not too expensive at the same time...but after it broke...5 times...and i had to send it all the way back to the company only for them to re-send me another model which would break within a time period of 30 days, I decided that maybe I should stick with an IPOD or ANY other mp3 player...DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH SENDING IT BACK TO THE COMPANY EVERY OTHER MONTH!!!

<Title>Great Gadget
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:  Amazing amount of space.  I have audiobooks, video television programs, and music on mine right now.    Software is easy to use.  I actually had an earlier version of the jukebox program that I got with my first MP3 player (gathering dust somewhere. It had 16 meg of memory!) And if you use this program to digitalize audio tapes you need to be aware if you install the new version that they have made this feature available only on the upgraded version that you have to purchase separately.   The other software is great.  Screen is small but clear.  Cons:  I don't like the front controls. They are like cheap video game controls and feel "mushy".   This is well worth the purchase price though!

<Content>ok you might have some doubts about this product form soem of the other reviews but trust me this product is great as long as you update the software when you get it. ok this picture is just amazing, the sound for your songs is also very nice, not quite as good as an ipo but an ipod doesnt have video. it is soo easy to record video you plug it in turn on the dvd and press record an thats it, if it a copyrigted dvd here is a tip when you first start recording unplug the wires, the systemw ill check to see if it is copurigted and it wont find anything after about 10 seconds plug it back in and the system wont know the difference, you can put so much on this little  thing i am so glad i bought it

<Title>Not Ready Yet
<Date>Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Overall impression after several days of use is that I am just disapointed. The hardware makes your drop your jaw in amazement but once you start using it the sodtware makes you scratch your head inc confusion on why this was released. <p>About 80% of it advertised functions do not work yet because the software doesn't exist on it yet. WHen attempting to enter or view functions that aren't available yet you are prompted with the message &quot;Feature will be available in furture firmware upgardes&quot;. You will get that message MANY times as you try to use the device. Also be prepared to Wait. That's right, I've seen some shorter load times on my playstation one. IT waits to save configuration information and it wait about 30sec to a minute to start playing an MP3 even when just moving to the next song. <p>Video playback is a joke. Expect not to be able to play any of the videos you have on your computer as it will only play very specific video codecs. <p>The batterly life is the BIGGEST draw back of the entire device. I have yet to have it last longer than 3 hours doing anything from only audio to watching video the whole time. This again is partially due to the software since the screen will be 100% on and bright during all function time unless you turn the backlight to off all the time in which you will have trouble seeing the screen. Expect to carry a charger around with it 24/7 or risk it going powerless extremely fast. It has never last a till I get home form work yet from the just over an hour commute each direction. <p>Dispite all this bashing this device has GREAT potential. have about 6 more months of software upgrades it might actually be usable the all of a sudden worth is with better batterly life and functions that actually function.

<Title>Ahhhh RELIEF(spelling doesnt matter)
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I finally figured it out after 2 long days. Ok what you gotta do is go onto the www.divx.com and get the 15 day free trial for doctor divx. Then you just download an avi file then use the three simple steps of doctor divx to encode it in Mpeg4 format and you can easily just zip it over to your lyra. I already have about ten of ym favorite shows on it and some of them came pre encoded. Also if your like me you were confused with the recording thing. Just hook the end of that wire with the audio video at the end into the line in of your lyra. Them hook the audio video parts inot a dvd player ( has to be a free DVD player you will see the details in the older reviews)or VCR. then you simply press record pick your time and then the picture shows up on your little screen and it records. Only problem is the copyrighted stuff which you can easily get passed with a free DVD player which I have seen cheapest around $139 (yes I know It sucks). It really is amazing that this amazon review board has been more helpful to me than that cr**py RCA site of frustration.

<Title>What's the problem?
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've got to say that after reading all the reviews listed here I was quite worried about how the Lyra A/V I had ordered would perform.  After three months I finally got it and I am very relieved.  I promptly installed the updates available on the RCA website and everything functions as it should.  There have been a lot of complaints about some of the functions not being available yet but that's no big deal, I'd rather have a functioning MP3/MPEG-4 player now and get the non-essential functions later.  Also, if you can't make the Lyra A/V work right all I can say is you must not know how to use it, try reading the instruction manual, you can also download that at RCA's website.

<Title>Lyra is a good looking piece of Junk
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Lyra is a great concept.  Storing vidio, audio, and pictures display.  The reality is that the product is not fully functional.  So don't expect to have the features that will make it useable.  You will constantly see &quot;this feature will be availabe in a future release&quot;.  The user interface is clunky and there are a number of file formats that are not useable.  If you try to contact Thomson (RCA) to find out when updates will be available they will tell you nothing.  It can only be surmised that the promised updates will never be available.  <p>When you install the basic operating software expect to be pushed marketing information.  Buy this subscription, this software upgrade, and on and on.  This product is a nice looking incomplete marketing night mare.<p>Save your money

<Title>Poorest piece of junk on the market
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had a Hango Personal Jukebox (10GB) for a number of years. An AV device seemed like the way to go for an upgrade. <p>Don't buy a Lyra. <p>The controls are difficult to use and too sensitive. Joystick style controls??? I test and review hardware/software for a living and anyone that tries to shove a joystick style control on a network device is immediately slapped for being CHEAP and stupid. The menu navigation is poorly contrived and missing most of the useful features (smart tags, playlists, etc...). <p>And God forbid you try to &quot;stop&quot; an audio playback. You can't. You have to exit by manipulating a tiny button on the side of the device. I have long finger nails and it's nearly impossible to use the &quot;menu&quot;, &quot;on/off&quot; and &quot;record&quot; buttons. <p>The crappy leather case makes it even more difficult to control. <p>From a performance standpoint, it will only accept 128kbps MP3s so if you've already got a collection you may need to rip it again. It does NOT do buffering of any kind (which the Hango PJB has done from DAY ONE) so if you try to move from one song to another (good luck - this in and of itself is a pain) you have at least a 5-10 second wait while the device finds the next song and begins buffering it.  It definitely appears to be an embedded windows device - slow, slow and slower. Trying to use it in the car today was so painful I'm ready to have my husband take it back and throw it at whoever sold it to him. <p>It is poorly designed physically and ill-conceived of in terms of functionality and usability. <p>In short, it's a piece of crap that isn't worth much more than a paperweight. <p>It is NOT worth the asking price.  <p>Buy an Archos if you want AV or a PJB from Hango if you want MP3 playback that's USABLE.

<Title>The gadget to get...
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am fully aware that this product is still in development software wise, but the functionality out of the box, the price, weight, form are the qualities that swayed me from the ARchos. Out of the box, the basic functions of listening to MP3s, watching DIVx movies, and storing my photos are all there. When all the promised upgrades are implemented, this will be one hell of a Personal AV player.<p>In size, quality and form, it beats the Archos. Where the ARchos seemed like a toy, the Lyra seemed more elegant. It is 50% textured plastic and 50% aluminum which makes it sturdy. <p>I have successfully made a lot of DIVx movies for the Lyra using Intervideo DVDCopy. They all played without glitches but I am sometimes annoyed by the blockiness in dark or black scenes. I am sure this will be fixed by firmware/software upgrades soon. MP3 playes just beautifully.<p>I really like how it feels in my hands, not too small to easily lose, not too big to warrant leaving it at home like the Archos. It is also cheaper than competition. <p>Overall, I am satisfied. All the accessories included are way useful for me. For the Archos, you have to buy everything extra. For the Lyra it all came with the package which is thoughtful.

<Content>The first RCA LYRA portable to incorporate video playback, the palm-sized 20GB RD2780 RCA LYRA Audio/Video Jukebox delivers a complete digital entertainment experience in the palm of the hand. About the size of a small picture frame with a 3.5-inch Thin Film Transistor (TFT) LCD screen, the RCA LYRA Audio Video Jukebox also acts as a computer storage device, compatible with multiple audio and video codecs, and can be easily connected to most standard television sets. Measuring a compact 5.2 x 3.14 x 0.98 inches, the versatile RD2780 can play mp3, mp3PRO and Windows Media Audio files. <p>"Adding video functionality to the digital audio product line is a natural progression for us as we continually seek ways to expand our consumer base and add value," said Redmond. "The RCA LYRA Audio/Video Jukebox is designed to go beyond the digital enthusiast audience and attract both young consumers and frequent travelers looking for an easily portable entertainment source that will deliver hours of entertainment."<p>Consumers can watch up to 80 hours of pre-recorded television shows, feature films, or home videos directly on the RD2780. It easily connects to a television set via its composite video output and includes both audio and video recording mode. Since the device is essentially a computer peripheral with a hard drive, the display screen can also be used to organize digital audio song files or other types of stored data, including computer files such as word processing documents and presentations. The RCA LYRA Audio/Video Jukebox is also a portable photo album, since JPEG images can be viewed on the RD2780, by either transferring them directly from the PC using a USB 2.0 high-speed connection or by inserting a Compact Flash memory card. The vast hard drive in the RCA LYRA Audio/Video Jukebox can accommodate up to 100,000 JPEG images.<p>Using the enclosed MusicMatch management software, users can also organize hundreds of hours of mp3 audio files using ID3 tag song data to display artist, album, song title and genre. Music fans can listen to their collection of mp3 files using one of nine playback modes, including normal play, shuffle and repeat, or by programming their own playlists. While listening to music files, the user can also navigate through the library and "tag" songs he or she would like to hear later, or delete from the device.<p>Other convenience features include auto resume, which "remembers" the track location and volume setting when the power was shut off, and returns to that same spot when the power is returned. Adding to the overall value of the RD2780 are the included AC/DC adapter, e.clipzclip-style stereo headphones, an audio/video patch cable, carrying pouch and recharge cradle. The RD2780's car kit provides hours of audio entertainment through a cassette adapter. The RD2760 can play for up to 15 hours with its Lithium Ion rechargeable battery

<Title>Compare it against the archos AV series
<Date>Sun Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>ok, so people wonder how the below reviewers know so much about this product. one, research on the internet. two, some people go to trade shows where the company demos the product before it's released. and three, there is more info up on the thompson website about this product. thompson is the rca brand in europe and other areas of the world.<p>now to compare against the archos av series, this product's major competitor. i bought one of these and returned it. the main reason i returned it was the mp3 interface/features were lacking. i hated to have to create playlists and open folders to play a song. i like my creative labs jukebox zen better for those features. another reason i didn't like it was because of the little joystick navigation. the button on the rca unit looks better. AND why archos doesn't include any (even if it was simple) carrying case is a MAJOR disappointment when you are spending over $500 for a player. on the good side, the screen was nice and the audio quality was ok. but i then found out about the rca unit and returned the archos immediately. plus the rca unit is about $150 cheaper. if you HAVE to have the capability to plug in a (not yet available) digital camera/camcorder attachment, then buy the archos.<p>why i like the rca unit better? size (thinner, but wider), no flimsy joystick that can get caught in my backpack (specially without a case), integrated compact flash for downloading my digital film, and yes it has a carry case.<p>i've had my rca unit preordered for months an can't wait to get it! P.S. I gave it only 4 stars because I don't have one in my hands yet.

<Title>it is a revolutionary design
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>think of thing thing this way, put a TiVo, a ipod, microsoft software and a jumbo hard drive all in one you my friend would get this player. the player it self can only be copared to the archos AV. line and even that doesn't compare the archos play av 120 and 140 have a much smaller screen, a littler battery life and you have to pay an extra 50 bucks to get the DVR(Digital video recorder). Then there is the AV 320,340 and 380 which still dont even come close to the brilliantnce of the Lycra why you ask I'll tell you the archos newest modle is 200 dollars more thats not including tax then it would be 210 dollars cheaper. But the things the two archos devices don't do are play WMAs wich are the mp3s for windows media player that comes with any computer (not including Apple computers) and more than half of my songs are WMA files and one more thing archos can't do its called powerpoint, microsoft word, and spreadsheets.    I first thought no one and I mean no one could match the features that archos offered I was right rca didn't match the features they added more and made a better device than archos and on thier first try archos has been at this for three years! I cant wait to see the player in action and I will probly do this before chrismas.

<Title>A device that is revolutionary
<Date>Mon Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This might be thoght as a imation of the archos products that have been out for years but its not, think of a Ipod, a TiVo, and microsoft word, powerpoint and spreadsheet all in one. The reason thing is thought to be different not be having less features but better by having more features. I have been studying the different players for months  and thing player is truely top of the line. <p>The things better about thing new lycra are that its battery life is longer for bolth video and audio. Plus the audio of the archos is only mp3 there is no WMA which stands for windows media audio which is one of the major types of music files. Then there is the price the price of the lycra is only 400 dollars and most of the 20 gb mp3 players are 400 dollars (the archos av320 is 100 dollars more!!) and if you can get video files too for free thats just icing of the digital cake, yeah that sounds kind of lame but trust me I know my stuff.<p>I will have the player by the end of nov and I cant wait to see it in person.<p>Ps. Please take my advise when I say that the world of mp3 players dont get much more advased than this.

<Title>Archos Av300 is a better product
<Date>Mon Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have owned the Archos AV340 for about 4 months. Today I purchased the RCA lyra 2780. I got it as a gift for my girlfriend. I did not want to get  the Archos for her because I  read how the RCA would support more audio formats and More video codecs. For the past five hours I have been playing around with the Lyra. I have tried out every function and feel I have a good feel for what it does and doesn't do. I read some of the early reviews for both products. The lyra just came out this weekend 11/16/03, so I am not sure what some of these people were reviewing. Any one who gets their hand on both and think the Lyra is a superior product must work for RCA. I don't want anybody to take my word for it, before buying either one, go out and test  both product. Do a side by side comparison of video quality, sound ( please bring your own headphones, the RCA ones are good, but the ones  Archos provides SUCK) Compare the operating system and play with the controls to really get a feel for each product. After doing this myself I am almost convinced I will be returning the Lyra. THE ARCHOS IS HANDS DOWN A BEETER PRODUCT. The lyra is suppose to support more video formats codecs, but so far its seems to have problems playing most of the video files I have tested on it. The archos only pays DIVX files in simple format. Basically unless its encoded that way you have to convert the files using a program called virtual dub. The latest version is much easier to use than when I owned the Archos AV20. Please don't buy the Av20 you will be very frustrated using it. The lyra does support more Audio formats but Archos claims they will offer Firmware upgrades that will support more audio formats. The lyra main screen looks much better than the Archos but that seems to be the only thing better about the interface. The archos is easier to understand and works better. The controls for the lyra are scattered and feel so flimsy I don't think it will stand up to everyday use. Video quality on the Archos is much, much better. Even the demo video that comes with the Lyra is painful to look at. I tested video file downloaded from the web and recorded a video tape. The Archos is near DVD quality, the Lyra is near VHS. You see a lot of pixilation on the Lyra. The archos screen is better and can be viewed from more angles. The difference is very obvious.  With the lyra you don't need a separate module to record video. Both products have almost the same plastic feel, the archos feels studier. The lyra comes with more goodies out of the box. (a nice case that allows acces to all the scattered controls) a car adapter and all the cables you need. The Archos comes with the video recorder module and cheap headphones and all the video and audio cables you need. The archos will eventually do much more when the Camera module is finally released. I have called archos several times to try to get a release date for the AV cam and so far every date they have given me has come and gone. Archos is not very good a keeping its own announced release dates. Please note you must update the lyra  from RCA website to use some of the features. The Archos firmware must also be updated but you can use almost all of its features out of the box. I had great expectations for the lyra and I am very disappointed. I will continue to play with it for a while. The Archos is a MUCH, MUCH better products.<br>Nov 19th<br>OK, I've had this for about five days and I am returning it this weekend. To many problems and a lack of out of the box functionality. Its frozen on me several times and I had to reset it. The reset fuction does not seem to work the way its suppose to. Worse of all YOU CAN'T RECORD COPY PROTECTED DVD'S. I've recorded a few DVD's I OWN!!! to take with me on trips with the Archos av340 and they always look great, If archos had their act together they would rule the PVP market. The Av300 camera just came out today, months late, when I've recieve it??, I will post a review. I am still trying to decide if I will get the Archos for my girl. <br>NOTE TO THE PEOPLE AT ARCHOS: LETS GET OUR ACT TOGETHER.

<Product Name>RCA RD2780 20GB Lyra Personal Digital Multi-Media Player
<Title>Pretty nice

<Content>I managed to snag a couple of these from a national chain store and it is pretty good.  The LCD is fairly bright and crisp and the build quality is pretty good.  Recording is a fairly straightforward task also and file organization is intuitive (although it may be problematic when you have a lot of files)<p>Also, there are some available on auction sites if you need one NOW!

<Product Name>RCA RD2780 20GB Lyra Personal Digital Multi-Media Player
<Title>Great Idea. Poor Result. A "Video MP3" Player that Wouldn't
<Date>Tue Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Imagine buying a MP3 player that will not allow you to record/playback copyrighted material.  Well that is exactly what RCA has released- a "video MP3" player that will not allow you to record any copyrighted material.  I thought it would be great to record some of my DVD's to this device so that I could watch them on the road just like I listen to my CD's on the road with an MP3 player but witout that capability the Lyra is useless to me and I imagine most other people.  I did however record some shows off of the TV as a test and the results were very acceptable although the picture would freeze on occasion.  Also the user interface is very clunky.  I am sure other manufacturers will improve on this idea in the near future.
