<Title>Who is Visual Land?
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You should ask your self this question before you think about buying this Item. WHO is this Visual Land company? This item worked wonderful until the 5th day. It did not work unless it was plugged in the wall. That could be the reason they give---as they say a free wall charger.  I emailed there co. and got a sorry but they left out the return confirmation number.  Caution do no buy from this company no matter how attractive the price.  Pay more money and buy from a name we all know is reputable.
