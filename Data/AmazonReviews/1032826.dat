<Title>Buy a Sandisk Sansa M240 instead
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>File transfer rate is at least FIVE TIMES SLOWER than equivalently-priced Sansa M240. MuVo v100 is Full-speed (actually USB 1.1) not Hi-speed (true USB 2.0). At Creative's site there are three pages of customer complaints about the MuVo v100 slow file transfer rate. No fix is currently available, though Creative customer service sends customers on a firmware-download wild goose chase and neglects to mention that the snail-like transfer rate is a well-documented problem. Also, the player's wheel, which needs to be turned and pushed, is an annoying gimmick. Finally, sound for playing audio books is indifferent. Stick to Sansa, the only problem with which, if you lose your place in an audio book, is a slow fast forward.

<Title>Good value and easy to use
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 as an upgrade to the previous Creative player I received as a gift a few years ago. I love the fact that you can connect to the computer via USB and add songs by the drag and drop method. However, the software that the player comes with is very user friendly. Of course this makes moving music much faster.  The player menu is setup in an intuitive manner and the buttons on the unit are well placed.

<Title>RECOMEND
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The guy below that says file transfer is slow must be using a PC with out a USB drive. I plug the unit directly into my usb port on the front of my pc and just drag and drop...simple. no cables. the actual unit plugs in to the pc. as far a loudness, just fine. When I have it on in the gym I dont here the gyms music in the back...  for 42 bucks you cant go wrong ,,  . i have had it about 5 mos now and except for a few times shutting off overall it is still kicking.

<Title>better than Ipod 
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have an IPOD Nano and this thing is so much better. I paid 200 for the IPOD and 30 for this. First, no DRM. You can drag and drop MP3 files and folders directly to the player. The user interface and buttons are much more usable than the IPOD. TO use the Ipod you need to look at the screen. I can keep this player in my pocket, change songs, change volume, without looking at the screen.   The battery life is about 20 hours if you turn off the back light, which isn't really necessary. I love not having to charge it. I am the type of person who turns "wireless" off on my cell phone so I don't have to charge it. And really, I may go through 2 batters a month at about 75c a battery.   The sound is not going to be the same as my expensive stereo headphones playing CD's, but it is not bad. The transfer speed is slower than another flash drive of mine, but definately reasonable. It's smaller than I thought and the design of not having another cable to connect it to the computer is great.   It's made to play music, that it does well. I that for the price, you can't go wrong.   ***** UPDATE 2 MONTHS LATER *****  This worked great when I got it. Being able to drag and drop files from Linux was nice. Running forever on a AAA battery was great. No charging needed. Internal USB  connection also nice.   However, after 2 months I started getting file system errors. Files would disappear or become corrupted. Following advice of Creative support, I attempted to upgrade the firmware. The unit bricked.   I have sent it back to be replaced... but with only a 90 day warranty if this had happened next month, I'd been out of luck.   I would still give it 2 stars because while it worked, it was great, and it's cheap enough to buy more than one.

<Title>Best Little MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always thought that I would buy one of Apple's MP3 players, but after spending some (poor) quality time with the horrible iTunes software, I was soon cured of that fantasy.  The moral of that story is - if you don't like iTunes, don't waste your money on an iPod.  I really just wanted an MP3 player to "drag and drop" my MP3 files onto and the Creative Muvo V100 was just the ticket!    Just copy the folders & files that you want to load to the player into a temporary directory on your PC, run an ID3 tag editor to strip off the ID3 information and load everything into the player.  The player is forced to display all of your folders and files just the way you named them.  Audio quality is great (just get some good "in ear" headphones).  Controlling the player takes some getting used to, but otherwise the player is great!  Battery life is good, but one caution - if you let the battery run completely out, the player's firmware will become corrupted about 10% of the time.  When it happened to me the first time, I couldn't get the PC to recognize the device at all.  A quick "fix player" download from the Creative web site fixed that in short order.  Now that the price has dropped to $22.00, I'm going to buy two more!

<Title>Quality product at a great price!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been putting off buying an MP3 player and when I finally decided to do it, I knew I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  After doing some research I found the reviews for this product to be very helpful in making the decision to buy.  I love this MP3 player and feel it's a great deal especially now that the price has dropped (I paid $43 but still think I got a good deal). It's just what I need to block out the distractions in a cubicle work environment.  The only problem I had was downloading the software to Windows Vista.  I took care of that by downloading the software instead to Windows Media v11 instead.  It's very easy to transfer songs from CD to the player and have only just begun to fill the memory.  This product will more than meet my needs.  If you're looking for an affordable and quality product, look no further!

<Content>I love my muvo. I will never fill the 1 GB space, that's almost 500 songs. Its very easy to use, great sound quality with the included ear buds. You don't have to install the provided software even, you can just drag and drop you mp3s as though it were a flash drive. Its small and light weight, great to drop in a pocket while I go running.. I'm very satisfied with this product, good buy for the price.

<Title>Worst customer service EVER
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After about 6 months of daily use, my MuVo v100 stopped working because I accidently let it run until the battery ran out (don't do that). I needed to run the recovery mode program but the serial number sticker had come off a while ago (I hold it in the hand while on my runs, the sweat had made the sticker come off) Anyway, after going around and around for days with customer service, their solution was to buy a new unit! Mind you, there isn't anything wrong with mine except it needs to be formatted, it's frozen in recovery mode. Because the sticker had fallen off, they treated me like a leper. So my advice is to not let the battery run out while the player is on, save your reciept and save the serial number

<Title>Love it
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted something simple.  This is what you get with this Creative MuVoV100.  Some bells and Wistles, but not stuff that you don't need if you don't want it.  Now out of the box, it tells you that you "must" load in the software CD that they give you with it.  No you don't!!!  Basicly it is a removeable mass storage device.  I put the usb thing in my usb port, waited a few seconds, and the window came up for me to drag and drop my music from my file.  That was that.  Now if you want to register your product and all that, then by all means, load the software CD.    Everything is all in one!!  the unit, the usb connector, and the spot where you put the 1 AAA battery. It has 3 or more folders where you can store your music or even if you want to use one of the folders for documents or pictures, you can do that.  It has a equalizer that has pre-sets and also has a bass boost setting.  Now it also has a thing for lyirics.  I have not used that.  I don't know why you would need to have the lyirics scrolling at the bottom, but if you do, I guess it can do that too, I hve not used that.  I  have found that the battery life is pretty good too.  I like it, it is simple and to the point for us old people "43-45 set".  Oh, yes, it has has a set of ear phones with it too.  I have not tried them.  I can only imagine that they are not so great.  But then again I am very picky about how my music sounds so I can't comment on the head phones.  I paid around $30 for them and I am completely satisfied!!!

<Title>No more Creative products for me!
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my wife a Creative Zen Nano Plus 1g MP3 so she could down-load from books on cd. It died early, but not early enough to be within warranty. Like a fool, I bought another Creative MP3, but this time a 2g MUVO V100. It died in less than five months, and again, after warranty. They will analyze the problem for $35.00, and I pay shipping (probably both ways) and I pay for parts, if needed. Do a Google search for Creative MP3 and you will see what they are all about.

<Title>Good, and alittle bad (Read it).
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's got increased capacity over my previous Creative player. It's also slightly larger, but that is fine, it's still very small and handy in my pocket.  It has the same control scheme, so it's useful for people like me who had another of the Creative line of products before. There's less worry about having to learn new functions.  Afew annoyances and observances follow:  #1 - Because the case separates (for USB connectivity), it ends up being alittle flimsy feeling. It hasn't come apart but I have a feeling it could.  #2 - Very flimsy battery door. Same design as my previous player. If you get a creative player and the door slides like this one, you'll probably end up having to use tape to keep it on after awhile. Not really a problem that prevents me from buying it, just something to keep in mind.  #3 - No FM tuner. It's not "vital", but I think it's a fair request to see an FM tuner in a player nowadays. There is NO reason not to include one.  #4 - There are subdirectories now, which can be abit of a hassle to work with, so I just drop my music into the root. I would prefer a "playlist" option, rather than little folders to organize music in. I suppose it's the same thing, but I've gotten used to playlists. I'm sure others have as well.  #5 - Uses a conventional replaceable AA battery. I love this feature in a player. Not just that the battery is conventional, but that there is an easy and effective way to get another. Alot of players out there have a built-in battery that you can't easily replace. This is a huge let-down for me. I'm pleased that the MuVo lets me expand the life of it by giving me a replaceable battery.  All in all, it's been a good player so far, use it daily, and it has decent sound quality and a useable capacity. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to accept the bad with the good. There really isn't much bad, it's a fine player.

<Title>Exceeded my expectations.
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This low-cost MP3 player has many features I liked, and one I did not. The player is unusual in that it consists of two parts, the "player part" and the "battery part". The two parts must be connected for normal mobile use. The separated player part plugs directly into a USB jack for drag-and-drop MP3 loading and doubles as a normal jump drive. The two flat buttons on the edge are volume up and down, the rounded fancy button does everything else except on/off and works just fine. There are several "default folders" which you can load and then play just the tunes in one folder, and the manual suggests a 3-level folder hierarchy is possible, I have not checked that. [ The user manual can be downloaded on line and is "reasonable". Menu item "skip folder" means "select folder".] The display has good resolution and scrolls too-long tune names horizontally. It has a backlight that stays on after any button press for an amount of time you determine as a setting (there are very many settings). The AAA battery life is claimed at 18 hours and may be long due to the fact that this player seems to use a "slow" FLASH chip that does not support the fast USB 2.0 (480 Mbps) download rate. It loads at the USB 1.0 rate (12 Mbps, aka the USB 2.0 slow rate) which is in effect about 1 MB/sec. So a complete reload of 1 GB might take 15 minutes. If you are a very frequent full reloader, this player may not be for you. I had a special interest in this product because its "player part" can be powered by 1.5 volts applied to the power pins of its USB connector (which normally uses 5 volts). See my Amazon review of the $3 "JWIN JAC32 Dual Voltage Egg Power Universal AC Adapter" for hints on making a 1.5 volt regulated AC adapter (battery replacement) for this MP3 player. Inquire rimrock at xmission com for more info. This Muvo was $33 with free shipping, today (12/2/07) it is $35 without, tomorrow who knows. It also includes a voice recorder function which I have never tried.

<Content>I love it. It's the second one I've had...lost the first one and then found it after I bought this one. I'm pretty much a novice, but I think the sound is terrific, altho' the earphones aren't very comfortable. They're too big for my ears; when I hold them close the sound is really great. I bought some Sony ear"pods", real small, but the sound was garbage with them so I took them back. All in all, for the price, it's a really good buy and I'm happy with both of my MP3's!

<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My family and I have used various Muvo models for audio downloads -- from Audible and from public libraries.  Unlike some brands which are set up to play short, song files, the Muvo is pretty good about "fast forwarding and rewinding" through long files. I particularly like the fact that the built in USB prong means no additional cable is needed to hook up to a computer.

The only downfall to this is that when I downloaded everything in order the way I wanted it, it was randomly scattered in the mp3. So one minute I could be listening to the Stones and then the next song I could be listening to techno. Oh well, for the price I paid it serves the purpose.

<Content>I just bought this item about a month ago and it works great with Linux. I had used a SanDisk MP3 player but the SanDisk player will not play MP3 files encoded over 128K. This player has no problem. I also like the fact that I don't need an external cable to connect to a PC like the SanDisk with USB. Only drawback is the transfer rate with the V100 is slower then with the SanDisk but this is not a problem for me.

<Content>I purchased the Creative nano 1GB at Christmas and was impressed with performance and accesories that were included for the price. I then purchased the muvo v100 which is almost identical to the nano but a little larger and has a direct USB plug-in. For essentially the same price, I did not get any accesories(a armband,skin, or belt clip) I had to purchase an armband from Creative for about what the player cost, because was not availiable anywhere else. Creative also charged my card wrong for the armband. So use caution when dealing with this

<Content>This product works as it's supposed to. It's pretty easy to use and doesn't necessarily require software. However, the software makes it easier to rip music from audio CDs and put it in your player plus it's easier to manage your music with the software. Despite what some people may say, I found the display icons very easy to understand and have no trouble whatsoever operating my player. I do wish it would come with a belt clip though...

<Content>I actually bought this with a company safety program gift card. I chose this player because of the abilty to use WMA format wich doubled the number of songs I could install (500). It comes with a program to convert your music to WMA format.The 1 gig size is perfect for me because I don't have all day to listen to music. Changing my playlists is easy, just delete than copy and paste. I have coworkers that have the shuffle ;)and are just a little jealous of the 500 songs ability.I know it does not come with a clip or holder but it fits in my pocket how lazy has our society become?!I think the triple A will last longer than your full playlist.I only think this because i've fallen asleep with this and waken with it still playing.

<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I apologise for this saying under 13, but I didn't want to register. Sorry to Amazon and others.  Well, first off, This was my very first MP3 player. I was rather pleases all-in-all. The main problem with it is that it uses AAA batteries, and it can get costly after a while, so I'd suggest recharagbles. If it's safe to use them with this product, of course. The interface was very simple and I was quite pleased with the sound quality. I'm actually in the market currently for an MP3 player - But that's just because this is too small to fit my needs.  Another complaint besides batteries, is that if you want it nice and neat, you have to do it your self. I spent about an hour organising the music into the proper genre and proper album. But once I did, I was quite pleased at how smoothly everything else worked.  Well, though this is a rather short review, I really suggest this product. It worked great for me.

<Title>Pretty cool
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Seeing as my iPod nano is full already, filled with podcasts and all, I decided to get an iPod Shuffle so I can have that to hold my music. When I went to the store, it I saw the Creative Muvo V100 listed at $49.99, compared to the iPod Shuffle at $78.99. They both are 1GB but this Creative holds up to 500 songs while the Shuffle holds only 240 songs. Seeing the value, I decided to why not try an MP3 player (this is my first). Hoping that it wouldn't disappoint me, I bought it. After I went home, I immediately uploaded songs onto the MP3 player. The quality of the music is the same as the ones from my iPod nano, but on the plus side, it holds the same amount of songs as the 2GB nano, but the nano is one hundred dollars more. I don't see why that is. This is actually a pretty good machine. I really recommend to you guys. Here's some points why you should get this MP3.  Uppers:  -Holds up to 500 songs -Cheap price -Pretty good quality -Easy-to-use -Doesn't require songs downloaded onto the computer in order to have it on the MP3 -Doesn't really require to download a new software (optional) -Compact   Downers: -Not as pretty as iPod -Songs not organized like iPod (i.e. cannot find artist easily, need to forward)  I guess that's it, this MP3 is a pretty good deal.

<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my mother. She was accustomed to an iPod that someone else loaned her. She is a non-technical person to boot. She was so excited when she received it. She could not wait to start putting songs on to the MP3 player. I felt that she could have tried loading the software on herself but she was a bit nervous to do it. She waited until I could help her.   Well, she has been a nonstop dancing machine. She takes this everywhere with her. She cannot get over how compact and good the music quality is for this player. In addition, she cannot get over the amount of songs that she can put onto it. I do not think that she will ever fill it up.   A couple of things to note: She had to buy better headphones since the earbuds annoy her. It did not come with an armband like mine did. I did not realize that must have been a special deal. In addition, she does not like the quality of sound when recording music from the radio.   Other than these items, and it is a perfect machine. They seemed too petty to have an effect on the rating. Let the good times roll!
