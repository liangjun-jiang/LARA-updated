<Title>Got What I Wanted
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like the zen.  This is my first mp3 player and I probably took way too long searching and reviewing my options.  I have only had to reset it once, I believe that was the first night I got it and I think it was my fault.  I dont really have any complaints, I like that fact that it has a SD card slot.  4gb is plenty of space for me.  It is small and sexy.  The chicks dig its credit card size.  Some of my roomates have bought one after they saw and played with mine.  It is very easy to use and I have not even loaded the software onto my computer.  I just use Windows Media and click and drag.  Sometimes I feel the buttons are cheap but to get over that I just listen to music and think about the price I payed for it and it was a steal...$89.

<Title>it doesn't auto advance folders!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>okay so i've had this for a day so far, and more or less i like it except for one very important fact for me!!!...  the unit doesn't auto advance music albums? what gives? i actually own a vision W as well and that one works just fine, auto advances music albums no problems and you manually advance them as well. well on the little zen apparently they got rid of that feature. now while that may not be a huge issue for some people it is a HUGE issue for me. say you have only a few songs from a given artist, well the player stops after it has played those songs. it should just auto advance to the next available album but it doesn't. other then that very annoying fact it works jus like the vision w does in terms of the navigation of the player.  oh and for me when i installed the software on my system it took forever to install versus the software i installed for the vision w. the little zen also, seemed to have installed useless software as well. just put it manual mode when installing the software.  to summarize, if you're like me and need the auto advance feature for music albums then don't get this.  for me i think i'll be going back to sony.

<Title>Don't even try it.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After Zen spend 2 hours constantly uploading more and more software onto my desktop, it wouldn't even let me transfer a single itunes song to it. Sure, it says it's possible, but after days and days of trying to convert this and uploading that, I just gave up. A BIG waste of money.

<Title>Very quality product for the money spent
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen (4GB) is a very quality personal media player. I trust in Creative products having owned a Creative Zen Micro for more than 2 years and I love it. Creative did a great job making the Zen, it is pretty small and light, and exactly the size of a credit/debit card. I feared that the buttons or the actual player would be too small for my big hands but it hasn't been an issue. It looks nice on the outside, and looks attractive. At first it felt cheap and breakable, but after holding it for awhile it felt better and I feel safe putting it in my pocket. The screen is amazing, the colors/sharpness make images look incredible and sharp. It's like a mini HD screen, seriously. The UI is very nice and many options and customization options are present. The buttons depress with a click and I never have to press any button more than once to make it work. The shortcut button is nice. The included software is very simple and it gets the job done well although it has bugged out a few times by not locating the data on the player. The sound quality is good, can't really compare it to anything though and the bass boost and equalizer are nice additions. Battery life is good from what I've seen so far. Haven't used the SD slot yet. Nice radio. Included earbuds suck. I personally think that no other player exists of this quality for this price and I'm glad I didn't decide to buy an overpriced Ipod Nano.

<Title>Not bad for the price
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had this player for about a month and had to return it because; when i resumed playing certain video files, the audio and video would not be synched. also it tended to lock up a lot, randomly and had to search around for a paper clip or something small enough to insert into the reset button. (not good on a 40 minute subway ride to work with no paper clip). other than that this is a pretty good mp3 player for the price. just be aware that it's no zune or ipod touch.

<Title>Top Quality MP3 Player - Great Value
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have finally upgraded from my Zen microphoto to this, and what a difference!! I have successfully put all 1700 songs straight across using the easy Creative music software. Album art can now be displayed on the fab TFT screen - excellent resolution and clarity for that, and all the graphics you want to display. My 2GB SD card slotted straight in and this allows me to view movies, pics and other music from that too. Very durable, light and capable - but a player case/protector/skin is a good investment. Sound quality is excellent, and it plays MP3, AAC, WMA and DivX. The FM radio is very good, and it now stores your favourite stations. All in all, a very capable player, and the Amazon price is VERY competitive. Highly recommended.

<Title>Couldn't Get Protected WMA files working
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I couldn't get this product working with Protected WMA files. I interacted with online support for about 2 weeks via email (live support only 9AM-6PM central M-F, right when I'm working). Some of the steps: Upgraded FW, upgrade Windows Media Player 10 with updates, upgraded to Windows Media Player 11, reformatted, and reset to name a few. Protected files always get a playback error at the end of the song and eventually hang. I returned the unit to Creative and they sent me a new one, it had the same issue. I'm returning to Amazon for a refund and look for a more reliable player. By the way, the songs playback on the PC, my wife & son's MP3 players, so I don't think the files (or transfer mechanism) are the issue.  Too bad, nice form factor and screen seemed to have decent resolution.

<Content>Short and sweet: I think this is a fabulous product at a great price.  I haven't run into any undocumented features (bugs) yet, although the documentation is a bit lacking.  Awesome looking screen and very good sound quality.  I'm quite happy with this little guy.

<Title>smooth
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>so far , have used it for music (on sd card and unit itself) and audio books on unit and fm radio function .  works well. sounds good.  easy to make selections.  have not yet used the pc s/w, but if it's like the zen nano s/w, should be no problem.  organizing items on sd cards should make creating compilations for all moods and events easy.  only downside is no main menu selection for audio books.

<Title>Zen vs Nano G3
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have an iPod Nano Gen 3 and I like it a lot, but needed to get another MP3 player because the wife wanted one too, so I decided to try the Zen.  The iPod is great because it interfaces with so many accessories (I have a nice little desktop stereo that allows you to control the iPod through the stereo remote, and a I have a little FM transmitter so I can play my mp3s on the road via the car radio) I also found the iPod way more stylish then the Zen.  However, the iPod was more expensive, and all the Apple accessories are way overpriced.  Enter the Zen.  It is slightly bigger, but I like the bigger display better.  I also find it better for a runner because the volume control is not easily bumped (the touch wheel on the iPod is terrible when running).    The stock Zen earbuds are way better than the iPods.  Also, once you upgrade the firmware, it is much more windows friendly than the iPod/iTunes alternative (which still gives me multiple errors every time I sync, even after following all of Apple's tips).  The Zen firmware still has issues, but it has gotten more stable, and I hope they will continue to improve it.  One area that could use some work is album art.  It's a shame with all that display area, the album cover is so tiny.  They even have several views to show during music playback, but none of them do justice to the album art.  The iPod coverflow is great in this regard.  Another area that could use some work is the customization of the background.  With all those great photos they include, it's a shame not to be able to set an image like that as your background.  Note however, that you can not customize the background at all on the iPod, so Creative is already ahead in this area, I particularly like the purple background on the Zen display.  There are also functional bugs that need fixing, but Creative will sell a lot more of these things if they tap the full potential of that beautiful display.  Overall I like both the iPod and the Zen each for different reasons and I would give them each 4 stars.  The iPod has the edge when it comes to interfacing with accessories, and in the style department.  The Zen has the edge with it's nicer display and ear-buds, better controls, and lower price tag.

<Title>Best player for the money available
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player rocks! Audio and Video you expect, the quality of both is outstanding. The voice recorder is a great feature not available on most units this inexpensive. It is one of my favorite secondary features. I can stop for a moment, record a fleeting thought, and go right back to my entertainment. The interface is clear, concise and idiot proof. I didn't even have to read the quick start guide. I bought the 4 gig unit, and already prefer it to a friend's 80 gig Ipod. Which is what I thought I was going to buy before I started researching what was out there. Do your homework, and you will probably buy one of these yourself.  I did crash it the first day. Ordered a replacement before  I saw the reset hole-push it with a pin, and it reinstalls it's op system, and comes right back up. (Amazon sent the replacement before I could cancel the shipment-What customer service!)

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player for a little over a month now, and so far the experience has been good. However, having just replaced my IPod Mini with this player, my opinions may not be the most dependable when compared to other more enthusiastic electronics consumers. For my purposes, this player is perfect. The sound quality is great, and I find that the volume controls are much louder than the Ipod mini. The video has beautiful resolution and so far my videos have played just fine without any glitches. The cons: this player really IS a magnet for fingerprints and I have had it freeze up on me a few times while importing songs from my computer. However, this has been rare and the reset has fixed it. It is extremely lightweight, and it is easy to incorporate media directly from windows media player. For a while, I was quite upset that the battery didn't seem to last very long, but if you adjust the brightness of the screen to low when it is not in use and/or put the player on hold when you're just listening to music, I find that the battery life is much longer. Great alternative to Ipod in my opinion!
