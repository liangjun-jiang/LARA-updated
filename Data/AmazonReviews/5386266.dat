<Content>You can barely see the display on a cloudy day if you shade it with your hand.  On a sunny day, forget it, you have no display.  That and not having a clock are my only complaints.

<Title>could have been awesome

<Content>I was looking for an mp3 player with a stopwatch so that I could time myself jogging.  This has a stopwatch on it, but it is completely useless because while in "stopwatch mode" you can't change tracks or even adjust the volume.  If you want to turn up the volume, you have to go to a different menu - which would not be a problem, but when you come back to stopwatch mode - it's reset to zero.  The reality is that when you are working out sometimes you need to change songs, or at least adjust the volume because of external noise, track volume differences, etc.    Otherwise its a great device, I suppose battery life is a bit shorter than I am used to, and you have to endure an occasional "please wait" message when you navigate the different functions.  Its cool it has a radio, and easily synchs up with audilbes.com.  The stupid stopwatch issue is very frustrating though - and it doesnt even have a clock to time yourself with.  Hopefully they'll come out with an update.

<Title>not what a rca product used to be
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this product for a birthday gift and when I saw the RCA name upon it i thought it would be a product that would last a long time,my parents had an RCA tv that lasted forever and i think it still works they gave it to a member of the family, however this product does not work well it has "off the wall" software (in my opinon) and when you download the songs on the product it skips the music and menu is hard to use and the radio part is not what it is suppost to be. Think really hard if you want to spend your money on this product

<Title>Simplisticly easy
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's not much the can be said badly about this player, the worse trouble I've had with it is the strap coming off one side, but only when in my backpack, it's a great player for the price, and the 'splash/sweat proof covering' that is the shell is one the main reason's I got it and so far it's worked out very well. Have had for a couple months. Also, if you have a reg usb power cord it will charge and play which helps on road trips or when battier is low at work.

<Title>Excellent product

<Content>I bought this mp3 player as a gift for my husband.  He really likes the fact that it's very easy to use and also splashproof.  He takes it with him into the sauna at the local gym on a daily basis and has had no problems with  it.  It came with both a wrist band and an arm band, you can't beat the price and the quality.

<Title>Decent Sports Player
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: Small and light Rugged Sweat resistant 30 lap stopwatch memory 5 or so EQ presets Included earbuds sound OK and stay in place. Earbuds/headphones are personal choice (I prefer headphones) You get both a stretchy wrist and arm bands  Cons Button pad is tough to use because it is small and therefore very easy to hit mulitple buttons at one time....especially while running.  The stopwatch will reset to 0 if you leave the stopwatch display to change volume or change tracks....frustrating!  Display is very small and tough to read especially when running  BMI calculator is a joke..  All it does is tell you if you're "Ideal" or  "Overweight" based upon your input height and weight  All in all, as an mp3 player strictly for working out or running, it is very good.  If you want an mp3 player where you can change volume and or tracks while the stopwatch is running, look elsewhere.  In fact, I just ordered a new Timex Ironman watch because of the issue with the stopwatch on this RCA S2002.
