<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Title>much better than an ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son bought one and when his brother's ipod broke, he wanted a Zune instead.  It has an FM radio, you can easily transfer any music, great features, and the price was much less than an ipod.  We will never buy apple products again as they are too proprietary.  Our whole family will be buying one.  You can also search around and find better deals on the Zune.  Amazon had the black one for $50 cheaper than the others.  GREAT PRODUCT

<Content>I gave this as a Christmas present.  I am told it's "Pretty cool".  I've been told it works well, is easy to load and operate, and the sound is excellent both as a player and when in radio mode.  It certainly satisfied the end user.  It seems to have been a good buy.

<Title>Zune 30GB worth the money
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 30GB was worth the money. It is user friendly and is fun to have. I placed the order within a few days of Christmas and received it as promised, Dec. 24.  Zune has a wide range of options and can store more than one can really use. I would recommend this product to all.

<Title>No manuals!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I cannot believe that the Zune comes without a manual! I would like to use Windows media player to managee my Zune's content but instead I have to use a software that I do not like at all. I was hoping to move the music, pictures and videos from my computer using the Zune as an external drive. I find it very cumbersome!!!

<Title>First time MP3 buyer
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Buying a hard drive MP3 player was the correct choice for me,this was the first generation Zune 30 Gigabite player and I was able to download all the updates to go with it. I already have about 85 cd's converted on my Zune, and soon my whole collection will be portable. .That still only uses one third of the available memory.The 3'' screen is the best for pictures and I plan on downloading a movie or two also. I like it that the album covers are displayed and it is very easy to use and navigate the players  menu too. This Zune has an FM radio, another feature I wanted. Most stores are just starting to carry Zune accesories, but they are easilly to buy online, with a large assortment to choose from.  Most importantly I only paid $159.95 on Amazon.com and with free shipping and no sales tax the internet is the best way to buy n ew MP3 players. The enclosed ear buds and need to be replaced right away, I purchased a pair of Sony's Right away and later a set of V-moda in ear canel type that I really like. The case is flimsy and I am looking for a plastic box to use as a case. I deffinately reccomend the Zune....

<Content>Bought this on sale for my son for Christmas.  It has an incredibly sharp picture and he has put a lot of things on it already.  We have found the synching gets trashed when synchin while using the computer online so he does it when the computer is not in use.  It takes some time.  He is very happy with it.  A friend at work plays it through the port with speakers and the sound is great.

<Title>Zune 30 - Great product, Great price.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my Zune at a great price, and never thought I would use it as much as I do. If you have a MediaCenter PC - This is a MUST HAVE! You can record TV shows, and movies, convert them to Windows media files, and take them with you. If you get the home dock and connect it to your TV, you can watch your shows right on the TV. It holds more music than I even know. Check out the aftermarket programs designed for it and you can really do some cool stuff. The screen on the 30 is big enough to actually enjoy watching. The new software adds features it did not initially come with, like podcast support, and full menu control with the remote. Seems very well built, and the accessories are top notch quality. Like the Ipod, all the accessories are pricey for the original Microsoft stuff, and I suggest you stick with original made accessories. Others I tried did not fit it quite right, I have a friend who got a cable from an online store that damaged his, buyer beware. If you have an XBox360, this connects and you can watch all the photos, videos and music right thru it very easily. The wireless sync is GREAT! I just need my Zune anywhere in the area of my wireless router, push sync on the Zune menu, it opens up the program on my PC and updates by itself. I don't need another sync cable for my computer.  I like it better than my Ipod, mostly for the wireless abilities, and the battery life. It also does NOT scratch like my Ipod, and the newer ones have a real glass screen to avoid the problem. All in all I'm quite impressed with it.

<Title>The most "ama-zune" thing ever
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Light, Compact, Heavy duty.When you turn the Zune sideways while you watch music videos or movies its like a widescreen movie. It's amazing! It's similar to the Ipod but with a way bigger screen for almost the exact same price or less. Another family member has the Ipod nano and for the same price I got 30gb. The size is a bit thicker but that doesn't bother me. I've synced movies on from dvds and they look great. So if your looking for a new mp3 player put the Zune on your List.:)

<Title>Hard-to-find item found - Before Xmas!!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend loves red, so when she "hinted" at mp3 players (by looking at those "fruity" ones), I knew what to get her. I have owned every brand of mp3 player under the sun, and I can say the Zune is the best bang for the buck - especially with the new software upgrade. I didn't think I'd be able to find an affordable 30GB red Zune in early December but Amazon not only had one (and I mean 1 in stock!) but their fast, free delivery got it to me in enough time to wrap it and get it under the tree. She was blown away, I scored major points :) and life is good! Thanks Amazon!

<Title>Can't live without it! Threw the iPod away!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I couldn't wait for the Zune!  My father bought one and he loved it!   He's purchased quite a few cheapy mp3 players thinking he really wouldn't use it.  Well I think he'd agree that he can't live without it.  He's ALWAYS got his with him.  I don't think he listens to the radio anymore!  So he bought me one.  I loaded it up and I rarely listen to the radio anymore either.  It's so easy to use.  I am a bit disappointed with the latest version of the software, but the Zune people are working very  hard daily to vamp it up! If you join the Zune network they actually answer the forum questions and let you know what's going on.  It just keeps getting better and better.  So I bought this one for my daughter.  We are three generation of Zunies!  And each of us feel the same way, if the house caught on fire, (I was going to say we'd run in to save our Zune first, but on second thought) we wouldn't have to run in to save our Zune's because we'd have them on us!  Sound quality is awesome, the amount of music you can fit on the Zune is perfect.  30G is more than you think!  I can't think of a negative to say!  Join [...] to stay informed!!

<Title>the only choice for people who don't like Apple products
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This music player is great, after installing the software it automatically pulled my entire music library from Windows Media Player onto the Zune in a matter of minutes.  The graphics and colorful menus make it easy to use, and the product easily woks with other Microsoft products.  Everyone I show this to at school tells me they wish they'd known about the Zune when they bought their Ipod.  If you prefer Windows Media Player, this is defiantly the better choice.  However it is a little bulky and lacks the all the cool touch sensitive features that you'd find on an Ipod.
