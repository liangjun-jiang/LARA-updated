<Title>Good little MP3....
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little gizmo is pretty great for the price. It's a little hard to access the files and repeat, play and what not, but all in all it's a great little MP3.

<Title>GREAT MP3 player!!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had one of these for 10 months and I love it! I use it often and it has never given me any problems! Great sound and user friendly. My daughter has an ipod. Although the Zen Nano I have is not as powerful, I still prefer it. If you don't want to shuck out the money for an ipod, don't buy one of the cheap MP3 players. I would highly reccommend the Zen Nano!

<Title>Great  MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for well over a year and still love it. I have taken it boating, camping, shopping, bike riding, hiking, and it still works. I also have gotten it wet twice. I am rough on things, as you can see. I liked it so much, I bought one for my husband and daughter.  It has all the features more expensive MP3 players have, except bigger screen, but cost a lot less. My daughter likes the radio. I just like to take mine shopping so I can ignore all the "Mom, can I get...".My husband uses his at work, and enjoys having all his music. I would reccomend it. It is a great buy.

<Title>My new best friend, but for how long?
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this about 2 weeks now, and I'm really happy with it.  I was able to use all the advertised features within minutes of opening it up.  I also downloaded all my music using the drag-and-drop feature which is a must-have if you don't want some proprietary software converting all your files and then deleting them (I've had this happen!)  Most of the files I have are ripped from CD using software for the Zen Stone since I had some problems finding anything simple for the Zen Nano Plus. The radio is better than the one in my car, and recording both the radio and lectures is very straightforward.  There's only one minor problem with this player (for the price) and that's it's shoddy case.  Don't get me wrong, it's the right size and heft, but within one day the plastic crevices were caked in dust and it looked like the two halves are trying their hardest to split apart.  I might have to duck tape it together because I want this player to last me at least a couple years.

<Title>Few complaints for this economic MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my Zen Nano over a year ago from an overstock-type site for around 35 dollars.  I can't recall exactly but it may have been an open-box return, which might explain the only problem I have had with it (see below).  Having tried other zen players, an old Muvo flash-drive player, and after sampling several different ipods, I have found this to be the best option, as well as the cheapest. The functionality is something unrivaled in most players I've tried.  It includes line-in recording so that you don't actually need a computer to load it.  An FM tuner, with admittedly limited reception, works in a pinch if I need to walk to the store in the middle of a football game.  It has a small microphone that is useful for note-taking, though not much else. These lesser functions are somewhat basic but do not detract from its main function of music playback, which works excellently.  The sound quality is every bit as good as any player I've tried, as long as you are willing to pay out for some more expensive earbuds(sony EX51s are nice but break relatively quickly) than the ones included, which are the same quality as the tinny pieces of junk you would get with an ipod. The player's operating softare includes playlist organization, mp3 encoding (which I've never used), and even a basic equalizer with presets which helps when I change audio inputs from my over-bassed Koss Sparkplug earbuds to my home stereo. I should note that some have complained that there is no gapless playback on this player, which is true although I'm not even sure gapless playback is possible with Mp3s, as they don't usually contain that sort of information (I could be wrong). The interface may provide some problems for those who are less familiar with computers like the elderly or perhaps those who simply don't have the dexterity for smallish buttons (for instance: the very very obese) but I found the interface perfectly comprehensible and transparent, including a faux-scroll wheel, an on/off/play/pause button, and two dedicated volume buttons. The only problem I have found with the player, which may be because I did not buy it new, is that the battery case cover on mine broke fairly soon after I bought it, making it very easy for it to fall off in my pocket.  This is not a huge problem, as it comes with a belt-clip plastic case I can put over it, preventing the battery from falling out.  The downside is that it increases the size of the player by about a third, but this is minimal in my opinion as the player is already a little smaller than the average disposable cigarette lighter. For what I paid for this player, I would still be happy with my purchase if it died completely tomorrow.  It outlasted the more expensive earbuds I purchased for it, and if you are willing to pay the extra money it costs at Amazon, you can return it for a new one if it is DOA, as plenty of electronics are.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I mainly got for listening to audio books and lectures. It plays well and has a long battery life. I haven't had any problems with the device.  The things I don't like are the ear pieces, which are definitely too big, and the fact that it is hard to navigate through the different audio files on the player. And, for some reason, when I download a book consisting of several chapters, it jumbles up the chapters on the player. I need to go back and put them in order with the firmware before detaching it from the pc, so if I forget to do it and take off with my player, I'm screwed as it would be very difficult to locate the chapters in sequence when I am away from my computer.   The above are little gripes that I can live with, ergo the 4 stars.  So, I'd recommend it. For the money, definitely worth it. Hope this helps.

<Title>30+ Albums on 1Gb Nano Plus
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really, really like this Nano. It is small, the file transfer is easy and fast, the sound is great (I have a high end hi-fi, yet am happy to use the lower bit rates to fit on more songs when I travel, 30+ Albums at 64Kb WMA). The battery life is good and I personally really like being able to change batteries half way though a trip away from home or at the office, without having to worry about a charger.   Things are a few things that annoyed me slightly. There is always a small gap and click between songs. It is also difficult to set the record levels when using the 'line in' facility to get a decent volume, yet avoid quite bad distortion.   Overall I highly recommend the Nano Player

<Content>My fiancee got me this MP3 player for Christmas.  I had been eyeing the ipod shuffles.  He did a lot of research and decided that the MP3 player would be better for me.  I was completely surprised when he gave it to me.  I absolutely love it!  I listen to it on the treadmill when I am walking and when I am cleaning the house.  Great item!

<Title>Great player for jogging
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to use a bulky mp3 cd player on my jogs.  After researching mp3 players and what I wanted to use them for, I decided on the zen nano plus.  Apple's equivilent would be the Shuffle, NOT the ipod nano as MANY misunderstand.  Here's why this player beats the shuffle in so many ways: -Price -FM Radio + radio recording! -Built in mic and line-in recording to mp3!  (96,128,192kbps selectable rates) -A DISPLAY -a BACKLIT display -Preset & Customizable EQ -Removable battery (AAA) -Does shuffle come with belt clip/arm band? (really, i don't know) -Mass storage device when plugged into USB. -MS Plays for Sure -Using WMP 10 and Sync, it auto-creates artist/album folders on the device. -About half the size of a pack of Big Red gum (it is really small)   Shuffle pros: Itunes (which i love, but WMP is catching up).

<Title>There are better options
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a Sandisk 1G MP3 player and I am pretty satisfied with it. I got it for five dollars less than this, and though I have returned it twice--once for a better price and once because the headphones shorted out--I think it's better than Creative Zen, which my friend owns. Hers has tiny buttons and an inefficient scroll wheel. If you're looking for a well-priced, easy to use mp3 player, go with the Sandisk m240 models.

<Title>Do NOT buy creative Zen nano
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one a couple of weeks ago on amazon and got a very very bad experience with creative zen nano. I had one sandisk e240 before and I have been using it for more than 6 months and I got no problem with it at all. It still looks like brand-new. Since my wife wants to have one mp3, I though we should try a different brand and then bought one creative zen nano. Nighmare follows. Zen nano is really like a small cheap gadget. The cons from my experience are 1) The battery cover broke within only two weeks.  2) The surface is easily scratchable.  3) No sleep timer included. 4) The lock function is build-in within the software, instead of a direct mechnical switch like in Sandisk. 5) The LCD window is too small. 6) The sound of pressing buttons is too loud and sounds like cheap toys.  A lot of people mention that the custom service of creative is very bad. This is not case for sandisk. The first mp3 I have is sandisk 1gb mp3 player (not e240 series). The firmware brokes once; I just send it back to sandisk and got replacement within 2 weeks without paying any fees. Although both brands are made in China, Sandisk obvisouly has much better design and quality control.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had an I-Pod shuffle and this is so much better!!!  You pay less for it and you get a voice recorder and fm tuner.  I also like the drag and drop ease of moving files to this player.  I-tunes is okay but I work on many different computers and I don't like having to install I-tunes all of the time.  Don't forget that this doubles as a flash drive too!  If you like a lot of bells and whistles as far as buttons go, do not buy this product.  There is one button that turns the player on/off, plays/pause.  Then there is a volume up button and volume down.  The only other thing is a scroll wheel that navigates through songs and the menu.  This is a very tiny player!  Also, do be careful with the battery cover.  It is small and can break.  I haven't had a problem but I have been careful with it.  All in all I love it!

<Title>Great little player for the price
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of online research before I purchased an MP3 player.  I was initially going to buy a SanDisk e200, but the store didn't stock it.  The salesman convinced me this little Zen Nano for 1/3 the price of the SanDisk would be very user friendly.  He was so right!  I was ripping songs from my CD's in no time after loading the software. I only want some music (FM radio on here is great, too!) and don't want to carry around a big CD player.  Don't care that there's no color LCD screen with pictures.  Highly recommended if you're just looking for something small to hold lots of music.  Sound is great, but might buy different eye buds...these are a little large.  I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a player with with features I don't really need.

<Title>Just what I wanted!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first digital player, and I love it.  I have had ZERO problems with it in the first three weeks or so of owning it, and have never opened the manual or installed any software.  I am able to download music from my PC, and books from NetLibrary with no problems.  I have also stored a bit of data on it with no ill effects.  The FM radio receiver is as good as that in my CD player--receives most stations as long as the headphone cable is extended.  Battery life seems fine to me (listened to an entire book, plus music and FM on the included Duracell). I can't vouch for the headphones, as I bought in-ear passive noise-reducing phones to go with it.

<Title>Decent mp3 player for the price!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Today I received my Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus 1GB.  I decided to purchase an mp3 player because I work out at the gym and was tired of running with a bulky cd player that skipped if I didn't hold it while running.  So, I started looking at mp3 players.  I am a big music person and have well over 12,000 files of mp3s on my home computer.  It seemed I would have to buy a costly mp3 just to hold a good portion of my collection on an mp3 player.  I checked out the Ipods, Sandisk and Creative Labs mp3 players.  I did A TON OF RESEARCH ON THESE PRODUCTS.  The end result?  There are bad experiences from reviewers with each brand and every model.  I decided to not throw away hundreds of dollars on a piece of techology that would potentially have an issue.  If you don't care about playing and watching video but just want a compact mp3 player to listen to a handful of music albums on -- this one seems to be the best.  I tried it out in the gym today and it was great.  It is the size and weight of a tiny package of gum (the kind with 5 pieces).  I held it in my hand while running since I don't trust technology to be dangling off my body, however, this one does come with an armband and waist clip!    Pros: +Comes with waist clip, armband, basic headphones, line-in cable, and usb cable. +Lightweight, has screen with optional backlight. +COST!  Save yourself some money! +Customer Service (I called with a question and was put on with a live body in minutes!) +FM Radio +Record audio!  Cons: -For working out, there is a lot of extra cord on the headphones. -Directions.  The set of directions that comes with this is really poor.  It gives no real direction on how to work the software and vague in some areas with how to use it.  I figured out everything through trial and error. -The case that it comes with doesn't actually cover the screen, which stinks because I don't want to worry about scratching it!   In summary, I couldn't find one mp3 player that didn't have an unhappy bunch reviewing each brand and model.  This one is working out so far.  If there isn't a great flawless mp3 player on the market then why waste so much money on an Ipod?  (I didn't talk about spec's in this review because you can learn that from Amazon's description.  You read reviews to read others experiences.)
