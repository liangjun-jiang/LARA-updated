<Title>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the worst piece of junk I have ever bought.  We have an Iaudio MP3, which is fabulous, and an Ipod, which is OK.  Although the unit is cool, the software is absolutely terrible.  It is incredibly difficult to rip CDs and to manage the files, and only works through Windows Media Player 10, which only runs on XP.  I strongly suggest that you buy either the Ipod or the Iaudio.  This is really a loser.

<Title>Don't trust IRiver
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We have an H340 that is 3 months out of warranty.  When its internal battery stopped holding a charge we were told that we now had a "paperweight."  Don't trust this brand.

<Title>Quite good.
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well to say the truth i expected more of this product, but it's working great. Battery is lasting for a very long time, the quality of the sound is great and you can adjust the EQ for yourself. On the background u can a put your favourite photo of your girlfriend, boyfriend, family, etc. The sound recorder is GREAT. it's even more the just GREAT. The sound is clean. It's possible to record songs from built-in FM-Tuner,which is kinda rare in the MP3 players. The thing i don't like is that if u push the butten, the screen lights up after a while. Video quality is pretty good, but in order to convert it into the needed format and size you have to download the program called IRIVETER. That's all i can say

<Title>A very nice player and smart choice!!! I just love it!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did an big research of mp3 devices last season....I was trying to find one decent mp3 player at a reasonable price. Believe me, this one is the perfect choice.  A friend of my family brought this from the US (I live in Perbut you can choose also friend's place in USA to be delivered then he can bring it to you, it works great! :) )  To you, my personal conclutions:  PROS: -Size, it's the size of a business card but it's kindda thick. Anyway it is still small and fits in any of your pockets. -The display is so so cool. Everyone who sees it get impressed by it. awesome click system! -Has lots of features, radio, text!!!,games, and beats the iPod...'cause yes! you can watch video!!! using the iReverter software from the iRiver website! -Price: today US$99.- WOW!!! -And the most important thing, the iRiver sound...just awesome!!! lots of features, eq modes, and a personal one to set. -I use it with a USB1.1 port and, despite of the extra-time in file transfering, it works fine!!  CONS: -Finger prints in the display, anyway the screen seems to be very solid it's difficult to scratch it(never tried though! :P ) -While in text mode you can not change the song played...yeah this one if you are very very exigent. -i'd like it better if it has more than the 40 volume top. -NOwadays you can consider it a little heavy. -I'm still looking for some sport adapter(arm-hanger or something) in my country...I think i'll get that cheap one from amazon :S, considerin' the way i get the goods it will take some time.  I can say I love this U10... Considering the cost-benefit this one beats any other product in the market TODAY.

<Title>Excellent, but the Clix is Spectacular
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I now own both the U10 and the Clix. While the U10 is an excellent Mp3 player, the Clix is spectacular. They look similar and operate in a similar fashion. However, the Clix has better graphics and a greater range of FM station options. The labels are bigger on the U10 than the are on the Clix. Also, unlike the Clix, the battery in the U10 does not have to be completely drained before you can recharge it. That is a plus. The Clix can show cover art. The U10 can not. The U10 has a boost function. The Clix has a WOW function. The big point, however, is that per MB the U10 is a much more expensive player than the Clix, which is now available in a 4 GB version for $199 at iRiver's Web site. As of this writing, the 4GB Clix is sold out, but iRiver has posted a new shipment date.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very good product, the video is good and so is the mp3 player, best feature is the fm radio incorporated in it. only thing missing is an additional slot of memory card, either a mini or micro sd card. would help due to the low amt of memory on it.

<Title>Poor life span
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 512mb model u10 right after if came out and after about 8 months began to have problems with it deleting songs on its own, or when I would delete them the songs name would stay in my playlist and would stop playing whenever it came to the song.  I have another u10 which is the 1GB model and after about 8 months it is doing the same thing, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy an iRiver product and if you have one take it back now because it will self destruct. IRiver isn't the only company who seems to have problems with their MP3 players lifespan, average life of a much more expensive IPod is only 18 months.  Until someone steps in and insists these electronic companies make a reliable product I am sticking with the cheaper products that services like Napster and Urge offer.

<Title>Good Video + Audio Hard to Install
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had problems installing and attaching the U10 with Window Media player 10. Called the help desk and it took 3 tries to get someone that Knew how to handle the installation.  Most of the people on the help desk have no idea how to help. They told me to return the product and get a new one that had the same problem.  Had to make a change to the regastry.  Then it worked as promised.  However, I had to reinstall the operating system and loaded Windows Media Player 11 and the devise work just by plugging it in to the URL.    Earphones are cheap so I replace them and the music sounds great.  Pictures show up chrisp and clear.  Games are lame.  And I have not been able to convert the anything to the required video format.    Pictures and video need their own utility to download.  The ability to use the frame around the unit to for most of the controls is east to use following the promts that show on the screen.

<Title>Excellent device...
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iriver u10 is an excellent device and has features that no other mp3 player can have all together.   Some of the features I love:  -built-in radio (ipod or similar doesn't have) -record sound/radio/linein directly to mp3 (amazing..., can record hours and hours...) -video -connect as a usb storage and you have the freedom to directly copy/rename/delete any file in it as its another folder in your computer! And you are not bound to an application such as itunes... -have different settings for song listings (such as list artists, albums, titles) BUT my favorite is that, it allows also you to browse the filename lists (not available in ipod) as in your computer. This is best if your mp3 tags are not well organized!! -Memory is flashram, so no need for extra careful handling -and finally; battery life is really long...  only problem might be the capacity (1gb). If you are the one that want to carry all his audio in a device, go for a hdd based device... Otherwise, enjoy u10...
