<Title>Useless and Creative's Customer Service Department stinks
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If this is your first venture into MP3 players like it was mine DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this device. First of all, there is no legally downloadable music to play on this thing. Nothing is compatible. But, go to their website and click on the "Fill Your Zen" link from the Zen Stone Plus 2GB webpage and it gives you all kinds of links to compatible services. Go to the service, sign up for it, and Guess What? It's not compatible. But wait!!?? They advertised that it was? Now try to get help from customer service. They talk in circles, oh yea, by e-mail only... and then to top it off you have to wait at least 24 hours between e-mails to get answers that get you nowhere. In the last e-mail I got customer service finally told me..   "[We] Apologize for any inconvenience caused from this experience. Please allow me to assist you further in resolving the issue.   Prior sending us an email, our website suggested some solutions for the issues that you are having. Some information that I provide might be repetitive, but I want to get you the solutions that have highest probability of resolving your issue.   I regret to tell you that Zen Stone Plus doesn't support Online Music Subscription Services. Therefore you won't be able to transfer any of the online music that you have subscribe whether it is itunes or Yahoo!Unlimited."   Well now, there's some help. All that stuff that they linked me to on their website, its not compatible. And I'm not comfortable downloading pirated music. So now what? I've got a device that does not do what the website said it would do. I call that false advertising and, Oh Yes...hmmm, its a piece of junk.

<Title>Good device for recorded books

<Content>I was looking for a good device to download audio books from the library, This works very well and resumes play where you leave off. It was fairly easy to use and also holds a lot of music.

<Content>I use my Zen Stone Plus while I work out and even when I don't.  I bought hot pink in order to deter my kids from "borrowing" it.  That didn't work.  But so far it is standing up to them and me.  I like the price, too.  I really like it and would buy another one.  I highly recommend it.

<Content>Bought for the girlfriend... paid almost twice the cost just to get a Pink one.  She loves it.  Works great!  I have a black version myself... which after about 3 days... started to hear a rattling from inside the case....  Which does not effect the quality of the product....  I just find it odd.  Overall, great buy IMO.
