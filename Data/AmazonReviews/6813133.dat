<Title>Great for a simple mp3 player
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got the Insignia NS-DA1G as a simple, low capacity player that would be easier to carry around during exercising than my much larger 60 gig iPod. I found its interface to be very adequate and sound quality to be very good as well. The list of features it offers is really quite impressive as well. Including an FM tuner, color screen and a replaceable battery. Synchronizing music to the player can either be accomplished using the provided Rhapsody software or by using Windows Media Player. I am not a big fan of using either program, but I can get over it.  For the price it is pretty hard to beat. The only real problems I had were the options I had for transferring music to the player and that 1 gig of space was simply not enough, so I got the 2 gig version instead.

<Content> Very nice.  I happen to have a 2 GB kind of these babies. The Battery life is around 13 hr. i found. The battery case is a bit loose, but it doesn't fall off very easyily.      The Sycn. process is very easy.  Simply plug the usb cable into your computer, and copy music from ur Music Player. You charge it through the usb cable also.     The durability is where this baby shines.  It has a nice rubber feel to it and can servive hard drops. MY EVEN WENT THROUGH THE WASH!! yes thats right througth the wash.  and after a small charge and after i let it air dry, and its been work flawlessily for a couple of weeks.       The sound quality is great, and like most MP3 players it has a EQ set-up,       The interface is VERY user friendly, and easy to move around in.  Conclusion:  If your looking for a cheaper, durable, and slim mp3 this is it.  I bought at BEST BUY for about 125$ . Another Great product by Insegnia.

<Content>i bought the 2gb one at best buy for $129! with ipods, you get like 10 songs for $99 u pay for the name, and they are crappy quality. were not talking about the razr case, thats a huge fad that is ok to be true. the raze IS a good phone, the ipod is not a good mp3 player. insignia is small and lightweight great sound, has photo, mini photo  of albums, radio and equalizers. try that apple. the new apple phone will never be the razr (besides the point) no one needs 13,000,000,000,000 songs. this one is perfect, i accidentally washed my pants with them in there, yea going through the washer and still works if that happened to ipod itd be dusted and dead. try that. awesome. get it.

<Title>Item was great...for about 5 hours
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player as a replacement for another that malfunctioned.  Over the course of a few days the battery died after using it a maximum of five hours.  I plugged it into my computer to recharge.  After being plugged in for two hours, the recommended recharge time, I unhooked it and it instantly died.  Plugged it back into the computer.  The player said it was fully charged and so did my computer.  I'm really not sure what the issue was, but I certainly wasn't going to replace it with the same model.
