<Content>amazing product! it is worth much more than what i paid. incredibly light, cant even notice it. headphones are comfortable (though i broke mine! gaaaah! replaced them with phillips headphones, and the meizu ones were better).  Plenty of space... i have about 500 songs on mine and i think thats enough, though there is a lot of space left (i mean, like 4 gb i dont even touch). i use it as a usb as well, very easy stuff (drag and drop). i carry this everywhere and the battery life is great. couldnt be more happy. i laugh at everyone else who is scrolling there little wheels or switching batteries. never dropped this thing cuz it is such a convenient size and the cover is grippy, never had a scratch. had ONE problem and i just reset it. this was the first day i had it, so that was just bad luck. after that, (its been 3 months almost), ZERO PRObLEMS.  one detail is that when it updates its library, its a bit slower than it could be.... but obviously nowhere near long... its just a bit slow.  oh yeah, and the headphone heads come off kind of easy (at least mine did), but just pop them back in and they will be fine. (i broke the cable on mine, which was because i kinda sorta ran into a tree... dont ask).  
<Overall>5
