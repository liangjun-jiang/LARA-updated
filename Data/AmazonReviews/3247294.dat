<Title>Great MP3 player, especially for price I paid
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my wife for christmas and we've had it for almost a month now and we haven't had a problem out of it.  I installed RockBox firmware, it seems to have more options to it than the original firmware but if you don't know much about computers/mp3 players I'd stick with the original firmware, it worked fine just not as much you can play with.  The battery life isn't quite as long as they advertise but it's good enough.  Overall it was a great purchase!

<Title>Great player, lots of features, some annoyances
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>One of the great things about this player is you do not have to install any special software; just drag a folder of MP3s over to it. The best feature is its future potential; the manufacturer brags 'firmware upgradeable' on the box and an Internet search reveals an active user forum and homebrew software available.  I actually found a use for the text file viewer-- it is a handy way to keep track of a new workout routine. Sound quality is good enough for loud rock music while mowing or working out.  There are some minor annoyances in the software. The equalizer does not have enough frequency ranges and introduces some noise. There is not a clear indication when you disable the EQ and turn on the SRS feature. The picture display is cool, but no zoom and pan - even my cell phone does that. However, these are all minor bugs that could be fixed with new software.  One of the advertised features is line in recording - but you don't get the line input jack unless you buy a cradle. Hmmm, why not just use the line input jack on your computer sound card and save the money. I would rather have had a line input and/or a mic jack on the unit itself than the wired remote control jack - the iriver is about the size of a remote control itself so I am not sure what the logic was here.  Like I mentioned earlier these are minor annoyances and I am generally impressed with the performance and sound on the player.

<Title>Great product. but NO support from IRIVER
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall a great player. The unit workes well with Windows media player 10 and is packed with features. The sound quality is excellent. Overall the player would be 5 stars EXCEPT-  IRIVER. This company has no customer service at all. I had a couple  quirky issues with the unit that I needed some help with. Their manual is useless. To-date, over the course of a week I have spent 2+ hours, per evening on 4 different days, on hold with them not able to get through. Good thing I have a speaker phone. They have yet to answer their support line.Its now become a matter of princepal that I get through. I've also sent off two different emails to them and in 5 days they have yet to return a one. Had I known, I would have seleced a different manufacturer.

<Title>Wonderful mp3 player/ipod 
<Date>Sat Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player. Works wonderful out of the box and requires no firmware updates. The sound is wonderful. Much better than the ipod. If you want to try out both the place to go is bestbuy because they have most of the top mp3 players available to test in their store. the headphones that came with the player are ok, but you probaby should go out and buy new ones. Again for the money it is the best player around. It works with most audio services. Unlike the ipod which only uses itunes. It comes with a multitude of features more than the ipod. including fm radio, radio/in line/voice recording. all and all excellent player, easy to use/ tons of features/ pictures/ excellent battery life

<Title>Excellent Produce
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is much better then an IPOD mainly because .. A. It has much better sound. B. It has an FM tuner. C. You don't have to ship it back to the factory (Apple) for $60.00 to $100.00 to change the battery when it starts going bad. There's way too much hype with IPOD. The only thing it has going for it is that it may be a bit easier to use and has a slightly larger screen, but it's not color. For the price the Iriver is a much better deal.

<Title>Wow, speechless
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>8/9/05 UPDATES:  So far so good. I am still enjoying my iRiver. I think my friend wants one, but it's kind of a waste of money since he doesn't even have a 128 CD case yet, and hasn't filled his 64. Besides, he has Windows 98, and the iRiver is only compatable with XP, Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X. The reason I am resumbitting my review is to point out a couple of things I didn't mention before.  1) Songs cannot play in album order. Though you can do this by using the quick list, it becomes frustratingg after awhile.  2) The battery life seemingly lasts more than 16 hours under normal use, more around 20-22 hours, depending on your usage.  3) The battery is not swappable, HOWEVER, iRiver's site said YET...meaning they are making a swapple battery for the H10-20GB. The battery lasts around 4 years, however shortens slowly after the third year. iRiver's website states at 4 years, the battery life will be dropped around -4 hours. Which means even if you get it now your battery will never die.  4) The player DOES seem to support .wav files. I by accident added a .wav file and my friend accidentally played it. The player played the four minute .wav file just fine without hesistation.  5) You can NOT add a song to an exisiting playlist that has been added to the player, a little frustrating. You have to delete the file in My Computer and then add the song again. This could take an immense amount of time if you want to add a large amount of certain songs.  6) Imo, CNET's review should be redone, as they say the navigation is difficult, when it's easy as pie.  So far, I still LOVE my iRiver. So, it's not 100% perfect, but the firmware hasn't even been upgradeable yet, meaning they are working on some new firmware for the H10-20GB.  And, if you haven't read my earlier review, it is posted below.  7/5/05:  I recently bought and returned the YH925GS. Not only did it not have an FM tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a BIG pain.   The MP3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. Like all 20 GB MP3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 CDs). The controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. There are also arrows for them most easy navigation. You'll notice that it's easier to use than most MP3 players on the market today. The battery life is 16 hours. Some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but I guess 16 is okay.   The player also comes with a 1.8" LCD screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. On this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. This is a really cool feature. You can store lyrics or essays in Notepad, then transfer them into the player. This is a VERY cool feature that I will be using more often.   The sound is really good. It doesn't have WOW features that most MP3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. The sound isn't distored at all, and I'm suprised about this.   The player also comes with recordings and FM tuning. THe microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the FM tuner is quite good too. There are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. And listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. How cool is that? Say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. It's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 GB, Radio, and Recording. (the iAudio X5 is the other player that has this...I didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, WTF?)   It's also PlaysForSure compatible, but to use WMP 10, you have to download the drivers from the iRiver website. Unless you have a lot of music on WMP, I would just stick to the drag-n-drop. It's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. My Computer, iRiver) or WMP 10 that's compatable. RealPlayer is compatable, and Napster is too (but I think Napster sucks). To put photos on your MP3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. As a matter of fact, the My Computer>iRiver method is probably the best. I have no reason why you would want/need WMP 10 or Real to manage music. Though, I guess to have further options, you would need it. But otherwise, it's VERY easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. But remember, if you can't get Windows to understand the H10, you'll need to go to iRiver's website and download the new drivers. I wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.   Overall, if you want the great combination of 20 GB, WMA and MP3, Recording, Drag-N-Drop (no hassle with WMP or Real), and FM radio, you just HAVE to have the H10.

<Title>Good product.... bad faults.
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I'm not 13. Now onto the product. I purchased this in the beginning of July. I grew tired of my CD player and went to Best Buy and debated between this or a Creative Zen. The specs were about the same so it came down to the looks of the player. The iRiver H10 is the best looking one out there. It's small, light and has a vivid color display. The player is also very easy to maneuver. I never really put the text feature to use or even tried it out and the picture feature is nice although i do not know what the significance of it is but I guess some would find it useful. Sound quality is excellent and you can change most of the options to fit your needs (backlighting, scroll speed, etc). Custom EQ, FM Radio, this player has it all. Of course this product has it's cons. It freezes up very often. I noticed this happening more and more as I started filling up the player more. It's not that troubling to take out the battery and putting it back, though. Two weeks after I got it I ended up exchanging it for another because the play/pause and fast forward buttons were becoming hard to push, which irritated me. Now that I have the new one for almost a month the back button occasionally does the same thing. Also, one morning it just kept crashing for no apparent reason. I had to remove the battery during a freeze-up while the system was initializing and it completly erased all my songs. But when I plugged it back to the USB I saw they were still on the player, just not actually appearing when I tried to play them on the iriver. So then I went to the iRiver website and  tried a firmware update which solved the problem and allowed me to start placing songs that would appear on my player. I was still angered about having to go through the trouble of putting all the songs back once again. In conclusion, this is a very good product even though it has major faults but then again..dont all mp3 players do? If you're planning on buying this from a store I strongly suggest purchasing a waranty or else you may regret it later on.

<Title>As good as the Zen Micro with the bonus of the color screen
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Zen Micro and I cant say enough good things about it.  My girlfriend thought it was cute so I gave it to her.  I was going to buy another one when I did some research.  The H10 had some mixed reviews but after using it for a week now it looks like user error...i'll explain later.  First if you have Rhapsody to Go (which I do) you cant complain about the price...its only $100 after the rebate...wow!  Ok now back to the user error section.  Many people complain that the songs are played in alphabetical order.  Yes you can do it that way of you select an album and hit the play button on the side of the H10. If you use the o button instead of the play, you get the album to play as intended.  Pretty simple but I can see how it would get a little confusing.  So just for that I will lower my rating to four stars.  Other than that its the perfect little player.  As good as the Zen Micro with a color screen.  Buy it!

<Content>I bought this player for my son who needed to travel within 2 days. The setup with Rhapsody required several phone calls for tech assistance and they were very helpful. But after one day the MP3 player froze. A call to Iriver said that they would answer the call within 2-3 business days. We found the reset button ourselves and the player has been OK since. Its best to buy this product from a company that can render assistance much sooner.

<Title>The Good, the OK, and the Bad
<Date>Sun Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iriver H10 20GB (Blue) about three weeks ago after saving and researching for about 6 months.  In summary, I have been very happy with the player and would definitely buy it again.    The Good  The sound quality is very good.  The included ear buds are fine (I'm not a fan of ear buds in general), but the source is clean and accurate and you can spend as much or as little on after-market headphones as you like.  There is a lot of control over the EQ.  Virtually all of my music is in Variable Bit Rate MP3 format.  The H10 supports MP3 and the Microsoft format (WMF).  I don't use iTunes (ACC) or Audible so lack of support for those formats is not an issue for me.  The form factor is nice.  It's about the same size as a deck of cards and fairly light.  It fits in my hand or a pocket easily.  The user interface works well with either one or two hands.  The controls are simple, intuitive and make sense.  (I recommend you read the short manual or it might take you a while to stumble onto some of the more subtle features.)  The thumb slider works well, even with a large list to scroll through-when your thumb hits the end of the slider, the display keeps scrolling.  Using the slider to control volume rather than a physical knob or wheel is a good idea.  One of my main reasons for picking the H10 was the FM tuner.  I like to listen to National Public Radio and other local stations.  The tuner has good reception and it is easy to program stations as presets.  I have used the ability to record an FM transmission a few times already.  The color display is bright and clear.  The screen layouts make sense and have useful information.  I don't have a reason to use the player to display pictures (other than when showing off the player), but it does have this ability.  I had no problems getting Windows XP to recognize the player-it shows up as a USB drive.  Data transfer rates have been good for a USB device.  I've loaded my entire library several times as I've played with different software besides Windows Media Player.  It takes about an hour and a half to transfer 12GB.  Some reviewers have complained that the player locks up when they used Windows to browse the player's hard drive.  It does take a while to display the contents of folders on the player, but I haven't had the player or Windows actually lock up.  The battery life has been good.  I've taken it on a couple of multi-day trips and haven't run it down completely.  The OK  The player is designed to work with Microsoft Windows Media Player 10 (included on CD with the player).  WMP does all of the basic things you want:  rip, organize, update ID3 tags, build playlists, sync with the player.  Of course it takes Microsoft's typical "software for dummies" approach-it doesn't do any of the things as well as some other programs and you can't change the way it behaves, where it stores your music files, etc.  ("Sorry ma'am, but you don't need to know the bit rate we're using to encode your music.  Move along now...")  But, if you are willing to be assimilated (resistance is futile!), it can manage your music collection and player adequately.  Fortunately, because you can copy the music files directly to the player using Windows, you can use any software you wish.  I like to use FreeRIP to create the mp3 files-it works very well, queries freedb so you don't have to type in any information, supports variable bit rate encoding, and is free.  To use the player with a lot of content, having clean ID3 tags is critical.  ID3 tags store the information about the music file (artist, album, title, genre, etc.) in the MP3 file.  I tried Windows Media Player, but again ended up using a different free program (MP3Tag) that worked better, especially when cleaning up hundred of files at a time.  Some reviewers have complained that the player will not play songs in the order that they were on the album.  Remember that the players has only the information in the ID3 tags and the file names to work with.  It doesn't seem to use the "Track" tag, but you can get it to play in album order if you include the track number in the file name and play songs in alphabetic order.  For example, I name my music files "Artist - Album - Track# - SongTitle.mp3."  99% of the time I have the player on random shuffle.  I'm still looking for a program that can make it easier to sync the player and manage playlists.    I don't expect the software to be an issue for the typical owner-I tend to be very particular.  I suppose the support for text files is useful, if you wanted to keep some reference files on the device.  I've read novels on a Palm Pilot, so I'm not opposed to using a small device for reading, but electronic devices have a long way to go to before they can match the performance and convenience of paper for pleasure reading.  Some reviewers have mentioned having to upgrade the firmware and having to remove the battery to reset the player.  The H10 20GB does not have a firmware upgrade release yet, and it resets very easily by pressing a small recessed button with a paper clip.  I have had to reset the player a couple of times, but it reboots quickly and this hasn't been a big deal.  The Bad  Bad is relative.  Nothing I've encountered with the player is truly "bad."   Probably my worst complaint is that there is a brittle-sounding click in the headphones as the player changes songs.  I don't really notice it any more, but at first it was annoying.  I like to listen to longer material, audio books and old radio programs, and fast-forwarding to a mid-point to resume listening can take a while, even with the scan rate set to max (6x).  A progressive scan (longer you hold it down, the faster it goes) would be more effective and intuitive.  The player comes with a white translucent silicone protective cover.  It has a belt clip and is soft and does a good job of protecting the player, even if it is not the most attractive thing I've seen.  I've listed it under the Bad category because it also makes it difficult to feel the Prev Track/Play/Next Track buttons through the silicone.  I haven't had to call iriver for support yet, but have no illusions about the quality of live support that will be available.  Unfortunately, no one provides good customer support.  Best we can hope for is a device that is made well enough that the need for support is rare.  So far, the H10 20GB seems to fall into this category.  Because the player is designed to be a copy of your master library, there's no obvious way to delete files (even ones you've recorded using the player's FM tuner) using the player's interface.  You have to connect it to your computer for this.  There's also no obvious way to figure out how much disk space is left on the player, either from the player or from Windows.  As a work-around, I add up the size of the various media directory trees on my computer to estimate how much space is left.  I'm hoping both of these are addressed by firmware upgrades.   Oh.. and I wish I had gotten red.

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave it a rating of 1 because that was the lowest choice available. Amazon didn't give me the option of a negative number.  I received my first (of 3) as a gift & it lasted about 1 month before it completely froze up & stopped working.  Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down, I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment, so I replaced it with an identical model.  2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working.  Since it was under warranty for 1 more month, I sent it back.  Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one, I don't have a clue.  I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done.  It worked for about 2 months, before it stopped working.  No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked.  So now all I have basically is a $300 paperweight.  I will never buy from iRiver again.

<Title>iriver is a stressful device and beware of wmp!
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Do not purchase an iriver!!!! It will make you miserable and you will end up spending more money than you would have had you bought yourself an ipod and here's why:  1-the iriver works with windows media player (wmp), the worst media player software on this planet. This software is designed to either give you a heart attack or to make you throw your laptop across the room so that you'd buy a new one. It is hard to create playlists in wmp and when u create them, upon subsequent syncing, wmp changes these playlists almost randomly. Some songs get doubled for mysterious reasons. It truly is a puzzle. Everytime you update your playlists or want to simply upload songs onto your player, you'll end up spending an entire weekend, and that's assuming that things are working fine. 2-the iriver firmware has some serious bugs. If you are like the rest of us (majority of iriver owners), then make no mistake, at some point within a year, you will spend an entire weekend downloading and tweaking your playlists only to realize that the iriver will have stopped working. You will turn It on and it will show a blue screen with a clock and an ominous print "system initializing, please wait", which means that you have reformat the player, which means that you'll need to re-upload everything that took you so long to upload in the first place. 3-within 1.5 years, you will realize how terrible iriver is and how stressful wmp is. This will force you into purchasing an ipod. At the end, you'll end up spending the money on the new ipod, in addition to the money wasted on the iriver.  The take home message is: Spend the extra 200 and buy an ipod; otherwise, you'll end up spending more. If you do not believe me and you think that I am just a mean disgruntled customer who's out there to get iriver, then forget what I said and do the research yourself. Go to google and type in keywords such as "system initializing", "playlists", "freezing on start up"...etc. you will see for yourself that the iriver is a problem, and wmp is even a bigger problem.   Note that when you're synchronizing, all hell breaks loose due to: 1-wmp changes the playlists almost randomly. 2-some files are supposedly transferred to the iriver but they just don't show up in the iriver. You will be puzzled and confused, not knowing what to do. 3-all of a sudden, playlists double in wmp and when you're synchronizing, not all playlists appear in iriver. It's all random I swear. The weirdest thing you'll experience. 4-this is my most dreaded: you're synchronizing, and all of a sudden, iriver encounters a file extension that is not supported by the player. The synchronization processes freezes and the player freezes too. Wmp may also freeze. And yet wmp, tell you "synchronization is progress" when in fact it's not. You cannot refreash wmp and you cannot disconnect the usb and you cannot turn off the player itself. You're forced to turn off your computer by ctr-alt-del method and to reset the player using the paper clip method. It is extremely stressful and time consuming. You will be angry and stressed out because you will feel that you did something wrong, when in fact it's the system that is so wrong that there is just nothing you can do to make right or smooth.  Be a smart shopper and don't even consider iriver mp3 players, unless you are a masochist and you enjoy torture and stress.   Little by little, it is becoming very clear to everyone that apple products are better even if they are more costly. After all, I truly believe that apple products are not only costlier due to sleek design but also due to better performance.

<Title>Works fine with WMP 11 and Vista
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased refurbished 8/07 with my Vista laptop. I like it but struggled with it the first 4 hours, reformatted it (nice feature) a few times using firmware updater program (download from iRiver) and started over. Once you understand it, it is actaully straightforward, but not as intuitive as hoped. Instructions say it works only with Win Media Player 10 but actually works great w/ the latest version 11. My advice - spend time cleaning up Id3 tags (Title, Artist, Album, etc.) before Sync-ing mp3s. Those tags end up being your folder structure for browing the players mp3 folders (by album, artist, etc.). Had trouble prior to id3 tag cleanup, created an inaccesible 'Unknown Artist' folder. My experience, the program that comes with the player for Windows Explorer like-functionality (Copy/Paste mp3s) wouldn't work on both my XP and my Vista laptops (shows 'Disconnected'). Actual Windows Explorer browsing to the player like a USB drive locked my unit up forcing me to push the reset/restart button (with a paper clip) so don't bother, stick w/ Sync-ing in WMP 11. What you save in $$, you'll pay back time spent understanding and making it work. iPod 30 GB more expensive but way easier interface

<Title>Long time owner
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, there is a small level of computer knowledge required to really use this thing at its full potential. Not much, just the ability to drag and drop files in windows. If you can do that, then you do not have to have your player tied down to any software, you can mix and match file types within album folders if you so choose, something that would melt itunes or windows media. The radio is excellent, the battery is decent, the screen is nice, the sound is very good. It looks nice, survives falls easily. The ability to read text files and record voice is good for students. Plus if you carry this around, and you dont really need a thumb drive. so why only two stars? Cause the longest I have ever heard one of these things lasting was just under two years. Generally the firmware fails somehow and you can no longer transfer files. The mini jack is not of the highest quality (when obviously the mini jack should be the most durable thing about any portable music player.) If you do get one for like 50$ or something be sure to carry around a small paper clip btw, you will need to reset it semi regularly.

<Content>Pros: Hold a lot of music, very user friendly, great sound quality, very durable, good battery life. Cons are: large (if that bothers you), freezes from time to time, I had a lot of issues getting it synced with my computer. Other than that, It works great.

<Title>I was satisfied
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this iriver although I can't use it anymore lol. I got this in 2005. I know its a bit late for me to be writing this review, but I was able to store more than enough music on this mp3 player. I have actually been a big fan of iriver but they went down a lot. I have had three irivers and this was either my second or third I don't remember but it plays pretty good. I would still have it if my boyfriend didn't start borrowing it did something to it. I don't know what he did but it doesn't work anymore lol. Its small and cute and not very bulky. The only issue I have with this as I had with one of the other irivers is that it freezes a lot. Overall, besides that I was satisfied.

<Title>the things I wish I knew when I thought it was a good deal
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1) that in just a couple years, the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min. and you can't change the battery 2) the paperclip (not supplied but don't leave home with out it)Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace.  I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted, the shuffle play worked well, and was a nice music selection away from home. I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first. i won't send mine to the landfill just yet, but as soon as it quits working on 110, c'est la vie...

<Title>Line In Recording
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great player for subscription music via Rhapsody. Screen is brilliant. No complaints but one: no line in! If the player is described as a recorder, then it should have a line in. The 6G version offers an optional cradle which has a line in, but no such cradle for the 20G, and no mention of it on the iRiver site. :-(

<Title>Damn worth it !
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having researched for a while for a good mp3 player, I can now attest that this is an awesome player.  Best part is the sound quality. Very good head-set also.  I wanted a player with Radio as I listen to Radio quiet a bit and the fact that I can record out of Radio and with voice-recorder is just perfect.  Display is really good and very easy to navigate. Menu options are a breeze to figure out.  I'm really excited about the battery life. Did a lot of things starting from sync-up( of about 18GB ) out of the battery and I couldn't see any drop (!!) at all.  Areas of improvments 1. The polymer glove/belt clip. They can come up with something different and sturdy, but its good. 2. Having filled up almost to the brim, if the 'shuffle' option is turned on, sometimes I was able to feel the hard-disk seeking the song, when I hold the player @ in my hand. Its quiet a search I believe :)  But all in all, I'm very much satisfied for the money I shelled on this.  Good job iRiver !

<Title>EXCELLENT
<Date>Sat Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friend owns this, after he bought and returned the similar Samsung version.   It is excellent, with good sound and easy to navigate controls.   It stores A LOT of songs. It places them into categories, making it easy for you to find the exact song you want.   FM Tuner is also included.  You can upload pictures to this iRiver, and view them when you are listening to music.  It comes with a rechargeable battery that has a huge battery life.  If i needed 20 gb, I would get this, but I plan to get a 6 gb Creative Zen.   Last Word: Best 20 gb mp3 player out there.

<Title>Disappointing - but decent - from a frustrated Napster user
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know why anyone who doesn't use Napster would buy this device.  Good things: Good sound quality. Lightweight device. Good storage for multiple file formats, including pictures. Digital Graphic Eq. Napster Compatible. Nice form factor; comes with rubber sleeve to protect. Some nice design features. Generally works as advertised.  Bad things: Expensive. Took me 1-hour to install the firmware upgrade (required for Napster To Go). Battery life disappoints; probably because device sometimes leaves itself on even when I think it's off. The 4 bars of the battery life don't reflect the true battery life %. Software GUI isn't as efficient as it could be. You can't buy a replacement Li-Ion battery very easily at your hotel (although you can online). UBS is integrated with recharger (make it clunky). Produces occasional errors while downloading from Napster. Produces occasional error that says songs are "expired". Device freezes on occasion, requiring a batter disconnect / reconnect to reboot. Default headphones are awful. (I have been very happy with a $30 Brookstone Edition). Can't control L/R balance (at least not on the device; haven't played with the software).

<Title>Avoid for two simple reasons
<Date>Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been an iRiver fan for a long time but avoid this player for two reasons:  (1) Although you connect the player to your computer via USB, the player side of the connection does not have a standard USB port.  Why should you care?  With many other players you can charge the unit and transfer songs with a simple standard USB cable.  With this one if you forget the special cable that comes with the unit (very non-standard) then you can't charge the unit or transfer songs.  I have one USB cable for my phone, camera, etc. and want to use it for the player.  Or, if I am out of town I can be assured someone is going to have or sell a standard USB cable.  I despise the iPOD for many reasons but at least they give you a real USB connection on the player itself.  (2) DRM on the US unit.  When you connect the unit to your computer you don't get a simple drive letter to drag and drop MP3 files to/from the player.  You must have Windows XP and you must use either Windows Media Player or "Portable Device" in explorer to move files over.  This means you can copy files over but not the other way.  I hear the Korean version of the unit gives you a real drive letter.  Come on iRiver - how much did Microsoft pay you to cripple the US version?  Summary: Stay away until companies get the message loud and clear - no DRM on the unit if you have your own collection of MP3 files.  Supporting DRM services such as Napster, Audible, Yahoo, Real, etc. is fine as long as it does not prohibit the use of my own collection - make the device appear as a drive letter when connected, and gives us a standard USB connection on the player side to charge and transfer data.

<Title>Wires, wires, wires, ...
<Date>Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is not just a rant at the iRiver but all mp3 players. I just purchased the H10 20GB mp3 player and I just don't see the usefulness of these devices. All they are is a storage device with and audio chip. In order to use them I need to connect them into something that can eventually convert them to an acoustic wave.   There are a number of ways to do this:    1) Plug in a set of amplified speakers    2) Plug in an FM transmitter and receive the sound on a radio.    3) Use a set of headphones to listen directly to the music. However, each of these requires a separate device and wires, wires, wires, ...  The H10 has a build-in FM receiver but not an FM transmitter. I would much rather it have a transmitter so I wouldn't need a separate device.  The other problem that I have with this product is the USB/power cable. It is one and the same. So in order to use power (or to recharge) I need to plug in a 6' cable with a USB appendage.   I planned to use this mp3 player to carry all my music between home, auto, and work. So, I thought an FM transmitter would be the best option. This plan has a lot of problems. 1) The Belkin transmitter that I purchased has a lot of static on all channels. This might be corrected with a new transmitter 2) The FM transmitter is automatic and only transmits music when it receives an input signal. So when I start up or turn off the mp3 player I get a lot of static. 3)  Also, when I turn off the car the mp3 player doesn't know this and continues to run. This drains the batteries.   I'm going back to my mp3 CDs. When I switch to the radio or turn off the car the CD pauses. I can get 40+ songs on a CD and create my own play lists.  The only disadvantage is that I need to carry lots of CD. But the CDs are easier to organize than the pile of wires!  Just as a followup, I messed with this for a week and then returned it. I haven't decided whether I'll replace it or just keep using CDs. If I do replace it I will probably go with an iPod :-(

<Title>Highly Dissapointed
<Date>Fri Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>6 months ago I bought the Iriver H320.  This device was incredible.  Drive letter access.  You just drag and dropped files into the unit and played em.  no software, no worrying that your playlists are configured or track tags are proper. sadly the unit was stolen a few weeks back.  Having had great luck with its predesessor, I purchased the new HD10 20 GB player as the H320 is no longer available.  IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!  no drive letter access really upsets me.  The transfer rate is slow, the usp/combined power cable? why?  the old unit allowed usb charging, so I could leave my power cable at work and use usb charging at home or on my laptop when out of town.  No I have to carry around 2 cables (Designer should be fired)    the up down slider bar, is very unresponsive and jumps, causing you to overshoot what you are looking for. why couldn't they just stay with the buttons?  I think even giving this item one star after the H320 is being nice.  Iriver you "improved" upon a great product and failed.

One thing that annoys me is that the LCD lights on randomly while the song plays. sound quality is really good, the SRS effect helps in audio quality. Good LCD screen, with bright enough display to view even during daytime,  I got this product over the iPod even tho it was a little costlier was because of the features it offered. I am pleased with the product and looking forward to the next firmware release.

<Title>Best you can get
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start off by saying that I have owned or used many mp3 players. Iriver h120, h320, rca lyra, ipod(not the color one), Creative zen xtra, the new samsung, and many more. The only mp3 player that beats this one is the h120, and you can't buy that one anymore. No software is needed at all. plug it into your cpu, go to my computer, and drag and drop. it took 35 minutes for me to transfer 3200 songs. has fm, fm recorder, and timer for the fm recorder. Nice if you would like to record a morning show or something while your at work. Turns on instantly, great sound quality, easy navigation. People say the albums are not in order, rename your files via musicmatch or what ever and have the track number first. this will solve that problem. You can search for your music or files with the browser function. Very nice if you like a more computer type of navigation. This is currently the best mp3 player on the market, I've only metioned a few features of this player. If your into electronics, this is the player to get. If your more about being cool and don't mind software that controls your music then I would suggest an ipod. In my eyes this player has the ipod beat in every area, with the exception of acceseries. Not to bash the ipod of coursel. Even I'll admit that the ipod is pretty cool and if it wasn't for all of it's restrictions, I would buy one, if there was no iriver of course.

<Title>Beats the iPod hands down
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iRiver has it all figured out, for sure. The only thing I've noticed that I dont like about the player is a slight lag when opening songs to play, but thats a small price to pay for everything else.   For Windows users, there couldnt be a better product! I manage my music library through Windows Media Player (which I highly recommend), so when I took my H10 out of the box all I did was sync it with my computer and bam --- my entire music library is now in my pocket! I love it. And the automatic sync updates any changes in your library when you connect, so the changes are then in your player too. (You can have manual syncs if you want, also).   And in case you're wondering, the case that comes with it is a rubber, sleeve-like thing that fits around the player with holes for the screen and buttons. The clip is pretty sturdy, I dont think its going anywhere.  Overall, I cant get over how great everyone thinks the iPod is; unless your a fan of Macintosh, its all about the H10!

<Title>Nothing Less Than 5 Star
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sorry Ipod people, the IRiver H10 has taken the lead in the MP3 world. I think Ipods are great. They're quality made, with a very intuitive interface. But I just finished a long time of researching and trying out different players, and I settled on the IRiver H10. Every day since I have patted myself on the back for this choice. It one-ups all other players in all categories. My #1 recommendation though is to go somewhere like Best Buy and try out all the players you're considering. We all think differently and one person's favorite scroller could be another's worst nightmare. For me, there are no downsides to this player yet. Some may  have a problem with it using Windows Media Player 10, or others may like having the hundreds of accessories that Ipod leaves at your disposal, but for me this player is everything I want and more. Definitely a big thumbs up.

<Content>I Purchased my 20gb h10 about a week ago and I love it.  It is very easy to navagate through and it looks and sounds awesome.  The main feature that the h10 has is easy to use software.  This was the main reason why I did not get an ipod.  The itunes software for the ipod was so difficult to use that it kept me from buying one.  The h10 on the other hand has got to have the most user friendly software on the planet which to me was a huge selling point.  If you purchase the h10 you will not be disappointed.

<Title>Stopped working on the first day
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this product from Best Buy. I had a predilection to purchase an iRiver product as my current iRiver mp3 player had lasted problem free for close to three. Therefore, I brought my new investment home, read the instructions, tinkered with it, and finally, and synced it with my computer. Initially, I was very impressed. I was able to transfer files quickly and directly through MS Explorer. Hence, I transferred about 3gb of audio onto the player.  Still, I was impressed. The sound quality was unbelievable and I was overwhelmed with the innumerous features and equalizations settings of the player. I was so impressed that I figured I would test out the alarm clock feature. So, I re-synced the player (as a note, the USB connection/charger is terribly designed) and attempted to load one small mp3 file onto the player. As a clicked on the music folder which I wanted to transfer the file into, MS Explorer froze. I could not access the file system of the mp3 player. Subsequently, unplugging the player from the USB in an attempt to restore the player to working condition was of no benefit. As a result, both my computer and the player froze. After resetting player and my computer and connected the player again, as I had did the glorious first attempt where I successfully transferred 3gb, the player malfunctioned again. I repeated this process about five times, no success. Then, the player itself could no longer buffer files that were already in its hard drive. For example, nothing selected through the 'music' directory on the player would work and caused the player to freeze; files could only be played through the 'browser.' Additionally, the player would no longer record audio as it did previously. Any attempt to save a recorded file would again lead to freezing. Apparently, iRiver has not perfected their firmware to properly buffer inputs into the massive hard drive, or perhaps, only my player is dysfunctional.  I continued testing my player in the following days; but alas, no success. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy. Honestly, I think this is a great product in thought, especially considering all of the equalization settings and the fm radio. However, it appears that iRiver has not done sufficient testing to work out all the bugs of this product. It appears as if iRiver was in a rush to compete with the growing dominance of the iPod. I commend iRiver on their ingenuity in constructing a highly capable player in such a small package, but the product needs improvement. I look forward to a future generation free of tremendous flaws.

<Date>Fri Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a teacher and have the summer off. This has allowed me tons of time to do research. This product does the most for the best price! I have had it for 3 days and it is so EASY to use. The battery life is amazing. I have been listening to it all day from 8 am till 6 pm and still have 1/2 battery life. The sound is stunning and there are a ton of EQ settings to choose from.. The interface is very intuative. I read the negative remarks of other people and can only assume ther received a lemon. This device amazes me with a new feature discoved daily. The silicone case it comes with is plenty good (other reviews said it sucked). I suggest that you become familiar with the keys and buttons of your H10 before putting the silicone case on because the case covers some buttons from visual view BUT they still work by pushing the silicone. I suggest you buy better headphones. You can use the windows media player 10 (provided on the CD that comes in the box)to help sync the h10 with your computer or Windows XP instantlly recognizes the H10 as a seperate drive. Either is just as good.I also bought the FM broadcaster by iriver and it is really powerful as well, the only key is that you have your volume at half on your H10 or the sound is distorted- but you can easily turn you radio volume up and down as needed. I have nothing but glowing things to say about this player...oh wait 1 thing- the photo feature is great but they are not the sharpest pictures. Good enough but not 5 megapixel greatness.  Stop reading this review and get your hands on one!!!

The player itself is outstanding - great features at a terrific price (20GB, color, radio, WPM,etc.) My son was really excited about getting this. HOWEVER, I spent countless hours trying to get Windows XP and WMP to recognize it. My research on the web indicated that many people are experiencing the same difficulties. It worked OK on Best Buy's computer, but, not a chance on my son's. Fortunately I was able to return it to Best Buy. My son and I are really disappointed because it is an excellent product, except for the Windows issue. FORGET IRIVER SUPPORT AND ESPECIALLY THEIR USELESS WEB SITE.

<Content>This is a great MP3 player, but I am highly dissappointed that Best Buy had none left. The storesperson said that this was a very popular item, even more popular than the iPod, and that it is very hard to get this item. I asked her to hold one for me. She said that was okay and they were getting more the next day. So before you go to Best Buy (currently, that's the only retail store that carries the H1020GB), make sure that they have one in stock, and ask to hold it for you.  So, if I have no info on the H1020GB, why would I give it 5 stars. My friend has one of these, and they are way above any MP3 player. The sound is excellent, and has an equalizer. You can drag-and-drop your songs. It's easy to use with it's touchpad. The cost is the same of the 20GB iPod that doesn't have any features.  Get this.

I'm a poor college kid, so the fact that this player was so reasonably priced was definitely what initially drew me to this one.  But once I started reading the reviews, I started getting a little freaked out.  I decided that I would get it anyways, and I love it!  It has frozen on me once, but that's a complete human error.

<Content>I like this products the sound it is nice and the space is AWESOME! I didn't think that it would have that much space.  The only negative thing about it, is the speed. Like if want to change the song and you click on the that song, it takes about 10 - 20 sec. But then again i am very impatient. Also the battery gauge, tells you what the battery is at, is not that good. Like everytime that I check on the battery (after charging it for a while) it is at the same position as the last time that I looked. That is just irritating.  But besides all of that, it is awesome.

<Title>Great sound but hangs a lot
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned mine now for over 1.5yrs and I like it a lot.  I got a great deal on it at the time only $199 at Best Buy.    First let me list my major dislikes:    - This player hangs a lot.  Most of the time, a reset does the trick.  But I have needed to refresh the database 3 times and wipe the device clean by doing a prom upgrade 2 times.  I kow this is not a small problem, so know that this will be an issue if you decide to purchase this product and keep your playlists and songs saved on your computer so you can get back to normal if you need to do the firmware upgrade.        - The software on the device is not very good.  For example, you cannot delete a song from the device directly, you must do it by pluginh into the computer.  Also very annoying is that there is no bookmark feature and the fast forward is a joke.  If you plan to listen to audio books or long recordings, I would not recommend this player AT ALL.    - The FM radio is okay to have but the reception is usually not great so I hardly use it.    - Transfers take a very very long time.  Especially when you have to transfer a lot of files like say after a firmware upgrade.  If you are still reading, on with the good news:    - 20GB of space is a lot of space.  You can fit more music than you would know what to do with on the player.  I have over 48 hrs of audio on my device and I still have over 60% free space.      - The sound is great.    - The audio recording is great (Main reason I bought it and I have not been disappointed)    - The radio is okay but I hardly use it.    - Works with Yahoo music unlimited.  Bottom line, you have to be very patient with if you decide to get this product.  You will not get much support from the company and their online documentation sucks.  But if you want a music player that can play MP3, WMA and subscription music, sounds great, NO DRM and offers lots of space for all your music, you can't beat the value of this device.

<Title>Would not recommend this player
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My iRiver H20 has been a very big disappointment.  I've had to reformat the hard drive at least 4 times - about every 2 months which is a huge drag because you lose everything.  I've sent it to iriver once for a new hard drive.  It does not work well with Napster - crashes every time - yes EVERY TIME!  And now my scroll bar scrolls down to zero and stays there so I can't use it.  Mine is going in the trash rather than sending it in to pay for it to be fixed (out of warranty) when I know it won't fix all of the rest of the problems.  If you check the iRiver customer support site user forum, you will see the long list of issues with the H10/H20.  Invest in something better!

<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Iriver H10-20GB for over a year and a half and it continues to be a solid, reliable player. I use a software program called Media Monkey to manage my music library and it syncs with no problem. I have to admit I don't ask alot from my player - just store and play music. I especially like the long battery life. I recommend this product.

<Content>I am 57 with minimal tech experience.  I found it so easy to download and copy to this player.  I was pretty sure I would have difficulty and had hesitated in making this purchase but my sister has an iriver so I knew if I had any problem she could help me.  I love it.  I didn't even have to read the instructions.  Well maybe a little.  The sound is good also.

<Title>Plays well but  . . . .
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think that the iRiver plays well, and I have had no trouble downloading from napster. However, I have had to reformat it at least four times in the past year. It is a drag because I have to reload songs every time I do that. This last time I can't even seem to re-format it. I've emailed customer service but their solutions haven't seemed to work. I'd rather a player that was more reliable. It is irritating when I am some where and want to listen and ooops the music won't play for no reason, and instead I get an error message. I'm a simple person and don't try to do too many things, but I would like it to work all the time.

<Title>Dumbed up iRiver
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this unit because of my experience with the iRiver iHp 120.  Though it's styling and features and color screen have come a long way, it no longer can be used the way it's predecesors can be used.  It's been designed to sync w/ WM10 and you can no longer use it as a straight mass storage device. Though you candrag and drop you need to create folders on your PC and then drag tham into the H10.  Therefore, I returned it and found that the iAudio x5 performs  like the old iHp120 and as they say, sorry iRiver, i've had to move on as iRiver has had to due to DRM.

<Title>nice but difficult
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the H10(20GB) player for a week. Having used other iriver players (512mg player) I felt comfortable with the choice. I am not in any way computer or eletronics savvy so products must be consumer friendly. From the start I had difficulties. The initial start up had a faulty disc. Trying the phone support took three tries. But when the player was finally downloaded it played nice. Easy to navigate the basic programs. Completely compatible with WMP. Nice window, easy on the eyes. But the difficulties arose again. The manual sucks in helping with anything or explaining things completely. The phone support was nice but never understood my objective question. Mostly "How the hell does this thing work." After three calls and constant web site visits I can still can not figure out the suffle mode. Sometimes the touch controls are not touch because you have to press them several times to get them to work. Again I stress, I need an extremely consumer friendly player. This just wasn't it. And because I realize that some of the difficulties made have been from consumer errors (that is way I gave it a 3 and not a 2)the support just was not there. I imagine if you are computer/electronics savvy this would be a very nice player for you.

<Title>Great Player-Glad I Got it over the iPOD
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did a lot of research before I bought an mp3 player and finally decided on the H10 20 GB. I went back and forth between this one and the new iPod with the color screen. I know several people who have iPods and have had problems with "denting" the screen and scratching the case. I have had no such problems with the H10. Also, the H10 has a digital FM radio, which is great in general or if you work out at a gym where the channels on the TV are broadcast over closed circuit FM. Presetting stations is a snap. It was extremely easy to use, straight out of the box. All the new ones are currently shipping with the most up to date firmware so there is no need for any upgrades at this point.   Controls are very intuitive and easy to use. Lots of different settings to give you control over almost every aspect of the player. If you get this player, consider getting Napster to Go. You can fill and refill the player with as many songs as you want for $15 a month. Downloading directly to the player is quick and easy. Sound quality is excellent. Much better than the iPod in my opinion. Battery life is awesome too. I have gotten 19+ hours at a time,excellent for long plane trips, recharges quickly also.  Bottom line, I'm sure I made the right decision over the iPod, very happy with my H10.

<Title>One of worst devices I have ever seen
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I cannot explain the good reviews here.  I earlier gave this H10 three stars but I am now forced to revise my opinion downward.  This device has demonstrated non-stop stupidity of design since I bought it two months ago.  The Biggest problem is that the device 'freezes' up so that even the off button wont work.  I am forced to use a paper clip (which I must now carry everywhere I take the H10) to insert into the reset hole, thus shutting it down.  This freezing is generally unpredictable.  It happens during playback, song selection, even during downloading.  When it freezes during downloading, it also causes the downloading program to freeze (I have seen this with both Windows Media Player 10 and with real's Rhapsody - which I use for the rhapsody-to-go service.)  At that point I have to use the paper clip on the H10 and use the task manager on XP to force the program to close.  I have the latest firmware and iRiver has failed to respond (at all) to my request for information on the problem.  Also, the device shuts itself off shortly after the final song plays, which is usually not a bad idea.  However, I have had the device run the battery all the way to nothing while I thought it was off.  I suspect it was actually just frozen with the screen blank.  There are other software glitch problems too.  It doesn't seem to know which songs it has already played when using random play mode.  It plays some songs many times and others not at all.  When using the playlist feature it actually played other songs (not on the playlist) while showing that it was playing one on the list.  The list of songs for any given artist seems to be limited.  In some cases many songs for that artist don't show up even though I downloaded them and can see them with the downloading software.  Aside from the software problems there are also a number of hardware design problems.  The rubber protector casing that comes with it has a belt clip on it but the rubber is so soft and maliable that you can't use the clip becuase you can't force it open.  Further the rubber actually ripped on mine within only hours of first use.  The buttons are extremely slow and sometimes outright unresponsive.  The volume control in particular is so slow it is infuriating.  If someone wants to talk to me, I have to take literally 5 seconds or more to turn down the volume.  They also put controls on four surfaces so that you can't easily hold the device while playing or you will accidentally change songs or restart them, etc.  Finally, it may be just a problem with the rhapsody-to-go service (I'm not sure), but the thing refuses to play songs often after only a couple of days, saying that the song's license has expired.  Also, it loses songs and even whole artists.  Sometimes selecting a particular artist or song causes the device to freeze up.  Once it even displayed a bunch of Chinese characters as the name of an artist - and I'm sure I didn't download that.  After these problems surface, I have to reload the firmware and wipe out all of the content on the device and then reload it.  This process takes an hour or more and if I try to download too many songs at once, that's right, it freezes!:(  I cannot recommend this device for anyone.  No, not even my worst enemy.  Hope this helps you avoid my mistake.

<Title>Great Design - HORRIBLE Reliability
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player based largely on customer feedback I read on-line (ironically, in part because of a review that touted the reliability of this model compared to the iPod). And I have to say that I absolutely love the design and functionality of the H10. But the reliability of this model, at least from my experience, is deplorable. I ordered one from Amazon about two months ago and loaded it up with my mp3's. And the first week was great. Then the player simply stopped working. So I returned it to Amazon for a replacement and they promptly sent me another one. Great service. I loaded up the new one with my music and once again everything was great for about a week. Then the player started doing strange things - the display would turn on at random, it would download songs in random order from Windows Media Player, and the battery would not accept a charge. So I'm sending it back for a refund. I have to say I'm really disappointed because the player fits my needs very well.  This is the first time I've had an experience with "infant mortality" in an electronic device. And it happened twice! My advice to you is DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL.

<Title>great hard drive mp3 player but has some flaws
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this is a great mp3 player but the design of it was made to compete with the ipod.  the touch strip down the middle does not work the way it should and is still very usefull.  the screen is a rather low resolution and jpg's will show many unwanted artifacts as a result of the compression.  some jpg's don't and some do.  the storage capabilities as far as file storage are almost useless.  the mp3 player is not a standard hard drive and has different rules than one.  you can't run any programs or open files from the hard drive.  you must copy them first.  the mp3 playing capabilities are excellent.  great sound qualitiy and the colors make the menu's so easy to navigate.  if you are looking for a color picture viewer and removable hdd then look at the gigabeat.  but for those of you that want a large copacity hdd mp3 player then this is for you.

<Title>Get Ready To Rock Out !!
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did all my research before getting an iRiver.  At first I was dead set on having a "flash player."  Concerned about moving around with a hard drive device.  However I don't jog with it and during my work-out routine, I place the player in a belted tune holder.  Nice & secure !  I had no problems with reading over the directions and getting this up and running.  I also found some very useful sites for added info.  Just run a search for iRiver Forums.  I was one of those people that had a hard time going from cassette tapes to CD's....LOL !   I truly wish I had bought a mp3 player a long time ago.  I chose the H10 (20 GB) because I know it will be a long time before I have to do any upgrading.  This device has everything !  The sound will BLOW YOU AWAY !!I also wanted to be sure that I had something that would be compatible with any of the music sites.  Mainly for the "All You Can Eat" music downloads.  I bought mine at Best Buy store.  I was willing to settle for the....  1 GB version.  But at the time they were offering a free $30.00 gift card with purchase of the H10, and free two month subscription to Napster.   So basically for an extra $75.00 bucks I could go from 1 GB to 20 GB.   Too good to pass up.    I have read complaints about the scroll bar.  DON'T use it like a regular computer scroll bar.....Just press either the top or bottom of it.  If your searching it will pick up speed very fast !  I do believe that as we get close to Christmas we will see newer models of all types coming out.  I suspect to see everything else slowing dropping in price.  :)

<Content>Like other reviewers, I was excited the first couple days I had this.  Used it with yahoomymusic.com subscription service and was thrilled.  The sound was great and it worked - for two days.  Then the model powered down from a full charge to no charge while turned off.  It accepted a charge but then played the music only erratically.  Looked up the internet site and found that iriver no longer has a firmward upgrade/format program for the 20gb model!  The iriver technician told me it had been taken off the web because "it wasn't solving the problem it was supposed to fix!"  Just now, I have tried the database refresh function and the device has frozen up completely!  I have e-mailed Amazon for a replacement.  I will try another model to see if just this one is defective - I hope the next one will work because I really did like it while it was running.  Will update once I have the new model.

<Title>I'd rather have an H10 over a basic 20 GB iPod, anyday.
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Where to start?  Well, feature-wise its far superior to the standard 20 GB. For the same cost as the afore mentioned iPod you can have the same amount of memory, in a slightly smaller and slightly lighter package. It includes a built FM tuner (which is unavailable in  iPod's, and unfortunately you need to purchase external adapters for your iPod to even play the radio), voice and FM recording (another feature that the iPod can only obtain via an adapter), a color screen (whihc is now becoming a standard feature and has recently been added to iPods). It also gets a longer battery life than most of the competition, including the iPod. Also, its compatible with a wider range of file formats than the standard iPod, including .jpgs.  My one knock on the H10 is its medicore navigation. While it's touchpad won't cause songs to change, fastfoward, rewind, or  pause as it slides around in your pocket (like the iPod tends to), its not very ergonomic. The vertical scroll touchpad gets the job done but its not as cool as the iPod's wheel.  Pros: -Comaptible with a wider range of files than the standard iPod. -Picture Display. -Color Screen. -Accessories (which can only be ordered from the iRiver website since iPod seems to have a monopoly at stores for shelf space). -Built in FM tuner. -Built in voice and FM recorder.  -Smaller and lighter than the standard 20GB iPod. -Being able to use Real, WinAmp (with plugins), and FooBar (also with plugins) allows the sound files to maintain their quality, which iTunes actually tends to deminish (particularly the bass and treble). -Better built in equalizer and even SRS Wow features. -Larger variety of online music stores that you can order music off of. -Large color variety. It comes in red, blue, platinum, and gray. -Doesn't get scratched up like the iPod's tend to (because it doesn't have a metallic back).  Cons: -Inconvenient navigation. -If you want accessories like cradles, car adapters, boom box and/or stereo adapters, and replacements for lost accessories, you'll have to order them off of the iRiver website. Theres nothing wrong with this, but it requires a wait and the extra charge for shipping and handling. However, you can pretty much use any iPod accessorie that only requires the headphone jack, (since they're universal) including some of the nicer Bose surround sound and sound canceling headphones. -Not as pleasing to the eyes as the simple, curvy, plain white iPod.

<Title>Works OK if your patient and like to scroll
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this MP3 for 14 months now.  It was a cheaper alternative to some of the more popular "i" MP3 players, not to mention NOT manufactured by Apple.    It plays music nicely, and has great battery life.  The interface is garbage though.  When I picked the player up at my local retailer, I went through the menus and didn't realize how much scrolling would be involved once I uploaded my MP3's.  This device uses the Contributing Artist, rather than the Artist tag in the "Artist" menu option.  I have over 400 CD's (a few thousand MP3s) on the device.  Most have more than one contributing artist which creates quite the list of artits.  Album name works much better, but who can remember all the album names?  Don't even consider going to the Song Title list, not if you have thousands of MP3s.    Uploading firmware updates is a royal pain.  I've only been able to accomplish it one time.  The instructions are quite vague and you have to be precise to within a quarter of a second on your timing (or so it seems.)    The player has frozen on me many times, and the only way to reset is to hit the reset button, in a tiny hole too small for even a paperclip (staples work, and I've found one pen with a small enough tip)  Playlists are not generated on the device.  You must create them in Windows Media Player.  It synchronizes well (I'm sure thanks to the WMP synch-engine) and does not duplicate files if they're on multiple playlists.    FM Radio worked very well, I enjoyed flying across the country trying to pick up radio stations.  However, the interface is still bad.  Power cable is weird.  To use the AC adapter, you have to plug it into a socket on the USB synch cable.  Makes for a nice tangle of wires.  Synchronizes text files.  Why? I still haven't figured it out.  You can't edit the files...  Synchronizes pictures.  Good display, but tiny. Almost no point on such a tiny screen.  Controls are actually desinged quite nicely.  The slider bar is a bit sensitive sometimes, and not perfectly accurate, but it takes practice (just don't get out of practice!)  Suggest you skip this device and buy an "i" MP3 player or better yet, a Zune.  Few more $$, but worth it!

<Title>Good for those with low standards or little music.
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a big fan of iRiver. My first player was a flash player of theirs. 512 mb, built like a rock. This one, not so much.  The biggest problem I have is the software. One thing I loved about my old iRiver was the fact that I could just drag and drop my files anywhere, rename files and folders with ease, and set things up the way I liked. However, this isn't possible since now iRiver teamed up with Microsoft and you have to sync your files with WMP, which actually kind of sucks. You have to deal with it putting your files wherever it wants to. For example, I was hoping that my Brandenburg Concertos and Goldberg Variations (both by Johann Sebastian Bach) could go in the same folder, conveniently named 'J.S Bach.' Not so. One CD of concertos is permanently under, "San Marco Luigi Varese' while another is under 'Johann Sebastian Bach' and the third is under 'J.S Bach'. The Goldberg Variations are under 'Glenn Gould'. Or with my indie. I have three items by Abandon Ship. Two of them are filed under 'Abandon Ship" (lucky me) and the other one is under "Happy Endings". That's the album name. It also decides randomly that it doesn't know who an album is by, so a lot of music gets lumped in to 'Unknown Artist'. If you remember all your album names, though, you're set. A tip: If you have, say, Abbey Road and Yellow Submarine and you were fortunate enough to have them both go under 'The Beatles," when you go to that host folder there will be an option to go to 'All' or the individual albums. Go to the individual albums if you want the songs to be in their original order. Otherwise, it's alphabetical or some irrational 'logic' for classical tracks.  So basically, what I liked best about iRiver -the easy software- is gone and now I'm screwed.   To be fair, if I only had a couple albums or just put all my music on shuffle, I wouldn't really care. As it is, I find it incredibly annoying that I have to stop and scroll around through a million folders just to get to another song from the same (multi-CD) album.  I also made the mistake of downloading the beta version of the newest WMP; so it syncs all my files. Sure, I can make sync list, but it goes straight through that and then in to everything else.  The 'reset' button sucks. It's too small. You can't use a paper clip, but if you have a lot of staples with you or a really fine-tip pen, you're okay. Fortunately I've only needed to use it twice.  The FM tuner is the only really decent part of the player. You get really good reception, you can record stuff (although you can't change the volume while recording, which isn't so great) and it only takes a little bit of memory to get used to the weird file names. Lots of numbers. Possibly something about the date but I'm not sure.  Picturewise it's sort of useless. You can have some little pictures or poor-quality big ones. Woohoo. My phone does better.  The microphone -mine broke the day after my warranty expired, but that's just me- is good quality and useful for quick notes if you don't have a pencil handy. Disadvantage is that I can't figure out how to take those files _off_ with WMP, so you should be brief before you start taking up impressive amounts of space.   Text scroller's fine. If you have a .txt file you're just burning to read, it kills time even though the small screen sort of kills your eyes.  Basically, iRiver is a decent company but this player doesn't live up to what I know they can do. Get a different iRiver, a Zen or an iPod instead.

To the guy a couple of reviews above me I'd like him to take his computer's harddrive outside, drop it on the ground, and come back and tell us if it works. Its an HDD there are thin foil/mylar disks inside. The manual tells you if you drop it damage will occur..  Nice player, good alternative for iPod, along with some other HDD players.

<Title>Not recommended
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because it seemed like a very good price for 20GB and an FM radio. I should have known you get what you pay for!   Problems:  1- You can only add/delete files through Windows Media Player, which is NOT a user-friendly programme.  I have had endless difficulties with: sound files being mysteriously dumped into the wrong artist folder; not actually synchronising to the device when WMP says they do; WMP giving the wrong artist/track info for a CD and then copying that info onto the device *even after I've manually changed it in Windows*; WMP copying the same songs onto the device twice, etc.  I've had to completely wipe the thing and reformat it a couple times to fix these problems.  2- The device freezes and needs to be reset a LOT.  With a paper clip. No problem if you're listening to it at home... big problem if you're listening to it on, say, a bus in the middle of the Spanish countryside...  3- The customer service. The first time I emailed them was to ask whether I would need a voltage converter (I bought the iRiver in America but I live in Europe).  The reply I got was yes, I did. However, before I got the reply, I happened to discover on my own that I only need a plug adapter.  If I had taken the advice of their own customer service people I would have fried the thing!!  I also once emailed them and asked them for help with Problem X; they replied "since you are having Problem Y..."  And I'm still waiting for a response to an email I sent a week ago...  4- It's a pain to listen to your tunes on shuffle if you switch between music and radio a lot.   5- The shuffle itself has a major flaw.  Even if you set it to "shuffle all", it only shuffles within songs that begin with either the same letter, or a letter nearby in the alphabet, as the first song it plays. So if you start on a song that begins with A, it will only play songs whose titles begin with the letters A, B, or C.    6- The battery indicator only works on an off and on basis.  Sometimes after being fully recharged, it will still show only as many bars as it showed before I recharged it.  This can be fixed by resetting the device but really, why should I have to?  7- Even when the battery indicator is "working", it isn't really a reliable indicator of how much battery you have left. It shows four bars for most of its working life. Once it gets down to three bars, it seems to go to two very quickly and at that point you'd better just charge it because one bar and then no bars follow very quickly indeed.    All in all, even considering the price, I do not think this is a good quality player and I would recommend saving up a little more money and buying something better.

<Title>Liked it, but wouldn't buy it agian.
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my H10 for almost a year from now, and have had mixed feelings about it.  First, my disclaimer: I'm not a fan of iPods. Actually, I hate them. Going hand-in-hand with that, I'm a very big fan of iRiver. Good company. I owned a flash-based player by them and liked it a lot, before it got stolen on a vacation. So I went looking for a new player. I decided to upgrade my memory capacity, and was looking at iRivers. This player was the obvious choice. The deciding factors in my purchase were the memory capacity, good sound quality, the built in FM tuner, and the integration with Windows Media Player [I'm also a supporter of WMP....and I hate iTunes]. Before I bought the player I read all the reviews carefully. It's a lot of money to spend if you don't.  Everything I bought the player for worked well. The things I didn't buy the player for are what made me less happy about it.  In many of the reviews I read, people reported that the player froze frequently, needing to be re-set. I thought that these were flukes, and that iRiver would have fixed this in the latest firmware upgrade. Apparently I was wrong. My player does freeze. Frequently. Oddly enough, it seems to happen more often when it's hot. I finally took to taping a paper clip to the back of the player.  There were other problems with the player I didn't notice immediately, and had not read about in other reviews. The player would start freezing while I was transferring files to it. Problem.  Other transfer problems include files not transferring completely - i.e. WMP, Napster etc. says the file transferred to the player, but when I disconnect the player from the computer, only some of the files are there. Sometimes I'll find them later in the "Unknown Artist" folder, or more often than not, they're simply gone.   Many people complain about the battery life of the player. I've experienced this problem as well, but apparently unlike them, I know why it happens. Amazon says you can get 16 hours of playback on one charge. This is based on playback at 128 kbps and volume level 20 out of 40. Let me tell you now that unless you're an audiophile, 128kbps sounds exactly the same as anything higher. That's the standard quality of a CD. I suspect that most listeners who complain about their battery life listen to their music at high volumes. Not only does this damage your hearing, but it does happen to decrease your battery life. I'll tell you now that I would never listen to my player at a volume higher than 20, because any higher could easily damage your hearing. Trust me, my mom's an audiologist, and I've been lectured on this a lot. Leave your volume at a comfortable 10, and you can easily get 24 hours or more out of your battery. Leave it at 40 [I've done it before, when attaching my player to speakers] and, oh guess what, your battery life goes all to hell.  The lesson I learned: Never take a review as the truth, but heed them, and don't disbelieve them.  Make your own decision. I made mine.

<Title>Frustrating
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iRiver H10 is the worst electronic device I have owned. The directions are limited, customer service is almost non-existent. The player is wonderful when it works right, but freezes up and has to be reset or even reformatted frequently. I finally sent my player back to iRiver after 8 months expecting to have it exchanged for a new one. It was still under warranty. After 2 weeks, I received my own H10 back. It appears that it was reformatted, but that is all. No explanation was included. My h10's latest problem, for about the last month, is that it will not play any of my purchased Napster tracks, saying the license is expired on all of them. I spent 2-3 hours on the phone with Napster on this [they, by contrast, are very helpful] and even downloaded tracks directly to the player from Napster and received the same message. I am out the purchase price of the player and can get no help from the company. I have waited on the phone anywhere from 20 to 70 minutes and have only once spoken to a person. It's like the company exists only on the web. Their FAQs are not bad, but sometimes you need more than FAQs. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009H9PZU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5809361-4179646">iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 Player/Recorder (Blue)</a>Stay away from iRiver!

<Title>What gives?
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading a few reviews on this little device, I thought I should try and offset things a bit.  It seems that a lot of people have had trouble with this player, or with customer service, or with synchronizing - or any number of other things.    However, I purchased my H10 about a year ago and absolutely love it.  Got to be one of my best purchases ever. It is somewhat bulky, but it's a 20 GB player, if you want to go jogging with your mp3 player you should get something smaller, but this is not "too" big.  It will easily fit in your pocket - i just don't know if I'd go running with it.  I've not had any issues with having to reset frequently, or ever had to reformat the drive.  I've never lost any songs or tag information.  I don't own an iPod to compare, but I would not hesitate to recommend an H10 to any of my friends.

<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Iriver for about a week, and am rather pleased.    Here are the only problems I'm having with it:  -Poor bass boost.  The CD player I used before buying this had amazing bass boost, and the Iriver is mediocre in this category (and its not just the headphones)  -Sorting.  One thing Itunes does that the Iriver does not do is combining files (for example) by "Beatles" and "The Beatles"  I had to go through and rename them each after I'd put them on the Iriver, mildly annoying.  -It only works on Windows XP, which was fine for me.  But I would be annoyed if I had to go out and get it just for my mp3 player.  Thats about it. I love the screen, all the extra goodies (radio, voice recorder, picture file, etc.)  I reccomend this mp3 player.

<Title>Some annoyances, but overall Solid Player
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>***Please note that I have not used the photo or text features enough to review them***  This is an overall good player, but there are some annoying things about it. The interface and color screen are quite nice. The player comes with no software, as it is meant to be used with Windows Media Player 10. While this is a little annoying to get used to at first (it was for me, even though I'm quite familiar with Windows), once you get the hang of it, it is actually a very nice feature. All you need to do is add tracks to your library and sync the whole library. Or you can just sync playlists, which is a very nice feature. You just add or delete songs to playlists as you wish, then when you sync the device WMP10 knows which songs to keep, add, or delete from your device. While there are more Cons than Pros, the player is still a good player. The Battery life is by far the most annoying characteristic of the player.  Overall:  Pros: -Nice-looking color screen  -Easy to navigate interface  -WMP10 quite useful once you get used to it.  Cons: -Battery Life!!--Box claimed 12-20 hours of playback; I've only got about 12 once, and that was when I didn't touch the player after starting music. As soon as I want to skip songs, change playlists, turn the volume up or down (all of which turn the LCD screen on), the battery life suffers greatly. I say I average 6 hours.  -The USB connector and plug for the AC adaptor are all in one unit, meaning you have to take both around with you if you want to be able to charge it.   -Buttons are fine if you have player on your belt or in your hand, but if you have it in a jacket or pocket it's almost impossible to do anything with them.  -Carrying case is not very good...it's hard to get on and off, and it hides the appearance of the player.  -Long playlists can take longer to load.

<Title>overall a good player
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this player beats the ipod strait up. the scroll bar on the player is so much better than the click wheel on an ipod. the screen resolution is AUSOME. the pictures, song titles, etc. all look really good and clear.the sound quality is good with the original 32 different eqs. then you have your custom equalizer. the 8000 songs are plenty for me and anyone else i know, and can be sorted and a few different ways, titles, artists, genres, and albums.  now when you talk about digital electronics you have to talk about the disadvantages right?. if you buy this device i strongly recomend that you buy the mistic audio leather case for it. although it is $25 it is well worth it. the original case it comes with is ugly, hard to put the player in and to take it out of, it is also hard to feel the play, next, and previous track buttons becaise the silicone covers them. also the original case does not cover the screen leaving it open to scratches. if you have an older computer you will have to run a windows update for service pack one, with dial up this took me 235 minutes. the charger is a universal charger/ usb cable so it has a plug in to the wall and a usb. this can be a pain because while charging it there will be another cable to get tangled in whatever. but overall i would recomend buying this device over an ipod.

<Title>Unless you seriously need the features, get an iPod or Zen Touch
<Date>Thu Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I do have to say the sound quality is good, the FM tuner, FM recording, and voice recording features are nice. But there are a few bad issues that weren't mentioned. This players freezes like crazy, and I had returned two units for freezing problems (one during saving a recording and one for displaying the artist names in Chinese and then freezing). The firmware, even with the newest, is somewhat buggy. Windows Media Player 10 is a bad software to use for this player, it is slow, freezes, and syncs slowly. Overall unless you desperately need an FM tuner I would get an iPod or a Touch.

<Title>iRiver, A good alternative to the iPod
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recently purchased a iRiver 20GB and I have to say after a week of use, this player is one of the best ever, in my humble opinion.  I bought this mp3 player after my iPod broke, as they often tend to do.  The scroll bar is much more intuitive than the iPod's scroll wheel.  The player also uses WMP and Plays for sure.  I'm not going to much argue why you should buy this over a Creative Zen Micro or anything because for the most part, Apple owns the business and, if the X-Men have taught us anything, we must attack the Jugernaut's head.  A lot of people complain about battery life, but I played it for about 10 hours and still had 2/4 battery left.  This player has a BEAUTIFUL color screen.  One problem I have, though, is the lack of CD art display on the "Now Playing" screen.  Really though this isn't so much a major gripe, it just would be kinda cool.  Also my player was defected but I just ordered a replacement on Amazon and my new one is due in just a little while.  While I cannot transfer files from the mp3 player to my PC yet I have heard that it is possible.  The player is super slick and definately looks cooler than the iPod and its white case.  The player comes with a FM radio recorder/player and you can even record voices, like the ones in my head.  Although I had to refer to the manual when I was trying to figure out how to do some things, in other words degrade my manhood, The iRiver 20GB is well worth your money.  I give it 5 Stars, as you can see above.  To sum things up:   Good: Screen Scroll Bar 20GB Sleek and Slick  Blue/Red/Grey Just overall seems super solid and impervious to all drops Compact Price FM Radio Player/ Recorder Windows compatable  Okay: Battery life Start up and downloading songs, I had to refer to the manual It doesn't display the album art.  Bad:  You probably don't have it yet!!

<Title>Overall Good Product
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The best feature about the iRiver that is lacking with the competition is the ability to browse files using the directory.  Finding individual songs can be a bother when having to scroll through 4000 songs, or even merely 400 artists for that matter, so the directory features makes it easy to quickly find what I'm looking for.  The player also has a very stylish look to it and is fairly small.  It becomes significantly bulkier with the included skin, but as long as it's handled carefully and not dropped, that's not necessary.  Unfortunately the device is lacking in other areas: The device can only be recognized with Windows Media Player 10 installed.  WMP 10 does not need to be used to load the device with music, which makes the issue somewhat better.  One of the more annoying features is that the buttons require two presses to actually do anything: If the screen has turned off the first button press only turns the screen on.  Other features lacking are those to do anything useful with the music on the player with the player.  Within the player, playlists cannot be built and songs cannot be deleted .  Songs can be rated and the equalizer changed, but that's about it.  The equalizer, by the way, is not a good option as it adds a significant amount of noise to the playback.  I've learned to live with it's quirks, and it seems unfortunate as most players have them.  While this may seem like a bad review, understand that my rating of the iPod is two stars.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player 
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the iRiver MP3 player for more than 3 months now, and I am very satisfied with the player.  The interface is quite easy to understand, and the scroll bar is quite easy to get used to.  Although the bar is not as intuitive as the iPod, it does its job well.  One of the chief reasons for buying the player was its extra features when compared to the iPod.  For instance, it has FM tuner/recording, and voice recording.  Music transfer is a sticking point of this player, as it will only let you transfer files using WMP 10.  However, this can be avoided by plugging the player into the USB port, reseting the player via the hole in the top, then pressing and holding the select and power buttons.  Then you have to use software EasyH10.  This may seem complicated, but after the first time you do it, it becomes very easy.  Battery life is not as advertised, but most of the time I can get about 10 hours per charge.  I have not had any problems with it, and the unit seem solid.  Overall, a great MP3 player for the money.

<Content>While I think iPods are nice I don't think they're the best thing out there. This player was recommended by sales people and others for the sound quality, and they were right. The sound is phenomenal. I personally like the layout of the H10 better than the iPod. If you have a lot to scroll through you can just hold the button and it'll fly through your lists (you can adjust the speed as well). I did have a couple of wierd things happen that required reseting the player. However, this has not been the case since I updated the firmware version that recently came out. I have been very pleased with my choice in this player. It's a great jukebox player.

<Title>Nice features but some major annoyances.
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased an iRiver in mid September and have been generally satisfied with the product but there are several major annoyances.  I also can't speak for its long term durability but it has been pretty durable so far.    The Good -Excellent extra features.  This player comes with a FM tuner and a recorder.  Both features work great.  The digital FM tuner works very well and you can preset up to 20 channels.  Its reception is generally good and is comparable to a clock radio.  The recorder also works very well and even without a microphone has very good reception especially on higher quality soundings.  You can also record FM radio if you want. -Good storage capacity and features for price. -The drag and drop system in adding files is generally very easy. -Respectable battery life.  The Bad -Extremely Buggy.  This player will freeze up often.  Luckily it is very easy to reset but it is an annoyance.  More seriously, I have had to reinstall the firmware twice since I have had this player.  I needed to do this because the player would freeze so often that I could no longer add files, delete files, record, etc. without the player freezing up.  This problem was solved by reinstalling the firmware and reformating the device but in order to update the firmware, you delete all your files and it takes at least an hour to reinstall all the music you lost.  -Slow Scan Speed.  The highest scan speed is jumping 16 seconds per skip.  This is OK for songs but if you use your iRiver to listen  to audio books then this is not a player for you.    -Incapable of transferring large files.  I sometimes use this player to transfer files and generally it is very good but if you have a large file (greater than 500 MB) in my experience it was not possible to transfer the file from the player to another computer though you can get the file on the computer.    If you need an mp3 player that records voices like I do then this is probably your best bet right now even with its flaws.  However, if you need it for any other purpose, I would recommend spending another 40 to 50 dollars for another brand with comparable features.

<Title>A Nifty Gadget
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iRiver mainly for recording, but I also got it because I was running out of space on my Ipod mini.  I had read a number of reviews, both positive and negative, but at the price, I couldn't beat it.    Here are my thoughts, FWIW:  Positives:  Functionality: Wow.    1.  Ok, it handles 20 gig of music of both WMA and MP3s.  Nice.   2.  FM radio.   3.  Great sound.   4.  Excellent recording. 5.  Great screen -- and color too.  Very readable.  I like this so much more than the Ipod. 6.  Comes with its own charger.  I like the way it interfaces to the computer and to the powercord.  Much nicer than the Ipod, IMO. 7.  Software is a nothing to install.  For me, it was literally nothing because I have media player. 8.  Comes with its own gummy case.  I paid $12 or so to get three for my Ipod when all I wanted was one. 9.  Really good battery life.   10.  You can record voice and record music on FM.  Very nice.  Negatives:  1.  It's a brick.  Well, maybe not a BRICK, but it is bigger than my Ipod mini.  That was a surprise.  2.  I dislike windows media enough.  Itunes is a bit more intuitive.  I have to figure out the playlists portion.  I would've liked to see a better interface.  I'm going to see if anything else will work with iRiver.  3.  Doesn't use Itunes, but nothing except Apple does.  This is NOT iRiver's fault.  DRM management issues if you switch over, but nothing I couldn't handle.   4.  There's a slight delay in the time it takes between pressing the buttons and playing the music.    5.  Doesn't take MP4 files.  No biggie.  You can convert them with a bunch of free software (including ITunes).    6.  Would like more documentation.  That's my preference.  If you have an Ipod and switch over to the iRiver, you may be looking for it to act like an Ipod, which it doesn't.  However, it's functionality, storage space and price made me think of this as a very viable alternative.

<Title>Flawed Battery Design
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a refurbished iRiver H10 about a year ago and happily loaded it up with songs. I never particularly liked the design of the operating software, but I'm not that picky--as long as it worked I was fine with it.  But about three months later, the device died completely. I assumed this was a battery failure--a not uncommon issue with refurbished electronics. I put it aside intending to send it in for repair at some point.   Well, recently I pulled it out again and set about trying to contact iRiver to see what the repair options might be. Much to my shock, I discovered that the battery for the H10 is sealed inside the case and cannot be replaced. This means that the whole device will have to be thrown away.   What a waste, and what an absurd way to design an expensive portable electronic device. Based on my experience I plan to stay as far away from iRiver products as possible.

The price was great for the amount of memory.  I love everything about it except the battery time.  I have to charge it every night!  And then once it's fully charged, if I leave it for a day without using it, it will be dead when I go to try to use it.  It's very frustrating and I am probably going to talk to the manufacturer about it.  Maybe I got a defective battery or something.  Other than that, it's pretty good.

<Title>MTP - iRiver's downfall
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own the legendary iRiver hp140 and love it. I avoided the iPod because I didn't want to be locked into a specific client software.  I bought the h10 20G as a xmas present recently and its Microsoft specific MTP (transfer protocol) has made it incompatible with 3 different windows XP sp2 computers I've tried it on. Beware!   Unfortunately, iRiver has abandoned its UMS (Universal Storage) approach and open codec standards to the dark side (MS specific protocols). The problem is that even if a protocol is designed by Microsoft, to run on a Microsoft OS, it is still unreliable.   I'm returning this - and thinking of getting the iAudio line of players. They seem to be the only ones left who build open format, UMS players.

<Title>Way better than Zen or Ipod!!  Use powered USB hub!!
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Returned 3 Zens because of the earphone jack issue, no more Zens available, trade up for the H10. Great looking player, sounds incredible with the Shure E2C earphones, and it displays color photos, easy to use. Was a little frustrated at first, Two of my three puters wouldn't even see the player, tried everything, called iriver and they couldn't help either. finally tried a powered(wall plug) USB hub and bingo!!! works like a charm. Hope this helps other frustrated users.

<Title>The best player out there- for the first few months of it's life.
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There is no doubt about it that this is the best DAP out there right now for people who dont want to get trapped into apple's conformist ideas of the world. Im not going to repeat what everyone here has already said and praised about the H10. I really wished it had video, but it doesn't, so I can get over that. What I cant get over is that so many people like me are having their players die after either just a few days or a few months. It is becoming a well-known problem that iriver has fixed for its h10 5/6gb owners, but has ignored us 20gb owners. In a few months, you will sadly wake up to annoying clicking sounds and a message saying "restore system files", but sadly you will not be able to do that because the computer wont be able to recongnize your player. You end up stuck in the middle between microsoft tech support, your computer's tech support, and iriver's tech support. As much trouble as this player has given me, I cant say that I'd choose any other player when I send this back to circuit city. It's just that great. Although the iaudio x5 is hard to not look at... In the end I'd say If you love iriver enough to wait it out, wait until they make a new harddrive player with video. Maybe by next christmas?

<Title>It's a great value device
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iRiver H10 has communication problems with my pc (i'm using window xp) . It didn't recognized the device .  But after i read the reviews about this product i have made the device working properly . And you dont need alot of steps like some of the reviews said  .  Here is what you should do  ;    Connect your USB cable to a vertical usb on your motherboard  . Then connect the usb cable to the device . Then reset the device using something small like a pin by the reset button (or hole ?) .  Then press and hold the O button (also called your select button ), continue holding the O button and turn the power on  .  Now the device will say that the usb is connected .   By now window media player will recognized the iRiver and Synchronization can take place . I hope this would help new buyers  . Have fun all !

<Title>DON'T do the upgrade
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I got my H10 it worked fine, then I loaded the firmware upgrade. "MUST HAVE XP with SERVICE PACK". If you don't, DO NOT BUY, it will NOT WORK.  It then ties it to the win 10 player and seems to need to log on to the internet just to check licences and upload mp3s to the player. I by passed that and just dragged and dropped to the player. Seems to be OK with that.  There seems to be no way to edit files on the H10, so you need to do everything on your PC then sync to the H10. Not too impressed with that. I liked the old way better.

<Title>Don't Buy an IPOD!
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little MP3 player is one of the best on the market, in my opinion! I read up on Iriver and they caught my attention from the get-go. I liked the design and I liked the fact that it seemed an underdog had a better piece of equipment than the ever-growing Apple IPOD. Don't buy an IPOD! Buy this! It's better quality and better thought out. The buttons are in the perfect position for your hands and the scroll bar in the middle of the unit is excellent! You can tap it or hold it down and it seems to be pressure sensitive with how fast of slow it scrolls. Great design.... espeically for those of us with oooodles of mp3s! The actual button design and what each of them do is very easy to catch onto after the first few uses. I actually don't even have to look at the buttons anymore. I've never had a problem with any of the software. It works perfect with Windows Media Player. No problems with freezing. No problems with reboots. No problems with play lists.   Unlike some other units I have heard of, this one will charge whether it is connected to a computer or not. Very convenient. The charging wire actually is a Y shaped wire. You can have it plugged into a computer while it is charging if you want to...but you don't have to. I've never actually tested how long it takes to fully charge, but it seems to be a "quick charger" and the charge itself lasts for quiet a long time.   As for the transfer rate... I've transferred 2 gigs of songs onto this thing in a matter of a few minutes. I will say that you do need to have your song files named properly for the submenu system to work properly. The iriver will automatically give you submenus underneath all of your artists concerning albumbs. It also give you an 'all' menu underneath each artist. Works perfectly as long as you have all of your artists name and alubmb name fields filled in before you transfer them over from Windows Media Player. If you've never used WMP before... don't worry, it's fairly easy to load songs onto this unit from WMP. You'll catch on quick.  The number one reason why I love this unit.... It doubles as a portable harddrive! You can save ANY kind of file on this thing. It will display photos and text files. It has menus automatically seperate these type of files out for you from your musix files. However...it also has a browser function where you can scan thru ANY kind of files that you saved to this unit if they don't fall into any of the above mentioned catagories. VERY VERY COOL. IPOD CANT DO THAT!!!!!   Now I've read previous reviews...... in response to all of those: (a) As long as your not a 17 year old looking to blow your ear-drums out, the ear buds that come with this unit are just fine. If your REALLLLLY picky when it comes to bass or treble, then you might want to go with an expensive pair of Sony's or something, but for the average-Joe, these are just fine. And besides... if you decide to buy new ear buds (for whatever reason), its the unit that makes the mp3 player, NOT the buds. (b) This is a piece of electronic equipment. The general rule of thumb that goes for anything that is electronic/comuter related...DONT DROP IT!!! You wouldn't pick up your laptop and accidentially drop it to the ground and expect nothing to be wrong. Why should this be any different? Come on people... common sense here... treat it well and it will treat you well! :) (c) The case that comes with it is a bit ridiculous. I've heard people refer to is as an Iriver condom because that's exactly what it looks like. It's rubber and white and it doesn't always quiet do the job. LOL. I've stuck with it because a case really isn't all that important to me. Here's the deal... it offers NO protection for the screen. ZERO. My solution to that is to go and buy one of those protective films that people use to protect the screen of their PSP and just cut it down to size. That's what I did and it works great. I do like the fact that the case covers most of your buttons (except the thumb scroll in the middle), but the covering over the buttons is slightly thinner than the rest of the case...so the buttons are still very usable and protected from dust and dirt at the same time. Bottom line is... it works, but not as well as it could. If your picky, you may want to find another alternative for a case.  I still give this product 5 stars!!!! Don't buy an ipod just because Apple has a bigger advertising pocket. The name of this game is quality...not popularity.

<Content>I chose this player (over the iPod) for one reason...Napster to Go. While I have been happy with the overal performace of the player and the interface with Napster, I have also been tempted to throw this thing through the nearest window! There is nothing simple about this player. You have to do all kinds of updates and installation...but once you get it taken care of, it works like a champ. My only complaint is the size. Compared to the Apple with comparable storage, (20-30 GB) this thing looks like a brick.

<Title>Couldn't Be More Pleased
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iRiver H10 is the perfect MP3 player for my needs.  I've had it for almost a full year now and use it almost daily.  I use the player exclusively for listening and recording purposes.  I listen to longer audio files (up to 75 minutes in length) and music burned from my CD collection.  I do not download music from any online MP3 store and cannot comment on how this unit syncs with any of these vendors.  The voice recordings are generally 30-40 minutes in length. My observations:  1. THE INTERFACE - The click-and-drag load/unload function is perfection in simplicity.  The Windows Media Player Sync function is worthless.  It takes forever and offers no real benefit except to people who cannot organize their MP3s themself.  And if it doesn't fully sync before you disconnect your iRiver, the software crashes and you have to reset the player (this erases all your files).  I do not use this function.  If you don't go into WMP, it's just click-and-drag like a USB flash drive.  2. UNIT SIZE - The unit is smaller and lighter than I was led to believe by reading older reviews here on Amazon.  It isn't an iPod Nano, but it isn't bulky either.  About the size of a deck of cards.  3. RECORDING - The "Recordings" feature is amazing.  Super-high-quality MP3 recordings with an auto-adjust microphone that picks up everything in proper balance.  4. DURABILITY - This thing is built to last.  I've dropped it more than once (usually on carpet or linoleum) and it has never been the worse for it.  5. BATTERY LIFE - About 15 hours of steady listening, in my experience.  If you like to adjust the volume and skip tracks a lot, then expect that to be reduced in proportion to your use of the backlit screen and pause button.  Frequent pausing will drain the battery most quickly because the unit shuts down after a couple minutes on pause.  6. LOCK FUNCTION - Maybe the best thing about this unit is the lock button.  I can carry it in my pocket without worrying about having the track switched or the volume lowered or the power button pressed accidentally.  7. HARD DRIVE - The 20GB hard drive is more than sufficient to hold my files and much larger than the current generation of flash-driven iPods.  I have used about half of the drive with some 300 half-hour to an hour long audio files.  This leaves plenty of room for creating high-quality voice recordings of my own.  8. FAST FORWARD / REWIND - Not fast enough.  A 75 minute audio file only skips ahead (or backward) at 4 second intervals (4 seconds for every 1).  This is very frustrating when someone distracts me 30 minutes into a track and instead of "PAUSE" I hit "NEXT TRACK".  This is my only major complaint about the unit (unless you try to use the Windows Media Player sync function).  Overall, the iRiver H10 has been a wonderful unit for my needs at a fantastic price.  Heavy button-pressers may prefer to put up with the idiosyncracies of the iPod merely for the ease of its interface.

<Title>Touch and Go
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iRiver is the ideal trade off for me. Sure I can't use iTunes, and it's not video-compatible, but I get an internal microphone for recordings (well over twelve hours of audio, instantly coverting it to instant mp3 - useful for classes or scratch recordings for my band) and it's a good price on more than enough memory. Battery life lasts for over 6 hours without charging. Audio quality is great and has an adjustable equalizer.  It also comes with 2 months free on Napster = pretty much unlimited downloads of their extensive library. I estimate that I'll be able to fit about 2500 songs on it.  But, after only a week, it's very unstable. I had to update the firmware immediately, and even with that, when it's communicating with the computer, it will often seize up, requiring a reset. And the track listing can become screwed up, requiring a 'database refresh'...which will usually fix the problem. I'm currently having a 2-day-long problem downloading anything licenced (through legal napster channels) and getting a 'no license found', and I hope it doesn't continue much longer.   I feel I'm a single screwed up connection from having the thing become a $160 paper weight. It has a waranty, I can use if things go to heck. So I'll still have the services, but I'll be further inconvenienced.  It can do a lot of great things, but it's not very consistent.

<Title>Stupidest software design
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own this item. I purchased it after having an iPod mini that died on me and this was cheaper per gig than another iPod. I regret this decision.  The good thing about this is that you can drag and drop from Windows onto the Iriver. Slightly more convinient than updating via iTunes.  The stupid thing about this product is the 'hold' button. I keep my player in my bag all day and use for my commute.  When the player is on 'hold' you would expect that pressing the buttons would do nothing.  However, when the iRiver is on 'hold' and you press a button, the screen lights up and tells you that it is on hold (probably for idiots who forget it is on hold).  The point is.... when the screen lights up every few minutes because my bag gets bumped and some button pressed, it drains the battery like crazy. I can't even use it on my way home unless I charge it all day.  I would reccomend spending the few extra bucks and buying an iPod.

<Title>iPod PWNED...film at eleven!
<Date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>MP3 players are pretty much the norm in today's society.  If you own a computer, CDs and/or music files, and love the convenience of taking your music with you, there simply isn't a better way to go.  Of course, the larger your music collection, the larger "size" player you'll likely need.  Then there's the "other stuff" to consider; features, file support, the player's physical size, etc...it can be akin to buying a new car.  If you've been searching for an affordable, compact player with a decent-size hard drive and features you wouldn't normally find on a standard player, may I recommend that this is the one for you.  It may not be the newest model on the lot, but it's nice, reliable, slim and trim, and seats up to about 8,000 songs comfortably (depending on what format they're in).  I've owned mine for about a year and a half now, and so far it's performed beautifully overall.  Not only that, it was about a hundred bucks cheaper than the 20GB iPod at time of purchase. So if you'd care to hop in, let's break this thing down a little further to give you a better idea of what this beauty can do: THE GOOD: --First off, the size of the hard drive.  She'll hold about 5,000 tracks in .mp3 format, which is the standard format for most music files.  Some music files, depending on where you get them, can be in different formats (like .wma) which are smaller and have slightly less sound quality.  If you want a conversion, 5,000 MP3s = about 8,000 WMA files.  As you can see, this model has quite a bit of trunk space, and unless you've got a monster music collection, you'll have plenty of room to spare. --That's all fine and good, but what about the sound quality?  As MP3 players go, it's great!  The sound quality (depending on the file, of course) is top-notch, and with 31 different equalizer settings, you can pick the right one to match pretty much whatever type of music you're listening to.  (And if you don't like any of the default equalizer settings, you can tweak your own and save them as a custom setting.) --Want to talk about some more features?  How about a 2" LCD screen that lets you look at pictures saved on the device?  There's also an FM radio, text document reader, built-in recorder with mic (you can record either sound or the FM radio signal), a browser to look through the files on the device, an alarm clock (you probably won't use that too much, but it's there if you need it), plus the standard repeat and shuffle features for music playback.  It's got a pretty decent battery life on it as well; about 12 hours of continuous play on a new player.  The battery's internal, though, and can't be removed without completely disassembling the player. --User friendliness...this is always a big issue when you're looking for electronics of any kind.  Usually, if you can't work it at all in the store (without the manual), chances are you won't take it home.  You can pretty much take the iriver out of the box, and after a few minutes of playing with it, will get the basics down.  The menu is quite uncomplicated and self-explanatory.  As far as transferring files, there are a couple of ways to do that, and they're both painfully easy.  The fastest way is to just drag and drop from your PC's hard drive into the device (after all, the iriver's basically a portable external hard drive) using Windows Explorer.  The iriver works brilliantly with Windows Media Player as well, though (version 10 and up; version 10 comes with the installation CD in case your PC has an earlier version).  With Media Player, you just connect the device to your PC (standard USB connection), open Media Player, hit "Sync", and forget about it.  Media Player will transfer all the music files in your hard drive to the iriver automatically (although it does take longer overall), and if it comes across a file that's already on your device, it will be skipped over.  (You can pick and choose songs to transfer as well, but that of course takes more time.)  As far as text files and pictures, they can be easily dragged and dropped using Windows Explorer. The touch-sensitive up/down arrow "clicker" is very smooth and responsive, scrolling through your music is ultra-quick (handy if you have a lot of music to peruse through), and there aren't a lot of other confusing buttons on the thing (power, forward, back, pause, and player lock; that's it).  The lock feature is easy to turn on and off, and will help conserve your player's battery by keeping it from turning on accidentally.  If the player ever locks up (like I said, it's a hard drive; it's gonna happen eventually), the embedded reset switch is easy enough to get to.  THE BAD: --Not that there's a lot of "bad" to speak of, but one aspect that can be irritating is the power/USB cable that comes with it.  The wonky design hassles things up a bit; the connector is unique to this device (in other words, you can't hook up any old AC adapter to it), and it's designed in such a way that the USB cable is grafted onto the AC connection.  I'm sure someone thought it was a good idea, but for traveling it just makes things awkward. --As said before, even though the internal lithium battery is rechargeable, it's not removable without complete disassembly (and that's next to impossible).  As you may know, a rechargeable battery can only be charged a few hundred times before it dies.  After a year and a half, my iriver still charges up pretty quickly, but the battery only lasts maybe 8 hours (a brand-new one lasts about 12-13 hours).  I'm noticing the battery's "memory" is filling up, and will maybe last another year or so before it only runs on AC power.  Be warned; it's best to let the battery run out completely before charging it each time. --Virtually no accessories exist for this device.  We all know about all the cool toys you can hook an iPod up to...where're the boom boxes and carrying cases for the iriver?  The company kind of dropped the ball here.  As far as carrying cases go, it does come with a soft plastic skin-type thing with a sturdy belt clip (which is actually pretty durable, but a veritable magnet for dust and dirt and difficult to clean).  It is compatible with standard FM modulators and portable speakers through the headphone jack (in fact, I'm listening through my PC speakers now), so it's at least easy to share your tunes with the world.  (By the way, iPod accessories will not work with this device; although the connector is similar, it's not the same.)  THE UGLY: --Nothing ugly about it.  Definitely a keeper!  I'm a very "latest and greatest" type of guy when it comes to electronic toys and the like, but I've been very satisfied with this player for as long as I've owned it.  While it won't hold my entire music collection, it will hold a big chunk of it and will keep me in tunes wherever I go.  It's light and compact (about the size of a deck of cards, and just a skosh heavier), it's very simple to use, and it's pretty durable for the most part (I wouldn't go jogging with it or anything, but I have dropped it once or twice without a problem).  A "search" feature would make the interface perfect, but scrolling through files goes fast enough without testing my patience.  Yeah, there's pretty much nothing in the way of accessories (at least a leather or even metal carrying case would be nice; I've ripped the soft plastic case a little just taking it off and on my belt), but that's not even a showstopper.  Overall, if you're looking for a good player that won't break the bank and don't care if it's an iPod, this is the one to go with.  No, it's not the latest and greatest, but it's good workmanship for a very good price (especially now), and you'll get a lot of use out of it.  And isn't that the bottom line?  Click the shopping cart and prepare to enjoy!

<Content>I could not be less pleased with this piece of electronic dung. Terrible software. Takes forever to find songs. when you skip a song it takes sometimes up to 30 seconds for it to play the next song. Freezes up constantly on me. I have to completely reset it. When I try to log onto Napster to go, it tells me I have the wrong player, so I have to reboot my computer then it will work. Also it fades into songs instead of playing them right away, you can hear the song slowly fade in. I hate this thing!

<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The world now is very iPod-centric but the incredible sales of iPod players don't mean iPod is the best digital music player on market. For me personally there few better ones. iRiver H10 is one of them and here is why I bought it.  For me what matters most is the sound quality. iRiver traditionally offers very clear, crisp and powerful sound, lots EQ options (better to not use them with good earphones) and something more. Instead supplying some no white pieces of plastic iRiver delivers its players with ear buds by Sennheiser and these little buds sound terrific so you won't have to look for something better after purchase. Only if you have ears like a bat you may consider something like Sennheiser PX100 or Koss Porta Pro for outdoor walks.  I like other stuff about iriver too - flawless connection to WMP10 and Windows Media Player 11 beta (so no need to install another player if you run Windows XP), support of music subscription services, easily replaceable battery and classy design. And one more thing - you don't look like a sheep in a herd with 100th million iPod in your pocket

<Title>Horrible - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this product for 9 months and it has not worked properly for 8 months.  I have had one "return to company and they will fix it" and it came back worse than when it started.  It would not play half of the songs I downloaded, even with the suggested low bit rate change per the company.  I have to reset it to switch songs, to turn it off, to turn it on - basically to perform any function.  I can only get customer service via their website, and it has been a never ending "have you tried....." despite the blatant fact that it should work the first time, simply, without a lot of reformatting and resetting.   I bought this product for sound quality as well as being anti-Ipod.  Now I will spend the money for an Ipod and count the cash I lost as a lesson - products don't sell by the millions if they don't work (Ipod vs. Iriver).

<Title>Finally Happy!
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had the Creative 30 gig unit and I felt as though all it ever did was "crash" on me. 32 days after I bought it, I had to send it in for repair! When it was under warranty, I would have to return it to Creative and wait for it to come back with all the data I uploaded gone. The iRiver is wonderful! It comes with EVERYTHING you need to operate it. A silcon case, Senhieser ear buds, etc. I am very happy with this unit. Yes, it is somewhat larger than an iPod but that doesn't bother me in the least (much smaller then the Creative so I'm still happy). Wonderful sound! It stores text and photos and it also has an FM radio that can be recorded from, as well as live recording capability (my Creative had none of these features). The iRiver is well worth the price (which was less than what I paid for the Creative, which is no longer under warranty and has crashed again and I'm through with it!) I will give Creative credit for their "Travel Sound" speakers. It's an excellent unit and I continue to use it with my iRiver MP3 player.

<Title>Amazing Player
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You can not go wrong with the iRiver H10. It gives a great package for the money that you spend. It takes some time to get used to using Windows Media Player to put your songs on the player, but once you do, its pretty easy. The controls are easy to navigate. It is deffinatly better than the IPods, even though there are not that many accessories for it.

<Title>A great device for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow.  The reviews for the iriver H10 20 GB are all over the place.  Overall, I really like this MP3 player.  I was worried about how it was going to be, but I have had it for a few weeks now, and I have had no problems with it.  I have Windows XP and WMP 10, so it has been extremly easy to use with my computer, and I'm not the smartest computer guy out there.  It's very easy to synch the songs with the player.  Look, the main reason I got it was to have something that could hold all of my cds and shuffle randomly through all of them, which this device does nicely.  For that purpose, this is a great device.  Navigation is very easy - there's a forward button and a backward button.  It doesn't get much easier than that.  I have friends that have the ipod, and I like this player better than that.  I would never watch video on a 2-inch ipod, so that wasn't a necessary buy, plus I can't stand all the hype for ipod, plus I have no need for the hundreds of pointless accessories that you can get for it.  This model can hold pictures, too, which is great because then I just downloaded pix of my baby into it so no one can complain that I don't have any on me.  The pictures are prisp, by the way.  A lot of people are complaining about having to do things to the device to make it work properly.  Well, I haven't done a thing to it, and it works great.  As for battery power, I use it for about 3-4 hours at work and about 40 minutes at the gym each day, and I have to power it every several days.  Not a big deal at all.  As for minor complaints, the instructions were not the most helpful.  They could have explained things a little better in there.  Also, make sure all the songs on a cd are ripped to WMP with the same artist name.  For example, my Stone Sour CD says that all the songs are by the artist Stone Sour except one by singer Corey Taylor, so that song isn't under the Stone Sour listings.  No big deal to me, because I shuffle through all my songs at once, not individual artists.  I can't comment on the earbuds, because I bought new ones without ever trying them.  Another thing, and maybe this is because I'm getting old, I'm used to having a STOP button.  It took me a day to realize that I don't need one - you just pause and/or turn off the player.  I'm used to it now.  Once again, a great, easy-to-use player and a great alternative to the more expensive ipod.

<Title>File system keeps getting messed up
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the idea of all-you-can-download-for-one-price music, but iPods don't work with the two current subscription music programs that I know of (Napster and Yahoo!). So I searched around and the H10 seemed to be a good balance of features and price, and was supported by Yahoo's music program, so I took the plunge on the H10 and Yahoo's subscription.  Two weeks later, I regret it. While this issue has yet to be raised on a product review here, I've since found a couple of postings at forums that describe scenarios where tracks get duplicated on the H10. So instead of having 11 songs from a certain album, I have 22. Other albums had the order of their tracks randomized on the device.  Today, I upgraded the firmware for the H10, wiped the device, and started over, but it didn't take very long for the mess to reoccur. (And by the way, reinstalling firmware is not something I'd expect everyone to be able to do.) I've figured out that I have to wipe the device and copy all the tracks over every time I want to change anything.  One other nit-pick: you need a paper clip or pin to reset the device. About a week after I bought the H10, I tried to unpause the device and found that the device had crashed (think: Windows blue screen of death). Who carries a paper clip when you're out for a jog? For a portable device, there really ought to be a better way to reset it.  I wish I could recommend something better, but consider yourself warned -- this device has some problems.

<Title>IRiver Rocks
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The capacity is enormous!  I bought a used ipod shuffle and played around with it a bit on my pc. I already had about 400 cd's in Windows Media Player, when I loaded Itunes it converted about 30 of the cds - and then it messed up some other programs I had.  I bought my dad the Iriver 512 MB for Christmas and when syncing music I discovered that it was directly compatable with Windows Media Player! So I had my husband purchase this 20 GB Iriver and I have put all my cd's on it I have 6 MB to spare. The sync'ing is easy and the sound quality on the headphones is great (better with Sony Noise Cancellation Headphones)  The Iriver has made my MP3 dreams come true! :o)

<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok! I was impressed. Previsouly, I had a 40 gig that posed no problems. All I did was drag and drop folders from my CDR's into the 340 with no problems. I Never used software only a plugin from Realplayer. Before that I had a 20 gig 100 that I did the same thing with, no problems!Then I bought the first H10. The first HD form the H10 crashed. Returned it, tried again. The software, WMP is some of the worst I have every come accross. Everytime I tried to sync I kept receiving  an error message, "this file may not be compatable with the software". I received the error message over and over again. In addition, Iriver's Customer Service was of no help.  Finally I gave up and bought  an IAudio X5 30 gig which I sould have bought in the first place. No problem except the print in the manual is so small you need a microscope to read it. However, interms of moving music music from one place to another it is a walk-in-the-park. The sound is great and the rest of the features can't be beat. In addition the customer serive (when you can get through are very knoledgeable)In the end, I paid an extra $35 for the Iaudio X5 30 gig, but I am so glad I did.

<Title>Disappointed former fan
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had an older model, iHP-120, that I loved.  Easy file transfer, fast, reliable, great sound.  When that failed, I decided to get the H10.  Bad move.  The H10 turned out to be extremely buggy, file transfers were difficult and time-consuming, the usb was extremely slow, battery life was short, and the machine was prone to locking up and required frequent resets.  Syncing through WMP, which is required, was always a crapshoot: sometimes files would make it into the searchable database, sometimes they wouldn't.  It was aggravating in the extreme.  I upgraded the firmware twice -- additional headaches just to get the upgrade application to work, and additional hours to transfer my library after the new firmware erased it.   So, I bought a Zen Touch and have been incredibly happy.  File transfers are easier, faster and more reliable.  Sound is solid.  Battery life is unparalleled -- I get close to 20 hrs per charge.  Good value for the money, too.  The aggravation is gone and I'm a happy camper again.    Caveat: The Zen Touch doesn't have an integrated FM tuner, but I almost never used it, so that doesn't much matter to me.

<Title>Good but not great
<Date>Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The reason I purchased this MP3 player is because I had previously purchased iriver's 1 GB T10 and it was pretty awesome with the Napster To Go service, it transferred songs to it really quickly, but it would skip every now and then and didn't hold enough music for my needs. So I purchased the 20 GB H10 because I have a 20 GB Sony NW-HD3 which is super-smooth, never skips, never makes a sound, and now I know is a superior MP3 player, but it doesn't have the "Plays-for-sure" capabilities.   When I first used the H10, it worked, pretty well, but the battery only seems to last about 6 to 8 hours. When I transfer songs with Napster, with the T10, it has a very short transfer time, a couple of minutes at most for about 20 songs, for the H10, it can take forever, 5-10 minutes or more depending on how the player feels.    Also, when it loads a song, it takes a bit of time, and is a bit loud. And with most MP3 players, when you choose an artist or album to play, and once it finishes that album, it continues playing to the next artist or album. With this MP3 player, it stops. Kind of weird, I guess this is a feature that you might be able to change, or maybe you are supposed to make play lists, I'm not quite sure.  But for the positives, This MP3 player has amazing sound, and has an amazing menu, and navigation. But the earbuds supplied are a bit lacking. Also, I do like the radio feature.  Overall, iriver is a good starter MP3 player, and it is well worth it when using any service like Napster, Yahoo, or Rhapsody. But I suspect in the future, iriver will have much better MP3 players, I'd probably hold off on buying until the next generation.

<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I got the H10, it was great, it held all of my songs, and using napster to go with it was great. With so many songs on it, though, it started to act up. I thought that a simple database refresh would do the trick, but it didnt, it went on and on for over a day. When it finally seems like its all going to work, it wont work with napster to go anymore. file transfers are slow and sometimes unreliable. the best thing about it though, is the SRS WOW technology, which i will miss when upgrading to a different player. the H10 is just too problematic

<Title>Potential iRiver Buyers Beware!
<Date>Tue Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the iRiver H10 for an American Holiday. I loaded 10 gig of music onto it with minimum fuss. Okay, so the User manual has incorrect disconnect-from-PC instructions, but so far so good.  Okay, day 1 of my 30 day holiday - I'll just pick up the iRiver and program a few tracks that I feel like listening to. Hmmm...I cant seem to find out how to add tracks to a tracklist.   No problems - Ill just play tracks alphabetically until I get off the flight and have a proper read of the manual.  To my absoloute HORROR, I found out that the iRiver can only have playlists added from a PC.  Thats right, without word of a lie - this "mobile" music device can only have playlists downloaded from my computer. What the hell? Was the design team SMOKING CRACK the day the designed this?  I frantically flicked through the pages of the manual and surfed a couple of forums to determine if this was an oversight and could be corrected by a firmware upgrade - NO. To my utter dismay, there was no way in which I could pick up the device, run through the tracks and program a playlist depending on my mood, whereabouts or situation.   As days went on, many situations arose which the iRiver could not handle. Program a party playlist for the tour pizza n beer party? Err sorry...no can do. Program a quick easy listening playlist for the bus ride? Nope. How about some RnB and hip hop tracks before we all hit the club? No. Cant do. The only thing I can do is play from A to Z.  What about playing a few tracks then hitting the "recently played" playlist? Nope - the bright sparks at the iRiver lab stymmied that idea too - theyre arranged in alphabetical order.   What is the point of only adding playlists via my PC? How will I know what I feel like listening to in a weeks or months time? Hell, I dont know what mood Ill be in tomorrow. I want my device to be portable - I dont want to take a laptop on holiday with me. I might as well purchase a CD Walkman!  I didnt purchase an iPod because I DETEST having to use iTunes. Unfortunately, I now regret this decision and will probably sell the iRiver for half the price I paid and make up the difference for an iPod.  Great work iRiver - a progressive company that designs a mobile device totally incapable of being mobile.  Beware - even if you detest iTunes like I, dont make the mistake of purchasing an iRiver product.

<Title>Listen to the 1 Star Reviews!
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe how terribly poor these players are made!  Firstly, the first one I bought was dead after only two DAYS! I put music into it and all the artists were in Chinese! UGH! Luckily as good as a store Best Buy is they fully let me exchange for a new one.  That new one is only a little better I guess, but it also died, only two weeks after the year waranty! It was always buggy like the first one I bought, I only used it lightly and had to keep reseting for various reasons and was formatting it near every three months. I only kept using it because if I paid $300 (YES $300 not the new $200!) I'm going to get some sort of use out of it and not resort to my Wal-Mart brand $20 CD player [which was even better than this by far but like I said about getting use out of it]. Anyway I kept formatting and reseting for different reasons. Reseting was always for some weird reason while formatting was often because Windows Media Player wouldn't add the songs correctly or I recorded something off the tuner and it froze in the middle and then there was no way to listen to music becuase of how corrupt it was. Well I guess today was the very final straw. I had to format it because the artists were messing up. I download the firmware and all that and I go to add songs to the player, and I turn it on and all it will do is go to "System initalizing please wait." I can't connect ti to the computer to format it because system initalizing happens before anything else. And I'm sure it's totally dead because it's been like this for 30 minutes now since I've turned it on. iRiver won't do a thing because it's outside of their one year warranty. Looks like the garbage can for this one...  Kinda sad to say a $20 cheap CD player I bought at Wal-Mart two years ago is much better than this. Avoid, even an iPod wins over this trash!

<Title>Not for Mix CDs
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I accidentally purchased this without inquiring how large the silence gaps between songs were. Unfortunately, if you like to listen to mix CDs (mixed by DJs) you should steer clear of the iRiver H10. I'll admit that the break will vary-- sometimes its only a fraction of a second, but other times it can be 2-3 seconds. The interruption in mix CDs can be uncomfortable.   Unfortunately most companies do not list "gapless playback" as a feature so you have to find out by word of mouth.  For the record, my old Creative Zen Touch 20GB had almost perfectly gapless playback; the gaps were only a fraction of a second all the time. This would leave me to believe that later units from Creative are similar, but I can't say for sure.  Other than the gaps between songs, I found this device to sound excellent, I love the style, design, & controls, and it is quite light.

<Content>Sadly, I must echo the previous review.  My 320 20 GB player, for which I paid 300 bucks, is failing to hold a charge after less than two years and only modest use. (I've been reasonably happy with it until the battery started to fail). I called IRiver today and was told that 1) they do not provide any battery replacement parts or service for out of warranty units, and that that 2) I could return it to them for about a $25 credit toward a new one. TWENTY FIVE BUCKS!!! As if I would ever buy another player from this company - HA~!

<Title>Update the firmware immediatly
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this product today, so I don't know what to say about the longetivity of the product(Although it went from dead to fully charged in 2 hours or less, and I've had it on for at least 2 hours, and the bar hasn't moved), but I do know that I don't expect my music players to last more than a year anyways, so their 1 year warranty works well for me.   But I do know that one of two things is going on here. Some of the people on here lied, or a firmware update made their issues with it irrelevant. I've heard reviews saying you can't create a playlist in the mp3 player. Wrong. In my manual it even says it, just hold the o button down when browsing the list of songs. Also, whoever said you couldn't delete the files from inside the player was dead wrong as well. All you do is go to Browser from the main menu and go into songs, and find whatever you want to delete and press the circle button, and then use the scroll pad to scroll from no to yes. File deleted.  Overall, I'm quite happy with this product. I especially loved the fact that they didn't just toss in some cheapo-2 dollar earbuds, but some mid-quality sennheiser earbuds (they don't come close to my Sennheiser PX100s, but they do a damn good job considering the crap some companies include with their products (hint hint Apple).  I didn't even try using it before I updated the firmware, but I assure you that with the latest firmware, this is a great mp3 player :)

<Content>The iRiver H10 is a very nice unit. It provides a lot of features for a reasonable price. Setup was straightforward. However, if you are using XP-Pro you will need to call the 800 number they supply. There is a registry fix that you will need to apply. It was quick and easy. Having the FM radio, the ability to store 1000's of digitial photos as well as its common usage of storing music in many formats MP3, WAV, WMF makes it very versatile. Battery life seems very good.

<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok so i got this mp3 player from amazon and the first time i turn it on i pushed too many buttons or somthing and the player froze [let me tell ya finding a sharp object to reset this thing with when you're at work is not the easiest thing to do]. Anyway after I reset the player it worked fine. I found all my songs, all 969 of them, i think, and it was great because it only took the player 30-45 min to get all the songs synced.  After i got off work, being 18 i gotta try to figure out every little part and option of my new little toy. The only things that i didn't really see any use for was the text option and the picture option; i mean pics look great on this litle screen, but if the pic isn't big enough then you can't really tell what the pic is unless you know everything that you put into your player and the text thing i just dont see the point in reading from a little player when i could just take the book itself with me (larger print and all). The music sounds great and you dont even need to have those crappy bit rates to get everything on the player and also you can record from the radio with this thing(someone told me this is illegal), now im not much for listening to the radio but this player uses your headphone cord for a antenna which i'm sure other players do but i have just never heard of it before. So in short if you want a player that is easy to use, has a quick transfer rate and can make your head feel like it might explode when the volume is all the way up and the custom equalizer is on, then this player is for you.    (and remember kids' music is good to ignore the stupid people in your life.[your mom and dad dont count as stupid people in your life, most of the time] have a great life :P)

<Title>Faulty product. DO NOT BUY!
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I bought this product thinking it would be great. And it was. For a while. I bought this specifically for syncing it with the Yahoo Unlimited program. And that worked, after some trouble shooting.   Then I wanted to get a couple songs off of the player. I just didn't want them anymore. So when I went to explore the files in my computer, I deleted them. I thought I was good, but I wasn't. When I turned the player back on, THE FILES WERE BACK! I couldnt get rid of them! So I went back to the file explorer, and my computer didnt recognize any files, because they were deleted. But they were still on the player!   And that's just one problem.  When I tried syncing with Yahoo Music, it worked after about five tries. Sometimes the songs wouldnt show up, or it would only transfer half of the songs I wanted. It got very frustrating. Now im stuck with a whole bunch of songs that wont play. Ugh. I really want a new Mp3 player.   And one more thing. I've had to reset the dang thing about a million times. I find it useful to travel with a paper clip so i can click the little tiny button to reset it. It freezes a lot. When i unplug it from my computer, nothing happens, and no buttons do anyting. So i have to reset. One time, it just shut itself down right in the middle of an album!   And my photos are really pixelated and blurry.  If you want a reliable product, do not buy this one!

<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The issues I've had with this player are too numerous to list, but here are the highlights: -Extremely cumbersome, unfriendly and inflexible User Interface (UI) -Can create only a single Playlist from H10 UI -Updating firmware completely wipes out every single track on the player.  That's right, you have to download every single song again. -Repeatedly hangs, requiring a hard reset -Repeatedly has problems synchronizing, both through Windows Media Player and through online subscription service (Rhapsody).  Sometimes it's a problem with the USB connection (I have 3 other USB devices that experience no connection problems), sometimes it's a DRM issue (the PC or online service can't get the device ID), sometimes it's a mystery. -Probably the worst online support I've ever come across (and there's a lot of stiff competition out there).  It's a cumbersome Q&A-based Help, without very little A.

<Content>I didn't want an iPod so I looked for alternatives. I heard alot about the iRiver and saw the H10. It looked and sounded promising, but it wasn't all that great. The first few days I was happy, until it started being a pain. It froze up almost every day and was a major pain to transfer songs.  The database is also unreliable. I've had to use EasyH10 several times because of a corrupt database, that fixed it but some of the songs got messed up, so I had to retransfer them.  Overall, it can be good, but is mostly a pain, especially when it freezes up and you don't have a paperclip or something thin.

<Content>I was extremely delighted to but my Iriver for christmas because it wasnt an IPOD. I loved having napster music service with it. I actually didnt start using it till the end of january. When I started using it I found i was having minor issues with it and needed to start reset occasionally. Once I downloaded about 50 songs I found I needed to reset more often. Then finally in February the thing just completely gave out on me. The music system completely went ape. I tried to bring it back to BEST BUY for an exchange but funny thing is, they are no longer continuing the use of the IRIVER H10. Therefore I assumed I am not the only one having problems with it. And whats even funny is that amazon is having a clearance sale of all the IRIVER H10's. SO BUYER BEWARE!!!

<Title>Nice product, but check for incompatibility
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this product in many respects, the main weakness being that I can't delete files from it directly (must use the computer, but by then I forget which files I wanted to delete).  Anyway, the main point of this review is to convey that certain older (2+ years old) processors are incompatible with this product, even though the operating system is completely updated.  My iRiver will interface fine with my work laptop, but not my home computer which is an emachine XP Athlon 1600+ processor.  I inquired to the iRiver support page about the problem, and the answer was simply that the product is not compatible with that processor.

<Title>Very Happy User

<Content>Is this a perfect MP3 player? No.    Is it the best option out there for people looking to unlock the incredible power of subscription music services like Yahoo! Music, Napster, Rhapsody, etc.? Yes  I've tried many different players, owned an iPod, and finally settled on this.  It can be buggy, and takes some time to get used to, but once you've figured it out it works great.    The built in microphone is very good for recording speech, but not a good option for bootlegging loud concerts since it is too sensitive.  I can't tell you how awesome it is to have unlimited music for a fair monthly fee.  I'm very happy with this iRiver combined with Yahoo! Music To Go subscription.  I suggest using Media Player to sync the iriver, once again it takes some time to figure out how to sync up your library and playlists.  One thing to be aware of, on occasion you may need to restart the iriver.  For example, if you charge it, I found that my unit will not show the battery meter correctly until I restart the unit.  Also I had an issue one time wehre all my music gave a message "expired subscription" or something like taht.  Once I restarted the unit, it was fine.  As bizarre as it may seem, I suggest getting a small pin and keeping it inside the sleve of the player.  The one complaint I have about this unit is that you need a pin to restart it (a pen won't work, it has to be needle/safety pin sized).  This way you'll always have it on hand if you need to restart for whatever reason.  So obviously if you are reading all of this review, you've come to realize that this player isn't for everybody.  It isn't the most user friendly thing in the world, it definitely has it's issues.  But the price is great and the thing works very well.  It just requires that you are a patient, somewhat experienced computer user.  If you don't plan to use subscription service music, I would look elsewhere (like iPod).  There are much better options out there for regular MP3 players.  This unit's main strength is that is compatible with the subscription file formats.

<Title>you'd better like window media player ...
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>as much as i hate to say this, i would not recommend the US-versions of the iriver players. older US versions, and the international versions support UMS (universal mass storage) mode. that means that when you connect it to your PC, it shows up as an external hard drive. this was the main reason i purchased my H300 (not this model).  newer players ONLY support MTS (media transer system?) mode. that means the only way to connect to and transfer files is by letting windows media player recognize it as a portable music device. it also means you cannot use the device as a portable hard drive.  if you're committed to windows media player and windows in general i suppose this is fine. i however do not want to tie myself to that platform. i don't want to manage my music collection with windows media. i mean, my music is already organized nicely into folders based on the artist and album ... do i really need some heavey weight application that needs to build a database of my music and try to present it in a more organized manner?   originally, all iriver players were UMS. then they started making US versions that were shipped MTS, but could be flashed to UMS (by loading an international version of the firmware). my wife's H10 6GB can be put into UMS mode, but only by removing the battery first (a pain). now with the H10 20GB, the latest word is that it's not possible to flash to non-US firmwares at all, and hence not possible to get to the UMS mode.  too bad iriver. you sold your soul to the devil.  as far as the player, the H10 firmware is pretty and easy to use. much better than previous models.

<Title>High potential, Bizarre Hindrances
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Color Screen: The screen on this thing is very nice for displaying photos...but as far as practicality for diplaying track information it is very poor.  The screen is totally unreadable when the backlight is off or when in sunlight.  Just pretend it's an Ipod shuffle outside, eh?  The colors are  gorgeous...inside. Darn disappointing.  Pictures: A rediculously poorly executed function.  The windows media player sync for photos NEVER WORKS CORRECTLY.  How do you get a Digital Rights Management warning for a JPEG picture taken off the internet???!?!  It will hang on a certain picture and only sunc the first 5 or so.  It should have been a "Drag and Drop" type operation.  The pictures display correctly in the "File Browser" mode, but that is slow and cumbersome, just like every other menu system.  Synchronization: I use a different application for synchronizing music and such and it works fine.  I've tried using WMP 10 for photos, but that never worked.  Oh, just a hint...your Windows XP computer will not recognize the player unless you have upgraded to SP1 or later (a problem I had, NOT COVERED IN THE MANUAL). Oh, and  proprietary cables for connectivity.    There's a separate jack for the remote, but USB is integrated into the wierd conection on the bottom? Why?  The multi-pin jack on the bottom of the player sounds like a great place to plug in accessories...not a separate space wasting connection on the top.  Size/Weight: Tolerable when kept naked.  In the case, it becomes unwieldy.  This means scratches.  However, the metallic case seems relatively hard.  Besides, I'd rather have a slightly heavier case that is rock solid than a lighter player that scratches easily.  Sound: Great with the SRS effects turned on.  I wish the custom equalizer had more bands to adjust (only 5 bands).  Since it doesn't adjust finely enough, I use the SRS effect.  Navigation: In a word: annoying.  You cannot flip through catgories with any sort of ease.  There is a terrible few second lag in between every selection and display.  Getting back to the Now Playing screen is one button away...however I never know if I've pressed it since I have to press it twice (once to turn on the screen, and once to switch) and waits 4-5 seconds to switch back to the now playing screen.  These types of response times give the impression of sluggishness.  New tracks take many seconds to display the track name, and occasionally will not display at all.  The Ipod has no such issues with menus, why can't this player be quick too?  The scroll pad is pretty, but has a stupid arrangement.  Instead of a normal "dragging" motion, one needs to only use a small section of the middle part to "drag" their finger down, otherwise you will go the wrong direction for one line.  The top and bottom parts of the pad will auto scroll if held, and I believe this is where the problem lies.  This makes volume adjustment a bit of an adventure.  Oh, and there's NO SENSITIVITY ADJUSTMENT!  Why?  Text File Reading: Stupid functionality since it does not wrap the text to fit the screen... it will di splay like this on th e screen. Usable, yet retarded.  Voice Recording: Have not tried it for any length of time yet.  Seems to work. FM Radio: Acceptable reception, sound is good though.  Auto scan loves to pick up static stations, which makes the feature more of an annoyance.  Haven't tested the battery life yet...initial indications are about 10-12 hours of life.  Overall, I like the player for music since it sounds great and only cost me $200.  However, if one needs to file through music quickly and actually wants to look at photos or practically read text files, that person will be insanely frustrated. (That's me...10% of the time)  It just seems like they went "half way" designing this player.  So many loose ends and unecessary complications (WMP10, for instance).  I just wanted a friggin player that acted like a hard drive...you know, simple and not subject to buggy windows software and unecessary complication.  Still, I love the sound, look, and feel of the player.  Maybe the next iRiver will be better.

<Content>When I first received my H10 MP3 player, I had problems downloading music from Napster. I contacted Iriver and received the firmware update and it has been smooth sailing ever since. It can be frustrating because getting through to customer support can take some time however the customer rep that helped me went through all possible problems and walked me through the update procedure. Now I'm a happy customer. I used the free trial at Napster and was able to download over 300 songs.  People who buy over the internet may need to reformat their H10 because traveling through magnetic fields can affect the player.

<Title>Great when it works
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, I found the novitiate learning curve not nearly as steep as could be. Files and sub-files are easy to access, controls accesible and sensibly located. Battery life seems fine, file storage capacity more than adequate.  LCD screen very bright, colors true. I'm using  the photo feature more than I had anticipated. Adding/deleting music files and managing plyalists has been fine. All included accesories have functioned well. Problem is two of  the two iRivers sampled the unfortunate habit of switching themselves on at random intervals, running the battery down if not caught and reset in time. The original iRiver did this every day or two. First suspected that it was somehow getting switched on accidently. Reset all the timers, and made sure 'lock' feature was activated. Still a problem, and noticed that the clock was 'frozen' at the time the device decided to turn itself on. Original iRiver also would freeze up when it reached two of the song titles on the list, either when playing them or passing them while scanning titles. These bugs got too annoying, returned original for replacement. Great customer service from Amazon, by the way: rec'd new player in three days. Replacement iRiver is starting the same trick of running the battery dry. It is not happening frequently enough (YET!) to go through the aggravation of a warranty repair. The CSR at iRiver(not an especially helpful person) informed me that warranty repairs take about 6 weeks. I am leaving the device hooked up with its charging cable when I am not using it. Not a great idea for the battery, I suspect, but I have power when I need it. Love the iRiver's features: photo screen, FM tuner, text file capacity, sound quality seems great. Reliability is unfortunately lacking.
