<Title>Don't buy this piece of junk
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Worked pretty well for the first month except that there is no way that I could find to bookmark the books I was listening to.  At one month, though, the cheap belt-clip broke off while I was jogging.  So much for "Sport Digital..."  The clip is just a little tab of cheap plastic coming off the back of the unit, no spring clip like a cell phone would have, and it flexes a little bit every time you put it on or take it off of your belt.  After about 1 month of this, it broke completely off and fell on the ground while I was jogging.  I emailed RCA to get them to replace it and they called the belt clip breaking "an act of nature" and said it voided the warranty.  A few weeks after the clip broke, the unit started displaying gibberish instead of the name of the song that was playing and the unit shuts down after about 30 seconds.  RCA won't replace the unit due to the so-called "act of nature" so I am out of luck.  The unit was > $100 at the time and RCA gives you the finger for buying their crappy product.    Bad service + bad product + doesn't stand behind product = don't buy the POS.

<Title>Mine has been ABUSED!!  It's still alive!
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this almost daily for over 3 months now.  One of the first days I used I had it I dropped it on a hard floor and the screen went blank.  I couldn't get it back on and nearly panicked.  I took the battery out and put it back in and it came back to life!!  This has happened about 6 times since- this thing is tough!  I've dropped it several times and it just kept on playing.  It's been left in heat and cold, it's even gotten a little wet.  Only thing I haven't done yet is crush it with a barbell!!  I've only used 2 batteries, which is amazing.  It took a little time to get used to the menu, but most of the time I put it on shuffle or play a whole album and it's no problem at all.  I replaced the stock earplugs immediately with soft Koss earbuds- the sound is great.    As far as another reviewer complaining about the flimsy belt clip: he was right.  I left it in my car overnight in the cold, the player was fine, but when I went to put it on my waistband the plastic was brittle and snapped.  I tried gluing it with Gorilla glue, snapped again.  So that night I emailed customer service.  They emailed back the next day and I was able to order replacements.  It wasn't a big deal!  It's part number 271389, costs $2.99 from RCA Consumer Parts and Accessory Order Center 1-800-338-0376.  I went ahead and ordered 2 so I'll have a spare.  I own a Sandisk Sansa too, I love it dearly but I paid too much to risk killing it at the gym.  I only paid $49 for this one, 1 GB is enough space I'm not bored with my collection yet- and I feel like I've got my money's worth out of it already!  I highly recommend this player not just for sports, but also for kids that might abuse it!  Good luck!

<Title>I cannot take belt clip off the device
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I snapped belt clip on the device and I cannot get it off to replace battery. If an adult strong man cannot get the clip off, how can a child or woman do it?! Be forewarned: never use the belt clip. Features: I haven't gotten to them yet after 2 hours of wrestling with the clip. Update: to remove the clip, you have to push down the top part of the clip, and pull off the bottom part.

<Content>I am Very satisfied with the product and as always the service of amazon was excellent, the only disadvantage was that during the use the cable of the earpieces brokes and is only working one of the exits, by the others the product as equipment surpasses the expectations with the handling of the archives, the sport fusions and FM radio with the recording by several hours, very useful for the interest programs.

<Title>Very Robust Player for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife has the predacessor (S1010) to this player.  RCA has made significant improvements with this one.  This player is very robust.  The battery compartment is fully protected with the included belt clip.  The edges are made of rubber for superior impact absorption.  My player has been dropped many times and does not have a mark on it.  It has gotten confused from the impact, but a simple power off and then power on corrected the problem.  My wifes predacessor (S1010) is less than a year old and is held together with tape and rubber bands.  This is not something that I anticipate needing to do with the RD2217.  The musicmatch interface software is much more user friendly than that of the S1010.  When you sync an playlist, the playlist actually shows up on the player.  I purchased three of these..one for myself, and two for my daughters (age 6 and 5).  I had to buy some different headphones because the earclips are too large for kids (but are great for adults during exercise).  I have been pleasantly supprised that they have not had much trouble operating the player.  However, I wish that the radio recording function could be disabled.  I gave this four stars because it is a bit heavy.  Although the 50 hours playtime from a AA battery is probably worth it.  I hated the joystick control at first.  Now that I have used the player for a month, I am finaly used to it and now see its advantage.  It is easy to locate the joystick control without looking at the player which allows you to adjust volume or skip songs on the go.  For a splashproof, sport player that is truley robust, you cannot beat this player for under $50.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Lyra performs well overall, but has some drawbacks. If you are an Audible Book listener there is no bookmarking feature. Each time you turn on the player you have to "find" your place again. Also the battery cover latch broke when the player was quite new. A rubber band holds the cover in place now.

<Content>Purchased 3 for each of my daughters. Product functioned fine for the download of music at first, however a few weeks after installing into the computer, we began to have problems. The program seems to have conflicts with our internet security, and thus must be disabled ever time we down load music. Function and durability of the player unit seem fine.

<Title>Great all around player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading the reviews about the fraility of the battery cover, I took extra precaution when changing batteries.  I get about 50 hours out of each AA battery I use, and I use rechargeable batteries.  The FM radio function works great, and once you get used to the controls, they are as easy as the ipod I used to use.  The only tough part is deleting radio files that you accidentally record when you put the player in your pocket.  For the price, this is the best player I've ever owned.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 15 year old son got this to replace his Zen Nano that broke. He is rough on stuff and this is a lot sturdier. It's a good player to wear while kicking the soccer ball around or things like that. I've listened to it a few times and sound quality is good. It's a bit bigger than most flash-based MP3 players, but not much so. You can record off FM radio, which my son does a lot. The only negative is that the software to install on your computer is just plain crappy. It's a lot easier to just use Windows Explorer to drag and drop folders and songs from the hard drive.

<Title>A Piece Of Junk
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>RCA had a good idea but a bad design. The Software is like trying to find your way through a maze that has no exit. I was a system network engineer and I was ready to bounce it off the walls a few times. The clip broke when trying to ugrade the firmware before we had a chance to use it. I had to call and order another clip which took over and hour. Save up and buy something better or go get a root canal it's less painfull.

<Title>good player, minor drawbacks
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got this for Christmas.  So far it's been great.  Haven't had any major issues with it, even what others have stated. Here are some things that people might not like about it:  you have to use windows media player to add or delete songs from it.  It's not drag and drop like some of the other players I've seen. The software that comes with it(other then the drivers) is like a demo and tends to lock up plus it keeps asking if I want to 'buy' the full version of it everytime I open it. Very annoying, so I just use media player which works just fine. Yes, the plastic clip seems very flimsy, but if you use the arm band, I think it is more then adequate for that.  The buttons, at first, seemed difficult to activate, but as I have been using it that has gotten better.    The earbuds are nice and have good sound. The battery included with the player is a very good long life alkaline.  Over all, I like the player. It was given to me as a gift.  The only thing different I would have like it to have an SD card slot to expand the memory, but then I haven't been able to use up all the memory it currently has!

<Content>Nothing about this player makes sense.  It is as if it was designed by graduates of Boston College.  The buttons take FOREVER to respond, if they respond at all.  The order that the songs are in make no sense.  Alphabetical..really?  I have no idea what RCA was thinking releasing this bomb on the general public.

<Content>This Mp3 player is really great for using at the gym or any sporting activity.  -first of all it was smaller than i thoght -the little joystick feel is wierd but you get used to it -the player looks robust and like it can take some abuse -the eq function is fine, rock is my favorite -you can change the color of the LCD orange,blue,purple -it has an fm radio and you can record radio -amazing battery life, and you dont have to rely on an internal battery, it uses an AA battery for 50 hours of play, and after 2 years you wont have to worry about the internal battery life ending. -it has a great clip and arm band to use it were you want it  AND BESIDES ALL OF THE ABOVE IT MESSURES YOUR HEART RATE  GREAT PLAYER

<Title>decent and cheap -  workout? 
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>stopping and restarting so that you pick up where you leave off press stop and hold the button until it shuts down. Play will allow you to start back up. I prefered the previous firmware- ie the stuff that's loaded- I ended up installing a new firmware. The previous allowed my player to be recognized only as a flash drive. I liked that because it allowed me to create folders and check the amount of room left easily. The new firmware is better in terms of file order- I believe it loads in the order the files are copied- but I miss the freedom of simply creating a directory and knowing exactly how much room was left. Of course this lead to me accidentily erasing the firmware. But the performance of this player is still decent. The belt clip is long gone, I think I sucessfully used it for three months, and then it broke. It still fits in my pocket and I'm not using it in an athletic situation. It occurs to me that it would be reasobably easy to construct a similar belt clip- perhaps even using some belt clip from another device. I haven't worked out how, but a thin gauge wire might be a good place to start. This player takes a lot of fooling around to figure out and it's not the most intuitive piece but it plays mp3 and wma and that means I happily use it for podcasts and audio books from my local library. It's not perfect but it's not expensive it has a visual display. I've seen something that suggests you can change the background color. I have not achieved that yet.   Keep the firmware (perhaps copying it to your computer as backup).  Don't use it to work out- it's belt clip will fail and that's the only way to use the armband. Unintuitive button use.   Still good playback. Multiple file support. windows media playlists? rugged construction. easy use with conventional or rechargable batteries.

<Content>Got this as a gift for XMas to replace a lost Rio Cali Sport. I need something light, durable and water-resistant for exercise. This is all that, but I found the controls, and the menus, much less easy to use than the Rio. Also it's easy to jostle the control stick and shut it down in the middle of a run. One other big negative is no slot for an MMR card, which was a big plus of the Cali. (If only I could find another of those!)

<Title>tough but cool
<Date>Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I researched ipods and mp3 players for two weeks on Amazon and read countless reviews.  This unit promised the most and has delivered.  It is tiny, but tough.  I have dropped on concrete due to my error twice and the rubberized trim protected the unit.  Sound is stereo quality (it passed my Steely Dan test).  I use the unit primarily to listen to podcasts of talk radio shows.  The storage is incredible at 1 gig.  That is plenty.  The only knock is that the buttons take some time (in my case about a week) to get used to and skipping songs can be difficult at times because sometimes when I slid it to skip to next song, it does not respond.  But..considering the other features, especially small size, looks, sound quality, storage and neat ear buds that hook around without pain to the ear, it's great value for $139-149 price range.  It even has a stopwatch and heartrate monitor as well as FM radio built in.  And, it looks smart and cool.

<Title>I want to rate this item a zero--it is not what I wanted
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is totally useless for someone who wants a compact device to listen to books and radio programs from audible.com despite the detail info in the description.  The instructions do not explain how to get it to re-start a book or radio program where one left off.  This means if you have listened to 3 hours of a 6 hour book, there is no way to get to where you are except let the thing play for 3 hours!  After much experimentation, I discovered a way, but it required 2 extra steps BEFORE turning off the machine and it only worked occasionally.  Often when I tried to go from one audible selection to another it froze up with the screen saying PLEASE WAIT forever.  The only way to fix that problem was to dislodge the battery.  BUT to do that you needed a screwdriver to get the belt clip off!  So if you are out driving or exercising and it freezes, you are out of luck.  When I called LYRA's help desk (could not find any relevant info on their web site), the customer service rep said the device can accept audible type files, but it really is intended for music only, not for books.  She said there were no ways to make bookmarks or to pickup where you left off.  The device also loaded the audible programs randomly, not in the order as they were added, which makes it difficult to listen to multiple radio programs in chronological order.  And if you are trying to scroll through your files to find the next date, 9 times out of 10 it froze and you were no where near your screwdriver! I am returning the device to Amazon IF they ever send the return envelope, which was promised two weeks ago.  UGH!  I'm frustrated.

<Content>So far I love this player.  At first I wasn't so sure about it.  It seemed difficult to work, but I have finally gotten the hang of it, and it is great.  I take it to the gym and use it working around the house.  It is easy to change from one song to the next, or to change the volume without having to look at the screen.  The only thing I don't like, is the earphones.  The sound is good, but they hurt my ears.  I have some cheap ones I bought, and they work fine.  I seriously considered getting an Ipod, but now I am glad I didn't.  I have used it, I don't know how many hours, and my battery indicator still shows full.  Plus, I love not having to recharge the battery.  You just use a plain AA battery.  I would definately recommend this player.  It is great for the price.

<Title>Such A Shame,  1 Star For Looks!!
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was so excited to get this MP3 player, it had every feature I was looking for. 1GB, digital radio, that you can record from, stopwatch and pulse monitor, and very important for my clumsy but,  rubber around it to absorb a fall, and a belt clip. I even got it for an absolutely wanderful price, $122.00.      Well here it goes, first off someone else had mentioned the battery screw sucks, well mine broke the first time I tried to open it, so the only thing keeping it shut is the beltclip that goes over the back. The belt clip is useless, it basically goes over your belt or wastband but can slide off very easily, it doesn't have that little wedge like beeper or cell phone clips. The sound is not impressive at all, at the gym when it wasn't falling off my wasteband I had it turned all the way up, and was still hearing the gym's music, (you have to know that the gym I go to does not play their music loud at all). I like my music loud, and this thing has to be turned all the way up just to be enjoyed, and at its loudest, its not loud at all. It doesn't come with an instruction manual either, (I know for sure its not a mistake, because I first purchased the 256MB one it didn't have one either). It is so hard to figure this thing out, and I'm usually pretty good with electronics. Now worst of all, almost all the music I listen to is mixed my a DJ, after all the dj mixed cd's and files from my computer I downloaded and was so exited to listen to, I found out that this thing automatically puts the songs from each cd or any file from your computer into alphebetical order, that pretty much did it for me, it defeats the purpose of why I listen to music. So if you get this, no matter what order you put your songs in or any cd that you listen to, the songs will automatically be put into alphebetical order regardless of how much time it took you to organize your files... WOW!!!!!???

<Title>Pretty good
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pluses - The deciding factor for me to get this was the AA battery .. my Panasonic with it's AAA using rechargable batteries lasts about 45 minutes .. so I really like the AA .. not sure why more mp3's dont use it.   Another plus my XP computer loaded the mp3 players as a drive and I could drop and drag my songs into the player ... No special software to check in songs I already have (unlike the Panasonic).  Sound is good with a very good set of headsets.  Is very easy to use if you just want to play music while working out .. I use shuffle feature for random play.  I don't need them sorted.  If I did this player may not sort properly from what I've read.  Minus - well , sort of ... I guess none are perfect. How funny. A big metal screw which requires a screw driver to hold battery cover.  Mine also broke right away .. but I just put a rubber band around it .. so it's no problem.  The cover just protects the battery, not hold it in place.

<Content>RCA advertises that this mp3 player is compatible with Macs - It is not!  The software they send you works only with windows.  Apparently, a long time ago, an unrelated company hacked a way to make it work with macs but they no longer exist/support the software/supply the software.  After finally finding a Windows infected PC (I live in the world of UNIX, LINUX, Mac), I discover the software comes attached with Marketing subprograms.    I also had to re-copy cd's to actually get them into the .mp3 format - which is old and unused by more competetive music players.  The radio works passably well.  Haven't tried the audio books or sports features yet.

<Content>I've used quite a few mp3 players for workouts: creative muvo and nano which are great but the battery doors are a bit flimsy. Trekstor which is also a great player, pretty durable; awesome sound. These are not splash proof.  But this Lyra player is awesome!! Mainly b/c the battery life is Amazing. I never have to worry about it. I've been using the AA battery they included for 2 weeks now. 2 FR*GGIN WEEKS! And as of today, it's only gone down 1 bar.   The only downside is it can be a bit hard to navigate but I assume after more use that will loosen up. I've even used the calorie counter and heart rate and they have worked well.  To me, this is a buy!
