<Title>Good - almost great little player! 
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am very impressed with this product in a nutshell.  Powered by a standard AAA battery the battery life for my kanguru is outstanding, I can listen for hours at a clip and change my battery about once every two weeks. It's about the size of a large pack of gum.   The music quality is as good as I think one can expect from a memory stick player presently. The tunes are largely flawless and the bass and EQ (equalizer) settings are much better than you will find with other players.  It's windows and linux friendly, (I didn't realize it but one of my computers was actually trying to boot from it the other day so for anyone looking for a cool hacking toy, look no further)  Initially files mp3's and recorded mp3/wavs are stored in separate directories, you can however add directories to any of these areas and organize your tunes by folder which I find really convenient if you want to group your listening into types of tunes or what have you.  I've been very happy with the transfer speed to my machines and have been able to basically forget burning CD/DVD's unless I actually want to "keep" something.   This player does have some minor issues but these are just that minor I'll be fair and mention them.  The little springy music switch seems to me to be the one thing which I think would/(might still) break, although it does make a certain amount of sense when you consider that you can move FF/Rev or go through tunes to a point in a song, not just from tune A to tune B.   The volume button on the unit is a little tricky, once or twice I pressed too close to the middle and the volume button and the player got confused and shut down, but now that I know, I am wiser.  Now to be fair, I am not easy on my equipment. I go through cell phones regularly and while I don't remember a particular instance where I overly abused my kanguru,but about two weeks out it up and died on me, but fear not intrepid readers, their support folks were all over it and I had a free replacement out to me in just 2 days. So just when I was missing my tunes I got my groove back!   And like any good American these days, I'll blame Al Qaida for the last bad thing that happened. I went thru some funky new metal detector at an airport and got an earful but otherwise the kanguru and I survived.   All in all I'm tempted to give them 5 of 5 but I've only had a couple of these and have been (so far) impressed.

<Title>Great sounding - very good value
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found the very few reviews of the Kanguru Micro MP3 Pro 1Gb on Amazon and PriceGrabber very helpful.  So I thought I'd contribute my own.  A lot of this is going to be my discovery and research in mp3 format - as opposed to just a review of the product.  So to summarize - the Kanguru Micro MP3 Pro 1Gb   Pluses  + very good value for money (I paid [...]dollars at Amazon and there was a [...]dollars rebate from Kanguru in Aug/2006) + works well  + sounds very good + small in size + built-in USB connector + load and file/folders as on regular USB flash drive + can arrange files in folders + current version (firmware version: 1.1.37) will play 320K/sec mp3 - and can play VBR (variable Bit Rate) mp3.  Minuses - there are some things that prevent me from giving it a full 5 star rating - but they are minor and can easily be overcome. - relatively short battery life - mine is the current version purchased August/2006 - with firmware version: 1.1.37 - spec in manual says 9 hours which is what I got out of the supplied alkaline battery.  I now use 1000mAh rechargeable NiMH AAA batteries which last about 10hours from full charge - not much better - but I can use the player with relative impunity as the power is more or less "free". - Need to read manual to be able to use the unit well - since the unit is small (an advantage) - that in turn make the controls smaller and fiddly - but the basics are easy. - Order of play is order of uploading - using folders can help mitigate this as the folders are played in order of creation/upload.  My learning curve was in mp3 format and quality -  Initially all I did was to rip CD tracks using Nero and Windows Media Player - using the just acceptable Constant Bit Rate (CBR) of 128k/sec - these gave files which sounded fine on the unit.   I read the mp3 entry at Wikipedia which helped in my understanding of mp3 its bit rates and quality - I then did lots of research/browsing on the web about mp3 - which led me to understand that LAME was considered one of the best sounding converters for mp3.  Also 128K/sec was the de-facto bit rate for acceptable quality - which is what I found - on its own the files sounded fine - no, great - that is until one compared it against the highest bit rate 320K/sec - there was just a perceptible difference - but certainly not enough to justify using 320K/sec which results in file size that is almost 3 times bigger over the 128K/sec.  Reading more on mp3 quality there were comments that 160K/sec was a better rate for almost indistinguishable from the original CD, others pick 192K/sec and some even 256K/sec.  The software I had been using to rip my CDs were  - Windows Media Player  does not say which mp3 encoder it uses - but I suspect is the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft (FhG) mp3 encoder.  - Nero CD Burning uses a trial version of mp3PRO which expired on me - I found and installed a free plug-in using LAME mp3 (v.3.93.1)  I wanted to try out later versions of LAME but I could not find/figure out how to plug-in later versions for Nero or Windows Media Player.  So eventually I read more on CD ripper-converter software and settled on CDex - which has the LAME mp3 encoder version 3.97beta2 installed.  This is what I now use to rip my CDs  Conducting my own listening tests I could tell a difference between 128, 160 and 320 - however I felt the quality of the 128K/bit was more than just "good enough" for a portable mp3 player as this Kanguru Micro mp3 Pro 1Gb.  Just a word of how I did my listening tests - I used my Sony MDR-V6 headphones which have long been regarded as one of the best headphones. And I picked a track that I was familiar with "Lazarus Heart" by Sting from the ".. Nothing Like the Sun" CD - I listen mainly to the first 1 minute or so of the track - specifically at the cymbal splash between 10 -21 secs, cymbals behind the soprano sax starting at about 30secs, then the quality of the vocals and the high cymbals behind it around 50secs.  The cymbal splash was much less defined using CBR 128K/sec - it improved using 160K/sec although I could still tell a slight difference between that and the 320K/sec version - 192K/sec was better - but marginal and the file sizes were getting unacceptably big.  That's when I read more about VBR (variable bit rate) and experimented with that setting using LAME mp3 on CDex.  Setting the full range from 32K to 320K/sec bit rates - I tried and settled on VBR 06 (00=highest, 09=lowest quality).  This gave a file size that was only very slightly bigger than the 128K/sec - and to my ears definitely sounded better and probably matching 160K/sec.  This is a great compromise between more than acceptable sound quality and file size.  I can now say I am very pleased with my results and usage of this unit.  The simple fact that I could hear/detect very subtle differences in my listening tests - shows that the sound quality from this unit is very good.  If possible I would rate this 4.5 stars  EDIT to Add -  About 6 months on - and I still like this MP3 player a lot - even though it has some idiosyncrasities - I have come to appreciate it over other mp3 players.  I like the fact this player supports folders and sub-folders - this allows one to order the sequence of playing more easily - also there is the ability re-sequence or insert songs into sequences without having to reload songs in play order. I do the latter by creating a temporary folder on the player where I move the tracks from a sequence into it then add the new track and move the songs one at a time in desired play order back into the original folder. Another useful aspect of this is a I have folder at the top which I use to insert any current listening album as a sub-folder for more immediate and frequent repeated access - then I can change that album out or add another without upsetting my other sequences. Not many mp3 players I've looked at support playing folders and sub-folders.  I have not got random repeat play to work for me.  Sound quality is really good using VBR (32K-320K, quality 06, LAME) mp3 encoding - and since I got even better suited headphones - the Philips HE591 "surround sound" earbuds (see my review).  1Gb may seems little by today's standards of multi-tens of gigs - but 1 Gb will hold about 250 songs, about 20 CDs, or close to 15.5 hours of music for my mp3 compression - that's a lot of music - and the ability to load/swap out any music into a folder for current listening without fuss makes this very convenient for the way I use the player.  This is a great little mp3 player at a not very expensive price. Rating remains at a good solid 4.5 stars.

<Title>Kanguru MP3not bad really, yet not great
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>my over all experience is positive, though the supplied head set is woefully inadequate, they caused a consistent short that reset the player in the middle of song tracks. Also the user interface is a little awkward at first but comes with experience. Over all the 1 gig of flash memory functions as advertised and gets  excellent marks from me. The real seller for me is that it functions well with my Ubuntu Linux box and never fails to upload song or file, as long as you remember to release the hold button on the side(it locks the access to all software/hardware functions). Over all 3 out of 5 stars, reason, its user interface needs to be streamlined to really improve the user experience, and the supplied ear buds are abysmal, but $5.00 and a cheap maxell head set solves the ear bud issue. Really its not that bad, but it could improve.

<Title>Does the job.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted a simple MP3 player with good sound and not a ton of extras.  This model showed up in a search, and though I'd never heard of the company, I took a chance.  And I'm glad I did.  I bought three - one for myself, and two for friends.  They're both very happy.  One caveat - one of my friends says it drains the battery quickly when you put the volume near the top mark (he's partially deaf).  Spend a few more dollars and get rechargable AAAs.

<Content>Easy to use and beats the CD player.  My only reservation is that rechargeable batteries are not the best choice to use with this mp3 player.

<Title>kanguru MP3 1G player
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this player is great! The song capacity is exactly what I needed and the price was great. Well worth the purchase. Infact, the player accidently went through the wash and it still worked. Very impressive. The ease of syncronizing the songs with my computer is also a plus. Just plug it into the USB port on the front of my computer and start adding songs. I would definitly refer anyone to purchase this player
