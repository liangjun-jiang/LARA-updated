<Title>It's a Sony!"
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This superlative unit is perhaps the finest portable audio/MP3 player on the market to date. I find it funny to say that, because this device crystallizes not only everything that is right about Sony, but most everything that is wrong about it, as well.   In a maddening repeat of the Sony story, the Sony Corporation was perhaps some ten years ahead of every other company on the world in developing high-compression audio using software algorithms to store sound data in computer-based files. In spite of that achievement, Sony was never able to successfully capitalize on the technology, primarily through a combination of missteps in advertising, pricing, and non-licensing of its proprietary technology. We sometimes watch with bemusement when we see today's MP3 aficionados, knowing that Sony was doing this type of thing - and doing it better - as far back as 1992, when it launched its first commercial MiniDisc player, the MZ1. For what was essentially an entire decade, those who worked with the MinDisc format enjoyed most all the advantages of MP3, and almost found ourselves chuckling to see the world "discover" lossy media recording some decade or so later, around 2001. It was also bemusing to watch the implementation of the technology in such open standards formats, primarily MP3, when an arguably superior encoding algorithm, the Sony ATRAC format, had been perfected for that entire timeframe, first with "S" and "R" variants, and then with even greater strides with the "ATRAC3Plus" algorithm. With such early work in the field of psychoacoustic encoding and the psychology of human sound processing, Sony played a key role in this technology's base, and helped make the entire domain possible.   And so as the story goes, Sony was able to capitalize on a ten-year technology lead, and completely dominate the MP3 world as they had done twenty years earlier with the invention of "Walkman." Everyone in the world used a Sony-developed portable audio player, and once again, Sony showed the world how it could translate their technological innovations into yet another product success story. Right? No, as usual in the recent past for Sony, WRONG. Sony managed to wrestle defeat out of the mouth of victory, and today, one can hardly find a Sony portable music player on the market, while competing companies sell their units at a rate that is seemingly limited only by market saturation. And that, too, is funny, because when one takes the time to check out a unit like the NW-7xx series, it is pretty easy to determine that the combination of an outstanding compression algorithm like ATRAC3Plus along with Sony's indisputable prowess at developing incredible audio hardware can result in a truly impressive product. In many ways, the NW-7xx series can be regarded as the pinnacle of a 15-year process in the development of portable audio equipment, the superb integration of digital computer technology with analog audio technology.   The NW-7xx series is a marvel of miniaturized audio technology. Sound quality is exceptional, the unit is designed with a style that is the hallmark of the Sony Design Center in Tokyo, and the operational control of the unit constantly reminds us that this unit truly is a "Sony," carefully thought out and executed with both technological and artistic flare. Ergonomic issues surrounding the use of small electronic devices have been carefully considered and marvelously addressed, and, in addition, pioneering technologies are implemented in the unit which are only now beginning to show up in other players. This is especially true of the use of OLED technology for the unit's display interface, which uses far less electricity than other display technologies, but is bright and attractive, and also the impressively functional, active noise reduction system which uses microphones at ear-level to create an inverse sound wave to cancel out ambient noise.   Features abound in this visually-striking device. Control is through a select few buttons, but the main interface is through a spring-loaded rotary knob, the design of which was successfully used in the earlier "Core" Sony devices. The OLED display is bright and clear, and even shows a full-color thumbnail of album art (if one has taken the time to capture the album art during ripping). Battery life is simply amazing, easily surpassing 40 hours under some conditions, and yet, is recharged at high speed, with only three minutes of recharge needed for three hours of play. (It may take 60 - 90 minutes to fully top off the battery, but this is still fast, considering the 40 - 50 hour playback time.) And because the battery is a lithium ion design, we have full battery readout on the screen to tell us the current battery charge level. The unit weighs only a few ounces, and is easily pocketed or worn around the neck with a strap.   Entering the menu system reveals a wealth of customizable features pertaining to operation and playback sound settings. There are multiple, customizable equalizer settings, adjustments for sound reduction sensitivity, "clear bass" technology, "clear stereo" technology, and a host of pre-configured, digital sound processing selections to imitate all types of sound fields. Noise reduction is accomplished through the use of the supplied headphones, which possess very small microphones in the earpiece component. (Other headphones using the small inch standard headphone jack size will also work with the player, but the active noise reduction will be disabled when doing so.) Is this a concern? Most people rate the Sony ear buds as one of the true "sleeper" headphones on the market today, churning out great sound quality in spite of their relatively low price. The headphones which come with this device, however, are even better than most other Sony headphones, utilizing a 13.5mm driver instead of the more typical 9mm driver found on other Sony ear bud headphone models.   The sound quality of the unit is simply superb. Using combinations of the noise reduction, equalization, and other settings, the player can produce playback that rivals much more expensive home systems, and surprisingly, due to the effectiveness of the ATRC3Plus algorithm, even at bit rates as low as 64 kbps. It's difficult to not be impressed, even upon repeated playing. And, yes, the noise reduction actually works. Take the unit into any noisy environment, turn it on, and watch the sound "floor" drop by a significant amount without any deterioration in sound quality. But it is the combination of elements - the high-quality circuitry, the outstanding headphones, and the sound processing options - that make the sound playback on the unit far surpass what we might ever expect from a portable player. So good, in fact, that the effect sometimes surpasses our home listening experiences.   With all these superlatives, why then would I say the unit also crystallizes everything that is WRONG with Sony? With Sony's advent into the world of media ownership (both music and video), the company moved into a semi-schizophrenic world that apparently pits the electronics division (which designs and manufactures hardware devices like the one reviewed here) against the media division (which sells music and movies). One could argue not unconvincingly that the two goals of such a move was not only misaligned, but perhaps opposed, to one another, with one group wishing to sell music DEVICES that play media, and the other wishing to control COPYRIGHT of such media. The result? A program called "SonicStage," the media ripper and control program for Sony portable media devices. And although it's not quite as horrible as some of its detractors make it out to be, the program is indeed slow and hobbled with DRM (digital rights management) that can be supremely frustrating even for the most basic of tasks. There are nightmare stories about the use of SonicStage (and some of them I've experienced, or witnessed, myself), and its presence alone more than anything else is at best the weak link in the use of the Sony portable digital players. This is the side of Sony that is probably most responsible for pushing people in droves into the arms of the now-famous and ubiquitous MP3 and iPod players. And while SonicStage has steadily improved over the years, it is still locked into DRM, and no Macintosh version exists to date. For a company that uses Macintosh in its own Design Center in Tokyo to create its award-winning designs, one can only wonder how such decisions are made.   The NW-7xx units are now showing up in some retail U.S. outlets at greatly reduced prices. The 4Gb units, until now sold exclusively in Europe and in Japan, are also showing up at discounts of up to 70%. As such, they represent one of the greatest bargains available for some of the most technologically advanced players on the market today. Sony may have more tricks up its sleeve, and we may soon see changes in the near future, perhaps another attempt to wrestle back some of the market share from the iPod. Even so, picking up one of these units now at sub-$100 prices is probably the portable electronics bargain of the year. If you can deal with SonicStage and not get too frustrated with its operation, you can enjoy one of the best sound experiences available today in portable electronics. Using one makes us remember with feeling the old marketing slogan: "It's a Sony!"

<Title>Great player, not reliable.
<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Imagine you just bought this player.  It's sexy, easy to use, and sounds great.  The LED is superb and the battery life is amazing.  Now imagine 5 months later it started to malfunction; the audio glitches and you can't hear anything.  The audio jack is loose so you decide to seal it yourself.  Unfortunately there aren't any screws or any other way to open the player.  Luckily you have a 1-year warranty.  You call tech support and they'll exchange it for the price of $30.  Stay away from this product; Just because Sony isn't doing so well doesn't mean they should screw their customers for their faults.  Pathetic.

<Title>Sony Connect Music Store is Closing
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device can only download from Sony Connect Store which is closing March, 2008.  After that, the device is useless.  You can not use other online download sites but this device used a different format.  I found many help sites with long instructions on how to convert a file, burn in on a cd, then...maybe you can download your PAID songs onto the device. I am not a computer buff. You can still play the songs already on the device and use the radio.  But I purchased this item to download my personal music library. I have 3 of them.  Not this one but the super one that was a 100.00.  What a waste.  YOu can return it and cant sell it.  What a waste of money.

<Title>Four-and-a-half stars
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the 706F, which is a 4 Gb, not officially available in the US.  I forget now, but I think I paid just a little over 100 for it.  PRO's are: noise canceling (need experimenting...), radio (Yay, NPR!), superior sound quality and battery life, and very efficient use of memory: regardless of source, it uses the ATRAC system uses 66 Kbps, half the low end of most iPod usage.  In other words, your 4 Gig works like an 8.  I have no problem with the Sonic Stage system once I got to learn it - just getting used to, rather than some kind of fundamental design flaw.  CON's? I DID experience some glitches with it.  A while back, the unit seemed to have been on permanent "hold", meaning nothing, incld. the volume control, worked.  It just played merrily on, without my ability to select the album I want, go to FM radio, change the volume/control or anything.  I rebooted it, which worked for a while, but then it started acting up the same way again.  This time rebooting didn't work.  I was about to return the unit for repairs, when by fiddling around with various buttons, mainly the "hold" button, it started working perfectly again.  That was 3-4 weeks ago, and the problem has not cropped up once since.  Weird.  Also, the unit IS prone to accidentally being turned on, which might drain your battery without you realizing it.  Now I learn to put it on "hold" if there's a risk it might be turned on.  All in all, I'd much prefer to use this than either my Nano or regular 30 gig.  Nobody has it - it's so cool, and so functional when I travel.  Let me tell you: on trans-con or inter-continental trips, the battery lasts forever compared to an iPod, and if you're unlucky enough to be on the last row of an MD-80, this baby will preserve your sanity.
