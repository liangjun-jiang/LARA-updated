<Title>Doesnt hold a charge

<Content>I bought it used and possibly my own mistake. But it doesnt hold a charge for more than 20 minutes. Take my advice and buy new. Then at least you can take it back when it starts to act up.

<Content>the i-pod works very nicely.  No problems.  The only reason I stopped using it was for a bigger one .  I bought an 80gb.  Otherwise this one is very nice.
