<Title>Problem was that ear pieces fall out ... see my resolution
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The main issue I had was with the player and the inability of the ear pieces to stay in place.  This was finally solved by buying a neoprene headband.  If you swim laps be sure to buy a neoprene headband.

<Title>Great for swimming
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Works really well, earbuds designed to not fall out and are very comfortable in the water.  Sound quality is great in the water.  Only downfall is the lack of features compared to other MP3 players, but fit my needs perfectly (lap swimming).

<Content>I did alot of research on these before i purchased them. They sound great in the water. I still havent got the right size for my ears yet. They come with 3 sizes and I just used the mediums that were on there and it seemed like they came out a couple times. They sounded great though, i used it for the purpose of lap swimming and it was amazing. I didnt want to get out of the water.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was a little worried about buying an MP3 player off of the Internet, but I am so happy I did! I have the 1GB model and it is totally awesome, so far. I have not been swimming with it yet, but I did submerse it in a sink full of water and it worked perfect! It even floats...which is a good thing!  It comes with a neoprene arm band which is pretty comfy, and the waterproof headphones work very good...the sound is not as clear as through reg. headphones, but trust me they are loud enough...I have quite a bit of hearing loss and they are plenty loud enough for me...  Personally, I would highly recommend this MP3 Player to my friends. It's built well, it's durable, light I can't even tell it's on my arm. It's a sweet deal. It also holds quite a bit of songs...and is very easy to transfer songs to. Oh, I almost forgot the greatest thing! It has built in rechargeable batteries, all you have to do is plug in the USB cord and let it charge...and they last a long time.

<Title>Ok product, not great service
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After researching quite a few different waterproof MP3 players, I decided to purchase the freestyle audio sport 1G player. I wanted one that would also work outside of the water. The first player arrived promptly; when I plugged the USB in my computer to charge the battery, my computer didn't recognize the device. After a couple of re-starts, same problem. I tried to power on/off the player and it then got stuck in the "on" position and would not turn off. After 3 calls to Freestyle customer service, they agreed to send a replacement.   The new player worked fine and was recognized by my computer. However, you will have to convert any Windows media files to MP3 (with a free program such as "Switch") before you can load then on your player. I copied files by dragging and dropping, because the optional playlist software you can download from Freestyle Audio's web site was non-functional. I even tried a re-install after the new player came, but the program never populated with the proper MP3 files. Because of this, I have to erase songs off of the player by "formatting" in windows media player. It's kind of a pain.  The player worked great in the water--good sound. Even with the smallest earbuds, however, I found the pressure to painful with a swim cap. I have fairly small ears. If you also have this problem I would recommend not pulling your swim cap over your ears. I only put one ear bud in while I swim and the sound is stil fine. You can still do underwater turns with it--I tend to just tuck the player into the waist of my suit rather than use the armband.  I found out something really annoying after my first use--My player won't remember what song it left off at. According to Freestyle's web site, the player is supposed to remember if you always turn if on/off at the switch (rather than unplugging the headphones). I have always done this, but the player still won't remember. Since it holds a lot of songs, and I only swim for 40 minutes at a time, this is HIGHLY annoying! I have called Freestyle three times (once I got a real person who was supposed to call back) trying to find out about a patch or another replacement. Their service is poor, in my opinion. This product has a 90 day warranty, so I should be able to get another product sent if I could get a real person on the phone!  Bottom line--I recommend with reservations. I think most of the players work as promised. However, I have had 2 players now that each had some sort of problem. Combined with some ho-hum customer service, it's hard to be too enthusiastic about their product.

<Title>stopped working the second time I used it....
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product from amazon 1 month ago. The first time I used it for swimming it was great...2 days later I went again to the pool and the mp3 player suddenly stopped working, from that moment on, it never turned on or showed any signal of life...I live in brazil and bought it while I was travelling in the US. So far I had no response from freestyleaudio regarding support or something like it..i totally advise any one who is interested on this product to reconsider it..

<Title>Avoid this product!
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine, and it worked exactly one time.  I was just doing water running, so it was never even submerged.  It never worked again, so I was out $150, since I purchased it before the price reduced.  I tried contacting the company, to no avail.  It just wouldn't respond at all after that first time.  It's not worth what you pay, and the company couldn't care less about  the product once it's sold.

<Title>Great Little Device
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for christmas because I'm a recreational lap swimmer, and I like it so far.  I put the player in my suit (I don't have the armband...yet) and I used the ear pieces that came attached (there are three sizes total, so you can pick the ones that fit your ear canal best).  It took me a few minutes to get the thing on, but after that I didn't have much of a problem - minimal fussing required, and I'm sure that once I figure out how to put them on right I won't have to touch them at all - they stayed in my ear very well, regardless of stroke).  The sound is dependent on the angle a which the ear pieces sit in your ear, so the volume varies a little when you turn your head to breathe or flip, but it didn't really bother me.  I also found that the sound was best when my ears were submerged but just below the surface (as opposed to a foot or two deep, like in a streamline).  It's obviously hard to change the song mid-stroke, so I reserved that for in-between sets.  The buttons aren't easily depressed, which is good because you can't hit them by mistake while you're swimming.  I do wish the volume went higher, but that's just because I wear headphones ALL the time, and I'm sure  I'm just half deaf.  This product is worth a try.

<Content>The FA 1GB player is awesome.  I was a little skeptical based on reviews here on amazon, but I have experienced none of these problems.  The player works great (picks up where you left off) and plays mp3s and WMAs (not iTunes).  I use the lanyard while swimming laps b/c IT FLOATS!!!  but the armband <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMEBSI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9178361-4709765">FREESTYLE AUDIO ARMBAND FOR DMP SERIES MP3 PLAYERS - FREESTYLE AUDIO - MP3 PLAYER</a> would come in very useful.  The player is compatible with regular headphones and if you are a boarder, it is compatible with in-helmet speakers found at www.shredready.com  The headphones (3 sizes) stay in, except in the most violent kick-turns, so maybe don't use it during your race, but lap swimming while listening to music is one of the coolest feelings.  I used to love swimming in competion, but I get bored by myself now that I'm older, with the FA player I can throw a playlist or CD from Windows Media Player and go for a swim or kayak, or go windsurfing or wakeboarding... if you or anyone you know likes any watersports get this awesome player.  It is much cheaper than an iPod with the case, and when you're working out do you really fool with all the buttons, no you just set it and forget it!

<Title>Not bad, and better than anything else on the market
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use my FS for listening to audiobooks (not music) while lap swimming, which I'm doing several times a week. I've been using the player like that for about a year and I would say I'm mildly satisfied.   On the pro side - it does what it's supposed to do - play mp3 files while submerged in water. To me - right there - this is a major feature, given that I would not have otherwise have the patience to swim for more than 10 minutes with only the sound of water and my breathing in my ears. Hence, the positive rating. PC interface is fine, both for file uploading and for charging - the included software doesn't do much but it does make sure your tracks play in your desired order - not crucial for music, probably, but very important for audiobooks...  There are, however, some limitations on its features which may, or may not, turn you off. It obviusly has no display whatsoever, so you can't navigate around your files and folders the way you do with a "normal" mp3 player. You can start, stop, skip back one track, skip forward one track, turn the volume up and turn the volume donw; that's it - no rewind, no fast forward. So you basically have to turn it on at the beginning of the session and turn it off at the end. Volume could be somewhat louder and, at least in my unit, one channel is louder and clearer than the other. The headphones are the weakest link - they're ok, but very fragile - I had 2 or 3 of those go silent on me, but the company replaced them at no charge and did so very gracioiusly.   All in all - a fairly satisfied customer.
