<Title>How to get it working again!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable.

<Title>Really Nice To Have
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has been working great for me. The headphones aren't the best so it sounds a whole lot better with good ones. Once the USB stick has been formatted on a Windows machine, files (audio or other) are easily transferred using a Mac in OSX. Having the removable USB stick to transfer files between computers is a huge bonus.

<Title>Great little mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the MuVo 64mb mp3 player. I actually got it through bartering on craigslist. I must say that I am VERY pleased. It's great that I now have a removable usb stick and the playback sounds absolutely incredible. It has surpassed my expectation. It is very simple to load songs/files onto. I can store about 13 songs on the 64mb version. :) Great for students, at the gym, while commuting (metro only hehehee), and just walking around town while shopping.

<Content>Long battery life, apprently indestructible, no moving parts, no display, drag and drop, totally unsophisticated but WORKS to hold a cvouple oif hours of songs for workouts, etc.  No playlists, but I simply plug it in to my USB port and replace the songs with new ones every few days. AAA batteries can be bought anywhere.  Of course you cannot compare this with a fuill-featured player, but for what it is it ROCKS!

<Title>Very nice MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ...  Yesterday, I ordered from Amazon, another MP player, this time I got me a bigger one. I am getting the Creative MuVo N200 512MB, plenty of music for me since my other one (64MB) is holding only 10 to 12 songs.  Now, if you wish to get a very small gadget that plays good music, I strongly suggest you get a Creative product, I do like them.

<Title>Great for Third World Travel
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this simple little player for third world travel.  Without having any bells and whistles, the batteries last a long time, which is important when traveling in areas where these might be hard to come by.  The simplicity of the controls makes it easy to use at night.  Its small size and its simple exterior allowed me to travel confidently without the fear that strangers in the bus stand thought I was holding something valuable.  I would recommend this player as an alternative to your Ipod for rugged travels.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When this device worked, it was great.  Small, could go running with it, and I remember excellent audio clarity.  But every once in a while it wouldn't work.  And I could never figure out why.  80% of the time worked great.  20% of time it really pissed me off.  A year later it seems to have completely stopped working.  Would probably have given a 5 if the player was more solid and tech difficulties/bugs had been worked out.

<Title>Very Unreliable
<Date>Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Like a few other people here, I'm having the auto-lobotomization problem big time. I had to do the hard reformat every other day or so, and it's presently not working at all.<p>Oddly enough, I got a 64 meg model as a gift after buying the 128 meg model. The 128 meg model worked fine when plugged into the 64 meg battery pack. Then they both stopped working at all. <p>I think Creative is very close to having a winner here. Using the thing when it works is a dream -- no goofy programs to load the device (which always seem to break or refuse to see the target). The fact that some people love it while others hate it make me suspect that they've got a really nasty QC problem in the assembly line.

<Title>Great product, but defective....
<Date>Sun Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I loved my MuVo, it's awesome. But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars.

<Title>The Simplest MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I received my MuVo 64 last week--no problems whatsoever. (My OS is Windows XP.)  This is the first MP3 player I've ever owned, so I'm not an expert nor do I miss the extras most of the other players have, such as the LCD screen. It couldn't be easier to use: separate the removable media from the battery pack, plug it into the USB port, drag &amp; drop your files, then eject the removable media. I bought mine primarily as an exercise buddy-makes my treadmill time go a little faster. Since these sessions generally last just 30-45 minutes, I don't need a large capacity player. The cord that enables me to hang the MuVo around my neck is a real plus; it's so lightweight (approximately 1 oz.) I hardly know it's there. The earbuds sounded OK, but a set of normal headphones (for ex, the headphones that came with my Walkman) proved to be a lot more comfortable. The only reasons for my not giving it 5 stars are (1) the earbuds, and (2) the need to press the play button for a few seconds to power up/down (I initially thought it was broken because of this).  Nevertheless, I love the size, weight, and sound of this gadget. A definite recommend for someone who wants an easy-to-use player and not looking for the extra features-a great exercise companion!

<Title>Great MP3 player with bonus portable storage feature!
<Date>Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After reading various reviews, professional and these user reviews, I knew this was the device for me. I was not disappointed. I was loading MP3s on it three minutes after opening the pacakage. <p>I am running XP home edition and had no problems getting it to recognize as a removable hard drive. Beautiful.<p>I mainly use mine to listen to music while jogging. You definitely need to get rid of the included earbuds. I threw mine into the trash after listening to the poor quality. Sound quality is great with my Sony earphones. Good bass as well.<p>If you are looking for a great no-frills MP3 player with removoable-storage capability this is the product for you. The reverse is true also. Both functions work great on XP and my Win2K system at work.<p>I agree with everyone that they definitely need to release some kind of armband for us joggers. Its annoying to have to carry in your hand and I don't trust the included lanyard.

<Title>nice job
<Date>Sun Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo 128 MB for my workouts and traveling. While I am optimistic about the traveling capabilities, I already enjoy this tiny device, which can hold 2 CDs in good quality, or up to 5, if you squeeze hard, for workouts and during work. The minimalistic user-interface appeals to me. The MuVo also works with NiMH AAA rechargables. <br>There are a couple of minor things: The sound is bass emphasized, which is not a problem with any earbuds, but becomes an issue when connecting it to the car or other stereos. Connecting to line-in, you have to max-up the volume. The earbuds that come with it sit really bad - they stay at most five seconds in my ears, and won't do for workouts; quick fixes available at your local CC or BB stores. Though I am able see the files in Linux, I haven't found a solution to employ Linux to move files onto it. And there are strange lapses in music, after it was accidentally getting a sometimes not completely avoidable discharge of statics and gym sweat humidity. <br>Still, for giving me *my* music commercial free in such a small housing for hours, and the ease of use, I rate it five stars. And it also transports regular files.

<Title>Perfect Product for the Right Consumer
<Date>Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3/WMA player by Creative Labs is just plain awesome.  True, it doesn't have an LCD screen, a clock, an FM tuner, or a built in stop watch; however, in exchange for these &quot;features&quot; what you do get is simplicity, ease of use, incredibly long battery life (12 hours on a AAA), unbelievable size and tremendous flexibility.<p>This device is so much more than just a portable MP3 player.  It is a hybrid portable storage device that can be used to transfer any file type from one computer to another.  In addition, it plays both MP3 as well as WMA formats.  I have found this to be a very important feature because of the relatively small size of WMA files.  The 64 MB model will easily hold 25-30 songs in WMA format.<p>If I had to sum this player up in two words it would be . . . wonderful simplicity.  I had this player out of the box, installed, and loaded with songs ready to go to the gym in five minutes.  (NO Exaggeration) There is no tricky software to learn or installation headaches to worry about.  You simply plug it into your USB port and then drag and drop the music files you want from your hard drive.  (I am running Windows XP; however, software is included in the box for Windows 98 users.)<p>The bottom line is that different people want vastly different things.  If you are looking for fancy menus, jog dials, and a lot of battery-draining bells and whistles, then look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for the simplest, smallest, lightest player on the market to take to the gym and to work that doubles as a really cool file storage device then look no further.  This is absolutely the product to buy.  I highly recommend it!!

After contacting customer service multiple times about a warranty item, I talked to one of their techs,   who said that they estimate 10% product failure on their products.

<Title>Small and easy to use.
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was impressed with this mp3 player for several reasons. First off, it is easily the smallest mp3 player I have ever seen in my life. My previous mp3 player was a Samsung Mini Yepp. That model which is small enough is relatively huge compared with the Nomad MuVo. Second, the functionality is quite ingenious. NO SOFTWARE is required for XP users. You simply pull the white part from the blue part and stick it into a USB port. And the transfer rate is pretty damned fast. It took me less than a couple of minutes to get the player out of the box and ready to go. Unless you like bulkiness, or need expandable memory slots for your 1000 mp3's, this is definitely a great deal.

<Title>Great for music lover and excellent for external data storag
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3 Player is really an innovative stuff from Cerative NoMad. NoMad is one of the leaders in MP3 music player. The design really catched me at the first time. It is so small and very convenient to carry anywhere. Then I learned another feature of it. This is extremely attractive. You can use it as a external storage device to transfer any files you want to any computer which uses Window 98SE and above. <p>Nomad MuVO is not only MP3 player. You can use it just like Thumb drive or Sony Micorvalve. When compare with the price per Mb, MuVo is far better than their competitors because it can be an MP3 player too. <p>The design of it is quite simple and easy to use. One thing don't like about it is the lack of LCD screen. You will not have any information about the songs. <p>Bottom line, this Nomad Muvo is very convenient for student or businesspersons who love music and want to carry music with them, and transfer files for friends or colleaques. With its light weight and very handy, you can carry it with you everywhere all the time. Only drawbacks that I can see with this product right now are the use of AAA battery (instead of rechargable battery) and unability to upgrade (unless you buy another higher capacity stick, but now it is only available on 64 Mb). This is only the first step and first model of MuVo. I am pretty sure that they will come up with the new model that eliminates the drawbacks I have said in the near future.

<Title>Muvo could have been a real win
<Date>Mon Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After I wrote this review, I discovered major problems with my Muvo and also a replacement unit: memory corruption that leaves the Muvo dead or files mangled.  <p>You can restore the unit with a special recovery mode hard format with their windows only utility, but this is not documented in their meager documentation.  I found that this was needed every day or two with the units I had.  Since I purchased it for file storage also I returned them both.  <p>That aside after using a Muvo for a couple of weeks, I found: <p>* the lack of a resume where you left off feature to be a major problem (four hours of music in a 128MB unit and you have to keep listening to the first half hour over and over ...).  <p>* you have to reformat and load all files in correct order if you want to control the play order. <p>My original review follows:<p>Rather than the 64, the Muvo 128 makes for a better value.<p>I've upgraded from one of the original Rio 300's so having 121 MB of memory to play with is a blast. Not being locked in to Windows was a big motivation for wanting a device with standard USB storage, plus there's plenty of room to keep your crypto keys and other files. <p>* Windows 2k shows about 121MB (not 128) free on my unit to start. There is a windows specific program for formating the drive. I suspect it puts a copy of the system software in the flash memory somewhere in the missing space. If so then it should be possible to update the firmware on the device a real plus. <p>* The player doesn't play files placed in a subdirectory. Your mp3 files need to be in the root directory. The play order seems to be the physical storage order on the flash memory disk - not alphabetical. <p>* The sound quality sounds great especially with my Sony Fontopia EX70LP ear buds - occasionally almost too much bass. The headphones shipped with the Muvo belong in the back of your bottom drawer. <p>* The unit feels solid and well made in spite of its small size and weight.

<Title>excellent product, but know what you want
<Date>Wed Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have owned 4 portable MP3 players and have found that the key is finding the product that matches your intended use / priority list. This player's strenghts are: very small form-factor; simplified operation; no drivers reqd for most OS'es; good dynamic range and bass output with low distortion (like most, the supplied earbuds leave a lot to be desired so plan on using another set of headphones); added functionality of a portable storage device; very good maximum volume level; very good battery life. This product is not: a feature-rich toy with a cool display and a lot of gimmicky features; expandable; versatile in the way you can bring it with you.<p>The player looks like a slightly oversized disposable lighter and leaves few options for you to clip it on or attach it. BUT, it is extremely small and the few buttons and features it has are very well thought out. There are no EQ settings and the factory settings are slightly bass-heavy but pleasing for rock and popular music. <p>I use this unit primarily while exercising and find its simplicity, small size and big clean sound, perfect for gym duty or on the trails.

<Title>Muvo reconsidered
<Date>Sun Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've now had some experience with my second Muvo and found that both units: <p>* will not play some .wma files that MS Media Player and MusicMatch will play - the Muvos power themselves down at the same spots. <p>* Both Muvos have shown signs of corrupting their flash memory - the common one being self labotomization: the flash area with files may look ok, but the Muvo will no longer power on. You must go through a special hard format procedure that restores the Muvo firmware and hard formats the flash memory. <p>Finally there is a major misfeature in the Muvo. When powered off the Muvo always returns to the first song. With no random play function this means that you will listen to the first 30 min to 1 hour of music over and over again unless you do a lot of button pressing. <p>I think the Muvo is a great idea, but the execution and quality should rule it out for now.

<Title>Serves a niche...
<Date>Sun Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I use mp3 exclusively for audio books and text to speech stuff. Therefore the lack of a &quot;resume&quot; or infinite pause for that matter, make this unit inconvenient at times. Also, they need to get the hint: NOBODY LIKES YOUR EARBUD DESIGN. I don't want to swap earwax with someone and share a set of assymetrical earbuds, so JUST STOP. The first thing I did when I unpacked the unit was to plug in my RCA earbuds in its place. MUCH better. Next was to put a keychain clip on the unit. (I took the twisting one from a cheap keychain laser and it works great.)<p>The big improvement of this player over my old one is the fact I don't have to burn a CD to listen to a quick web download, VERY NICE. Also, it is small enought that you can wear it for hours and forget you have it on. The lack of an LCD screen is not really a problem, becauseI figured it was new and they would add them to later models. The unit also seems pretty rugged.<p>In order to recover the use of the unit, you may have to run SCANDISK and defrag every once in awhile. Slightly annoying, but at least you don't have to use the crummy software that comes with it. Just treat it like a portable USB device and drag and drop your files, or the VERY useful &quot;send to E:&quot; via right mouse click command.<p>All in all, I like this product, but hopefully the newer models will address this one's shortcomings.<p>(Did I mention that NO ONE LIKES THE EARBUDS???.)<p>Thanks.

<Content>I bought this player when it first came out a bit more than a year ago. I took it with me on a 4 month trip to Nepal and Tibet. I dropped it, sat on it, dropped it some more, and the little trooper never gave it. It doesn't have any shuffle feature, and the memory could be bigger, but this is one hell of a resilient little bugger. The only reason I don?t have it is that I gave to a Nepali guy as a thank you gift for letting me stay with his family for 5 weeks. I just bought one of the new 256mb models with a screen. We'll see. It'll take a good showing to beat the usage I got outta the last one.

<Content>I've had mine (64mb version) for about 2 years, and haven't had a single problem with it. It's very small (I quit smoking years ago, but if memory serves, it's a little smaller than a bic lighter), but because of it's size, you obviously can't sort, or view file names.   Loading the software was easy, and glitch free, and there isn't any complicated interface to work with; you just plug it in to the usb port, and drag/drop your files on to the hard drive icon that shows up after it's been plugged in.  It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more, nothing less.

<Title>Not the most reliable player
<Date>Tue Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love my MuVo, I've had it for over a year.  I got it from a friend who said it was suffering from the same problems as most reviews here list.  Creative Support was no help, so I installed everything from Creative's site, used their music organization software to reformat the player, and it's worked fine ever since.  I've been moving files on and off on a daily basis, used it with 5 different computers with not one problem since.  This thing gets beat around in my pocket with my keys, I've dropped it, washed it, pulled it out of the computer without stopping it properly, got it dirty, almost every way I could possibly break it, and no problems yet.  However, judging from the reviews here the quality of these players is very inconsistant, either they'll break after a couple months or keep going forever...  Also, Creative desperatly needs to work on its Customer Service. I haven't found any problems with the playlist restarting when I turn it off or unplug it from the battery.  It does restart when you format the player, but I would think that's expected.  Sometimes when you skip through tracks, the player will cut off the first half-second or so, but it's not a huge problem.  I also think the A-B repeat function is pretty useless, a random play button would be a much better idea.  I'm impressed with the durability of this little player, but it seems I am in the minority.  As to the storage, 128megs is about 4 1/2 hours at WMA 64k, which is what Creative's software converts MP3s to with its "SmartFit" program.  The battery life isn't exceptional, the battery lasts about 2 hours at most with standard Duracells.  Using higher capacity batteries may get you better results.  Overall, a good player if you can get one that works well, so I'd reccomend getting a little more reliable player.

<Title>Poor battery life
<Date>Thu Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>2.5 stars really. Not a bad player but there are better ones out there. The 128Mb gives a reasonable no. of songs but recording at low res makes for disappointing playback. Using alkaline batteries this unit has no where near the 12 hours it claims. It is a handy USB drive however and that part of it has helped me out in many urgent work situations.

<Title>Just what you need, but not much more than that.
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It doesnt have a display, which was my only concern. Once I got it though, I found that I could careless. Im to busy listening to music and forwarding and rewinding tracks are just a button push away. Synch went great with windows media player 10 (xpsp2 also installed). No problems what so ever, I went from taking it out of the package to walking out my door listening to music within about 20-30 minutes. MOst that time was spent realizing I had to "synch" not burn onto the Nomad.(im a goof). I used it all night and worked great. Only draw back that the earbuds wont stay in my ears. Could be just me but I ordered some new headphones anyway so not a problem for me. Bottome line, if what you want is a dependable MP3 player to strap on and listen to music, this player does just that without breaking your bank account.

<Title>Great idea - but couldn't find one that worked.
<Date>Wed Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I went through FOUR of these and had to return EVERY one.  After a few days the players began to stop at apparently random times during playback.  I wanted a small, reliable mp3 player to use at the gym.  I finally decided on a Rio S35s Sport 128MB player which works just fine and has more features.

<Content>This one is cool, but the IRiver IFP180T has a built in FM-tuner (great for listening to the Bengals lose), and they're priced similarly.

<Title>Nifty, small and easy to use MP3
<Date>Mon Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The MUVO is for people who like to keep it simple. Simple design. Simple use. Simple file storage. Simple battery change. Good sound and 128MB effective data storage. I actually think it sounds great! If you want gadget buttons, flickering lights and advanced choices - go for something else. The MUVO just gets the work done. As for those who report problems I can only say; No problems here. Music please!

<Title>Remarkable machine, 100% Macintosh compatible!
<Date>Tue Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a remarkable machine.  It is tiny, magnificently designed and so easy to use, it defies the imagination.  Why other companies are not using a similar approach is a mystery to me.  I want to emphasize that this is 100% Macintosh compatible!  No one is saying this, but all you do is open the box, put in a AAA battery and plug the little guy into a USB port.  In 1 second you will see a new drive called "Untitled" on your desktop.  Open up your iTunes or other MP3 program and just drag the songs you want onto the new drive.  Then remove it and you are done!  No software, no upgrades, no cables no incompatibilities!  It's even easier to use than the venerable iPod (which is also excellent but larger, less portable and much more expensive).  I'm using it with OS X Jaguar as well as Win 2000 and it is a joy.  I also have a PowerPoint presentation stored on there so that I can carry it with me.  This is the future.  A perfect gift for anyone new to MP3s as there is simply no learning curve.  I can't say enough about this amazing product.

<Title>Such a shame...
<Date>Mon Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I had such high hopes for this machine. I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product.

<Title>great sound! wonderfully versatile! So far, I love it!
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have had my Muvo for 5 weeks and absolutely adore it-- on the other hand I think I must be its perfect target audience. I mainly use it for going over a fairly small selection of choral music while I'm walking to/from work, so I don't need to be able to store too many songs (and do Love having the repeat button!)-- 128MB is usually enough. Also,I was looking for something as small and light as possible, without compromising the sound quality or battery life, and this definitely is it-- for the sake of the small size and great sound I'm willing to do without LCD, etc. And I love the ease of use. I have been using the file transfer features a lot more than I had expected to-- I can transfer large papers/presentations between home (win98), office(linux) and lab computers (XP) with no hassle at all. (The linux mount command is <p>mount /dev/sda1 /your_dir ; cd /your_dir<br> and<br>umount /your_dir<p> (I think) to unmount, if you are a linux newbie like me. Then you can just copy/move files around, treating it as just another directory.)  The only problem I have had so far is that when there is any static electricity around it seems to affect the player very adversely, sometimes even cutting off the signal entirely-- but this is only a problem when it's dry and I'm wearing fuzzy sweaters.I'm so happy with my muvo! <p>(On the other hand, if you are looking for a feature-packed mp3 playerwith 20GB memory, you will probably be unhappy with this. Get the archos jukebox, which a couple of my friends have and like a lot-- I was tempted, and it's only maybe a hundred bucks more, but it was just too heavy for me, and I don't actually need those fancy features.)

<Title>Works as Advertised... Great Sound... Small Size
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I use the MuVo at the gym and in the car. It is very easy to use, both getting music onto it and playing it. The buttons are big for a small player, and give a noticable click when you press them, so you can feel when you have activated a button for that &quot;I've got better things to look at&quot; style. It has a neat repeat function, you can repeat a song or any portion of your play list. It has a single light which flashes red, or glows steady red or green, depending of course on what it is telling you. The normal alkaline battery lasts at least the advertised 11 hours. Complaints: none. It is small and sounds great, and holds about two cds worth of your music. 5 stars.

<Title>compact and handy
<Date>Sat Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>i like this player because it is really easy to use and needs no software. i can load songs easily and quickly. before i got this one, i was using my brother's 32 mb rio. i liked it, but the process to load files was fairly long. i liked the lcd screen on the rio, but i don't miss it. this player is also good because of it's small size. i can put in my purse or in my pocket easily. it does turn off when it plays some songs, mostly wma formats w/ copyright protection, but that doesn't happen often. i love this device. i don't know what i would do without it.
