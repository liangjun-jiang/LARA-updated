<Content>Ya. I like my Creative Zen Sleek. It's really easy to use, it's pretty compatible with my music server that I use, and it's got a cool design. I like that I can put pictures on it, so I can carry the pictures I like with me to show other people. Over all I enjoy it!

<Content>I just bought this 3 weeks ago, but for the time I have used it has succesfully fullfilled my expectatives. For the price it's awesome the things that it has, mic, radio, photos and the best of all: 20 Gb for mp3! the ipod nano cost the same as this one, but it's only 4GB, I don't know why creative hasn't gone to the charts of popularity with this great price. You better buy this one, 'cause the ipod and the new generation of ipods will sell you the music and it's gonna be way to expensive to hear music.

<Content>To anyone out there considering this, i say go for it...holds 5 times as many songs as an ipod but for the same price! for the tree months that i had it, it was really great and i loved it!(just do NOT drop it in the toilet, because it will not work after you fish it out) Not joking. But other then that, it is a really great deal.

<Title>Great budget 20 Gig Player
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zen Sleek Photo about a month ago. After continuous use (seriously) I have to say Creative did great by this one. I purchased a refurbished unit.  So far, I have not had more than 1 issue with it. The only issue being that at 192kbps WMA (Napster to go) my battery life ia about half of the rated 19 hours. But...since I work on a computer and have open USB slots, that's never a real issue.   Pros: Sound Quality - Set your EQ, turn off the bass boost and you'll get great results 20 GB of storage FM Tuner with recording Picture viewer (included software automatically resizes pictures for optimal storage) Hybrid controls (Touch and tactile) - this one makes it easy for driving. Set to random all and skip as needed. Customizable menus - only what you want or need Cost-Current day price for a refurb with 12 month warranty from Creative. I only paid 70 bucks!!  Cons:  No video No slideshow while playing music Battery life at 192kbps with EQ on drops quite a bit (Still about 9-10 hours) No removable, user replaceable battery Slightly heafty (but I particularly like the feel/weight)  For those small cons, I couldn't be happier.  I use my cell phone for videos and games so video isn't a need. The music with slideshow has never been a deal killer, but would be nice. Overall, a great player for a great price.

<Title>I'm very pleased.

<Content>I got my Sleek Photo a few weeks ago.  I've had mp3 players before, but never used them as much as I use this one.  I think the key is the interface.  It took about a day to get used to, but now I can browse through a few hundred CD's with ease.   The only features I wish it had would be a user replaceable battery and a little less weight.  It has a proprietary connector, but it didn't take more than 5 minutes to find a spare sync/charge cable online.  A great player at a great price.

<Title>Better All-Around Product Than iPod
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great mp3 player. Not only is it extremely easy to use (yeah, that's right tobytoby, it's really easy to use), it has great audio quality. If you think it looks too thick you are wrong. It has a really good feel to it. If you are the type that everything has to be an incredible fashon statement go ahead and get your pretty little iPod. But if you care about quality, this mp3 player is the one to get. With features such as FM radio, recording, and much much more, the Zen Sleek Photo beats down the iPod like a sick dog. The price is great, it has a huge capacity, the brushed metal surface is very durable and does not scratch very easily, plus you are not just limited to iTunes but you have a wide selection of music services to choose from. Also the accessories are very cheap. I got a nice case for five bucks. I saw some iPod socks (you read right, socks) for the iPod for thirty dollars! The choice is yours... iPod or Zen.

<Title>Good At First, Downhill
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for a good while.... Got it new for over $200 dollars and after watching the market for almost two years I realize what a bad deal that was.  I suppose it is worth the $129 price. My main problems with it were the following:  1. small screen. The screen boasts a ton of colors, but the screen is small and rather old looking.  2. horrible battery. they say it is a 19 hour battery, but nay. after about six months it's down to ten and after a year and a half... It won't last five hours. no joke.  3. Buggs up.... alot. About every month or two you will need to restart it because it freezes up. It then takes over ten minutes to 're-build library'. whatever that means. You also can't view photos at the same time as playing music... expect the music to stop when you touch the photo button. While on the subject of photos, it pauses waaaay too much when viewing photos. expect to take anywhere between a minute and ten to view ten photos. And I will add that the screen is a magnet for dust. After having mine for two years it gets increasingly bad... I can barely make out the screen. with any light coming in it's invisible, but in the dark or if you shade it with your hand, it is rather acceptable.  4. Not very pretty. It's smaller than the Zune and iPod but rather clunky, box-like structure.  Overall, please don't get this. It's outdated. I wouldn't suggest an iPod either since it is, from my experience, a gift suited for preteen girls and people who are not into music that much, if you know what I mean. I am most likely getting the Zune next, after some research it seems the best. Not only is the screen beautiful and large, It isn't nearly as big and clunky as it looks (I've handled one, trust me). It also plays video in a more widescreen format unlike the medium size screen of the iPod. The siliconized rubber on the outer edge is a nice touch. If you're into heavy (for it's size), buggy (undeniably, and may I add customer support for anything is HORRIBLE), brake-in-a-week-earphones (buy some skullcandy) type of MP3 player this is for you. It was great in the beginning, but the player wears out fast. Kind of sad.
