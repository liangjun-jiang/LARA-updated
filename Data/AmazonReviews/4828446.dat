<Content>This player is a couple years old, it has no video or picture views or color for that matter.  The problem I had was that is malfunctioned most of the time I had it.  I had some time to use it, and when it worked, it was enjoyable, but those times were few and far in between.    The player functions were pretty good, the voice recorder worked quite well.  The ease of use was great, but had too many problems to keep the player I had.  Keep in mind, I purchased a refurbished player, not the wisest choice for quality, but for the money, it seemed good.    I had to mail the player back to the vendor, because of my many troubles with the player and hopefully they will refund my money. The trouble I went through with this is not worth my time or money for that matter.   Seemed good, but not worth the trouble with all the malfunctioning.

<Content>I have this player and for the price it really gets the job done!  The touch navigation is really easy to use, it's super fast to make playlists on the go, and it has lots of features besides just music (calendar, contacts, etc.) The size is actually quite small, and it syncs and charges really easily via USB.  For the functionality of an iPod for a fraction of the price, I'd get one!
