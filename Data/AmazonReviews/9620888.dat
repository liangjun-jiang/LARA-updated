<Content>I have an ipod also which I have never used that much because I had a hard time with getting the songs I wanted on it. This little sony sonicstage program is so easy to use. The battery instantly charges so there is no waiting time plus it plugs into a usb port. There are no additional wall cords. I recieved this as a gift and have used it everyday since.

<Title>Macintosh!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 because I really wanted something more simple than Ipod and with more functions, but I think I made a huge mistake!! I already have a Nano and I think it is really great, but you have to use Itunes to put music inside it and it can not be used as a pen drive and do not play FM/AM.  What I did not know about Sony is that it also comes with a software called Sonic Stage and it does not work in Macintosh!! This is not written in the box, only in the manual. I wish I had read this reviews before, because there are a lot of people complaining about that. If you want to buy a Sony mp3, you need to know that you can not put any music inside it, without the Sony software. And if you have only a Macintosh, do not buy that, or you will have to use it to listen FM/AM!!!! Ipod is still the best mp3, even being only a mp3 player, but if you have a pc and do not care about the software the sony mp3 works very well and have a great volume.

<Content>I gave it to my girlfriend and she loved it! The battery lasts several hours and the design is great. I recommend it. Down side: you are forced to use the provided software to upload songs to the player.

<Content>This is the perfect MP3 Player, it is small and easy to use. The program that you get with it to transfer music to it is really NOT hard to use, you just click on the song and say transfer. Very good sound quality and I love that I don't have to buy battries for it! The only down side was it doesn't come with a armband or lanyard!

<Title>Rock on with Sony
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the second mp3 player I've owned.  The first one crapped out on me 2 months after purchase so I was skeptical about getting another.  I didn't have to buy this one though which was a plus, and I've been thrilled with it.  I recently got back from a trip where I travelled by air and despite how noisy airplanes can be I was able to relax and enjoy my music.  It is very easy to program and charge and so lightweight it's unbelievable.  I even use it while walking my dogs.  The only complaint I have is the headphones it comes with are not that great, but I had my own from the previous player so I didn't really worry about it.  To me, Sony has always been top of the line and they did not fall short here, so if you're in the market for an mp3 player this is a great route to take.

<Title>Great design, good sound, poor software

<Content>Not to beat this to point to a pulp, but as many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the flaw of this player is the lack of "drag and drop" capability.  Also, the lack of ability to charge on the road (unless you have a portable computer with USB, or a computer where you are going) this thing is dead in the water on a car ride.  All my other players use alkaline batteries or can use a cord.  I own 4 mp3 players now, and this is the only one I can not just drop an mp3 format file onto it and play. you are forced to use the clunky sonic stage program which makes uploading a pain in the rump. you have to import a track, then transfer it to the player. Not exactly the fastest way to do things (basically doing everything twice). the battery charging thing is a pain also.  I have a GPX player, and Two Coby's and I am more satisfied with those than this. But I got this for Free, so what can I say, can't complain too much. This also has a nice FM tuner (take that I-pod with your clunky software and proprietary garbage). For those who have to purchase, please look elsewhere first (like the Sandiscs, gpx, coby, rca, or comparables). All of those other ones are drag, drop, go. not this.

<Title>Charging away from your computer
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the sports walkman and it is supposed to be plugged into my computer as well. But my cell phone charger will work.  So any usb charger should work and you can probably get a car adapter for it.
