<Title>Pretty sweet
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ok, first of all, in response to a few of you who have 'reviewed' the Zen Micro already:  If there aren't many OGG players out there, there's probably a good reason for it. For some reason, 'Betamax' keeps ringing in my ears...  Second, no one, and I mean NO ONE, listens to AM radio. Unless you want to catch 'the game', or perhaps you're just grumpy because your cane has fallen behind the washing machine again and you can't reach it?  Third, if your girlfriend laughs at you, tell her where to shove it. Strap on a pair man. If anything you should feel smug for owning a quality piece of intriguing equipment.  As an iPod owner, I can say well done to creative for emulating apple's simplicity and sleek looks. I'd be interested.

<Title>Get a Rio Karma instead
<Date>Sun Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.  The karma also has a very long battery life.  Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  No comparison in my opinion.

<Title>Not really a review.
<Date>Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is not really a review since the product isn't even available yet.  I'd just like to point out to the all the ipod lovers out there that this device completely rules the ipod when it comes to the battery.  If the ipod's battery stops taking a charge, which usually happens after about 18 months of steady use, you CAN'T replace it yourself.  You have to send it back to the factory where they charge you ninety-nine bucks plus shipping.  For that simple reason I will never own an ipod.

<Title>The Preview
<Date>Tue Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. $190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short one again.  Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to the Pencil? Stopping going in circles and get to the point. Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )

<Title>Should be good
<Date>Tue Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"  Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.

<Title>Good Buy
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Not a review, I'll update when I get it, but these are the points that sold me: - Calendar that can synch with MS Office (contrary to other posts, the micro does have this functionality and it is actually better than the mini's functionality so long as you have Outlook) - Removable battery (iPod and Rio Carbon fall short) - More Space than iPod Mini - FM Radio Tuner - Not stuck with iTunes (I buy all my CDs, I like to listen to a whole album) - Looks Nice, seems to have a good interface - Bundeled with good software - Best audio quality on the market for comperable players - Creative's history in audio - My past experience with Creative - Did I mention the removable battery?  That's huge! - Also much better battery life than the iPod Mini.  On par with the Carbon - Voice/Radio recording a +, but not a big one for me

<Title>The first legitimate iPod mini killer
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Creatives new Zen micro is a promising mp3 player for people of all ages. It seems to be the only mini-drive player that can compete with the iPod mini. Compared to the mini, heres are the pros and cons:   Pros-Removable battery, Better battery life, Ten electrifying colors(5 more than the mini), Intuitive vertical Touch Pad, Mesmerizing blue glow, FM radio with recording, Voice recording and built in mic, Twice the internet music access(including Napster, MSN's music service and more), Comes with everything you need (A belt clip that doubles as a stand, a protective carrying case, a USB 2.0 cable, a universal AC adapter and in-ear dynamic bass response earbuds)  Cons-Even though it hold more songs than the iPod mini,5gb may not be enough storage for a growing music library, Does not have games which should not be an issue for most people, Not as many accessory options from brands other than Creative (but hey, it comes with everything you'll ever need, except the optional wired remote which i will be getting once i get mine)  All in all, this is a solid player for many users from the begginer to the audiophile  yes..i will be getting one, the Pros substantially outnumber the cons. This is the player ive been looking for.

<Title>I'm an IPod mini owner but...
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this item does intrigue me. And by the way don't label the IPod owners as brainwashed when you're raving about a product you haven't even seen yet. And if you believe the battery will last 12 hours just cuz Creative says it will, they YOU'RE brainwashed. Also, Creative is NOT the first to market this kind of MP3 player. They followed after the PJB-100 from Hy-Tek or Hango or someone like that. I had one of those (paid thru my nose) and later I had the Creative Jukebox. The Jukebox I owned was a piece of garbage. The user interface was either insanely poor, or it was malfunctioning upon arrival. It stopped working completely after a few months. So I'm a bit leary about the zen micro.  However, comparing it to my IPod mini, I seem some positives: 1.) Modular battery. 2.) FM radio. 3.) Possibly better buttons. (never liked the IPod wheel)  I wonder if the buttons operate as well as the IPod's wheel, which can be a nuisance sometimes. Cuz when your trying to use it for a button sometimes it thinks your trying to use it as a wheel. And I don't think anybody has ever improved on the good old standard volume dial. But for surfing thru lists, or very long recordings, the IPod wheel rules.  One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable.  I am interested in the zen. But I'd really have to check it out in person first before being convinced one way or the other.  Can anyone who OWNS an IPod and a Zen comment on the relative sound quality? That's a big issue for me and if it does sound better, I might consider trying out the zen and possibly EBaying my IPod mini.

<Title>it was nice, and then it wasn't
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>after about a month it started freezing regularly when I tried to turn it off. The only way to unfreeze the thing was to take the battery out. Then, about a week later, it just completely froze, and the screen showed a picture of an unhappy zen micro...   Well, obviously this wasn't normal, so I called Creative and they said normally they would replace it, but they discontinued the product. Oh well, I did get my money back, and the customer service was good, so 4 stars. I really liked it, and I would recommend it, I just hope it doesn't break.

<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7886477-3652027">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Content>The Creative Zen Micro is quite a decent mp3 player.  Its controls are sensitive and its case is not made of iron and steel, so if you're used to throwing technology around, this isn't really for you.  If you treat it well, it will work.  My only problems with this were 1) once it completely froze and wouldn't work, so i had to send it back in for repairs.  After that, it was fine, except 2) occasionally it freezes, but all I do is take out the battery, it rebuilds the library and works again, albeit the battery is one notch lower than it was before.  Overall, it is a wonderful machine.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>(+=pro, -=con) -(+)I bought the Zen Micro in May of 2005. The first thing I noticed was how small it is. I was thinking of it being the macho IPOD size which is clunky, and innefective if trying to use with one hand. It fits easily in the palm of your hand and is fun to show off how small it is. -(+)I also thought that the look was very cool. The blue LED light around the edge really makes a difference from many other mp3s. -(+&-)The installed FM radio is a plus, but the quality and reception is poor. -(-)Battery life is so-so. It depends mostly on how many times you light the screen (by touching the pad, this can be disabled to save battery life). For me, it only lasts about 5 hours, but that is because I leave the backlight on and I change the songs often. -(+)Sound quality is excellent when listening through earphones. Does not sound as good when connected to speakers because you can hear the compact sound, but this is the same with all mp3's. -(-)The touch pad is very sensitive, and is not user-friendly, but I was able to manage it after the first hour. I do not like touch pads; I prefer buttons, and a scroll, but it does not make much of a difference. In my opinion, the layout of the touch pad is poor, but it does not take back from the quality of the player. -(+)The removable battery is a huge plus, compared to those who cant be removed, such as the IPOD. When the battery life becomes shorter and shorter, you can buy a new one. It also provides a way to listen to more music; if you have two batteries, you can just replace the one that has run out of life with a full-charged battery. You can listen to twice the amount of music in a sitting.  -(+)The USB port makes it very simple to connect and quickly transfer songs to your computer. -(-)The rounded shape, in my opinion, makes it look very "unprofessional". I would rather have gotten something like the IRiver that has a boxy, professional-like (sorry for the repetion) look to it. But again, this does not take back from the overall value of the player. -(-)The back of the player is easily scratched-up. I bought a leather RhinoSkin cover which has helped. I reccomend that you do this if you get the Zen Micro.  A month ago, the jack began to become loose, and I have to adjust the headphone jack frequently (it is not the headphones, I have tested with many). I am going to send it in for repair after Christmas break. Although this definately took away from my overall veiw of the Zen, I expected that this would happen if I used a mp3 in general for half a year.  Overall this mp3 is a must get for those who enjoy having something unique, and different from the ordinary. In my experience, it is much better than the IPOD, and is one of the best players out there.

<Title>Good Product - Edit - Good When It Works Properly
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good: - Removable battery - FM Tuner - Easy navigation - EQ settings & Misc. settings  Bad: - Customer Support - battery life - sometimes poor FM reception - froze once - bundled accessories (or lack of)  Other: - voice recording - lack of SDK  ----- UPDATE - Read! ----- Less than a year has passed and I ran into a problem with my player that I cannot resolve nor can Creative tech wizards solve it.  I used my player for a couple of days during the week and once I go to plug it into my laptop I get an error that my player has malfunctioned and that the device is not recognized.  I had to figit with the supplied USB cord to get any recognition by Windows.  I then noticed that the supplied USB cord has ceased to work properly.  I bought a new USB 5-pin cord and test the player again to find the same error.  I then try this with countless computers setups with the same error.  I email Creative customer support and they showed me their amazing copy, paste and send techniques. They finally direct me to RMA but I have to pay them $25usd and prepay the shipping to them (all together just under $50usd) just for them to look at the player.  I received the player back as they said there was nothing wrong with it but I do not believe they tested the player using USB 2. As the player only functions in USB 1.X. But transferring and deleting many large files over USB 1.X is not practical.  So countless emails and the same copy & paste emails from them. I am nowhere near a solution. But they want my money again and say they value me after I pay them $25usd again plus prepaying for shipping.  Morale of the story is if you get a Creative product that does work then you are OK. But if you run into problems you will be hard-pressed in finding good support from the makers of the product.

<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen mp3 player b/c I didn't want to buy an iPod about a year ago. At the beginning, I noticed that the radio part didn't work too great. It was also hard to tell when the battery was going to die on you. But fine, I could listen to music fine, the sound was clear. However, it starting to give me problems, like it would turn on by itself, or freeze, or the battery will discharge almost immediately. I don't know if it's just mine that is the problem or if this happens frequently. But my friend has had an iPod for 2 years and works great, I don't think this thing is going to last that long. I'm only giving it 3 stars b/c atleast it still works.

<Title>Nice player with some frustrating problems
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought my Zen Micro approximately one year ago when it first came out.  When I first got it, I loved it.  The touchpad was easy to use for me, the unit was easy to charge, it looked good, it was compatible with Musicmatch Jukebox, it liked Windows Explorer, you could make playlists on the fly, and it had a gig more space than the then-popular Ipod Mini.  It was great.  Approximately four months after I got it (and a month after the three-month warranty ran out), I began developing the familiar headphone jack problem.  The jack became loose, causing one of the stereo channels to stop playing every so often.  I had used it often and treated it carefully.  I'd never once dropped it in four months.  I thought it was a fluke, so I wrote Creative, which obligingly gave me an RMA number and told me to send in the unit for replacement.  I did, and got a brand-new unit, which made me really happy despite the fact that I had to load all of my songs into it again.  This time, I was extra careful with the jack, buying new earbuds with an L-shaped plug so that it wouldn't put pressure on the jack.  I used it nearly every day.  Eight months later, the same problem resurfaced yet again.  The headphones started shorting out.  The computer itself was fine, but I couldn't listen to music without being paranoid about the possible lack of one of the stereo channels.  Finally, fed up with the unit entirely (and well past the point where any warranty would be active), and on the point of buying a new Apple, I opened the machine up to see what I could do.  Following some guides I found online, I opened it easily and fixed the loose jack by "padding" the jack's casing and screwing it to the board again so that it couldn't move around.  This worked.  I know a more permanent fix would be to solder the jack firmly to the board, but I'm not experienced with soldering, so this will have to do for now.  Buyers, beware!

<Title>Good sound, a few bugs
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like the sound this player provides, but it has a few glitches that drive me crazy. First, if you haven't turned it on for awhile or you have just charged it, it takes somewhere close to five minutes to turn on. The first time I used it, I was able to select a list of songs to listen to instead of randomly listening to all my songs or a pre loaded playlist (just as a temporary playlist). I have not been able to do so since then. When I have tried to set a list, the slightest mis-step on the dial, even with the sensitivity turned low, will wipe out everything I have just done. The software is easy to use once you figure it out, but it took me awhile to do so as there are no directions that come with the player other then the very basic set-up instructions. I like the radio being part of it, and have been using it more for that than an mp3 player because of the difficulties it has been giving me. Maybe I just have a faulty player, but it isn't what I was hoping for.

<Title>the best yet
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently recived this product from my dad because he didn't have much room on it for him. I haven't had any problems with it. I started out with a small sandisc 512mb mp3 but the screen went out so I got this one. I like the part that it has a removable battery (unlikeinthe ipod's you hav to send it into apple to replace the battery which could take weeks,and it cost $80.00 to replace a battery in an ipod while in this creative it only costs $30). Ipods also dont have the fm radio (unless you drop another $50.00 into it). And the creative has easyer controls and seems to work better. The music player also comes in verriety of colors, and the neon light adds personality to it. So if going to by an ipod ipod mini any other ipod save your money and spend it on the creatve zen micro.

<Title>Fantastic Player - to be revamped
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player from another online store and recently had to return it for refund but untill the headjack breaking happened to me - i had no problems what so ever. At least nothing major that i didn't expect to happen to ANY mp3 player.  Minor problems -   - Can tend to stall if you try to plug in a cable to charge while your player is on. But not always. It's just better for you and your player if your not plugging it in when its already on anyway. And that is the ONLY stalling problem i've personaly encountered. Taking out the battery is how you end up remedying this problem.  - You have to listen to the playlist at the same time your creating it. Which isn't realy a problem its a perferance or minor problem. If you plug it into your pc and open the software there's no problem and you don't have to listen at the same time.  - Some find the sensitivity of the touch bad to be too sensitive or not sensitive enough. I've found on mine, even tho i had it on high senstivity it DID go down in sensitivity. When you first get it - better to change the sensitivity to low This is not button function player like you might expect. No punching allowed! Tap for goodness sake.  For the Perks of it -  - Calendar, Voice Recorder, etc - see the description! Everythign this player has to offer worked with out any real hang up at all. - on mine. It seems to depend on the person and the player they've seem to have gotten.   - Simple interface. Extreamly easy to navigate  That said - The zen micro 5mb has seemed to gone BACK to development or off the shelves untill a new mid size modle comes out. Creative has completly removed the zen micro from their shop inventory. Not just out of stock but completly gone. But the accessories still remain.  I haven't seen any place else mentioning this so only my observation but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a new and improved Micro will be out soon to replace the one i was forced to give up.

<Content>I got this mp3 player today for Christmas which i was looking really foward too. I opened the box and went right away to set it up. Make sure that when you get this that you charge it with the included charger from Staples. I currently have 61 songs on it and so far it has been as expected. The sound is great and the headphones aren't as bad as i thought. The features are also great, however i haven't tried the fm radio but i heard the reception isn't that good. So far the headphone jack is working just make sure that you don't take it in and out, then it will begin to make it's way away from the player. The player itself seems really sturdy. It is curved to fit your hand. The sensitivity was first on medium for me and when i got it i changed it to low, which i highly reccommend.  Overall, so far, this player is amazing and everything works great.
