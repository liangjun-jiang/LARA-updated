<Title>Perfect product for the price
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using this for about 4 months for the price it was excellent up until 2 days ago. Mind you i used this player daily for about 4 hours at work. The volume key seems to not work very well anymore. there was an issue where if you do not unplug the usb cord and the computer crashes it currupts the player. So be weary if your computer crashes allot.

<Title>Great Product!!

<Content>I bought this for my fifteen year old daughter for Christmas before she showed me a ton of other players she liked. After she opened it, I knew I made the right decision. She absolutely loved it and it is VERY loud for being so small. I bought her a pair of speakers to go with it for her room and she doesnt even need them. She works out or folds laundry or whatever she is doing all you hear is this MP3 player. It is very loud and clear and an excellent value for the cost. It was also very easy for her to download her songs on to. Definitely 5 stars!

<Title>Cheap, and good product

<Content>If your looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is a good choice. The built-in speakers are decent quality, and haven't broken yet, and ive had it for about a year or so. The only issue i can think of is that it has only 512mb of memory and doesn't hold a lot of music.

<Title>Not an alarm clock
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product, despite being tagged as one IS NOT AN ALARM CLOCK! Had I been looking for an mp3 player, I would have rated this higher, but considering that this is the first item to come up on a search for mp3 alarm clock, this product fails to tell time. I would die a happy man knowing that the alarm clock tag was removed from this.
