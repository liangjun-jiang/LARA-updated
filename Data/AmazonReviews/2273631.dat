<Title>Way too much hassle
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So, I got my archos last week and i've been doodling with it - but get this: Playlists and videos don't work nearly as well as they should. Let's examine this:  1) Playlists. Do you want to be able to auto sync your WMP or media monkey playlists quickly to the archos? Sorry, won't happen, not even with the script someone came up with on archosforums. Even if you have your playlist in m3u, it gets converted to a non-playable wla file that crashes the archos. Fun right?  2) Videos. I use Clone DVD mobile to rip 720x404, 1900 bitrate. The videos work fine on my computer, but cut off 4/5 of the way through on the archos?  Are there ways around this? Well let's see. Like I said, someone created a script on mediamonkey to add playlists. I can't get it to work, but even so, why should you need a consumer-made script to get playlists to work? For videos, it's just finnicky with the encoding you use. Any hope for a firmware update to fix all this? Probably not if archos customer service is as bad as people say.  All in all, this was a waste of 380 as it has been more of a headache than a useful tool. Back to the store it goes. Of course, my alternative is an ipod. I might as well eat my own head.

<Title>Worthy new entry in the Archos lineup
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like many others, I gave up on my Amazon order and got it directly from Archos.  I've been happily playing with it for the last couple days and really quite happy.  To be fair, I am upgrading from the Archos 604 Wifi so I am already pretty well familiar with Archos' little quirks and such.   I also have a brand new iPod Touch which is a great product in its own way. Overall I think this product is worthy of a 5 star rating because it offers the most bang for the buck as it were, amazing features at a moderate price.  As is my wont, I start with the things I love:  1)  160 GB, whats not to love about that?  My brand new laptop has only 80GB, crazy to think that this little handheld PMP has more storage than my laptop or my desktop either for that matter! 2)  Awesome screen resolution: Wow thats a lot of pixels for such a small screen. 3)  Touch screen interface, very sensitive, and quite usable with or without a stylus (unlike the Touch which is not so sensitive).   4)  If you purchase the Video Podcast and Cinema plugins from Archos ($40) you can watch just about any video on this baby without any tedious conversions (unlike the iPods). 5)  Beautiful and colorful user interface, nice improvement on 604.  I especially like being able to see what the next and previous songs on the playlist are, the Now Playing screen is nicely laid out. 6)  Wifi is amazing, you can play videos off of your desktop computer or copy files from other computers.  In fact, I was even able to automatically upgrade the Archos firmware just by connecting to Wifi. 7)  Opera browser ($30 plugin) is very nice browser, works well with touch screen and supports YouTube and some other streaming video interfaces.   8)  Fantastic DVR dock allows you to output to pretty much any kind of cable and watch at nice resolution on the monitor of your choice.  This also includes a great remote control with a Blackberryish keyboard; again this is something I don't see available for iPods. 9)  Dedicated volume button (not available on Touch or 604). 10) You can actually edit, rename, delete, etc music, videos, playlists etc. on the  605 itself, you don't have to hook it up to a PC every time you want to make the slightest change or delete something you don't need anymore.  This is perhaps one of my biggest gripes about iPods in general.   11) Built-in viewing stand, how clever is that? 12) Indicator lights: I like the fact that you can see when the battery is charged, when the hard drive is running, if the TV-Out is on or the power is on without flipping through menus or turning the device on. 13)  Playlist editing/saving etc seems to work a lot better than it did on the 604. Just the fact that you can do this on the unit itself is a nice feature in comparison to iPods! 14)  I can use the drive as a data backup and it doesn't messup my music or cause undue delays like it did on my 604.   Of course, for me anyway, 5 stars doesn't mean perfection because there is no such thing in the world of technology.  5 stars means top of its class in my mind.  So with that disclaimer in hand, here are things about the Archos 605 that could use improvement:  1)  Hidden expense: To really get the full experience you should expect to spend an additional $100 to $150 for plugins and DVR dock etc.  Archos, like Apple, just gives you the bare minimum accessories with the product; not really enough to set you up in style.  To be fair, its the same deal with an iPod Touch!  In fact, apple has taken to charging for their new software features too :O 2)  Accessories:  don't expect to be able to walk into any electronics store and buy accessories for this baby.  I have had to order just about everything online -- btw I highly recommend the Noreve case for this player which can be bought on Amazon. 3)   Size:  with a screen this big and a 160GB disk don't be thinking this is just going to slide unobtrusively into your pocket like a Touch does.  It will fit in your pocket but you'll know its there. 4)  Lack of software aka there ain't no iTunes for this thing!  Making playlists is a bit tricky.  You will have to use something like Winamp or MediaMonkey or the player itself to make playlists.  This doesn't compare well to the air-tight integration of the iPod and iTunes system. 5)  No built-in USB port, you have to use the special cable provided or a dock to connect USB (this is a gripe I have about iPods too)! 6)  Volume is a bit on the quiet side,  I just run all my songs through "mp3gain" and set volume to 95dB and is plenty loud enough for me. Or you can use the battery dock which removes volume limiting restrictions. 7) Battery is not removable like the 604 was, its the price we pay for a slimmer profile I guess.  To be fair, this just makes Archos like Apple but I do miss being able to swap batteries.  Fortunately, you can use the battery dock to good effect or other external battery packs such as ones made by Tekkeon to extend the battery life of the unit.  In summary, this is not the most user-friendly player in the world.  But the features are spectacular and cutting edge.  This is not a player for the faint of heart but it is a very rewarding experience if you are willing to take the time to play with it.  Feature by feature it really blows the iPod Touch away.  If you are aware of the quirks of buying an Archos ahead of time, I guarantee you will be quite happy with this product.   Update after 4 months of ownership: still very happy with this product.  I've removed a few negative points because I feel that they weren't really relevant anymore, I get carried away with negative points sometimes!  I have had zero problems with this (making it more reliable than my Touch!) and it continues to be a great product.  In addition, firmware updates have added widgets and seem to have improved the sound as well as fixing bugs relating to ID tags and such.

<Title>An Ipod for adults
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The device is amazing.  It is not apple and so can be accessed as a hard drive by any windows computer (or linux for the geeks among us) and it will do it all.  Movies, music, pictures, videos, podcasts, record tv and playback to TV or Stereo system and it is simply the best media player currently available. The company misses some points but the are largely promotional and availability points not quality.  I couldn't be more pleased.

<Content>Great product!  Huge hard drive, fast load times, great screen (crisper and brighter than my old Zen vision w). Archos is updating the firmware for this thing often.  Did I mention that the Archos 605 supports A LOT of formats!!!  I have used this product for about a week and love it.    The only complaint I have is that I can not use my playlists in windows media player (the Archos 605 supports m3u playlists).  P.S. I typed this on my Archos 605!

<Title>Great but not an iPod replacement
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a great device but....it's NOT an iPod replacement.  It's too big to carry in your pocket walking around the city.  The bottons are on the side and get pressed easily just rubbing against your leg.  Good thing winter is coming up so you'll have jacket pockets for your 605 so that issue can be avoided sometimes.   Again, for its size, it's too big to bring to the gym too.  This is ideal for plane trips or long commutes on a train.  This is not a pocket device.  As everyone says, the screen is really good.  It has a matte finish so it's not prone to fingerprints.  It seems like it woud be fairly resistant to minor scratches too.  While it can play DVD resolution files, it's limited to files 2GB and under (FAT 32 restriction I think).  So, ripping a 2 hour DVD at 2500kbps will leave you with a file to big to really handle.  Today, I couldnt xfer a 2.34GB file due to file size.  So, you're forced to lower bitrates or splitting files.  Anything over 2000kbps is overkill for the small screen anyway but it's needed if you want to watch something on your TV using the dvr station's video connections.     Speaking of the DVR, seems you're limited to 640x480 recording with a max bitrate of 2500kbps.  The bitrate isnt a problem but the resolution is smaller than what I would consider ideal for playback on my HD Plasma.  Guess there's only so much you can expect from the processor in the 605.  Once again, not a problem when viewing on the 605's screen (maybe a little hazy) but for playback on an HDTV, it leaves you wishing the rez was higher.  DVR scheduling and recording itself is good and very similar to set-top box DVRs.  Gives you warnings for recording conflicts etc.  Can automatically schedule listing downloads via wifi etc.  This is a well executed feature.  Audio functions are nice but one thing I noticed is that there's no instant Shuffle function.  You need to change the play-mode first and then go into the first album in your library to start shuffle mode.  Then, while you'll always hear the same first song in shuffle mode, all other songs will play in random as expected.  I wish it would always default to standard play mode and also offer a one-click shortcut to start playing in shuffle mode.  For unsupported file types like apple lossless/m4v files that you may have from itunes rips, the 605 doesnt handle it.  Rather than skip to the next playable file, it just stops and gives you a warning.  So, you may need to re-rip your CD's into playable formats to avoid this problem.  much of the device is plastic except for the bezel around the screen which is metal.  Seems pretty tough.   The USB connection is proprietary which is kind of a pain but given the connection features, you cant expect it to be anything else besides non-standard.   I wish the connection was on the side or top though.  If it's connected, you cant prop the device up with the kickstand - it stands tilted this way.  not a big deal though.  A secondary, mini USB (data only) connection would be ideal.  Charging with the ubs cable is painfully slow.  You really need the DVR station or other plug-in power sources for charging.  Its not realistic to deal with 6-8hours of slow charging via USB.  Get the DVR station for charging as well as other features that make this device shine.  Other great things about this device is video startup time.   Big, hi-rez files startup in under 3 seconds.  fast forwarding is also super quick.  Viewing photos is also superb - the interface is really nice and pics taken in 8+ megapixels are easy to flip though with little/no delays.  Havent tried RAW yet though.  that's all for now

<Title>Archos 605 Wi-Fi - This is it!
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, waiting for this device was frustrating but worth it.  I originally puchased from [...] but they have no idea what customer service is about so I bought from the beloved Amazon.com.  As always, seamless transaction.  I was so excited when I saw someone had it in stock I bought it.  Should have known better than to not get it from Amazon.  This device is finally it.  After iPods, Zen Micros, PDAs, Media Center Extenders, and all of the other devices I purchase to create my digital library, this is it.    I was shocked how easy the Archos was to setup straight out of the box.  I ordered a DVR station with it and it worked perfectly.  The pass-through allows you to view the Archos on your TV and watch movies, etc.  It took less than 5 minutes to get it to record TV.  Very smart interface and the docuing station can be sitting on top of a cable box and still send signals to change the channel.  To sum up how it works, you sign up for the free tv listing service online by your zip code and service provider, you then very easily tell the Archos what TV or DVR or Satellite box you want to control, test the IR repeater funtion works and youre done. You then view the listings on the screen, click on the shopw you want to record and the device does the rest.  It changes the channel on the cable box and starts recording.  Very very simple.  Video quality, awesome.  Very crisp display and good options for adjusting the picture quality.  My MOST favourite feature is no proprietary formats.  So, MP3s stay MP3s, WMV, Divx, etc.  The folder structure is quite easy to understand.  As soon as you dock it via USB you get folders such as "Data, Music, Pictures and Video" as a drive.  You simply drag whatever and boom, it's there and ready to play.  Sound quality is excellent (with headphones).  And then last night I discovered even a better feature.  Amazon's MP3 service.  Finally, purchasing digital music is without DRM, conversions, etc.  A comlpete package.  And no, I do not work for Amazon but I think they have it completely and totally "figured out".  So I highly recommend this baby.  The only "negatives" are the connector cable (proprietary USB 2.0 unless you have DVR station then it is standard) and a little bulky but worth it.  Everyone at my office now wants one.  I love showing it to the iPod Phone or Touch owners with their 16GB of solid state storage :)  In summary, if you want to consolidate your ENTIRE digital library, this is it.

<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wifi ROCKS!! The product is amazing because it offers all the same features as the iPod toutch and more for the same price or lower(depending on model). Flippin overrated iPods dont have a chance against the Archos. I have the 160GB version and I'm surprised of how small it is. Its no thicker than a classic PSP and the screen is amazing. I love how it has a kickstand for viewing movies, rather than holding it in your hands. I like almost EVERYTHING about it.   But the one drawback is that if you want internet you have to bust out $30 more since its not included. If you also have alot of videos downloaded from a p2p program most of them wont play without the Cinema plugin ($20). Other than that I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!

<Content>Got my 605 wifi after waiting over 2 months (way to long), got it charged and had just started loading it when it reset itself and flashed an error message. Gave the option to fix it, but would not called the company and now I have to return it, and it could take up to 45 days (their minimum estimate) to receive a replacement. NOT IMPRESSED.   User guide leaves alot to be desired, but hopefully the replacement will work properly.

<Title>Love it when it works:(
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Archos 605 160Gb. I love this thing when it works.  I had it for 1 month with no problems.  Took extremely good care of it.  Kept the screen protector on it and kept it in its case in and that case in yet another case.  I put 100 movies on it, 1200 songs, a few thousand pictures, and all my camcorder movies too. I had all the plug ins. They cost..so figure in an extra $100 if you want to make the most of the product. I had the dvr station too another $80.  The DVR station came in with the audio out lines blown. But I used it to convert all my camcorder movies onto the unit; very easily too. Then the problems started. It would not always turn on. The problem got to the point that it came to 29/30 times it would not turn on. The majority of the time the green power light came on...but nothing on the hdd red light. Sometimes I would just get a quick flash or two from the hdd light and (maybe) even get the archos boot up logo. Usually with lines going through it horizontally and then the unit would lock up. This all started at 1 month of ownership. This is when I requested my rma. I kept it a few more weeks to back it up, trying reformats through the unit, and to reinstall firmware. It got to be impossible to deal with at 2 months. I backed up my 100+ gig of data to my computer, though it took me an hour just to power on the archos to do so. It did not seem to make any difference on how full the battery was or not. Now I have sent the unit in next day air to archos. 49 hours after ups tracking shows they got it; their website still shows it not received. Each time I call I waste 30-40 minutes on hold to get through to anyone. They say they have it and it will take (10-15 business days) to test and fix or replace it. Excluding any shipping. This just seems absurd to me. This was a lot of money to me, its new, and now I lose the unit for a month. Should this not be their problem??? Why is it mine? Am I the only one out there that is going through this???  I still think I would recommend the unit.  I just hope you get a good one.  I would rebuy at this point, but not sure if my opinion will stay that way.  I do wish there was an fm tuner, flash capability, and voice recorder.  But for the price, the size of the hard drive, and what it can do;  It is worth it.  If it works!

<Title>Hard to Beat the Versatility
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally broke down and decided to upgrade my MP3 player to a portable media player.  I had originally wanted to get an iPod, but was mostly weary of compatibility with my library.  After lots of research, I decided to go with the 160 GB Archos 605 because it was essentially an 160GB iPod meshed with an iTouch.  It also had PlaysForSure backing up the fact that it will play just about anything.  I had some trouble at first with the player.  It took almost a full day to charge the player, and it wouldn't run off auxiliary power from my computer.  I also had trouble syncing it with my Windows Media Player (WMP).  I don't normally use WMP, so I didn't like this feature.  After getting my music on it, I realized that it filed the MP3's based on the ID3 tags (like WMP), not the folders they were in.  Most of my music was sorted by genre on my computer, so I had trouble finding all of it.  Also, it was tough to make playlists at first for this reason.  It also froze and crashed a lot the first few days.  I figured out that this is because once you open a playlist and are playing it, you can't really decide to load a new playlist without closing the old one.  I also had trouble connecting to the internet via WiFi to download plug-ins.  That all being said, I still give it 4 stars.  I have learned to deal with most of the issues above.  It still sometimes crashes when I decide I want to listen to a particular song after loading a playlist, but oh well.  I found out that you don't have to sync it with WMP.  I didn't have any playlists in WMP, so I don't know if they carry over by syncing it.  You can transfer files like you would with any other external device by going to My Computer and draging and dropping files in the correct folder.  This is how I transfered video to it, and how I will transfer all my new music.  This is also the easiest way to update your Archos and buy plug-ins.  I had trouble with Archos' site, but their phone help was very good and even just had me do it over the phone and emailed me the plug-in.  Most of my AVI files played without the Cinema plug-in, but about 40% didn't.  I got the Cinema plug-in and I have only found one particular file that didn't play because of the compression ratio.  The picture is amazing and I like it very well.  The sound isn't quite as good because it sometimes isn't loud enough.  Especially on an airplane, some of my files cannot be heard, even with my noise cancelling head phones.  I will have to edit the file to increse the volume.  I dabbled a little with the online media available for free through Archos' site on DailyMotion.  It dl'ed very quickly and was very good quality for the player.  Eventually I will buy the Web Browser plug in, but right now it doesn't make sense since I have a laptop.  I like that you can plug it in to the cradle or a computer and charge it while listening to music or playing video.  I also got the DVR and it plays very easily onto any TV.  You have to be sure your TV or cable box has an S-video output or you cannot record TV with your Archos.  Mine doesn't, so I haven't been able to try out this feature.  The battery is only about 4 hours for video and browsing, so you have to plan your time carefully.  I have not figured out how long the music is for it yet, but it is plenty long enough.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the player and will be even more satisfied when I am able to record TV.  Tech support has also been pretty good as well, although I haven't had any big problems yet.

<Title>Archos is a winner in my book...
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been mouth-watering after one of these for a while. I finally took the plunge and bought it. It did not take too much time to learn the new interface. I got the 160gb version so I have a lot of storage space for anything from music, music videos to movies and yeah not to forget pictures. Since I watch video podcasts I did have to get the podcast plug in for it so that was extra $20. Then I was wondering about the whole Opera browser so I bought that to for $30. And then since I own a good selection of music videos which are stored in mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 formats, I went for the final plug-in for additional $20. The additional charges aside, the player right out of the box doesn't have its own power supply. You will have to use supplied USB cable to charge it and it will take painfully long to do so. I would suggest getting either one of the docking stations (preferably the DVR one) or get a power supply from Archos website. After that's all and done, trust me, you won't be wondering why oh why didn't I get the Ipod Touch. I was pondering on this a while myself as to which player I want. First of all, Archos has more storage, second it reads more formats, third you can stream videos/music and view pictures from your own network (or somebody else's if you into this kind of thing) using the built-in wifi.   Using the DVR option you can record whatever you want from tv and carry it around with you. Comparing it to the fancy touch screen on the ipod touch, that's where the novelty ends with Apple for me. Archos has a bigger screen and it's also touch screen and it is very responsive.  The headphones that come with the Archos are ok, but getting something like Sennheiser PX100 headphones (which are rather inexpensive and available here on Amazon) will make your PMP sound a lot better. Speaking of sound, the player has a bass boost with several levels as well as preset equalizers to choose from or you can just set your own equalizer to your liking. I've only tried it with MP3 files and I had no problems since sound quality. I guess I am not that needy.   The video portion which I am sure you are most interested in, I did not have too many problems with. I've tried MP4, MOV (h.264 and normal quicktime/apple format), WMV, AVI (xvid/divx) but for now it will only play videos with resolutions up to 720x575. I've tried HD but the player refused to play these files. Archos however, is promising 720p support through either firmware update or a plug-in. It will not play Sorenson Squeeze codecs.  The touch screen will be a learning curve especially if you never used one before; example being the virtual keyboard and navigating the interface. This brings me to the Opera browser and WIFI. Before you can browse, you have to sign yourself into the network which is easy if you are a techie, but if you are not, the user's guide is accommodating and is in several languages :) Once that's all and done, I naturally went for the Google page since it always shows up. By double tapping in one spot (with new firmware update) you can zoom in, but providing you are not far sided sitting in front of it without glasses, you should be able to see the letters on the high resolution (for a PMP) screen. By default the whole page will fit on your screen. Various zoom options are available which show up whenever you are in the browser mode and tap on the screen. None of the Ajax stuff will work properly in the browser (it doesn't work in the desktop version either) so unfortunately Google maps are out of our reach for now. Instead you can use something like [...]. For me, that's where testing for internet browsing ended since the player crashed while browsing Google maps freezing the whole unit. Like most computers (no matter what size) a quick power down and power up will fix that. VP6 encoded flash videos are not supported by this player which is a shame because a lot of content on the net uses that codec. If there is a direct download of other file formats for download, the browser will present you with a choice to either play them (stream it) or download it to your player once you click on any. It would also be nice if the browser be faster because it gets painfully slow sometimes. The pages on websites do render correctly, but long. The browser has no problems with YouTube videos/website either.  Although you can play music in the background while in your PMP's menu interface, once you access the browser, PDF reader, or try to manipulate your files, the music stops and doesn't remember where it stopped. It would be nice if they fixed that with the next firmware update. But if they don't, you can however quickly go back into the song played and fast forward using the touch screen and scroll to the point where the music was playing before. Archos 605 does have up to 32 bookmarks available for position marking for both your music and videos so you can resume it at a later time, only one bookmark per file.  The PDF reader can only be accessed through the file manager discussed later in this review. There is a PDF reader which can be a cool addition for reading books, but loading pages takes what is seems like forever and you can only read pages in 5:3 mode (player's normal holding position) and can't be flipped. There are some zoom options but that's about it for PDF features. You can also view text files all with the help of the browser.  Picture viewer does have a few nice features that do allow you to browse through your pictures using the touch screen by swiping your finger from left to right going forward or right to left going backwards. Bottom to left and vice-versa will rotate the picture 90 degrees. Zooming in and out is better navigated using the buttons on the side however. There seems to be also a limitation on how big the pictures have to be, to be viewed. My own experience taught me that you may have problems with some Jpegs over 7 mega pixels but I haven't tested that further.  File Manager will be useful to copy, delete, and rename files stored on your Archos. From there however you can access much more like your networked files stored on other computers/devices which are sharing allowing you to stream them. If you get one of the docking stations, and connect a flash drive or a hard drive, it will also show up there. Little tabs on the top of your screen allow you to choose which of the two columns you are navigating enabling you to say copy a file from one location to another by opening folders in each.  When you go into the WIFI settings, you can turn on the server option making the Archos a wireless server which can be password protected if you wish and accessible from anywhere on your network.   My overall experience with the player is very positive, I think mostly from excitement, so I can't think objectively, but I think you'll be happy if you get one of these. If you travel a lot for long trips across Atlantic, on a train, or are passenger in a car, you will appreciate lack of boredom :) and you just can't beat the portability of this little gem.

<Title>problematic
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Received the Archos 605 wifi on tuesday. It looked great, the videos and everything. I purchased the plugins (cinema, podcast, webbrowser) on wednesday it was wonderful, downloaded the new firmware, I even tried to convert some Ipod addicted friends to archos. Unfortunatly for me, my archos is no longer recognize by my PC (windows vista) (device not recognized) since Friday. I tried it on a Win XP system but the same thing. (I did the master reset, factory reset, download the drivers on the archos website).

<Title>A stellar personal multimedia player
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If Archos, the company, had competent management, its products would be world class. Unfortunately, the company's management is not overly competent, so it turns out near exellent to excellent products that take a clobbering in the marketplace.    The Archos 605 160 GB is a superb product, but its introduction was marred by lack of availability which created a lot of ill will among people who very much wanted it. Wait times of three or more months were not uncommon - and the company remained silent. Truly a stupid thing to do. Even now, months after release, promised accessories are still not available - and Archos simply doesn't communicate with its customers. If you read the Archos support forums on the web, you also get the impression that Archos customer support stinks as well.    Given all that, I am very pleased with the Archos 605.    The Archos 605 160 GB is everything you'd want in a personal multimedia player. The 160 GB hard drive will hold up to 200 feature length movies at acceptable resolution or more hours of music than you could listen to.    The screen is superb. 4.3" at 800x480 resolution is large enough to display most movies that don't go overboard on dark, moody scenes. Almost all common formats are supported out of the box. Playback is flawlessly smooth.    Navigating the touchscreen is simple. The side mounted buttons are very convenient for controlling most functions. A major improvement is the inclusion of a volume button. The front mounted speaker is surprisingly sufficient, especially compared to the Archos 504. Headphone volume and fidelity is more than sufficient.    I use the Archos 605 primarily for video playback and think it is faultless; much better than the 5G iPod with video. Yes, it is physically larger, but it is far better suited to the purpose than the iPod. The screen is acres larger than the iPod - at least it seems that way when you are watching a video. The speaker is very nice and something the iPod doesn't have. A little kickstand lets you set the unit on a table to watch. Way cool.    Music seems to work well, handling a number of formats and being accessible without the need for special software like iTunes. Just drag and drop. I haven't yet tried creating playlists. Some people have commented that it is a chore.    As a photo viewer, it has some cool features. Just drag left or right to get to the next or previous picture. Drag up or down and the photo rotates. You can zoom the image from a sidebar and navigate with your finger. Cool. And, again, the screen is stunning.    There's also a file manager which comes in handy if you use the Archos as removable storage for your PC. It functions just like any other USB removable hard drive.    One of the other unsavory aspects of Archos management is that they are as chintzy as Apple. For example, you don't get an AC adapter with this almost $400 device. You get a USB cable which you can use to charge the device - and which takes forever.    A number of other features are add-ons as well. Though the Archos is WiFi enabled, they charge extra for the Opera browser, which is more than adequate for handling Flash videos. They also charge extra for plug-ins to access H.264 and MPEG-2 formats. The argument is that Archos doesn't want to charge people for features they don't want. Uh, considering what it would cost Archos to bundle these features, I think the motive is pure greed. (A PDF viewer comes standard.)    Then there are the docks. You can get one to make the Archos into a DVR. Actually you can get one for stationary use or another for travel. There's another dock to that permits you to download pictures from your digital camera. And another that has a backup battery.    Overall, the Archos has the potential of taking a bunch of bucks out of your pocket.    But when it comes to a platform for viewing video or photos, browsing the web wirelessly and listening to music, the Archos 605 is in a league of its own.  Jerry

<Title>Nice, but not without quirks
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this device for about a month now (after waiting for quite a few weeks for the backorders on Amazon to fill).  Overall I am pleased with it, but I cannot say I endorse it whole-heartedly.  There are enough little quirks and annoyances that I would caution anyone thinking of buying one to reconsider before clicking that Purchase button.   Don't get me wrong: the nice features are very nice indeed.  The screen is bright and clear and the capacity can't be beat.  The UI is pretty and the wi-fi works well.  As others have addressed all of these points, I'll concentrate on the things I found somewhat surprising upon opening the box.  The quirks range from minor annoyances to serious issues, ranked below accordingly.  - The audio is indeed *much* too low.  It's fine for quiet situations, and usually not bad if the particular audio track is recorded at a high level.  However, I have tried to watch certain movies on a commuter train (with what I would call a moderate noise level) and the audio track is completely indecipherable at max volume.  If you're going to use this out in public (and isn't that the point of the whole device?), you're going to need noise-cancelling headphones at a minimum.  - This is a portable device, but I would not call it a "pocket" device.  It has some serious heft to it (especially the 160 gb version) and it's pretty big.  Fortunately, most of the device is taken up by the screen, which makes it more worthwhile; still, this is not at all something you stash in your shirt pocket.  - Plenty of others have mentioned the short battery life, but it bears repeating.  This is especially notable since the battery is non-removable, so you're completely stuck with it unless you're using some external power.  I find it reasonable for most uses, but don't forget to recharge at the end of every day or it will become a doorstop on your next commute.  - Generally the OS works well, but sometimes loads very slowly (hourglass or splash screen for quite a few seconds) and occasionally outright crashes.  I have had to reset the device a handful of times already.  - The audio track on large video files (2+ hour movies) can get out of synch with the picture if you jump around too much using the controls.  This is especially sad because there is absolutely NO "resume" functionality, so you are forced to load the file from the beginning and jump forward if you are resuming watching a file.  - The touchscreen works well overall, but the smaller buttons can be fairly difficult to press.  (The pop-up USB activation button sometimes requires some serious button-mashing in particular.)  - The unit comes with two plastic styli to use on the touchscreen, but there's absolutely nowhere to store them.  (i.e. they don't attach to the device as is the case with pretty much every other stylus-using device.)  It's nice having a stylus but this screams "Lose me."  - The PDF browser is *extremely* slow.  It can take upwards of 30 seconds to draw each individual page, and any slight navigation or zooming can cause it to redraw forever again.  Not to mention it seems like they are just "printing" the content to a PostScript file and then displaying it, so protective "print only" watermarks actually show up on the screen.  I was looking forward to this feature for browsing scans of some graphic novels, but the load times make this far too frustrating to be practical.  - The DVR function is somewhat of a joke.  I'm not even sure why they include the "TV Guide" and timer functionality, since it won't record anything unless your TV and cable box are on the right channel at the right time.  It will record TV shows, but I'm not sure what functionality the "DVR" adds since it's pretty much the same as just connecting the device and pressing record when your show is on.  - On a related note, the optional "DVR Station" is also somewhat of a joke.  I think it flirts with false advertising to label a device as a "TV recorder" when it doesn't even accept a cable signal.  It's really just a docking station with some additonal outputs, and doesn't get around the fact that you have to manually set your TV and cable anyway.    - The manual that explains the functions of the device is wrong in many places.  For example, the placement and function of the LEDs is completely different than the diagram.  (In fact, for some inexplicable reason the HDD light is on the *back* of the device, so you never really see it.)  I suspect they cut and pasted the diagram from another device (the 04 series?) and didn't update.  Somewhat minor, but there are enough functions on the device that this is annoying when trying to learn them all.  All in all, you might find this device useful if the above quirks don't really bother you.  It's still fairly nice to have on a long commute, but it's not quite the "wonder device" that some have painted it to be.

<Title>Great Potential for Gen 6 *if and only if*...
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, this thing totally breaks ground, and will force apple to be more competitive and innovative thankfully.  Mainly I got it to get away from the proprietary crap that apple stuffs in its products.  Personally I go for function over form and branding, and the same people who like Volkswagens like Apple products mainly for form not function.  Anyways here's what needs improvement in the Generation 6 that is not even slated to exist yet.  1) Battery needs to be removeable and there needs to be an external charger so you can always have fresh charged battery to swap out with a used up one, and so you don't have to use the device itself to charge the battery (cuz if its mobile you want to be moving around, not tied down to a PC or outlet so you can have the juice you need).  2) Battery needs to last way longer!  Plain and simple.  The advertised battery times are way off.  I haven't had mine last for longer than five hours ever no matter what I'm doing with it.  3) Make it a multimedia device.  We're going back to windows 3.1 functionality with this thing.  I should be able to listen to music while using the internet...  4a) which leads to FIX THE BUGS! SO IT DOESN'T CRASH SO MUCH!  4b) Actually, the crashes are likely due to an insufficient amount of onboard system memory (aka RAM in the PC scene) and a processing chip that needs more muscle.  It seems to happen any time you try to rapidly move through menus or make more than three touch screen presses very quickly.  The little hour glass that comes up after you make some selections is a clue to this fact.  They must have known the processing would be slightly weaker than instant or else they never would have decided to put the little hour glass symbol into the software.  Again this is something that reminds me of Windows 3.1.  Please make the next device true multimedia (multiple media forms that can be going simultaneously).  5) Standard USB please, no need for proprierary.  6) **HUGELY IMPORTANT*** make a customized rubber condom for the thing that absorbs shock if you drop it, and which allows you to still use it in everyway while the rubber is on it (cuz you're going to drop it and it weighs a ton, so its gonna hurt it unless you have the silicone condom on it).  They have these for Ipods, get them for Archos!  7) As others have said, the user manual is lacking.  Also, how about a paper copy of it in full, or at least a sheet of paper that tells you where to find it on the device (I didn't realize it was in a PDF on the device until a week of using it and recreating the wheel to figure out how it functions).  10) Slot for the stylus!  You lose it otherwise... plain and simple.  11) Get your own sync software please, cuz I don't want to use WinXp which is what I'd have to do to be able to use the sync function on Win Media Player 11 which only works with XP and newer OS.  12) Make the internet more smooth and less power eating.  Its pretty much a novelty as it is.  Not practical to use... so your use of it will atrophy quickly.  It needs to be easier to type and mouse around.  It takes forever to enter in the slightest thing by typing. [The remote for the DVR adapter really helps in this area, but you can't take it with you because the dvr adapter is not portable since it needs a AC power source (plugs into the wall) and you wouldn't want to cuz its pretty big.  The travel version of the dvr adapter doesn't come with a remote.]  13) Audio recording was adverted as being built in.  They didn't tell you  that you need the DVR station or travel DVR to record notes to self.  All recording functionality should be inside the device itself, cuz daisy chaining a bunch of adapters makes an already large and heavy device impossible to bring with you very easily.  All this said, the 605 is an important step.  But, you might want to just wait until Generation 6 comes out if you really want all this stuff to work as it should.  And I'd add that Archos needs to get better information out there about what the device has for functions.  It takes a lot of research to find out good information on what all the device actually does and doesn't do, and you usually have to trust third party sources who don't seem too confident in the info they're telling you, like the folks on the archosfans forums.  It just shouldn't be so hard to get full information on the device!  That said, it works just as good as an ipod.  So, even if some of the archos features don't work in a practical manner, remember that ipods don't have these functions at all (or if they do the Iphone only has 16 puny gigs).  So, while archos can deliver poorly on expectation, it still does better than ipods.   Its up to you.  If you're not doing the mp3 player thing yet and you're thinking of jumping into this game, then I would counsel to wait until the next round of products in a year or so.  There's a lot happening now, but as usual when new stuff comes out they don't get it right the first time.  ***Addendum added after two months of owning the 605: I am very satisfied with my 605 even though it has the problems listed above.  You have to remember that it is way better than an ipod, and realize that this is a great step forward for pmp's and the first step toward a true convergence device.  Without the 605 there could never be a 606 in the future.  While they didn't get everything right, they got most of it.  Definitely glad I got the DVR Adapter with its awesome remote control!

<Title>I love it, but...
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my Archos 605 last night, and I love it. I'm so glad I got it. I had been going so long without carrying my music with me, that something in me really had begun to die.. My 605 is bringing it back to life.  So to make this short (others have already said whats great about this product), you won't be TOO disappointed if you buy this item. Its good, but not perfect.  The negative things I have noticed are that the interface is not all that intuitive. Playlist editing on this thing is no where near as easy as it should be. Its too hard to create new playlists, and add songs to them. Adding a song to a playlist (ANY playlist) should take no more than three steps.  You should download the new firmware immediately when you buy this item.  All in all, I like this item, I'm glad I bought it. But for $400+ (w/ the DVR thingy) it could be WAY better.  UPDATE: I removed the stuff about not being able to resume, and not being able to lock the player; I found those functions after a bit of trial and error. (Thank you to the people who left comments..) Since those were two of my biggest complaints, I have to give the 605 one more star for a total of four now; if only I could figure out how to get Amazon to let me do that. :-/

<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned my archos 605 wifi for about 70 days now. I am a high school student and this gets me throught the day. All I do is record jay leno and conan o'brien at night and watch it during free time in class. The people around me all have video Ipods and were very confused when I pulled out my 160 gig monster. the battery will get me throught the day.I did a battery test because I thought that it was broken but the battery lasted 4 hours 40 min so close to 5 hour on video on full screen brightness. I love this device. I started with the archos av480 as my first inconveniently large mp3 player and people were amazed with that.both of my archoses batteries are integrated. my av480 has a fried battery that will not even power up the device. eventually the 605 will be like that but this one I will get fixed.

<Title>Great Great Product
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this primarily to be able to hook the 605 up to my TV.  I have my complete movie collection compressed to DIVX on external hd's and wanted an alternative to play them on my tv.  This product performs that product perfectly.  I have not tested the DVR function at this time so I have not ran into the problems with the power function that others have.  One thing I was disappointed with is that the advertisment said it would play HD.  I have several movies compressed into an HD format and they do play but the HD quality does not come through the composit video jacks and I have not been able to make the S-Video work at this time... not sure that it works at all.  I would certainly recomend this product to anyone with a compressed video collection.  Plus it charges the unit in about an hour.

<Title>Works great, budget in an extra 100$ for plugins and accessories
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 160GB 605 for two weeks now and I'm quite satisfied with it. The first one I received had a defective hard disk and had to be exchanged for a replacement from Amazon (which is a quick and painless process by itself), and the replacement has been going great guns so far.  Things I like: - You can navigate without using the touchscreen - the side buttons give you access to everything you might want to do, except perhaps browsing on the internet - If you buy the web browser plugin (Opera, $20), you can browse the web and watch videos on youtube. I was also able to stream music/radio which is a really welcome feature. - Flick through photos on the screen like the iphone - fun! - Oodles of space and a large screen. My music collection isn't so large, but it's good to know that I have the extra space - You can check and download updates directly on the device when you're connected to the internet, so no more fiddling with the PC or Mac - Works great with my macbook pro, showing up as an external disk - Personalization! Some color support, but you can choose any picture or any frame of a video to set as the background for the home screen.  Things I'm not too hot about: - The 20$ for the browser, 20$ to play raw DVD files (in the vob format) - USB charging is pretty slow, and it's 30$ for a mini dock or 50$ for a dock with an additional battery. - Though you can play raw dvds with the 20$ plugin and choose the soundtrack, you can't use subtitles, which I'm hoping comes in a future update. - Recording is only available if you spring for the 100$ dvr base, playback on the tv only available if you choose the dock or the base (50 - 100$)  Overall, it's a great device, and well worth the $480 (device and accessories/plugins) I've paid for it so far. Battery life and general build quality remains to be seen :)

<Content>The device is pretty cool.  The weak battery life is a serious minus.  The TV Schedule upload doesn't work and therefore I cannot use the DVR functions of my docking station...and since getting help from their tech support is impossible (I have been trying to get someone for the past 2 weeks!!!!!!!!!)  I am considering returning it to get a Zen vision even if it only has 30GB (my Archos has 160GB).  What a shame!  This product had so much potential - but the frustration of dealing with such incompetent buffoons has taken all the joy out of the experience.

<Title>Only buy if you need the features unique to it
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There are two types of people who will not be unhappy with this product. First there is the casual user who wants lots of space, no hassle or forced software to load media up and dosen't care too much about tech stuff like pixel resolution, is not an audiophile and doesn't mind Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to charging you.  Second is the technical savvy geek who needs the specific things that only an Archos can give you. The three things are:  1) Massive storage (160gb) 2) USB host 3) Wifi hard drive  If you fit either of these types of user, then go ahead otherwise you will just be unhappy and join the ranks who wish they bought a Cowon. Why? I only have 300 words so I am going to list it out:  1) Do not let the linux base of this device fool you. This is a locked down device.   2) It only supports 720x480 res video (or the equivelent PAL vertical res if on PAL mode) eventhough the Archos has a 800x480 res. Your video will either have black bars or will be scaled to oversize, your choice.  2) If you want a remote, you MUST buy the DVR station and not the mini one. Only the full DVR station has an IR receiver. The full DVR dock is huge not something you would ever want to travel with.  3) Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to squeeze money out of you is rather irritating. For me its not the money, but it means you have to carry, keep track of, etc these docks when you travel with them.  This unit does not have a replaceable battery, so you NEED the battery dock (otherwise your battery life is terrible).  I've hit the word limit but there are 4 other items on this list.

<Title>The WORST customer service!!
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am fed up with Archos customer service.  The TV program guide feature wouldn't work on my 605 Wifi and it wouldn't accept the firmware upgrade.  Sent it in to Archos (on my dime of course).  They kept it for over 2 weeks, sent it back and it still doesn't work.  No explanation.  So I finally found time to call customer service (It can take up to an hour on hold to get to talk to someone).  They gave me the run around.  My daughter ordered the leather case for me for Christmas.  After the Christmas rush died down and I had time to try it out, I had to cram it into the case so tight I thought it would break.  Then I couldn't plug the cable in to use it in the car since the little hole in the leather was too small and didn't line up.  The whole thing is a bad design.  Also bought a pack of styli which were not the original ones but tiny good for nothing ones.  Called customer service to return them and was informed you have to return within 7 days of Christmas! Period!  Supposedly talked to the supervisor and she was no help at all.  I would NOT recommend buying any Archos product unless you enjoy disappointment and frustration!

<Title>Not a Steller Music Player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My primary reason for purchasing this unit was for the large amounts of memory and the good reviews.  Once I received it I found how buggy it's operating system is and how user-friendly it is NOT.  I spent at least 20 hours working on it trying to copy music playlists from my computer to the Archos 605.  I tried numerous methods and software applications and could never get it to work.  My daughter showed me her ipod touch and I discovered how much easier tasks are on it.  My daughter and I have had a friendly debate on who got the best product - I had to concede that for what we wanted to use it for, she did.   Also, Amazon willingly took the product back, but it has taken them over two weeks to refund my money to my credit card.

I gave it a few weeks and I had nothing but trouble with it.  Either it didn't charge, locked up, wouldn't sync, you name it.  All calls to their support were pretty useless with the vague answer of "reset" the unit.    If I could rate this with negative stars - I would.  It's not worth the one star they make you select.  The only GOOD thing about the product - Amazon refunded my money.  I switched to a Zen Vision W - 60G - it's AWESOME and their support is great and helpful.    Seriously, I will NEVER buy or recommend Archos to anyone.

<Title>Awesome Player!
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player is awesome. I almost didn't buy it after reading the negative reviews. I have since realized that many such reviews are by users who are ignorant of the proper usage of this piece of equipment. Archos 605 wifi is more than just a standard PMP (personal media player).   For instance, some complain about the absence of a standard USB cable. But the Archos 605 has features that go beyond what a regular USB cable is able to handle. When plugged into the DVR dock (purchased separately) the player becomes a DVR which records from any television signal.   I was able to attach the DVR dock to my cable box. At first I was unable to get my Pioneer cable box to respond to the DVR. But then I selected Time-Warner cable instead of Pioneer (the maker of the box) and the signals worked.   The dock has an infrared emitter which turns the cable box on and off and changes the box to the channel I have programmed the player to record. The recording and playback itself is flawless. The screen resolution is great and allows you to read titles and text clearly.  Using the built in wireless feature I seamlessly updated the firmware and also updated the cable program guide for Time-Warner NY city area.  The TV guide system works as it should. The guide is up to date and I would just select a program from the guide, touch the record icon, put the player in the DVR dock and forget it. Next day the program, properly titled, is in my REC folder on the player.  The battery life is satisfactory. New users must allow it fully charge before first time use. You should not turn the player off to recharge it. Just turn it on, plug the USB adapter to a PC or the DVR dock, select charge and leave it. The system will go to sleep by itself during the charging cycle. If you turn it off during charging you will not see the blinking fully charged light.  The buttons at the side are very useful when I don't want to obscure the touch screen to activate features.  MP3s sound good and picture viewing was a breeze. I was able to flip through images by just dragging my finger across the touch screen.  I haven't yet used it for internet browsing but will add to this post as soon as I do.

<Title>Excellent Tech
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been watching Archos products for a while. While the Ipod is the mass favorite my requirements were for a device that did not require transcoding of video material to another format. I just wanted a device that I could connect via Wi-Fi or USB to my computer and copy movies and music. This device does just that.  Another very important feature is the superior resolution on the new Generation 5 Archos products. The video clarity blows the competition away.  Web browsing is great, I don't use the feature that much but it's nice to know I can check email with a handheld device. Another HUGE plus, it runs the Linux OS. The device is very fast.  UDPATE: I ordered my first Archos 605 160gb unit in October when they were still on backorder. Finally got it and had sound problems. Basically, whenever wi-fi was enabled and transmitting or receiving the audio circuitry was picking up activity with wi-fi. This was the same for headphones, speaker or SPID/F. Turning off wi-fi fixed the problem. But I wanted to stream music and video and surf the way the units was intended to work. So I returned it. BTW, Amazon is great for returns!! Kudos! I got the second unit in November... same problem. I was told both times by Archos that a firmware update would fix it. I have an engineering background and was highly skeptical. I used the unit for a few weeks waiting for the magical firmware update. I thought I could get used to the sound problems. The new firmware 1.7.3 didn't fix the problem and I'd had enough of the audio issues. I returned it for a refund and placed ANOTHER order on Amazon. The 3rd unit works fantastic (with 1.7.3 firmware) and I couldn't be happier hence the 5 star rating. Video playback is beyond phenominal on the Archos Gen 5 compared to the competition. The Linux OS is fast and reliable. I use absolutely every function on this device.  Also, I was considering buying a DVD Recorder/VHS device to transfer old VHS tapes to DVD. These things are in the $250+ range. And it occured to me that the Archos 605 could do it. I have transferred a huge library of VHS tapes that aren't available on DVD and probably never will be to DivX format with ease. Sure there could be improvements, we all want battery's that last for weeks and storage capacities in the Terabyte range but this is the best we have thus far. BTW, you can buy one of the new USB powered 320gb drives from Western Digital and plug it in to the DVR or Mini-Dock base for added storage. How slick is that?? A lot of people criticize the styling but I like the industrial look and very solid build. You have the option of touch input or button input. Anyone can easily figure out navigation. As a side note, I have taken the .png files on the device (menus, backgrounds, etc.) and edited them with Photoshop for my own stamp on the thing. Just a fun aside that makes the device unique and fun to customize. This is not documented anywhere but it is easily done. Pure genius, I would easily recommend this to anyone.  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars and not 5 is a problem with the unit. I had to return the first one because of popping and cracking sounds through the speakers and/or headphones when Wi-Fi is enabled. Archos said it would be fixed via a firmware update but I decided to exchange the unit for another one. Guess what, the second unit has the same problem. I researched this on the web and found that several other users with 605 160gb units have a similar problem. And also several users that don't have the problem. So it seems unlikely that it's a firmware issue.  If you get a defect free device you're dealing with a great piece of technology. Otherwise you'll be frustrated with a device that has noise issues when one of its primary functions is enabled.

<Title>STAY AWAY!!!!!  Two Defective Units In A Row!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd heard that Archos tends to ship a large number of defective units and has terrible customer service, so (fortunately) ordered through Amazon for the added protection.  Received my first unit early in November and immediately plugged it in to charge.  24 hours later it did not indicate a full charge but I tried to turn it on anyway.  NOTHING, system would not power up at all.  Charged for an additional 12 hours and the same thing.  Called Amazon and they agreed the unit was defective and promptly shipped a replacement.  The second unit took a charge and allowed me to spend 2 days loading videos and music, as well as another 2 days creating playlists (Archos playlist creation is absolutely archaic).  Turned it on this morning and got the "white screen of death", asking if I wanted to recover my system.  After repeated attempts, I called Archos technical support and after a lengthy period on hold, I was informed the unit was dead and there was nothing I could do to save all of the time I had invested.    Needless to say, the unit is going back (thank you Amazon) and I'll never purchase another Archos product.

<Title>Great Product, awful service
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 is a great product, with a clean, crisp 4.3 inch screen. However, after owning one myself, i returned it due to its compatibility issues, and the web browser. I advise against getting this product if you own a Mac, because the steps necessary to get the Archos up and running are extremely time consuming and pricey. Also, the web browser is extremely sluggish compared to Safari on the Ipod Touch. If you can deal with both of those issues, then you reach the customer service problems. To be able to call customer service, you have to set up an account for your Archos, which is a pain if you a Mac, because you cannot set up an account on Safari, it does not work. Customer service is the worst that you will ever deal with. I sat waiting for the operators to pick up the phone for over half an hour, and this happened multiple times. if you have the choice between the Archos and the Ipod Touch, go with the Touch. It is much more reliable, and easier to work with.

<Title>Glorious
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is by far the coolest portable video player or MP3 player I've owned, which is saying something because I always want the latest & greatest.  After using an iPod (some version or another) for the past several years, I would worried that I'd have to tinker too much to get this to work. As a busy working professional, I didn't want to have to fiddle too much with the device - just wanted it to be plug and play.  It really couldn't be easier. I own a MacBook Pro, so I attach it like a portable hard drive and just drag and drop files onto the Archos. I don't have to sync to Windows Media Player. I can also easily attach & grab files from my work PC or other Windows PC in the house.  I have 25 GB of music, all my photos, 40 to 60 hours of video (AVI format), data backup, etc. on this baby and there is still 98 GB left! It's insane that so much is packed into such a little device.  Yeah, it's bigger than an iPod touch, but it has 10 TIMES the capacity. It is fast, intuitive, and bright and crystal clear - it's almost like having a laptop to go around with you - a laptop that only has the fun features, and not the work stuff :-) I didn't even have to read the manual, it's very intuitive.  You can watch photo slideshows to music. It doesn't seem to let you listen to music & browse the web at the same time, though. The on-board speakers aren't the best ever, but it's cool they are there in case you are caught without headphones.   Yeah, I had to pay $30 extra for the WiFi, but I knew this going into the purchase. It's not like Archos hides the fact that some plug-ins are extra. The Opera browser on this thing is great. The screen resolution is vastly superior to any portable device I've owned. This makes the tiny text on websites readable even from a distance. The browser does tabbed browsing and loads complicated web pages like ESPN with no problems. Way better than the WiFi on a PDA, for example.  You can read PDF documents. An addition of Widgets is scheduled for release soon, which will add Calendar, Weather, etc. functionality.  Can't wait!  I don't really know why some the reviews are so negative. It almost scared me off from buying, but it was just too cool to pass up. This really is the coolest thing out there right now that I have seen. And this is coming from an iPod lover and Mac owner, not a person who likes to trash anything that isn't made by Apple.  Fear not! If you have $400 to drop on this and about $60-$100 for add-ins, you will be "geeking out" as much as I am.

<Title>Fantastic gadget
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This entire review is predicated on a well-functioning unit without any bugs or glitches.  From all of the research I did before plunking down the cash, it was clear that Archos customer service is abysmal for malfunctioning units.  Thankfully, like I said, my 605 is working flawlessly.  After a few weeks of intense research and peer reviews, I decided that the 605 would be a worth-while investment.  In addition to the obvious application of personal video player (PVP), I intended the 605 to operate as a traveling DVR.  I am frequently on the road and don't have cable on the TV I watch most often.  Access to all of my TV shows and movies was paramount, so I thought this machine was the way to go.  Knowing ahead of time that it wouldn't connect by itself, I purchased the 605 with the Generation 5 adapter.  In addition to component, composite, and s-video inputs and outputs, the adapter works as a charger.  I paid $455 for everything through Amazon, and I'd do it all again.  I couldn't have been more favorably surprised.  First of all, the unit is easy to use.  I am a Mac man, and it's as simple as dragging and dropping downloaded files.  As almost all reviewers say, the graphics are unreal.  However, what has me most excited is the video playback on a TV.  I had a hard time finding extended reviews of the video playback quality, but it's great.  I have a Verizon Fios DVR on another TV, and the 605 quality is comparable to that.  Granted, it's not hi-def, but those files would be too big anyways.  Hooking the 605 up to a TV is as simple as docking it and connecting the cables (I use composite bc of easier access).  This is my first review of a product on Amazon.  I was so impressed by the customer service and the product that I felt obligated to share my enthusiasm.  Listed below in bullet points are more pros (and a few cons) of the 605: PROS: - Simple to navigate - Easy to upload music and pictures (both can be edited via computer or in the unit) - Digitize VHS movies: Once connected to the Gen 5 adapter, you can hook VHS outputs directly to the Archos.  So doing, I was able to convert all of my highschool and college football tapes to digital.  I have since transferred the files onto my Mac and made DVDs.  I know there are VHS/DVD combos out there, but now I don't need one.  Awesome. - Great quality when hooked up to a TV - Kickstand on the back is perfect.  Some reviewers don't like this feature or prefer a stylus port, but I think it works well.  Plus, I have enormous hands and can easily operate the 605 with my sausage fingers - Tons of memory- Everyone says to buy as much memory as you can afford.  I am seriously happy that I opted for 160gb over the 80gb.  Right now, I have 7 gigs of pics, 11 gigs of music, 30 movies, and 45 tv shows on the 605.  And I still have 75 gigs left to play with. - Simple to use this guy as your stereo: I hooked it up to my surround system using composite cables with the Gen 5 adapter.  Now, I have access to 11 gigs of music in 5.1 stereo.  CONS: - Even though I didn't buy the internet plug-in, I can agree that the web is a little slow on this guy.  The content portal is online and free, and it's a wee slow. - The DVR is a little less than OK.  I haven't played with it all that much, but I'm fairly certain that you can't record one show while watching another.  Also, I was disappointed to find out that I couldn't upload shows from my Fios DVR onto it.  I've read that you can with TiVo, and I think that would be sweet.  I've had to manually copy my shows.  Slowly. - The external speaker is almost worthless.  But most people will usually listen through headphones or attach speakers.  UNDECIDED: - Haven't bought the web plug-in.  Did anyone?  Is it worth it? - Haven't bought the Cinema plug-in.  This enables mp4 playback.  A good amount of files are in this format.  The website also claims that you can drag-and-drop DVD files right into the 605 with this plug-in, but I can't find a single review for this online.  Any feedback on this?   Overall, it's probably the best money I've spent since converting to Mac or buying Flow snowboard bindings.  If you're on the fence, take my word for it- it's worth it.

<Title>Before you buy a 605
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 605 with a 160G drive.  I've been using it for about two months.  I purchased it primarily for the DVR and WiFi capabilities.  The 605 is a marvel of technology if it worked as advertised.  The first thing that annoyed me was that the WiFi connection is not reliable.  If you think that this device will act like your laptop, think again.  First, it needs a very strong WiFi signal and even then it sometimes disconnects for apparently no reason.  Second, the 605 browsing (using the purchased plugin) is so slow that it becomes unbearable.  Simple sites like Google are fine but you will find that there are many sites that you simply cannot view because they choke the 605.  OK, the DVR station works but sometimes it records video in black & white instead of color.  I can update the TV Guide using WiFi (again, horribly slow) but I cannot get the TV Guide to update using the ArchosLink software.  I have contacted Archos technical support many times and they have never solved any of my issues.  Next, the 605 crashes way to often, especially when browsing. [...]

<Title>Craptastic!
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yeah, this thing looks decent enough, and it's convenient too, but I found the user interface to be sorely lacking. It was insane how difficult it was to simply add my MP3s to the Archos.   Add to this the fact that the Ok button on mine stopped working after less than two weeks, and the fact that I had some fairly bad pixel dimming in less than a month, and you have yourself a craptastic piece of electronics.   It's not like I'm rough on my gadgets either. Heck, I've got a 5G iPod that's still in pristine condition, even though those things were known to scratch up like mad before they switched to the aluminum case.

<Title>great tech support for a great product
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There were some prior reviews saying that tech support was poor. Don't know where they contacted for support, but when I filled out the on line registation at their web site I then got a special tech support user number. I sent an email to them (they do also have call in) and they got back to me within 2 hours with an answer. And it is a bit annoying to have to pay $20 or so to get the internet software and $30 to watch mp4 movies, but even adding all that in it is a super value product. HINT: this unit charges with USB which takes many, many hours. Rather than spending big bucks getting the Archos plugs and docking station check out The Gomadic Rapid Wall AC Travel Charger for the Archos 604 at Amazon, Only $20. Important- call Gomadic first and tell them you want the tip for the 605 unit since the 604 unit will not fit in the 605, but Gomadic told me they have a specail tip they will can send so that it fits in the 605. Gomadic was super helpful on this also

<Title>Would be great (oh, if only it worked)
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third Archos.  I started with the Gmini 402, which was probably the best of the bunch, but just not enough hard drive storage.  Moved on to the 100GB AV400, which had its problems but in balance was pretty good.  But the hard drive soon filled up and in the meantime Archos, in typical fashion, refused to support the AV400 when Windows Media Player updated to Version 11.  I eventually upgraded to the 605 but was told it wouldn't be availble until March 2008.  So I broke down and actually bought an iPod.  But a week later -- surprise -- the 605 arrived.  Bye bye iPod.  Some might think the 605 was rushed to market, unfinished and laden with bugs, just so it would be available for the holidays.  Some might think right.  You can almost feel the Dilbert-like struggle that went on between engineering and marketing on this one.  My first 605 would not sync with WMP 11.  No support, of course, from Archos so I had to manually transfer files using the 605 as an external hard drive.  I managed to transfer about half my files that way before the 605 refused to recognize the USB link any more.  And the files that did transfer would not play even though none were DRM-infested.  So back it went.  Round 2.  The second 605 synched but only for a short while.  I got about 2/3's of my files over and those did come over did play.  I'm almost tempted to keep it anyway because the features are that good.  When it works, the 605 has the power to delight -- truly stunning.  The touch screen interface is too cool and the 605 also works very well as a portable (although very expensive) photo album.  Want to move on to the next picture?  Just whisk your finger across the screen and off it goes.  Want to zoom?  Put your thumb and finger on the screen and then drag.  Again, too cool.  It's even got a memory card slot for your pictures.  The wifi feature lets you tap in to your computer's files without transferring them over, again very cool but not without drawbacks:  It's not too useful, obviously, if you want to go portable; the reception is very poor so you won't be able to stray too far anyway; and -- oh yeah -- on my unit that feature died after only 2 days.  Plus, as everyone else has noted, you're getting a stripped down (i.e., crippled) version here.  Most of the bells and whistles advertised are actually sold a la carte and you'll need to invest an additional $100 or so to get the best of them.  The 605, for example, charges (very slowly) through the USB connection.  Want an AC adapter?  That's extra.  Want to use the wifi to get on the web?  That's extra.  It's like buying a Ferrari and then having to pay extra to get it to go over 55.  So, regretfully, back it goes.  I think I'll keep trying to work around the flaws in the AV400 for a least a little longer but I'll be keeping my eyes open.  If Archos can ever get the product to work or can at least provide a decent level of support when it doesn't, I'll be the first one back in line.  The 605 has so much potential that it's frustrating that so much of it doesn't work.  And it's even worse that a lot of the frustration is intentional, to force you to buy a lot of add-ons that should have been standard to begin with.

<Title>Great video player, somewhat difficult to use as in-car mp3 player
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is great as a portable video and music player, but can be difficult to use in your car as an mp3 player.  The buttons are pretty easy to use, but can be a little difficult to use when driving.  It would help out a lot of the phono plug was on the right side instead of the left for in-car use as it can be a little difficult to maneuver or place it anywhere.  I would still buy it, hands down, over the other 160GB mp3 player that is out there.  My only other gripes are that after a song starts playing, it takes about 10 seconds before you can look at the info of the song or skip to the next, and that you have to buy extra accessories just to use some of the features that I think should be included (eg. WiFi) especially since it is part of the name of the player.

<Content>Although all the attachements and accessories available for this 605 might amount to more than what you expect or want to pay for a PMP, this unit is great. It might be a bit bulkly in comparison to the iPod Touch, but with 160Gbs and all the media formats it can handle flawlessly, it's certainly worth the weight. For the most part, no need to convert your videos/music. Screen is gorgeous. Doubles as a portable storage device..something the iPod Touch doesn't do. A couple of minor complaints...the PDF viewer is slow to render pages. Perhaps a future firmware update might fix this. Also, viewing a few websites I've experienced crashes on the unit...where you'll have to hold down the ON button to restart the unit. All in all, well worth the money.

<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great media device, the video quality is excellent and the audio seems to be better than other devices I own. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is an issue with syncronization in that if I sync a playlist in a program like media player or media monkey, it does bring in the music files and playlists, but the playlist structure doesn't match where the files are. So when I do select the playlist it doesn't see any songs. There are workarounds for this but would be nice if Archos would address this in future firmware releases for those of us who have had playlists set up long ago and don't wish to re-invent the wheel. But if you don't mind the work arounds I would highly recommend the 605.

Pros: tons of space sharp screen with many viewable angles kickstand allows you to sit the device down (very handy) wi-fi works well and picks up all available networks touchscreen is pretty accurate fun product overall Cons: If you buy the basic package you have to charge the device through USB- which takes FOREVER (and is ridiculous)- buy the dock or mini-dock so you can charge with an adapter!

<Title>Worst technology product on the market
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the worst technology product I have ever purchased.  I bought it so I don't have to carry a portable dvd player, but have found it is impossible to download dvd's on to the hard drive and make the play on the archos.  I have tried several different programs to accomplish this and none work.  I then have found that after waiting up to an hour on hold for tech support, they refuse to be help.  I strongly recommend NOT buying this product.

<Title>What a disappointment!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I hate to be negative but it's the only conclusion i can draw here.  I ordered the Archos 605 160GB unit on December 31st and by January 7th it was a paperweight.  I was very excited about the unit, the huge amount of storage and the packaged features made it look like a very attractive alternative to the iTouch. What i found though was a buggy unit with a hard to use interface. In the first day i was forced to reset the unit several times as it kept locking up and when i put it on the DVR recorder for any extended amount of time it would lock up and miss programs i had scheduled to record. I then took it on a cross country flight and struggled just to get it to show a single movie. it would lock up, skip and just be non-responsive. with a unit that needs to be reset so often you would think that process might be easier to handle...it isnt...the reset hole is too small for even a paperclip to access nevermind the cheap plastic stylus they provide. i ultimately had to resort to a single staple to reset the unit.  I assumed that i must have just received a buggy unit so i tried contacting support. the website was pretty unreliable when i finally did get through i was told i had to submit an RMA request to get them to look at the unit. this request took a couple of days to accomplish with Archos asking for the same infromation twice. Once I got the RMA established i went to the site to print the mailing label....guess who has to pay shipping? that's right. I was informed that Archos would cover the cost of mailing the "fixed" unit back to me but getting the unit to them would be on my own dime. this was the last straw for me. I decided that having to pay to get a unit that broke in less than two weeks fixed was too much of an insult. luckily i bought the unit through Amazon and their return policy is much easier to navigate and they PAY the shipping!  the unit had a lot of potential and i was severely disappointed not only with the quality of the unit but with the lack of accountability from Archos.

<Content>I have been using archos since gmini 220. Great product, but just the  battery sucks. Turns out 3 years later, those French people never  learn, for mobile unit, battery IS important! Why would they give  such a great product such a low capacity battery? Mine lasts only 2~2.5  hours watching movie.  Other than the battery it is a great unit, occasinally would freeze up  which requires a hardware reset, but not a serious threat since you  don't lose any files.

<Title>A Nightmare on MY Street
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ACT I, SCENE I:  Daughter wanted the top of the line media player for her birthday and the Archos 605 seemed liked the no-brainer choice.  Ordered it and the DVR station from Amazon.com (not to ruin the ending, but this is the only happy point of the story).    ACT I, SCENE II:  Product arrived promptly - daughter loved it - dad is a hero - all is well!  Then &lt;KEY SCARY MUSIC>, the "white screen of death" popped up 48 hours after she had it.  ACT I, SCENE III:  I took the player to my computer networking genius to see if he could figure it out.  After a day of trying to get Archos customer service (which we decided was a myth), trying to find a fix online and anywhere else we could, it was determined the unit was dead.  ACT I, SCENE IV: The only warm-fuzzy moment in this story was the return process back to Amazon.  We live in a rural area and returns to large electronic type stores require at least a 90 minute one-way drive.  Amazon reshipped the replacement unit, I downloaded the mailing label for the return and dropped it off at the UPS Store.  In and out in 60 seconds for the return!  Wally World can't even beat that.  ACT II, SCENE I: Replacement unit worked great...for the first 72 hours (I guess they're improving them).  Then &lt;KEY SCARY MUSIC AGAIN>, just like Freddy Krueger springs on his victims when they least expect it, the "white screen of death" attacked again and we were back to square one.  ACT II, SCENE II: Now daughter is bummed, dad is frustrated, and unit number 2 is lying worthless on the counter.  I don't know what she'll want to do now, but ACT III with an Archos isn't going to happen.    To say the least, I'm very disappointed with the product.  Archos doesn't list a telephone number where you can actually talk to someone about the problem, and I really don't know what they could say if you called them.  When the machine locks up, there's NOTHING anybody can do.  You can't reset; you can't format; you're just picked!  But, like the reviews say, the screen is larger so you can easily read the "white screen of death" while you poke the buttons and curse the unit.   Bottomline, for electronics in my book, it's 2 strikes and your out!

<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked into buying this product for several weeks before purchasing it, and I am so glad I did.  I take it everywhere with me.  Half external hard drive, half personal computer (limited functions of course), half MP3/video player (3 halves??? j/k).  Within two days of having mine and showing it off, my brother and several friends all purchased them as well. My brother ran into a small problem his not re-charging properly, however Amazon and Archos shipped out a replacement immediately.  The only problem I run into is of course battery life. Replaceable battery would be great also.  All in all, GREAT PURCHASE! Definitely Recommend.

<Title>So SO happy with this great product
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a fantastic product.  I've been waiting to buy an MP3/Portable Media Player for a while, and this was worth the wait. I am a techie person, so I can't stand the iPod/iTunes system to restrict what you can do with an iPod. I like using iPods, but they don't give you freedom like this device.  Top 10 things I like about this product: 1) 160 GB!!! I have all my photos (literally thousands), and all my music (about 4,000 songs), and 10 or so full DVD movies (VOB files) -- and it's still only half full!  2) Great price: You have to pay about $70 more for all the plug-ins to make this the ultimate media device, but even after paying for the extras, it still totally blows the iPod Touch away for value for money. 3) With the Video Podcast plug in it plays all the songs I have ripped from CD using iTunes (not songs I have bought through iTunes Store because of stupid DRM - just burn them and re-rip them and you're good to go). 4) With Cinema plug-in, I can use the freely downloaded software DVD Decrypter and rip VOB files off my DVDs, which then play PERFECTLY on the device. Plus with the optional DVR Station they even play back in 5.1 surround with my home cinema system! Sweet. 5) Web browser: Works perfectly. Now I can use Google Maps on a free WiFi  network if I get lost anywhere in the world! 6) Sound and video quality is amazing. 7) It's actually smaller than I expected. Fits in a coat pocket no problem. 8) Can use it as a USB mass storage device. So much better than an iPod! 9) With the free ArchosLink software I can subscribe to Podcasts easily. 10) Joy to use: I love the look, and the user interface. Easy touch screen and/or nav buttons. Need to add one more: 11) Plays EVERYTHING! Again, beats the iPod: With the plug-ins, it will play every media file type I've thrown at it: WMA/MP3/M4A/MP4/VOB/MOV/AAC etc etc!  Only cons for me: 1) Battery life could be a little better - but it's still acceptable. 2) Very slow to charge over USB. I am getting the DVR station for Christmas, which apparently charges faster.  Summary:  I wish Archos had the marketing muscle to steal some market share from Apple. This is SO MUCH BETTER than an iPod, but the world is fooled by dancing silhouettes wearing white earphones and other marketing hype. Be a rebel: Buy this instead of your next iPod, it's 10 times better, and has 10 times the storage space of an iPod Touch!

<Title>Great player with a few minor issues
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Archos for about two weeks at this point and was impressed enough to write a brief review. I may have more to add at some future time.  First, the capacity is huge, at 160 gig. To provide some perspective, that is 40 gig more than the Panasonic DVD burner with a 120 gig hard drive that I bought several years ago, which was an $800 unit at the time, and the size of a typical VCR player. By contrast, the 605 is about the size of a large wallet and will fit in your pocket. In terms of capacity there's no comparison to the bigger iPODs at 30 and 80 gigs.  Great screen, very bright,  clear, and sharp, probably the best of any handheld multimedia player out there.   Very nice user interface. You can disregard the comments by people who say it's clunky or not attractive or hard to use. The touch screen is very intuitive and easy to use, and if you're hands are grubby and you don't want to use the tip of your finger or don't have your stylus, the control buttons on the right side of the unit are perfectly fine and easy to learn also.  Lots of connectivity power. The optional DVD docking station allows you to hook it up to your TV and use it as a TIVO unit.   The remote control is very convenient, and the small keyboard is, well, small, but still usable.   On the cons, there is no standard USB cable; the cable is proprietary and if you need to get another one, you'll probably have to get it from the ARchos website. My cable crapped out after only a week, but there's a workaround in that I could hook up the DVD docking station and do it that way, it's just less convenient.   The battery capacity is limited. It's only a few hours, comparable to the first-generation small cell phones. However, there is an extended battery pack that you can buy to provide longer capacity.  It has web browser capability but it's based on Opera, a third party browser that most people probably aren't familiar with. I used it on my PC so I know it and like it because it's faster than IE on slow internet connections. But be aware it takes some getting used to if you don't know it. Also, you have to pay about $30 for it, and for a $500 unit something like that ought to be free.  The unit has Wifi, which is pretty cool, something I don't need, but you get it anyway.   So far I'm very satisfied with it and can recommend it to anyone wanting a top of the line multimedia viewer with a lot of capacity and power. If it weren't for the cable issue and problem, and the limited battery life,  I'd give it four and a half stars.

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Was originally concerned by some reviews that mentioned the interface is sub par. To my pleasant surprise, I actually liked the interface. Drag and drop is a VERY nice feature to have. I use this mainly as just an mp3 player. Even tough it is bigger than an ipods, it is much better for a few reasons: 1. touch screen with 160gb... ipods you could get touch screen and 16gb or no touch screen and 160gb 2. true drag and drop (don't have to use itunes! YAY!) Can use windows media player if you want instead. 3. wifi anyone? Just archos has this 4. extremely competitive price for the feature set 5. don't have to re-encode every movie to work on it. 6. 800x480 res  It is bigger an an ipod, but as a female i can't fit an mp3 player in my pockets anyways. I am so much more happy with this device than any ipods, and I have owned 2 ipods.

<Title>An excellent personal media player.
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am really a big fan of my Archos 605. The 800x480 LCD touchscreen was my main reason for purchasing -- 4.3 inches is at the high end for a PMP, no doubt, but the pixel resolution is what really grabbed my attention. If you  have video with subtitles or important text, that difference in resolution can be the difference between legibility and an unreadable garble. Comparatively, the iPod Touch's (in my opinion, the nearest competitor) 3.5 inch 480 x 320 screen just didn't measure up.   The web browsing is excellent, and I am particularly impressed by its ability to play YouTube/Google Video flash videos at full screen resolution. The only downside is that there's only two levels of zoom on webpages, where I understand that the iPod touch has several levels of zoom. Even so, both zoom levels are plenty legible for me thanks to the high resolution, and I don't have the best vision. And of course the  Opera web browser is far superior to Apple's Safari, which is mandatory on the iPod Touch.   Further to that, the Archos supports Opera Widgets, which are little programs available for free online that do all sorts of things, from paint programs to calendar/scheduling applications.  This isn't to say there are no downsides -- the battery life isn't what it could be, and the included USB charger charges painfully slow. This is  mitigated if you get the battery dock accessory which gives you extra life, or just the mini-dock with AC adapter so you can charge faster. These portable docks also add a USB port to connect flash drives directly to the Archos with no need for a computer, or play video from the Archos on your TV. Even so, these drawbacks aren't enough to stop me from giving the Archos 605 WiFi five stars.

<Title>Simply put: The Best of the rest!!!!
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hi Everybody,  For a long time, i've been an Apple customer for almost all the gadgets they sell, iPod Hifi speakers, iPods from the Mini to the 5.5 generation, i ow a Macbook Pro, and an AppleTV. so my review is from that perspective.  I got angry with apple when they released the 6th generation of iPods, they used  to be practical, fun to use and very original, reminds me that "Think Different" campaign but, since they used a crappy software which it's not as stable as it used to be and even worst, when they added that proprietary "chip" video output i decided to look for alternatives because from my humble point of view, Apple is loosing the focus and now they "Think the Same" as everybody else on the consumer market. they're not different anymore.  I bought an AppleTV (160gb version) directly from an Apple store in Las Vegas and got very disappointed with it. I'm a laptop person, i don't use desktop computers and laptops has not the size of HD the desktops have so the AppleTV seemed to be an spectacular solution to my dilema: All my media files are eating up all my laptop hard drive. but it solved nothing, you have to have all the media on your iTunes as well as on your AppleTV because it only works with Sync so if you delete a file from your computer, you delete the file on your AppleTV.  Well, i kept looking and found some pages that tries to compensate the lack of functionality of the product adding things without any support, they call this "Hacks". i decided to get rid of the beautiful thing just because it's impractical but i still needed something that could do the Job.  Then, this one appeared, Archos, what the hell is that? where does it comes from? What's that ugly name that sounds more like a kitchen appliance than an electronics company? i still don't know who they are or where they come from but i do know how spectacular this product is.  First of all, if you buy the additional DVR station and additional codecs and you get All that apple TV does and more without the hasle.  - You connect the 605 to your computer (a mac in my case) and it just becomes an external drive where you drop the files and you're done. -You can take it with you to watch movies or listen to music, i particularly use it for movies and music videos. - When at home, just plug it into the DVR station and you can use it as a Tivo box... you can record your favorite programs, edit to take the commercials off your records, watch or hear what's on your 605.  The integrated screen it's better than the one on the iPod touch by far, not to mention storage capacity which compares with the iPod Classic (160gb) but the iPod's screen size it's not really for video.  The interface it's very intuitive, it's not like the apple's iPod Touch which is better but very easy to use as well  If you need a DVR like a Tivo that can become a DMP (digital media player) this is the one, i can't tell you how satisfied i'm with this thing.  Just be aware that you need to buy at least the two codecs packs that rise the cost by $40 both and the DVR and the Web browser  making the hole set price to rise up to about $520 but i really think it worths it.  It's like having an enchanced AppleTV, a Tivo AND in some sort of way, iPod, all in one.  Hope this helps  PP

<Content>I upgraded from the Archos 504 160GB to the 605 160GB - massive improvement and I'm glad I upgraded. The screen and resolution are fantastic, the wifi and web browser allows me to view youtube videos in bed when I'm not quite ready to asleep. The buttons don't feel as sturdy as the 504 but with the 605's touch screen, I don't think I'll be using the buttons very often. I have an issue with the case that was included for the device - a piece of garbage considering the case is expected to protect a $400+ device. Get it, you'll love it.

<Title>The Bar Is Raised on Mobile Video
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I'll probably never use this as an MP3 player (I have smaller devices for that), it makes one nice video player.  I've been playing with one for a little while and here are my impressions thus far:  Positives:  1)  The video.  Wow!!!  I doubt there is anything this clean and crisp out there that is this small and portable.  The video looks fantastic and I've yet to have any hardware lag while viewing it. 2)  160GB.  That is massive and just the right size for carrying around video. 3)  Intuitive user interface.  I've got a Zune for my mp3's and I often find that complicated (and irritating) to navigate around but this is quite easy to figure out.  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to get this to work the way you want it to.  Navigating around a movie is fantastic as well because it is so easy to pause, fast forward, or do anything else you would want to do on a video player. 4)  Responsive Touch-Screen.  Using the touch screen was quite easy... I don't think I even touched the buttons on the side much.  I had no problem even though I've got some thick fingers. 5)  Sound quality.  This thing sounds great some with nice earphones.  I can see why some might use it as an mp3 player as well.  It sounds awesome!  Negatives:  1)  No standard USB Connection on the device?  Come on, if you are going to be this large then give us a standard USB interface, please.  For one, it is smaller than this ending.  Also, if we are near a computer we can use the USB to charge it without having to carry the proprietary cable around.  USB is just sooooo... universal... I'm flabbergasted anytime somebody doesn't include a USB connection. 2)  Battery.  First, this isn't removable so you can't carry a spare pack around.  But it doesn't last that long when playing video.  This wouldn't be too much of a concern if it had a USB connection because there is always a way to charge it that way.  But if the battery doesn't last as long as a laptop... there isn't much point. 3)  Browser is not good.  You can download video from Youtube and a few other sites but you can't just get out on the web and grab stuff.  I've read you can buy a browser to do this, but something decent should have come with the device.  If you are going to have Wi-Fi, why not make it as functional as possible?  So, if you are willing to shell out the cash this is an excellent device for video.  I'd have other preferences for music but this is quite capable of handling that as well.

<Content>this is my third media player (zen vision M, broke, Vision W, gave to a friend) now this.. it is by far my fav! i like how i can add and remove from my archos via wifi...  you can move files around on the device itself! you can download things from the web, and transfer them to your PC when you get home! exe's zips etc... you can view PDFs and txt files on the unit itself! slick... buying plugsin was easy as pie! took me two seconds!! (usa here) i do not like the proprietary USB though.. why couldn't they have just put a USB mini on it?? battery isn't so hot, dies faster than the W... the screen isn't quite as nice either... i love how you can chose to either charge, or connect/charge when you plug it into your computer.. very smart...  wish there was a little more volume in it, not as loud as my vision W was...   negative: volume is low(er, than my W) proprietary USB screen quality, not bad, but not as nice as the vision W  pluses: everything else! wifi, touchscreen, easy to add music to, re-arrange music.. dont need proprietary software, ie IPOD, CREATIVE lets you chose MTC or UMS protocol

<Title>Problems across the board
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really looked forward to getting this-- even after I got strung along by Amazon on my pre-order. When it finally arrived, my unit had a horrible problem with static during playback that their tech staff blamed on software, but couldn't figure out. I got a replacement; same problem. Only by then they had updated the firmware I could download, which fixed the problem. The original firmware, apparently, was outdated before the first shipment went out, and none of the tech staff knew about it. Then the shortcomings started to appear. This isn't really designed to be an audio player-- it's too bulky, there's no way to attach it to you, and it seems a little fragile. So as a video player/recorder, you'd think it would play a multitude of files. It doesn't, not until you pay extra for the plug in (honestly, it doesn't even play the two file types it advertises; only certain versions/qualities of those file types). The wifi is a great idea. But you'll have to pay extra for it. As packaged, you can only re-charge the battery from your computer by USB, which is painfully slow (4-5 hours). So you've got to dish out more money for a charger. Want to record video (as advertised)? You have to buy the $100 adapter. When you buy, you think the case won't matter, but after you see the large screen with the controls around the edge, you realize you really want something that will actually protect the unit. More money. Expect to pay $80 to $300 more than the unit to get it to work the way you want. Reviews from the pros tend to be good because they get a pre-tested, tricked-out model from the company with all of the features working. In addition, I've found the volume output is low, and I've yet to get more than 9 hours of audio playback. The unit will lose battery power rather quickly while "sleeping", and I suspect it loses some when "Off" as well. Go figure.

<Title>Great device...the plugins are lacking and DVR Station is a joke
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a sweet device...haven't found anything about the device...except the non-standard USB connection that I don't like.  However, the cinema plugin that allows you to play DVD VOB files directly works great on the device, but lacks a LOT when you export it to a tv...the music is jumpy and the video is "wavy" for lack of a better term.  The DVR station is a joke.  Without a demodulator...it can't control which station it is on...so if I am passing the video through a VCR or a Cable box...I have to make sure the it is ON and on the right channel or when the 605 goes to record...or it won't record the right program.  So what if in the middle of the night I want to record two shows on different stations...I'm out of luck unless I set my alarm for 5am and get up to change the channel on the VCR...this is so fundamental...why hasn't Archos thought of this...maybe they have and this is their way of pushing purchases through their content portal?  The shoddy Vob playing on tv is the most annoying....to make me pay more for a plugin that doesn't function right really peaves me.  The unit is great...but don't let your expectations get too high when it comes to recording tv shows and such...it lacks some here.

<Content>This is awesome.  It can play everything and is sweet.  They kinda jack you and make you buy the DVR and extra software add ons like the web browser and mpeg2 plugin, but if you have enough money to buy this thing that shouldn't be too big of a problem.  Anyway, highly reccommend this to anyone who has a job with downtime because it can easily keep you entertained.

<Title>ARCHOS TECH SUPPORT (F)- NO STARS
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>2 days and wont turn on.  I was thinking of having it replaced until I spoke with the unhelpful and rude archos tech support manager!! specifically(Katy A #7920).  Its amazing how people with no people skills attain these positions in customer service.   Amazon is giving me a refund.  So no problem. However.   Dont buy the plugins unless you understand the NO REFUND TOO BAD POLICY!!  Katy just laughs at you. She wont transfer you to her BOSS!!?  I think the company will be suprised when the chargeback clears.  I know that Fry's stop selling these because of the horrible customer support.  Lets hope Amazon does.  ARCHOS GO UNDER

<Title>Good Product, but Customer Service is a Joke
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I had originally purchased a 604, but it was defective and I returned it for a 605. I only had the 604 for 2 days before I returned it, but I purchased the cinema plug-in for it. I called Archo's sales and they said they could refund the charge if I purchased the plug-in for my new 605 Archo's, which I did while I was on the phone with the customer service rep. They sent me an email confirming the refund and said I should see it in about 2-3 days. After about 2 weeks I never saw the credit. I called them today and they told me that it was a mistake and they could not refund me the 19.99. I told them about the email and she said she already saw it, but told me too bad because the original rep made a mistake.  They told me they will not refund a plug under any circumstances.  I called Visa and disputed the charge.  Visa made a judgment in my favor without me even filling out any paperwork while I was on the phone with them. That tells me they must have dealt with the company before because normally would want you to fill out a dispute form.  I like my Archo's, but it upsets me to own a product knowing how they treat customers.  Chad

<Title>where is it?
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had this on order from Amazon for over a month. Tried to be patient and was looking forward to the slight price break - cheaper than Archos, and a discount when ordered along with the docking station. Well, the docking station arrived within a week, and a month later, started to get the e-mails from Amazon about changes in delivery dates. The first one actually said I could expec it sooner. Then they became more frequent and further away - til the last one that said March of 2008 - you've got to be kidding me!!!!!!!  Canceled the order - ordered direct from Archos - less than a week and it's in mid-shipment - due to arrive tomorrow - yeah.  Hate to blame Amazon for Archos not giving them adequate supply, but something isn't right about their working relationship!!!  Will post more after I've put it through the ringers!!!!!!!!
