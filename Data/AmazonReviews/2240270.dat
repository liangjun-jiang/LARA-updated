<Title>How to get it working again!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>True, this little guy freezes from time to time when you forget to dismount it properly (NOT creatives fault!). It's pretty easy to reformat if you people who say it's 'broken' used LINUX and not windows! Simple as that guys - no need to bother with with wasting your money on repair costs. Unbelievable.

<Title>Really Nice To Have
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has been working great for me. The headphones aren't the best so it sounds a whole lot better with good ones. Once the USB stick has been formatted on a Windows machine, files (audio or other) are easily transferred using a Mac in OSX. Having the removable USB stick to transfer files between computers is a huge bonus.

<Title>Great little mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the MuVo 64mb mp3 player. I actually got it through bartering on craigslist. I must say that I am VERY pleased. It's great that I now have a removable usb stick and the playback sounds absolutely incredible. It has surpassed my expectation. It is very simple to load songs/files onto. I can store about 13 songs on the 64mb version. :) Great for students, at the gym, while commuting (metro only hehehee), and just walking around town while shopping.

<Content>Long battery life, apprently indestructible, no moving parts, no display, drag and drop, totally unsophisticated but WORKS to hold a cvouple oif hours of songs for workouts, etc.  No playlists, but I simply plug it in to my USB port and replace the songs with new ones every few days. AAA batteries can be bought anywhere.  Of course you cannot compare this with a fuill-featured player, but for what it is it ROCKS!

<Title>Very nice MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my very first MP3 player I purchased few years ago. In two words, I just love this little thing. I visited my country taking it with me, droped it several times and nothing happened to this little machine. I had only one trouble in Athens (Greece), when I could not turn it on, but after Creative sent me an e-mail telling me what to do, voila, my Muvo is back working again. It needed a firmware ...  Yesterday, I ordered from Amazon, another MP player, this time I got me a bigger one. I am getting the Creative MuVo N200 512MB, plenty of music for me since my other one (64MB) is holding only 10 to 12 songs.  Now, if you wish to get a very small gadget that plays good music, I strongly suggest you get a Creative product, I do like them.

<Title>Great for Third World Travel
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this simple little player for third world travel.  Without having any bells and whistles, the batteries last a long time, which is important when traveling in areas where these might be hard to come by.  The simplicity of the controls makes it easy to use at night.  Its small size and its simple exterior allowed me to travel confidently without the fear that strangers in the bus stand thought I was holding something valuable.  I would recommend this player as an alternative to your Ipod for rugged travels.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When this device worked, it was great.  Small, could go running with it, and I remember excellent audio clarity.  But every once in a while it wouldn't work.  And I could never figure out why.  80% of the time worked great.  20% of time it really pissed me off.  A year later it seems to have completely stopped working.  Would probably have given a 5 if the player was more solid and tech difficulties/bugs had been worked out.

<Title>Very Unreliable
<Date>Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Like a few other people here, I'm having the auto-lobotomization problem big time. I had to do the hard reformat every other day or so, and it's presently not working at all.<p>Oddly enough, I got a 64 meg model as a gift after buying the 128 meg model. The 128 meg model worked fine when plugged into the 64 meg battery pack. Then they both stopped working at all. <p>I think Creative is very close to having a winner here. Using the thing when it works is a dream -- no goofy programs to load the device (which always seem to break or refuse to see the target). The fact that some people love it while others hate it make me suspect that they've got a really nasty QC problem in the assembly line.

<Title>Great product, but defective....
<Date>Sun Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I loved my MuVo, it's awesome. But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars.

<Title>The Simplest MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I received my MuVo 64 last week--no problems whatsoever. (My OS is Windows XP.)  This is the first MP3 player I've ever owned, so I'm not an expert nor do I miss the extras most of the other players have, such as the LCD screen. It couldn't be easier to use: separate the removable media from the battery pack, plug it into the USB port, drag &amp; drop your files, then eject the removable media. I bought mine primarily as an exercise buddy-makes my treadmill time go a little faster. Since these sessions generally last just 30-45 minutes, I don't need a large capacity player. The cord that enables me to hang the MuVo around my neck is a real plus; it's so lightweight (approximately 1 oz.) I hardly know it's there. The earbuds sounded OK, but a set of normal headphones (for ex, the headphones that came with my Walkman) proved to be a lot more comfortable. The only reasons for my not giving it 5 stars are (1) the earbuds, and (2) the need to press the play button for a few seconds to power up/down (I initially thought it was broken because of this).  Nevertheless, I love the size, weight, and sound of this gadget. A definite recommend for someone who wants an easy-to-use player and not looking for the extra features-a great exercise companion!

<Title>Great MP3 player with bonus portable storage feature!
<Date>Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After reading various reviews, professional and these user reviews, I knew this was the device for me. I was not disappointed. I was loading MP3s on it three minutes after opening the pacakage. <p>I am running XP home edition and had no problems getting it to recognize as a removable hard drive. Beautiful.<p>I mainly use mine to listen to music while jogging. You definitely need to get rid of the included earbuds. I threw mine into the trash after listening to the poor quality. Sound quality is great with my Sony earphones. Good bass as well.<p>If you are looking for a great no-frills MP3 player with removoable-storage capability this is the product for you. The reverse is true also. Both functions work great on XP and my Win2K system at work.<p>I agree with everyone that they definitely need to release some kind of armband for us joggers. Its annoying to have to carry in your hand and I don't trust the included lanyard.

<Title>nice job
<Date>Sun Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo 128 MB for my workouts and traveling. While I am optimistic about the traveling capabilities, I already enjoy this tiny device, which can hold 2 CDs in good quality, or up to 5, if you squeeze hard, for workouts and during work. The minimalistic user-interface appeals to me. The MuVo also works with NiMH AAA rechargables. <br>There are a couple of minor things: The sound is bass emphasized, which is not a problem with any earbuds, but becomes an issue when connecting it to the car or other stereos. Connecting to line-in, you have to max-up the volume. The earbuds that come with it sit really bad - they stay at most five seconds in my ears, and won't do for workouts; quick fixes available at your local CC or BB stores. Though I am able see the files in Linux, I haven't found a solution to employ Linux to move files onto it. And there are strange lapses in music, after it was accidentally getting a sometimes not completely avoidable discharge of statics and gym sweat humidity. <br>Still, for giving me *my* music commercial free in such a small housing for hours, and the ease of use, I rate it five stars. And it also transports regular files.

<Title>Perfect Product for the Right Consumer
<Date>Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3/WMA player by Creative Labs is just plain awesome.  True, it doesn't have an LCD screen, a clock, an FM tuner, or a built in stop watch; however, in exchange for these &quot;features&quot; what you do get is simplicity, ease of use, incredibly long battery life (12 hours on a AAA), unbelievable size and tremendous flexibility.<p>This device is so much more than just a portable MP3 player.  It is a hybrid portable storage device that can be used to transfer any file type from one computer to another.  In addition, it plays both MP3 as well as WMA formats.  I have found this to be a very important feature because of the relatively small size of WMA files.  The 64 MB model will easily hold 25-30 songs in WMA format.<p>If I had to sum this player up in two words it would be . . . wonderful simplicity.  I had this player out of the box, installed, and loaded with songs ready to go to the gym in five minutes.  (NO Exaggeration) There is no tricky software to learn or installation headaches to worry about.  You simply plug it into your USB port and then drag and drop the music files you want from your hard drive.  (I am running Windows XP; however, software is included in the box for Windows 98 users.)<p>The bottom line is that different people want vastly different things.  If you are looking for fancy menus, jog dials, and a lot of battery-draining bells and whistles, then look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for the simplest, smallest, lightest player on the market to take to the gym and to work that doubles as a really cool file storage device then look no further.  This is absolutely the product to buy.  I highly recommend it!!

After contacting customer service multiple times about a warranty item, I talked to one of their techs,   who said that they estimate 10% product failure on their products.

<Title>Small and easy to use.
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was impressed with this mp3 player for several reasons. First off, it is easily the smallest mp3 player I have ever seen in my life. My previous mp3 player was a Samsung Mini Yepp. That model which is small enough is relatively huge compared with the Nomad MuVo. Second, the functionality is quite ingenious. NO SOFTWARE is required for XP users. You simply pull the white part from the blue part and stick it into a USB port. And the transfer rate is pretty damned fast. It took me less than a couple of minutes to get the player out of the box and ready to go. Unless you like bulkiness, or need expandable memory slots for your 1000 mp3's, this is definitely a great deal.

<Title>Great for music lover and excellent for external data storag
<Date>Thu Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This MP3 Player is really an innovative stuff from Cerative NoMad. NoMad is one of the leaders in MP3 music player. The design really catched me at the first time. It is so small and very convenient to carry anywhere. Then I learned another feature of it. This is extremely attractive. You can use it as a external storage device to transfer any files you want to any computer which uses Window 98SE and above. <p>Nomad MuVO is not only MP3 player. You can use it just like Thumb drive or Sony Micorvalve. When compare with the price per Mb, MuVo is far better than their competitors because it can be an MP3 player too. <p>The design of it is quite simple and easy to use. One thing don't like about it is the lack of LCD screen. You will not have any information about the songs. <p>Bottom line, this Nomad Muvo is very convenient for student or businesspersons who love music and want to carry music with them, and transfer files for friends or colleaques. With its light weight and very handy, you can carry it with you everywhere all the time. Only drawbacks that I can see with this product right now are the use of AAA battery (instead of rechargable battery) and unability to upgrade (unless you buy another higher capacity stick, but now it is only available on 64 Mb). This is only the first step and first model of MuVo. I am pretty sure that they will come up with the new model that eliminates the drawbacks I have said in the near future.

<Title>Muvo could have been a real win
<Date>Mon Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>After I wrote this review, I discovered major problems with my Muvo and also a replacement unit: memory corruption that leaves the Muvo dead or files mangled.  <p>You can restore the unit with a special recovery mode hard format with their windows only utility, but this is not documented in their meager documentation.  I found that this was needed every day or two with the units I had.  Since I purchased it for file storage also I returned them both.  <p>That aside after using a Muvo for a couple of weeks, I found: <p>* the lack of a resume where you left off feature to be a major problem (four hours of music in a 128MB unit and you have to keep listening to the first half hour over and over ...).  <p>* you have to reformat and load all files in correct order if you want to control the play order. <p>My original review follows:<p>Rather than the 64, the Muvo 128 makes for a better value.<p>I've upgraded from one of the original Rio 300's so having 121 MB of memory to play with is a blast. Not being locked in to Windows was a big motivation for wanting a device with standard USB storage, plus there's plenty of room to keep your crypto keys and other files. <p>* Windows 2k shows about 121MB (not 128) free on my unit to start. There is a windows specific program for formating the drive. I suspect it puts a copy of the system software in the flash memory somewhere in the missing space. If so then it should be possible to update the firmware on the device a real plus. <p>* The player doesn't play files placed in a subdirectory. Your mp3 files need to be in the root directory. The play order seems to be the physical storage order on the flash memory disk - not alphabetical. <p>* The sound quality sounds great especially with my Sony Fontopia EX70LP ear buds - occasionally almost too much bass. The headphones shipped with the Muvo belong in the back of your bottom drawer. <p>* The unit feels solid and well made in spite of its small size and weight.

<Title>excellent product, but know what you want
<Date>Wed Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have owned 4 portable MP3 players and have found that the key is finding the product that matches your intended use / priority list. This player's strenghts are: very small form-factor; simplified operation; no drivers reqd for most OS'es; good dynamic range and bass output with low distortion (like most, the supplied earbuds leave a lot to be desired so plan on using another set of headphones); added functionality of a portable storage device; very good maximum volume level; very good battery life. This product is not: a feature-rich toy with a cool display and a lot of gimmicky features; expandable; versatile in the way you can bring it with you.<p>The player looks like a slightly oversized disposable lighter and leaves few options for you to clip it on or attach it. BUT, it is extremely small and the few buttons and features it has are very well thought out. There are no EQ settings and the factory settings are slightly bass-heavy but pleasing for rock and popular music. <p>I use this unit primarily while exercising and find its simplicity, small size and big clean sound, perfect for gym duty or on the trails.

<Title>Muvo reconsidered
<Date>Sun Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've now had some experience with my second Muvo and found that both units: <p>* will not play some .wma files that MS Media Player and MusicMatch will play - the Muvos power themselves down at the same spots. <p>* Both Muvos have shown signs of corrupting their flash memory - the common one being self labotomization: the flash area with files may look ok, but the Muvo will no longer power on. You must go through a special hard format procedure that restores the Muvo firmware and hard formats the flash memory. <p>Finally there is a major misfeature in the Muvo. When powered off the Muvo always returns to the first song. With no random play function this means that you will listen to the first 30 min to 1 hour of music over and over again unless you do a lot of button pressing. <p>I think the Muvo is a great idea, but the execution and quality should rule it out for now.

<Title>Serves a niche...
<Date>Sun Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I use mp3 exclusively for audio books and text to speech stuff. Therefore the lack of a &quot;resume&quot; or infinite pause for that matter, make this unit inconvenient at times. Also, they need to get the hint: NOBODY LIKES YOUR EARBUD DESIGN. I don't want to swap earwax with someone and share a set of assymetrical earbuds, so JUST STOP. The first thing I did when I unpacked the unit was to plug in my RCA earbuds in its place. MUCH better. Next was to put a keychain clip on the unit. (I took the twisting one from a cheap keychain laser and it works great.)<p>The big improvement of this player over my old one is the fact I don't have to burn a CD to listen to a quick web download, VERY NICE. Also, it is small enought that you can wear it for hours and forget you have it on. The lack of an LCD screen is not really a problem, becauseI figured it was new and they would add them to later models. The unit also seems pretty rugged.<p>In order to recover the use of the unit, you may have to run SCANDISK and defrag every once in awhile. Slightly annoying, but at least you don't have to use the crummy software that comes with it. Just treat it like a portable USB device and drag and drop your files, or the VERY useful &quot;send to E:&quot; via right mouse click command.<p>All in all, I like this product, but hopefully the newer models will address this one's shortcomings.<p>(Did I mention that NO ONE LIKES THE EARBUDS???.)<p>Thanks.

<Content>I bought this player when it first came out a bit more than a year ago. I took it with me on a 4 month trip to Nepal and Tibet. I dropped it, sat on it, dropped it some more, and the little trooper never gave it. It doesn't have any shuffle feature, and the memory could be bigger, but this is one hell of a resilient little bugger. The only reason I don?t have it is that I gave to a Nepali guy as a thank you gift for letting me stay with his family for 5 weeks. I just bought one of the new 256mb models with a screen. We'll see. It'll take a good showing to beat the usage I got outta the last one.

<Content>I've had mine (64mb version) for about 2 years, and haven't had a single problem with it. It's very small (I quit smoking years ago, but if memory serves, it's a little smaller than a bic lighter), but because of it's size, you obviously can't sort, or view file names.   Loading the software was easy, and glitch free, and there isn't any complicated interface to work with; you just plug it in to the usb port, and drag/drop your files on to the hard drive icon that shows up after it's been plugged in.  It does exactly what it says it does, nothing more, nothing less.

<Title>Not the most reliable player
<Date>Tue Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love my MuVo, I've had it for over a year.  I got it from a friend who said it was suffering from the same problems as most reviews here list.  Creative Support was no help, so I installed everything from Creative's site, used their music organization software to reformat the player, and it's worked fine ever since.  I've been moving files on and off on a daily basis, used it with 5 different computers with not one problem since.  This thing gets beat around in my pocket with my keys, I've dropped it, washed it, pulled it out of the computer without stopping it properly, got it dirty, almost every way I could possibly break it, and no problems yet.  However, judging from the reviews here the quality of these players is very inconsistant, either they'll break after a couple months or keep going forever...  Also, Creative desperatly needs to work on its Customer Service. I haven't found any problems with the playlist restarting when I turn it off or unplug it from the battery.  It does restart when you format the player, but I would think that's expected.  Sometimes when you skip through tracks, the player will cut off the first half-second or so, but it's not a huge problem.  I also think the A-B repeat function is pretty useless, a random play button would be a much better idea.  I'm impressed with the durability of this little player, but it seems I am in the minority.  As to the storage, 128megs is about 4 1/2 hours at WMA 64k, which is what Creative's software converts MP3s to with its "SmartFit" program.  The battery life isn't exceptional, the battery lasts about 2 hours at most with standard Duracells.  Using higher capacity batteries may get you better results.  Overall, a good player if you can get one that works well, so I'd reccomend getting a little more reliable player.

<Title>Poor battery life
<Date>Thu Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>2.5 stars really. Not a bad player but there are better ones out there. The 128Mb gives a reasonable no. of songs but recording at low res makes for disappointing playback. Using alkaline batteries this unit has no where near the 12 hours it claims. It is a handy USB drive however and that part of it has helped me out in many urgent work situations.

<Title>Just what you need, but not much more than that.
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It doesnt have a display, which was my only concern. Once I got it though, I found that I could careless. Im to busy listening to music and forwarding and rewinding tracks are just a button push away. Synch went great with windows media player 10 (xpsp2 also installed). No problems what so ever, I went from taking it out of the package to walking out my door listening to music within about 20-30 minutes. MOst that time was spent realizing I had to "synch" not burn onto the Nomad.(im a goof). I used it all night and worked great. Only draw back that the earbuds wont stay in my ears. Could be just me but I ordered some new headphones anyway so not a problem for me. Bottome line, if what you want is a dependable MP3 player to strap on and listen to music, this player does just that without breaking your bank account.

<Title>Remarkable machine, 100% Macintosh compatible!
<Date>Tue Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a remarkable machine.  It is tiny, magnificently designed and so easy to use, it defies the imagination.  Why other companies are not using a similar approach is a mystery to me.  I want to emphasize that this is 100% Macintosh compatible!  No one is saying this, but all you do is open the box, put in a AAA battery and plug the little guy into a USB port.  In 1 second you will see a new drive called "Untitled" on your desktop.  Open up your iTunes or other MP3 program and just drag the songs you want onto the new drive.  Then remove it and you are done!  No software, no upgrades, no cables no incompatibilities!  It's even easier to use than the venerable iPod (which is also excellent but larger, less portable and much more expensive).  I'm using it with OS X Jaguar as well as Win 2000 and it is a joy.  I also have a PowerPoint presentation stored on there so that I can carry it with me.  This is the future.  A perfect gift for anyone new to MP3s as there is simply no learning curve.  I can't say enough about this amazing product.

<Date>Mon Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I had such high hopes for this machine. I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product.

<Title>great sound! wonderfully versatile! So far, I love it!
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have had my Muvo for 5 weeks and absolutely adore it-- on the other hand I think I must be its perfect target audience. I mainly use it for going over a fairly small selection of choral music while I'm walking to/from work, so I don't need to be able to store too many songs (and do Love having the repeat button!)-- 128MB is usually enough. Also,I was looking for something as small and light as possible, without compromising the sound quality or battery life, and this definitely is it-- for the sake of the small size and great sound I'm willing to do without LCD, etc. And I love the ease of use. I have been using the file transfer features a lot more than I had expected to-- I can transfer large papers/presentations between home (win98), office(linux) and lab computers (XP) with no hassle at all. (The linux mount command is <p>mount /dev/sda1 /your_dir ; cd /your_dir<br> and<br>umount /your_dir<p> (I think) to unmount, if you are a linux newbie like me. Then you can just copy/move files around, treating it as just another directory.)  The only problem I have had so far is that when there is any static electricity around it seems to affect the player very adversely, sometimes even cutting off the signal entirely-- but this is only a problem when it's dry and I'm wearing fuzzy sweaters.I'm so happy with my muvo! <p>(On the other hand, if you are looking for a feature-packed mp3 playerwith 20GB memory, you will probably be unhappy with this. Get the archos jukebox, which a couple of my friends have and like a lot-- I was tempted, and it's only maybe a hundred bucks more, but it was just too heavy for me, and I don't actually need those fancy features.)

<Title>Works as Advertised... Great Sound... Small Size
<Date>Thu Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I use the MuVo at the gym and in the car. It is very easy to use, both getting music onto it and playing it. The buttons are big for a small player, and give a noticable click when you press them, so you can feel when you have activated a button for that &quot;I've got better things to look at&quot; style. It has a neat repeat function, you can repeat a song or any portion of your play list. It has a single light which flashes red, or glows steady red or green, depending of course on what it is telling you. The normal alkaline battery lasts at least the advertised 11 hours. Complaints: none. It is small and sounds great, and holds about two cds worth of your music. 5 stars.

<Content>I bougth my Muvo MP3 Player a few months after it came out and still own and use it.  It's pretty durable, I've dropped it several times and it still works.  I use it everday to listen to music as well as transfer files.  It's also very easy to use.  You just drag and drop the songs that you want, and it's played in order that you copied it, even though it list it alphabetically.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lock function as well as having to start from the beginning when you stop playing it.

<Title>Good value, but has some issues :
<Date>Wed Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have my 128mb Muvo for over a year. Here are some things to know about it:<p>1. Song playing order is set according to the order they were transferred to the muvo.<br>(And if a song is deleted, the next song copied to muvo will take it's place.) So the only way to set the song order to your liking is to copy the songs one at a time after formating.<br>2. The sound using the original headphones absolutely sucks! you must get headphones which emphasize bass. I recommend "Sennheiser MX400" which makes my muvo sound superb!<br>3. Muvo uses a hidden file called: SETTINGS.DAT<br>If it gets deleted (for instance by regular Windows formatting, instead of using the supplied formatting software) the device won't work! (I keep a copy of this file on my pc, and put a copy of it back on my muvo when ever I need too... but you can also restore the file using the supplied formatting software.)<br>So if all of the sudden your muvo buttons don't have any effect, now you know why....<br>4. File transfer is slow (USB1). It takes over 10 minutes to have your muvo filled up with 30 songs.<p>Still it's my favorite player do to it's size, versatility and great sound.<br>Bottom line - <br>Once you know what to expect, and you get to know your muvo - it's a very nice device!

<Title>Please read this review, it IS helpful
<Date>Tue Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, first of all if I could rate this 4 1/2 stars I would, mainly cuz its not perfect.  I ogt this for a Christmas present a few years ago and its worked great.  For of all, I would curse all of you people who gave this less than 4 stars but I'm going tyo qoute what my mother once told me, "Saying negative things never helps, it just makes the envirment more negative, and hardly ever fixes anything." So, that being said I'm not going to be nasty because what some of you did I might have done as well if my brother hadn't told me what was wrong.  My only real problem was I woke up one morning and it just, didn't work so I moped a while thinkling it was broken until I asked my brother if he knew how to fix it.  Appernetly there is a System.dat file in the mp3 player that if you delete (or don't delete, I'm not sure which) it will cause your mp3 player not to turn on.  So I went and did what mny brother told me (which was to delete the Sytem.dat file) and HALLELUJAH it worked again.  So if it won't turn on and you think its broken, look at the maual, do a web search and if all of that doesn't help, try what I did, (especially if you think itrs broken and were going to return it anyway).  SO for all of you out there who returned thers all you can do is think, " (...)WHY DIDN'T I TRY THAT?"  So, here are the pros and cons:<p>Pros:<br>Lightwieght<br>Stores bout 36 songs( which is nice for such a small player)<br>Small<br>Cheap<br>Durable<p>Cons:<br>Bad earphones<br>Have to hold the on/off button for 3 sec. to turn on or off<br>And without my brother I would be  Mp3 playerless and sad to know it wasn't really broken if I had returned it.<p>Overall:<br>My first Mp3 player and a nice one.  Reliable and nice for going to the gym jogging, or mowing the lawn (which is when I use it the most). (...) 1/2 (THATS FOUR AND A HALF STARS) oNCE AGAIN FROM  UPYOURARSE.

<Title>It just stopped working
<Date>Fri May 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the most compact and convenient MP3 player.  It runs on one AAA battery.  It's truly dummy proof.  You don't even need to install a driver...just plug it into a usb port then click and drag your music into the drive and you're in business.  You can even use it as an removable drive to transport any type of files (media, documents, etc).  <p>Having said all these positive things, here comes the BUT.  I loved this little guy, but it broke after only 2 weeks.  I bought it 1 1/2 years ago for about $120.  I didn't drop it or drown it.  It just stopped working.  I guess I shouldn't have disregarded all the other reviewers' caveats.  I traded it in for the 128MB RipFlash MP3 player/voice recorder. Although in retrospect, commuters like me who spend at least 2hrs daily on the subway should think in terms of GBs and not MBs.  Perhaps it's time for an upgrade.

<Content>I bought this unit and used it for about 2 hours for use while running and working in the yard.  Shortly thereafter, I broke my ankle and was unable to work in the yard or run, so had no use for it.  6 months after recovery, I plugged it into my USB port and it froze my computer.  I tried again and same thing.  I contacted Creative and they had me try some things to no avail.  Creative Labs wants me to cover shipping and a minimum of $20 in &quot;assessment&quot; costs + whatever costs to repair it.  UNBELIEVABLE.  This is a product known to have major issues and yet they want me to pay to fix it.  UNBELIEVABLE.  I will never buy a Creative Labs product ever again.  Be smart, avoid their trash.

<Title>Think: Flash Drive that just happens to support MP3/WMA
<Date>Tue Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The MuVo was my second choice player, having returned a Samsung Yepp YP30-SH model to Best Buy the day before. The latter has  better styling, features and display, but its atrocious digital rights management gave me a new appreciation for the MuVo.<p>Basically, the MuVo has none of that. It's a flash drive that just happens to play MP3's &amp; WMA files, and in a Spartan fashion at that. On the downside, of course there's no EQ controls or LCD display, volume level is just adequate, and it doesn't skip playback of incompatible files gracefully. The MuVo also occasionally clips the beginning or ending of songs, so consider adding a little padding when compressing your files.<p>On the plus side, its codecs have breadth; it supports a good variety of MP3 and Windows Media bitrates, which is an important thing that's almost never mentioned on the box. If the unit only had a built-in microphone, I'd give it five stars.<p>For reference, here's the test matrix I tried with the unit.<p>Windows Media 9 VBR100 1-Pass Lossless: No  (811Kbps)<br>Windows Media 9 393K VBR: No<br>Windows Media 9 192K VBR for Portables: No<br>Windows Media 9 96K 2-pass CBR: Yes<br>Windows Media 9 64K 2-pass CBR: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 6K Voice: No<br>Windows Media 8 20K Mono: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 32K Stereo: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 128K: Yes<br>Windows Media 8 160K: Yes<p>And a few unusual MP3 variations.

I have switched to MP3 to see if it<br>matters.  Anyway, unlike other small devices, I can put both WMA<br>and MP3 on the same space.  I have about 20 songs, really long<br>songs!!!  I have listed to most of the others and this by far sounds the best.  It's easy to drag and drop files. I have used both windows media player and creative labs play center. (I also<br>own the nomad 20gb 3).  Their firmware update now allows an icon for the MuVo.  This is really cool.  I can use up ALL the space on the MuVo becasue it tells me how much I got left.  I get nothing but compliments when people see it.  When I let them hear it, they are astounded.  Now I must say, I don't download mp3's cause I think the quality [stinks], but rip from my own collection.  I highly recomend this product.  Battery life is not as advertised but were talking aaa batteries, and not an issue when you compare what else is out there

<Title>Creative MuVo vs. Kanguru Micro MP3
<Date>Fri Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the MuVo and was very impressed with it all around.  Easy to use, light, and I could use the universal headset plug with other devices, like my stereo. I didn't mind there was no display on it. (No display on the Kanguru, either.) All the controls were easy to figure out. However, on the second day I had it, it broke and wouldn't turn back on. I returned it and got a comparable product, the KanguruMicro MP3 drive from Interactive Media Corp. <p>The Kanguru is a little more difficult to operate. For example, the volume and skip buttons are one and the same. It has a 2.5mm headphone plug, which can only be used with the included neck strap/earphones. (The earphones are part of the neck strap and don't come apart.)  The manual says there is a universal headset adapter, but I didn't get one, and tech support is a long distance number.<p>In Kanguru's favor, they do make a 256MB model, which Creative doesn't yet. It is easier to pull the cap off the Kanguru than the battery pack from the MuVo to plug in the USB. (Kanguru has a lithium-ion battery that charges off the USB port; MuVo uses AAA batteries.) Also, Kanguru has a neck strap and a clip, and the MuVo doesn't have any way to carry it. Although the MuVo being about 1/2 the thickness allows you to stuff it just about anywhere.<p>If you want more capacity and will be using the product as-is, you're fine with the Kanguru.  But if you want to use your own head phones and tote around an ultra-light USB drive/MP3 player, go with the Creative MuVo.

<Title>Fits the bill for ease and portability
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This the third MP3 player I have owned and the ease of file transfer is the best part of this unit.  Drag and drop files to the Muvo which appears as a drive on your computer.  It helps to have an accessible USB port or hub.  The battery life is good as well.  Only downside is lack of a display but you know what u downloaded. right?  Also, display sucks battery life.  Main problem is the wife keeps wanting to borrow it.

<Title>Broken
<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like many of the reviews, mine is broken too.  I received the player as a gift from my fiance and loved to use it when I was running.  Unfortunately for me, the device mysteriously stopped working after about a month.  Since I received it for Christmas and don't run much in the winter months, the warranty expired by the time I realized it was faulty.<p>I wanted to see if there was anything I could do and decided to call the manufacturer.  I could only find a long distance number for technical support, and when I called I was also told that it wasn't working properly because I did something wrong when installing the software - even though I had been using the device successfully for a month.  Then, I was told I could send it back to them for repair for $50.00 - a brand new one doesn't cost much more than that.<p>I would suggest that if you are considering buying this product, reconsider.

<Title>Finally an MP3 player that is easy to use
<Date>Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I tried two other players before I purchased this one.  The first one (Rio Sport 64MB) did not sound very good and the software it came with was bad.  The second one I tried was the Philips/Nike.  This one was way too complicated.  You had to go to the Philips website and download software to load the correct drivers for it to work. After doing that it still didn't work. I finally bought The Nomad Muvo 128.  It does not need software or a cable. All I did was use Windows Media Player to copy music from my CDs, create a playlist, plug in the Nomad to my usb port and transfer the playlist.  It was so simple.  I was able to get about 2 hours of music onto the player.  I did not have to do any type of conversion to mp3 files.  The sound is good too.  I have only had it for a few days.  So far so good.

<Title>A little too expensive for the features
<Date>Sun Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A friend gave me this as a gift, which I'm glad she did because I'm not sure if I'd want to pay for it<p>The good things about the player is that it's very simplistic.  It only has two pieces to it, so you don't have to worry abot a bunch of cables or anything.  You slide out the flash drive, plug it into your USB port, and start copying files to it directly from Windows Explorer, which recognizes it as an additional hard drive.  The player will hold around 15-18 mp3 songs encoded at 128kbps.  This is plenty for someone like me who only runs for 20-30 minutes.  It's also nice to have a flash drive that I can easily transfer files with. I have not experienced any effect of the player cutting off the first second of each song like another reviewer said.  Every song starts right up at the beginning.<p>The cons: AT first, I couldn't do anything with this device until I formatted it.  Windows would recognize it, but not let me remove or copy any files to it.  I tried it on several computers and could only listen to the songs already on it until I found the format software, but it works great now.  The player doesn't have an LCD screen, so you can't see what song is playing, although this isn't really a problem with only 64mb of storage space.  Another problem, is that it didn't come with the armband. You have to order it seperately from Creative.  For a portable MP3 player designed to be used with exercise, this is ridiculous.  For the price they should have thrown it in, or at least put a belt clip on it.  I have to wear shorts with pockets in them to carry it with me when I run.  I also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around.   The armband would have prevented all this.  The player does come with some earphones that suck and a neck loop that is great if you run in the woods or at night where no one can see what an idiot you look like.<p>The player also features a "loop" button that allows you to start recording a point in one of your songs, press a button, and it will loop the section you recorded over and over.  I have no idea what the point of this was, or why they wasted time with it.  As far as I can tell, it is completely useless.  <p>My biggest complaint is the battery life.  It holds one AAA battery.  This is nice for the compact size, but I would have rather it been slightly larger and held tow batteries.  I like my music up pretty loud, and my battery is dead after 45-60 minutes.   That is unacceptable. I've seen reviews that say the battery life lasts 12 hours at 60% volume.  I have never seen that. I have to buy batteries in bulk just to be able to use it.  What's more, the Muvo will actually drain amps from your battery when it's turned off. For the life of me I can't figure out why.  It's a flash drive, so there should be zero reason it needs to keep power up.  It is not very significant, but if you put a brand new battery in and don't turn it on at all, in about two months the battery will be dead from the drain.  WMA files also consume more battery usage than mp3 files.<p>The player also has a skip button that lets you skip tracks and fast forward, but it can act flaky on WMA files, and instead of seeking through a song, just skip right to the beginning.  There is also no repeat feature.  After the last song, you have to hit play again to restart it.  No random song feature either.<p>Although this player is pretty much outdated now, it would be a decent player.  I like the basic design and the controls are easy to use.  It's just not worth the current price, and it has too many flaws to use for serious athletes.

<Title>Great -- While it Works
<Date>Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great product while it works. It is compact, reliable, and easy to use (just drag your music files to the player as if it were a removable disk drive). <p>But beware: it WILL fail. I had three and all failed completely within a year -- one within two months. Once your player fails you are pretty much out of luck. Creative support is almost non-existent; but if you can track it down you will have to pay $20 to have them &quot;look at it&quot; and ultimately nearly $80 to replace it. In this product's defense, it could be pointed out that many MP3 players have a limited lifetime (e.g. even the iPod's batteries run down within a couple years and are costly or impossible to replace) so it could be argued that product failure is not in itself a reason to avoid this product (that's why it doesn't get just one star). But the MuVo just doesn't last long enough to be worth the price: two months of 128 Mb of music for $90 (or 64 Mb for $80) just doesn't compare with a year or more of many gigabytes for a couple hundred (even the overpriced Porsche of players, the iPod mini can he had for $250).

<Title>Does its job, but sure is flimsy...
<Date>Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this thing used.  Thus far, it's working fine.  <p>But, be warned that every thing about this Muvo is flimsy from the buttons, the casing, and even the battery cover. So if you're likely to drop things, DON'T GET IT.  There is no 'lock button' and the pause button easily gets set off by slight pressure - even by the wrinkle of your jeans.  I find this to be the most annoying thing.<p>Also annoying is the fact that once the player is shut off and then on again, the playlist resets to the first song.<p>I would not buy thing this at the retail cost.  There aren't enough options and it can hardly be called a quality piece of equipment.  Plus, there are far better options out there for less money.<p>If you happened to get it for cheap and are just looking for something to bring to the gym or listen to while jogging in the park, it'll do fine.

The only problem I have had is after about 3-4 hrs of play it will randomly shut off. I can turn it back on &amp; it will be fine for a few songs then shut off again. I placed a new battery in &amp; it was fine for awhile. I thought it was the player so I took it back &amp; got another one. It also does the same thing after about 3-4 hrs play. Not near the 10-12 hrs it said it can do. Other than that I really like it.

<Title>Send MuVo Back to the Design Lab
<Date>Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My MuVo died a premature death after an hour of use. Simply stopped working and had to be returned. Creative Labs "support" for this product was unresponsive-- no help from the live technical Rep or e-mail support. [Weak] customer support for troubleshooting product which can only mean that the product has known out-of-box first use issues and when it's DOA it stays that way.  Flimsy design and obvious commodity quality and/or firmware issues prevent the MuVo from achieving it's potential. In short, poorly executed product with horrible support from Creative Labs-- Recommend you buy something else from someone else who better understands how to design, manufacture and support consumer audio electronics.

<Title>A well designed minimalist MP3 player
<Date>Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the Nomad Muvo 128 as a gift and love it. While it's advertised to support the Windows platform only, I've been using it with ease with my Mac OSX iBook. You can drag and drop right out of iTunes to the Muvo, which couldn't be easier.<p>I've had no problems with the unit and with NiCad rechargeable batteries, I'd say the 12h playing time is an understatement. Sound quality is great, though the included headphones aren't much good. Plug it into a good quality pair (or your home stereo) and you'll immediately notice the great quality sound.<p>I'd give it a 5 except that the Muvo cannot remember where it left off each time you turn it off. When you turn it back on, it always restarts at the first song in your play list. The good news is that the Muvo's firmware is upgradeable, so Creative will be able to improve on it in the future. Fixing this issue and adding better mac support would get a 5-star rating out of me. [...]

<Date>Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My first unit failed within a few weeks of purchase. It would simply turn off after several minutes of play. When I'd turn it back on it would start back at the beginning of the playlist. I sent it in for warrantee repair, and after several weeks got a replacement (refurbished). Now I'm having the same problems occur and I'll have to send it back yet again. <br>Another issue I have with the player is that the buttons are much too small.

<Content>...BEST PLAYER FOR SERIOUS ATHLETES.  Do you run, lift, bike?  This player is the one for you.  Do yourself a favor and order the armband/belt clip from Creative America.  This $.. rubber exoskeleton for the MuVo has a wonderfull design and still make the total cost of the player $.. less than the Nike psa128.  I own both.  The MuVo wins hands down.  Lite, small, and easy to use.  I did have the problem that some have had with the sudden loss of ability to play mp3's but still function as a keychain drive.  THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL MP3 PLAYERS (similar problem happened with the nike).  I inadvertantly had the player in close proximity to my cell phone when it rang.  If you have ever had your phone next to your computer/monitor, you have seen what it can do.  There is no reason to believe that the MuVo is more succeptable to this than other players.  People may see this as a problem with MuVo because they can still make it function to transfer songs.  <p>If you enjoy small, simple players, that will not get in your way while working out....the MuVo is it!

<Content>My MuVo was also dead after about the 3rd time I used it. I got online and started doing research and found that many others were also having issues and I became concerned. So, I contacted Creative tech support and they helped me to resolve my issue. While this device boasts that it requires no additional software that's not exactly true. You must use their software to format the device. Also, I had to reset my MuVo by holding down the play button while inserting the unit into my PCs USB slot and continuing to hold it down for 10 seconds. Then, remove the unit, plug it back in and format it. Walla, good as new. Don't be afraid to try this product. I only wish it had a belt clip or arm band included.

I mostly use it when running and on long-haul plane travel, and it has stood up well so far. It's pretty good on battery use, too. I haven't tried it with WMA files yet, only music MP3s and various files as a USB drive.  UPDATE in August 2007: After 4 years the MuVo is still going great. Of course, the capacity has been pretty much eclipsed by more recent products, but it's still great for tunes when I'm working out. I tell people it's what the iPod Shuffle looked like before the design people got a hold of it....

<Title>Does the Job I Bought it For
<Date>Wed Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Nomad Muvo MP3 Player because I wanted a small, inexpensive player that could store enough music to get me through a ride on the Metro, an afternoon running errands or walking to class. In addition, I liked that it required no extra cables or software. The player has worked brilliantly in the first 6 months of use. The sound quality is pretty nice and the player could not be easier to use. <p>I have not experienced any of the problems commonly described in the reviews, and I suspect that those users probably treated the player with less care than I do. It is a very lightweight piece of equipment, and is therefore very damageable. Keep it in your pocket and you'll be fine -- but don't expect it to be able to handle heavy damage or drops.<p>The only complaint is the battery life. It sucks down a single AAA battery relatively quickly. The solution to this is a pack of rechargeable AAA batteries.

In fact I had such good luck that I ordered another one just like it so i could alternate tunes. <br>BIG MISTAKE. <br>The second one i bought, I left in it's packaging for a while, finally took it out, and plugged it into my computer (WIN 98). It crashed my computer! 4 Times! So I took it to work (WIN2K) where i was able to put my mp3 files on it, no problem. According to the computer, the memory stick had no problems or malfunctions. When I plugged it into the battery case - it would not turn on. I tested the battery case with the old one -- worked fine. I have never gotten this second one to work. Perhaps it is the buttons. Talk about a waste of money. I am hoping I can get a replacement from the manufacturer...

<Title>Do NOT Buy this!!!!!
<Date>Sat Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I loved the portability of this player. I didn't need a lot of extras, just something to listen to while running. I have never dropped mine. I have used it for about a total of 10 to 15 hours. It has sooo many bugs. It is very &quot;moody&quot;. Sometimes it works good, sometimes you have to reformat it to get it to work again. Not a very &quot;plug and play&quot; set up. Very high maintanence. I'm all about bargains, but this is a waste of money. I am very into tech stuff. I have some very high-tech toys and cameras, and stuff, so it's not tlike I don't know how to work these things. But now it's just passed it's 3 month Warantee and it's totally broke. I've been on the line with the Creative Technical support (nice peopple) multiple times now and they said it's broken. And since it's more than 3 months old (5 months), I have to pay them $20 (twenty) just for them to tell me what's broken. That doesn't include what I would have to pay to fix it. I only paid $65 (sixty-five) for it brand new. So its been a total waste of $$$. PLEASE! Do yourself a favor...Find another model for a little bit more and enjoy having a nice and easy-to-use, reliable player. This has a good concept but is very &quot;buggy&quot;.

<Content>I've had this player for under four months, used it sparingly, and never abused it - but since the play button broke (a comment I've seen several times), it's just a storage device that won't play MP3's at all, and that's not why I bought it.  And when you stop the player, it starts back up at the first track - the batteries never seemed to last nearly as long as advertized either.  Just spend some more money and get something that won't break on you.

<Content>I am a tech person and have owned 4 MP3 players. I still have two of them including this door stop. As with everything Creative Labs has produced since the sound blaster sound cards, they can't get it right and eventually other companies enter the field and push them out. Now to the player. It worked for 4 months with a few formats and installations but it would constantly corrupt the music files. Eventually I had the same problem most users have with the player - the on button wouldn't work. I paid too much for this 128 mb player and will never buy another Creative Lab product if it costs over $20. I still need a smaller player so I am looking at CNET recommendations and will probably go with the RIO NITRUS. Don't waste your money on this player.

<Content>This player is great for size and ease of use! Its' design is simplistic and lightweight. No cables or mess when transferring music. I use it for running and it's even gotten wet! (Rains alot here in Hawaii) However, it does not playback all the songs I have uploaded to it. It randomly skips over the same certain songs every time I play it. And the play is not continuous. It will stop at the same points every time. I simply have to push "play" again for it to work but this gets annoying. So if you don't care about these things and you want a lightweight, durable and simple unit, then this one is for you. I don't mind its imperfections and so I'm pretty happy with it.

<Content>This inexpensive device is perfect in its simplicity.  I have had mine for 2 years with no problems at all (and so has my dad!).  It's perfect for the gym but I also use it for transporting work files e.g. MS Word, Powerpoint, etc (they just need to be stored in a subdirectory). For this low price I'd be surprised to find a better MP3 player/ USB storage device.

<Title>It's Ok
<Date>Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this MP3 Player as a birthday present. When I received it, I really knew almost nothing about MP3 players. I was delighted. Of course, I read the manual, (Which by the way, is not very clear at all) and I saw that it said that the light would blink red if the battery was low. Well, apparently, my version of the player was a little different. It would just shut off when it felt like it. Changing the battery would do the trick, but it would only work for a very very limited time, and then you would have to change the battery again. I got quite sick of this, so I spoke to my Dad about it. He sent it in to the company and they sent me a new one. This one does the same thing. I was confused, but apparently, I just didn't get a quality MP3 player. I would also prefer to have a little more space on the stick, because it doesn't fit many songs. About 20 if you search for smaller sized files. If you are looking for a reasonably OK MP3 player, but are on a tight budget, I would reccomend this one, but if you are ok to go a little higher on the price scale, you should definately try something different.

<Title>A good, not great, product
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I brought one for my son for christmas and we were both pleased with it. It is, as you can tell, extremely small and I worry that he may lose it because of this. We did have some problems after he did "something" to it either by direct drag and drop or messing with the files one the USB drive. It was basically dead, no lights, no music. After some brief online research I was able to guess at what the problem was, he had somehow removed or overwrote the part of the USB drive that holds the programing. I was able to fix it after I used the format utility from creative. I had not installed it since the documentation leads you to belive you don't need any additional software it you are running XP, well to cover these kind of incidents you do!<br>The only other downside is that it will probably cost $.. by next christmas and they'll be giving them away in cereal boxes by the christmas after that!

<Content>It's a great machine.  But if you have long files (e.g. audio books) it is not so useful.  Have to start all over again, if you stop for more than a minute or so.  Also no counter to see where you are, or indicator of the files on the device.  Good idea needs work

<Title>Amazing little player!
<Date>Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>In my opinion, this player is exactly what it appears to be: a little flash memory keychain in which you can save 128MB of files and MP3/WMA music.<p>The portability is its greatest feature, so if you're looking for a small MP3 player, this gotta be your choice. You won't find anything smaller or more practical than this.<p>To copy MP3 to the Muvo player, all you have to do is plug it into an USB port on your computer, and copy the files you wish to. It works as if it were another hard-drive. Couldn't be more easy to use, that's for sure.<p>The instalation is also really easy. In Windows 98 is necessary to use the instalation CD which comes with the player, but on the other systems above this one, you don't have to instal anything: just plug the player and Windows will recognize it automatically. Great thing!<p>I was also impressed by the sound quality. I was kinda affraid it would be poor, but, boy, was I mistaken! The sound is great,it sounds exactly as the MP3 being played on my computer (with a Creative Soundblaster MP3+ Soundcard).<p>In my opinion, the fact that this player doesn't have a LCD screen is not a problem at all. In fact, I don't think you need one, because this player only fits about 25 songs, so you probably already know which songs are being played anyway.<p>I've read a lot of reviews of people complaining about how their players broke down as soon as they got them. I still haven't had any problems at all - thank God! In fact, I was also kinda affraid of buying this because of the reviews, but I decided to anyway, and I don't regret it at all! It was a great buy!<p>So, if you're looking for something small, with great portability and easy to use, search no more!

<Title>Functionally Great/Technically Difficult
<Date>Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>If you want a tiny no-frills MP3 player with generous storage, the Creative MuVo is for you (that is if you are willing to put up with a few idiosyncrasies). I purchased the 128MB MuVo, and immediately filled it up with a couple CDs worth of music. The sound was great once I switched to better headphones (Sennheiser MX400's - the included headphones are best left in the box). I had no problems for the first couple of days, and hoped I would not run into the "2 day curse" that some other reviewers had mentioned (apparently the MuVo sometimes shuts off never to work again - often after two days of use). <p>Well, I used the MuVo for a couple of days, and sure enough as I was turning it off on the third day, the indicator light turned red and stayed that way. I was very upset given the fact that I would have to return the unit to Amazon.com and wait a couple of days for a replacement. <p>Like other reviewers had mentioned, the MuVo continued to work as a hard drive when I plugged it into my USB port. Well, I found a fix for my unit. WARNING: You will lose all data on the MuVo doing this, so back it up first. I immediately loaded the included software and reformatted the MuVo (From the Start Menu in Windows, just go to "Creative", "Nomad MuVo", "Format" and select the "Start" button). This will wipe the drive, and reformat the unit. I reloaded a couple of mp3 files onto the MuVo, and it worked again! So, if you run into this problem, try this before calling Creative.<p>End result, here are my pros and cons for the MuVo:<p>PROS:<br>-Tiny package for decent size drive (about the same size as a larger BIC cigarette lighter).<br>-Great sound once headphones are replaced.<br>-Doubles as a file transfer drive.<br>-Works right out of the box with most updated Windows and MAC operating systems (also works interchangeably between PC and MAC).<p>CONS:<br>-No display. You won't know which songs are on the unit until you listen.<br>-Song order sometimes random. The MuVo plays the songs in the order in which they were copied. Not always alphabetically or by album. You need to play around with it a bit to get it to work properly.<br>-Possible indiscriminate player failure (it has only happened to me once, but I would be surprised if it didn't happen again.<br>-No FM Tuner (would be nice and more functional, but would probably also make the unit somewhat larger).<p>All in all, a great little (and it is one of the smallest 128MB mp3 players out there) package with a few technical hiccups.

Belt clip/armband only can order from manuf' web site.  ship and handling cost more than the product. <p>Opinion:<p>This would make a great product if it was intended for Horseshoe games.  George Bush Sr. would loved it - he is a great Horseshoe game player.  I don't play Horseshoe game and close enough just doesn't do it for me.  <p>30 mins laters I am walking out the door to gym with 17 songs.  I was really excited to hear them ALL while I am running on the treadmill.  At first, I thought I ripped the same song more than once because it played more than once before it played the whole list.  <p>Next day, running again, I heard songs that I KNEW that I ripped but didn't on the day before.  It played whatever it wants to and missing out on some of my favor songs.  After 3 hrs of playing, heard annoying static sound...low on battery( I thought it was defective at first). <p>Seems that it's  playing shuffle but it actually goes through the whole list, just that whole list is not the whole, it's partial.  It will play whatever list it wants to and does go back to track one to repeat ( I set to repeat play.  This time this crazy player plays some of the songs it didn't play prior.  Magic!!  Wonder what causes that to happen??  <p>Some days, I just got to hear my favor song(s) because that's why I bought this darn device.  when it doesn't...ruins you evening workout esp, if you had a long day.<p>Decide for yourself.  You'll get 30days of free trial at the vendor's cost.  Be sure to keep the receipt and the original packaging for return.  <p>I just wanted my MP3 player to play ALL the songs on the player.<p>PS.  Hold off on odering Belt clip/armband, after you return the player, you will want to return the Belt clip/armband but remember, you won't get your shipping and handling cost back.

<Title>coolest, then dashed hopes, now tail spin
<Date>Sun Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It WAS the coolest.  Then on the 3rd day it stopped -- no clue.  FAQs and self help on Creative's site eventually got me to download Creative's formatter software.  I formatted it and it was back! But not for long. 2 days later it stopped again.  This time it was worse.  WinXP couldn't recognize it as a muvo anymore, only as some generic device.  I formatted it again but "Format Failed" and the Muvo red LED when out.  That was the end. Nothing I tried worked.  It took two weeks to get an RMA from Creative using their self serve customer care web page.  Since then I've been reading reviews from others having almost the exact same problems, one guy on this 3rd return which also eventually failed. Stay away from this product until they fix it.

<Title>Solid player after having 30 days
<Date>Mon Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I read all the reviews and decided to purchase MuVo 128 for $130 on Amazon over the $200 Nike player.  Granted, the player doesn't feel as solid as Nike's, but it was extremely easy to use (had no problems like some users) and much smaller.  I jump rope and do weights, and this player didn't miss a beat.  The only minor nuances:<br>-I couldn't use MusicMatch where I organize my mp3s.  You need to find it on your hard drive.<br>-Doesn't have a lock button where the buttons don't function. It never accidentally pushed buttons, but I'd take the battery out before packing it.<br>-No belt clip included.  It's so small I put it in my pocket or tied it through my short waist-string without problems, but some might think it's annoying.<br>Overall, a very good product that I'll definitely keep.

<Date>Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I loved this for it's very small size, reasonably good sound, easy drag-n-drop interface, and ability to use it as a USB hard drive. <p>But, like so many other Muvos before it, this one went belly-up after about 4 months.  It won't power on, my computer won't recognize it in order to format it, and even the magical hard-reset procedure which has resurrected it several times already during its short life couldn't bring it back to life.<p>So, it's into the trash with the dead Muvo, and on to search for a better MP3 player.  I'd avoid this one if I were you!

<Content>I don't normally write reviews, there are plenty of people out there who like to share their opinion every day -- but I am so incensed by Creative's policies that I feel obligated to share...<p>I bought this brand new when it came out in October 2002 and was so amazed and proud to own such a cool mp3 player.  Everything everyone wrote about it is true and did not have any qualms about it at all.  It could use a digital screen but that is the trade off of something so small.<p>But it is now the beginning of February 2003 and it had stopped working!!!  It still plugs into my computer and transfers files on and off it, but when you plug it into the battery pack it refuses to get any juice from the battery when I have a freshly opened battery in there.<br> <br>I've called Creative for a solution, and they decided i needed to have it sent it to be fixed, but their warrenty is only 90 days!!!!  I am over by only 2 weeks, which is absolutely curious to me!!!  So now I have to fork out another $20 to have them fix it.  Granted it's only $20 however, I am very disappointed they put out a product that has such an awful warranty period.  But I am doublely upset with Creative now that I read in these reviews that this has happened to other Muvo customers.<p>So Buyer Beware!!!

<Title>Very small. Very nice. Sounds great.
<Date>Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've now had this thing for about four months, and I just love it. It's very small -- about the size of a disposible lighter -- and sounds great. True, it doesn't have tons of features, but the controls it does have are very easy to use (even with gloves on) and an LED screen and more controls would just make it bigger.<p>I just started using rechargeable batteries, and contrary to another review here, my Muvo ran for about 8 hours straight on one NiMH recargeable battery (I was testing the new battery to see how long it would last).  It uses one AAA, so it's pretty easy to carry a spare.<p>The earphones that come with it aren't the greatest, but they don't sound too bad. Still, my Sony's do sound better. I've even plugged the thing into my stereo and it sounds pretty damn good.  And guess what? You can also use this thing to store and transfer files from computer to computer. No software needed for Windows Me and up, but you will need the included software if you have Windows 98.<p>For those who have had problems, try cleaning the files off the unit and copying them back, or use the format feature included with the software.  It has no way of changing the order of the way songs are played, and doesn't always play them back in the order you load them.  Personally, I don't mind the surprises, and while it's easy to jump foward and back to another track the unit will sometimes jump too far, or not far enough.<p>Everybody I've shown this to has been blown away by its small size and big sound. I know there are better MP3 players out there, but not many can be used to transfer data files, and I can't think of any that are this small.  You can look at all the pictures of it you want, but I can assure you that you'll still be surprised when you see it for real.<p>By the way, make sure you let your friends hear it before you pull it out of your pocket -- that really impresses them.

<Content>My MUVO is cool as heck. The reason I like it is that I'm in college and I can slip it into my shirt pocket when I'm at the gym and when I'm walking to class. Being at Clemson which has become very technologically advanced, I use computers for about 2-4 hours a day. This MUVO makes writing CD's and using disks absolete for anything under 128MB. Only downside is kinda short battery life (which doesnt matter if used as flash drive) and no display. Thats why i gave 4 instead of 5. LATA

<Date>Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Muvo from J&amp;R. Had to return it for replacement because it broke when I touched the fast forward buttons. The Muvo is a very fragile product. The second Muvo had other problems which I am dealing with currently. The rechargeable Ni-Metal Hydyride batteries only last 5 minutes with Muvo after the batteries are fully recharged. I bought a new charger and four new AAA Ni-Metal Hydride batteries and the problems continue. Bottomline: I am very unhappy with Muvo. I tend to think that Creative Labs has not tested its product properly before it brought Muvo to the market. I also read at the CNET site that people had similar problems with Muvo, so my problems do not seem unusual for this product.

<Content>I've read a lot of people had some technical problems with theirs but all I know is I love mine.  I bought it for the gym and it's perfect for that.  It's so light and comfortable to wear I almost literally don't notice I'm wearing it, it's like I've got a private dj beaming my music into my head while I exercise.  I even like the ear buds.  They may not be the world's greatest headphones but they fit my ears really well and provide sound which is perfectly adequate for my needs.  I'm not an audiophile and I could care less if the sound is &quot;awesome&quot; as long as I have my music in a lightweight, trouble-free package.  add to the nice packaging that downloading is a snap (I'm running windows XP), and you can't beat it.  If you're looking for a jukebox type MP3 or need lots of features, perfect sonic clarity etc, look elsewhere, but if simplicity and size are you criteria, this is it.

<Content>This thing is handy-dandy.  Mine has worked flawlessly for the 3 months that I've owned it.  Using WMA files, I can cram 33-34 songs on there.  I love it.  Only main drawback (aside from missing a random mode) is what others have mentioned - using alkaline batteries, it lasts 1.5 hours, tops.  So you ALWAYS have to carry a spare battery, even if you're just walking to the mailbox.  I've gotten quite good at changing the battery when I'm running.

<Title>small, extremely easy, good size memory, great sound
<Date>Fri Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I don't have much time but I'll share my thoughts. I bought my player about 2 months ago. This is one of the best things I've ever bought.  It's so much easier than having a program to put mp3's on your player.  All you do is click and drag, it also has pretty good transfer time.  It's very light and fits well in any pocket.  For it's size, it has great memory storage.  Some mp3 player lack good volume but this doesn't. hmmmm what else, it's has average bass sound.  The only complaints I have about the player is that it doesn't have a random button.  Also, I found out the hard way that this product is not to be toyed with.  I'll admitt to you (but not to tech support) that I dropped it at least twice about 3 feet and some other minor stuff. As a result it started to screw up a little and turns off at random, but if your careful with it, it should be fine.  This mp3 player is badass GET IT!

<Title>It's a great player, but...
<Date>Fri Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The volume is excellent, as well as the clarity, and size.  However, this is not the only purchase you have to make.  If you want to put your CD's on it, you need to purchase a MP3 Ripper.  I downloaded several free ones off of the internet, but they all have restrictions.  It gets tiresome.  I did not want to have to buy another product.  It was just not for me.

<Title>Early failure of function controls
<Date>Thu Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Well. I have had mine no more than two weeks. The &quot;Forward&quot; skip and volume &quot;Down&quot; controls went out. Device sounds great but it looks like they did'nt have good quality control in assembly. I suspect it is based in the circuit board as two totally seperate functions went down. I cannot imagine two of those little bubble switches going down at the same time so that rules that out. It definitly appears like a bad common conductor on the circuit board that both switches are connected to. Find your goof up Creative.<br>HINT: If you remove the USB half from the battery pack it will reduce the volume level back to a resonable startup level.

<Title>Heed the Warnings
<Date>Tue Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This was the most disappointing purchase I have made in a long time...I should have paid attention to the reviews here and elsewhere.<p>This player started failing the first night I had it - would stop playing even though it appeared it was still going. I changed the batteries, reformatted and ensured it wasn't corrupted MP3's but no such luck. Half of the pages on Creative's support web site were non-existant and since there was virtually no documentation with the product I was stuck. And very unhappy.<p>When it was working the sound quality was pretty lousy, too, despite the programmable EQ. I was a bit surprised as I had once thought that Creative was the leader in portable digital audio.<p>I would highly recommend the iRiver 1FP-380T, which is what I replaced this piece with. For LESS money you get way better quality, durability, stability, upgradability and overall product satisfaction.

<Title>A fantastic little gadget!...
<Date>Mon Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was out to purchase an MP3 player for my workouts and decided upon this tiny device.  I have had mine for about two months now and I can honestly say I'm completely satisfied.  I have read a few of the other reviews in which there were various complaints of &quot;it stopped working&quot;.  I put mine through a few hours of use everyday (which includes a daily routine of deleting the previous day's tunes and creating a fresh line up) and haven't had a single problem.  It's also the easy thing in the world to operate and work with, many people who are familiar with USB ports won't need to read the instructions at all, with Windows XP you just treat it like a folder and simply 'drag n' drop'.  I will say (as a nother reviewer did) if you're really picky about your music and really want some thumping then go with the Koss Plug ear buds.  THe only reason I won't give this five stars is because I had to purchase the armband/clip separately.  Overall a big thumbs up!

<Title>warning: the amazon.com three-star rating is misleading!
<Date>Sun Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Before you consider buying this product, click "all customer reviews" and then click "one star reviews only" and READ them.  of the 126 reviews for this product, 53 are one-star reviews, most of which tell the same story: this product is fabulous for three months, three weeks, or (in many cases) three days, but then it stops working altogether -- and the offers of help from the folks at Creative Labs are mostly ineffectual or mere delusions.  My experience: It stopped working after four days.  You wouldn't know this from the three-star rating (obviously an average of the high marks that folks give the product when it doesn't break and the low marks given by the rest of us) -- or from the "spotlight reviews" that amazon.com posts...

<Title>Not Worth it.
<Date>Mon Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got this as my first mp3 player, and yes, I'll admit that it worked beautifuly for the first two weeks, however, with me changing my playlist daily - it didn't work beautifuly for long.<p>It was the second week that the volume buttons began sticking, so I couldn't move the volume up and down. I went to the store, thinking it was a default one, and exchanged it for a new one (thank god I didn't have to pay), and the pattern repeated. <p>I kept using it with stuck volume buttons, but another two weeks later the playback button started to stick and stopped playing at all, in other words, these things have a lifespan of about 2 weeks, it's cheaper in the end to get a more expensive one.

<Title>Good Idea; Poor Design
<Date>Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>KISS Design, tiny form factor, and USB thumbdisk functionality - sounds great in theory.  The MuVo, however, falls far short in its implementation and Creative has compounded its failure by failing to recall and replace this device and delivering abysmal customer support.<p>I, and apparently nearly half of the purchasers of this device, experienced frequent failure of the MuVo within a few play hours of use.  There are reformatting and the more drastic Recovery utilities to fix the problem.  Sometimes they work.  Often they do not.  After three replacements and near-zero assist from Creative, COMPUSA cut me off, leaving me with my fourth and final MuVo.  Creative has offered to repair or replace for an additional $20.  In common trade speak, this is called &quot;chiseling.&quot;<p>There are other issues - clipping of the tracks on the front and back end, and the complete inability to sequence tracks, other than by copying them one.... at.... a... time.  Quite tedious.  All these could be overlooked, if the MuVo just worked.<p>Which it doesn't.<p>Run - don't walk - away from this product.  Maybe even all Creative products, altogether.  Despite its excellent track record with the impressive SoundBlaster line of products, the MuVo may herald a new era of shoddy worksmanship, evasive customer service, and chiseling tactices for Creative.<p>My idea of recreation does not include 90 minute hold times only to be told to cough up a couple more sawbucks just to get what I paid for in the first place.

<Content>I received the Nomad Muvo 64 MB MP3 player for Christmas.  It was really small and light, which was wonderful.  The fact that it broke 4 weeks later was not so great.  Even when it was working, it would cut out occasionally. The idea behind the design is good...it slides apart to easily connect to your USB port. The sound quality was amazing when it worked. However, the poor reliability of the player just ruins all the other good features.  I don't recommend this particular product.

<Date>Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had the Muvo one month and it stopped working.   Like one of the other reviewers,  I can plug it into my computer, transfer and play MP3 files, but does not work when plugged into the battery pack.   Creative Labs customer support does not exist.   I called the technical support phone number listed on their website and was introduced to a laundry list of tele-options that provided no solution.    I called their order number and they gave me a second phone number for reporting problems.   No one answered.   I called the order number again, and they then said the second number is having problems and to try again in several hours.   They &quot;hoped&quot; it will be working by then.    I submitted my problem using Creative email option which has a published 2 to 3 day response.   I'm not very optimistic.   A previous reviewer summed up Creative Labs and the Muvo rather well: &quot;In short, poorly executed product with horrible support from Creative Labs-- Recommend you buy something else from someone else who better understands how to design, manufacture and support consumers...&quot;

There's really no parts that could have broke, yet still it did.<p>Because it's barely over the horrible 90 day warranty there are no options to get my money back on it. Creative labs has the worst tech support line I've had the displeasure of calling into.<p>My recomendation, look into an iPod, or some of the new smaller MP3 players on Amazon. This device may be small and cool, but it's not worth it due to the poor quality control.

<Date>Wed Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I still stand by my prior statement that I love my Muvo, but I just wanted to add one caveat.  This thing eats batteries like nothing I've ever seen. Maybe I like my music cranking more than other people but I get two hours max out of a AAA battery.  Also, I think a lot of people's problems are probably battery related.  I find that it stops playing due to low power even before the low battery light comes on.  So you'll definitely need to invest in rechargable batteries if you use this device, because if you listen to music loud, it's best to put a fresh battery in everytime you head out with it or at least carry a spare with you.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Thu Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first invested in Creative Labs with my Nomad Jukebox C-series 20 GB mp3 player.  I love it, but the only down side is that is about the size of CD player (a welcome compromise for the 20 GB storage).  I started searching for smaller players and found this.  <br>It is a bit pricey, but I think it is worth it.  The only down side is what the other customers have mentioned: it shuts down after a day or two.  The storage works, but the player doesn't register.  I read a review before I bought it and the guy says how to troubleshoot the problem yourself.  I  tried his advice and it worked.<br>Here is what you do: After you install the MuVo software, go through the start menu to "Creative" and click "Format."  When the format box comes up, just hit start and it will wipe your hard drive clean (the only down side to this procedure).  After this your player should work.  <br>The other down side to the MuVo is storage, only 64mb.  The memory thing doesn't really bother me, but if you do want more, there is a 128mb version available.<br>Despite these two problems, I am definitely pleased with this buy.

<Content>I've had the MUVO 128MB for about 2 weeks now and am very happy with it.  The size is great and it is really easy to use: just plug it in and copy files to it.  I don't really mind not having an LCD...it's a worthy trade-off for the size and portable-drive features.  I don't like the fact that it always restarts at the first song, and I would have liked to have a random or shuffle mode.  Sound quality is good and I haven't had any technical difficulties with it whatsoever.

<Title>Poor Product - Miserable Service
<Date>Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The concept is great - small sleek simple solid-state. What more could you ask for? Coming off the Rio players with their awkward Audio Manager to move songs on and off the unit, I was looking forward to small and simple.<p>The implementation, however, falls far short of the mark. I have been through three MuVo units. They have all been defective.<p>The storage part of the unit becomes corrupted regularly. Adding or subtracting tracks can corrupt the drive - forcing a full reformat and re-loading. Very tedious and, from my experience, a common problem. This does not appear to be "just one guy's bad experience." Read - "Design Flaw."<p>Also, you cannot simply scoop up a bunch of files and transfer them to the unit, if you wish to preserve play order. The MuVo plays strictly first in-first played order. Windows copy, however, does not necessarily copy files selected in the order listed in the directory. The actual copy order performed by Windows has never been relevant... until now. If you listen to books on tape like me, however, unless you not really hung on that "sequential chapter" thing, it's critical. The only solution, I've found, is to manually copy one track at a time. Rio Audio Manager doesn't seem too bad, now.<p>Finally, there's customer service. I've been buying Creative Sound Cards for years and never, ever needed customer service before, so I never realized how poor it is. Creative Customer Service is practically non-existent; it is designed to frustrate and discourage people seeking support. You have two options, you can call the Customer Support Line and, unless you live in San Jose, CA, expect to pay the full price of your MuVo again in toll charges waiting, on hold, for the next representative, or through their web site system where weeks can go by waiting for a stock response, cut and pasted from the support manual - and then not necessarily responsive to your question. ... That's Creative customer support!<p>Getting a Return Authorization number to send the unit in for service is like pulling teeth.<p>MuVo, I understand, is short for Musical Voyage. Consider this your HYDROLANT Special Warning to Mariners: Steer Clear! This is a beta product. It doesn't work and Creative won't help you. Don't be an Early Adopter Sucker like me.  [Let's not get so aggressive with the editing, there, Amazon police.]<p>Wait for V3.0, when they've got the bugs worked out.

<Content>A good idea! 128MB lets you play about 25 - 30 songs with standard mp3 encoding. Transferring songs is so simple thanks to the built-in USB! The data storage it provides is a great feature too. Decent sound though the earphones could do with a little more bass. It is understandable that there is no battery-hogging display but some additional features like bass, treble and random play controls are missed. Battery life (1 AAA) is good though it would have been awesome if it had been rechargeable. Quirky performer - sometimes it stops functioning and you have to run the format utility from your PC. Otherwise I have been very happy with it.<p>Pros:<br>Ease of use, Compact size and weight, sound clarity, Can be used as a data storage device too<p>Cons: <br>Lack of features like random play, bass/treble controls.

<Title>Good sound, short battery life
<Date>Tue Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This device has great sound, especially with decent headphones, but is a case study in falsity in advertising, since the only other way to explain the company's claim that the battery lasts up to 12 hours is to assume that they rounded up to the nearest multiple of 12. Also note that there's no window, and songs added without reformatting will, as an inviolable rule, never end up where you want them. But it is really small... just make sure you pack a few extra batteries.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this product 7 months ago and it still hasn't failed on me. It got messed up once when I tried to format the drive manually. You have to use the formatter that came with the CD (which you can also download from the Creative website).<p>I wouldn't recommend using this product with an Apple computer, unless you have a backup PC. Mac OS puts hidden files on the drive that caused it to play only the first song. You can remove those hidden files with a PC. Also, make sure you eject the drive before removing it from the USB port, that's why I had to reformat the drive. You could probably use the mp3 player with Linux. But if you have to format the drive in Linux, you're out of luck.<p>I can usually store about 2.5 to 3 albums on the mp3 player. The sound quality is great, even with cheap headphones. I can usually get it to play for 8 to 12 hours. Plus, it's so tiny!

<Title>I Gave It Two Stars Because I Got It for Free
<Date>Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this MP3 player as a freebie throw-in with my Dell computer.  If I had actually paid any money for it, let alone the actual sales price, I would have returned this zero-star performer in a flash.  <p>The only upside to it is its design simplicity:  part of the unit detaches, plugs into any USB port, and is then recognized as a portable drive.  From there, you just move files into/out of the player just like any other drive.  No additional software installs, setup, etc. - true plug and play.  <p>Unfortunately, the cons are much more numerous.  The most disappointing aspect is the sound, from the ill-fitting earbuds that deliver the thinnest of tones to the playback unit that chops off the first millisecond of every track.  That latter fact really makes this unit completely unacceptable.  Also, the lack of any LCD display coupled with buttons that are small and difficult to use make control a constant problem as well.  Capacity is so-so - I've had to lop tracks off of many albums that I've attempted to load.  Lastly, the packaged unit doesn't come with any armband - it's available as a separate accessory, which seems excessive for the price.  <p>This player is fine only if you can find one for dirt cheap and are looking for an option to use when you're mowing the lawn or any other dirty activity where you'd be reluctant to bring your &quot;real&quot; MP3.

<Title>skip this player
<Date>Thu Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had a nightmare experience with this player.  When I turned the volume up it skipped like crazy.  I visited the Creative website and could find no explanation of why it was doing this, so I loaded their updated software, which didn't fix it, so I downloaded their firmware, still no luck.  Creative has no 800# so what do I do -  support a company that doesn't have a real customer service department to solve a problem that they can't explain?  And get this, Creative sent me a confused email guessing that my source was the problem without even explaining why that would cause the problem and not offering a possible fix or any king of solution. Well, no 800#, so I sent the player back, and I'm buying an MPIO player.

<Title>It's Going Back
<Date>Fri Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I didn't buy this from Amazon. It was a delayed "impulse" purchase from a local store a few days ago. After getting it home, I became curious about product reviews and checked with Amazon...user experiences were a bit scary, to say the least. Creative's scant 90 day parts/labor warranty only added to the insecurity. However, the player worked, sound was beautiful, so I tried to convince myself that everything would be all right.<p>That was Monday evening. As of Friday morning, the player was totally dead. Pressing/holding the power button did nothing, even after inserting a new AAA battery...in fact, I tried TWO brand new batteries, with the same result each time.<p>The memory module still functions--I inserted it into my computer's USB port and all is well. I didn't buy it as flash memory for my computer, however. I bought it as a portable Mp3 unit--and that's totally dead.<p>My faith in Creative Labs is shaken--from other user's comments, from my own unhappy experience with this product, and from the pathetic excuse for a warranty--and Creative even wants you to pay to ship the product back to them during the warranty period. Forget it, this item is being returned to the place of purchase within 24 hours. There are better choices, from better companies, with better warranties.<p>Buyer beware!

<Title>Similar (negative) experience
<Date>Fri Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Thanks to everyone for saving me time.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with my recently-non-functioning MuVo, which I bought on the recommendation of Men's Health magazine (grrrrr). Just like Orlando Gutierrez, mine worked for about 93 days -- just long enough for my warranty to wear out -- and then the on/off button just stopped working.  It's now worthless.<p>Before I bought the MuVo, I read reviews that preserving playing order and the flimsy construction were issues.  I should have paid more attention.  The lack of a belt clip was a problem, too, when it comes to working out.  Also, I only got about 2-3 hours on the AAA battery at most.<p>I'm off to buy the iAudio CW200.  I'm willing to pay a bit more for sturdier construction, longer battery life and more features.  Wish me luck!

<Title>HOW TO FIX THE ON/OFF BUTTON
<Date>Sat Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Creative has not been very good about responding to support emails. If you ever encounter a problem with the on/off button not working don't panic. There is most likely nothing wrong with your MuVo player. I won't go into the technical details of what happens but you will encounter this problem if your battery dies and the MuVo does not turn itself off. <p>THE SOLUTION IS TO PLUG IT INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND REFORMAT THE DRIVE. You can of course remove your MP3's or other files first. <p>I hope this information helps anyone who buys this product. I love mine with the exception that there aren't any accessories for it. I like to run but have no &quot;armband&quot; or secure attachment for it.<p>Good luck.

<Content>I think the problem many people are having are what I experienced when I first bought it.  I put all my music files into folders on the drive.  The Nomad cannot recognize music files in folders and did not work.  However, once I moved the music files out of folders it worked perfectly.  Great device as an MP3 player and even better as a &quot;portable&quot; hard drive of memory.  Great for people who do lots work at various computers (home, work, school) and are sick of emailing files back and forth.  Highly recommend it.

<Date>Tue Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The design and idea behind the Muvo is great - I bought it almost exclusively for gym use.  I like that I can use it as a memory stick, although data transfer could be a bit faster from my Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop.<p>The software has been pretty horrible, however.  I have had about 3 weeks of use during the full 4 months I've owned it.  It doesn't seem to deal well with some MP3 files &amp; a required, hidden file called settings.dat invites deletion.<p>I would also appreciate a random play button and a wristband.  This may be available with the latest firmware release; I'm not sure.

<Title>Nice idea - POOR QUALITY
<Date>Wed Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just got back from the post office to send my second unit back.  The first went bad after 2 months.  After multiple contacts with customer "service," I finally got authorization to send it back in.  Five weeks after Creative received it (per their website), their "RMA status" box read "NO PROBLEM FOUND."  I called and asked them to not send it back until it was fixed.  I was assured that it had been repaired.  Almost 2 weeks later, I received a dead unit.  And yes, I had to listen to yet another customer service rep turn the pages of a manual while I told him the next step in the "recovery" process - that was again fruitless.  So after much wasted time with customer service, and being on hold, and getting to spend another half hour in line at the post office,... I get the privilege of waiting another 5+ weeks to get another faulty unit.  Gee, I can't wait.  And I didn't...<p>During all of this, I purchased a Cowon iaudio 256 MB flash memory mp3 and have been extremely pleased.  <p>The MuVo sound quality is not bad.  The battery life is about 1/2 the advertised length.  The software caused my WinXP PC to crash (blue screen) after every other time that the MuVo was inserted in a USB.  The size is tiny and you barely notice it in a pocket.  The unit intermittently and spontaneously played songs in a random order, sometimes ignoring many songs with each cycle.<p>Bottom line: DO NOT PURCHASE A MuVo!  The product is extremely poorly built, fragile, and is made by a company with timely but wholly inadequate customer service.  The warranty period of 90 days is a strategic move on their part.

<Title>This player is absolute junk
<Date>Sun Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the 64MB MuVo and initially it worked great.  It's true that you can get it running more quickly than most MP3 players because you don't have to install special software.  However, the player stopped working when I tried to put a new album on the player.  At first I thought it was the copy protection that Windows Media player enforces by default, so I turned that off.  Still, the player would only play the first couple seconds of the first song before turning off.  Since then I've tried everything--different MP3 formats (bitrates), WMA, copy protection on/off, reformatting multiple times, being ultra-careful about copying files onto the player (not dragging multiple things at once), etc. etc.  This thing is just a major piece of [poo] and won't even turn on.  As others have noted, the USB portion seems to work ok, so the memory portion is solid.  I know this because I can play the music from the USB drive on my PC.  But the player itself...either won't turn on or won't stay on for more than a few seconds.  All this with multiple brand new batteries.  The WORST consumer electronic item I have ever purchased, even worse than my Lexmark Z32 printer.

<Title>Versatile and high quality !!
<Date>Mon Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this compact player after reading reviews all over the WEB. Personally, I needed something with 128 MB of storage that was small enough to carry around in my pocket. The MuVo seemed to be the logical choice for me (although there are several others in this size range). Arguably, the lack of a display could be seen as a drawback. But, for me, I know exactly what I loaded onto the player and don't really care to see the name of the artist, title of album, etc .... scrolling along eating away at my battery life. The drag and drop simplicity of loading music is another plus for me. I wear the player around my neck while at work and have a fairly strenuous, outdoor job. The player has performed without flaw for me. The included earbuds can be a little uncomfortable after a few hours, but other than that, I'm extremely pleased !

<Title>Super product, but instructions need revising
<Date>Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I couldn't figure out why the player wouldn't work.  Pressed the start button, but it wouldn't turn on.  Then I read a review of the product that said you had to press the start button and hold it for several seconds before the device would turn on.  That works.  Another thing to watch out for:  When inserting the flash memory stick into the port, make sure you haven't got any other open programs.  The flash memory may be damaged in inserting or removing the memory stick if other programs are operating.  Otherwise, the stick works like another drive, and copying and pasting MP3s or WMA files is easy.

<Date>Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm just returning my second unit. I used the first one 4 times and the second 3 before they completely broke down. I'm really disappointed...it's such a cool product. I so easy to use and the sound quality is good, if you use better headphones. The ones that come with it sound really tinny and there's no bass boost or adjustments on the player.<br>The 1st problem I had was loud, screechy static. I thought it was just a corrupt file so I formattd it and copied new music to it. It worked fine for an hour or so then started w/the static again. trying to skip the song that wasn't playing caused it to shut down and I was never able to power it up completely. <br>The 2nd unit worked fine through 2 uses and then shut itself off and would not allow me to restart it. <br>I'm not willing to give it a 3rd try, since I did not even get a full week of use out of the 1st 2 units! I've exchanged for a Sony Minidisc player instead. They should pull this thing off the market.

<Title>don't buy this MP3 player unless your stupid
<Date>Sun Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this MP3 player thinking that it would be convenient and also double as a hard disk to move files from home to work and vise versa.  Since I have had the machine I have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times (within 2 months).  Currently it is not working at all.  This machine has been extremely unreliable.  Often I would go on a trip and it would simple not work- one then needs the CD and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again.  and , after you reformat it, you have to re-install all the songs you had on there before.  When it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were.  I thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use.  Nothing is further from the truth.  I am only upset  now because I cannot find the receipt to return this junk.  Please, do yourself a favor and get something else.

<Content>This was so~o not worth the money. Before I puchased my player, I read every single review that was written. Majority of them said that dropping it will cause damages so I was EXTREMLY careful about not dropping and I never did. But right after the damn warrenty runs out, it stopped working all together and I tried reformatting 100x. Not to mention within the time that I did use it, it would turn on at the slightest touch and at other times, i would have to crunch the buttons to play. The bottom line. DONT BUY THIS. ITS TOO WEAK ESP. IF YOU PLAN TO ADD/REMOVE MUSIC EVERYDAY. IT CANT HANDLE IT. <p>Now, I simply use it to transport music files from my pc to mac. I just wished I didnt pay $... (i bought the 128mb) for a disk I could have bought for much cheaper.

I just gave up.<p>I don't care how much they drop the price -- don't buy it.  Hopefully, they'll keep working on it &amp; create a tiny player that works.<p>One more con:  even if you can get it to work -- it has no ability to remember where it was shut off.  So, your book, you playlist, etc. restarts everytime you turn it on.

<Title>Don't BLOW Creative MUVO player. It's great...
<Date>Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Here is my word about it:<p>1. DON'T use WINDOWS FORMAT to the MUVO. You will cause the "common" corruption (you won't switch on the MUVO again, till you use format utility localized in CD that Creative delivers). MUVO uses special file format!!!<p>2. DON'T plug off MUVO until you copy all the files you need (this can lead to corruption too).<p>3. IF you do something from 1 or 2 try the reformatting MUVO with the software located on the CD (or downloaded from website).<p>4. "settings.dat" is the file that stores volume level of last session.<p>5. DON'T blow the technical support of Creative - look at knowledge base located in their website. You can read all about the corruptions (how to format MUVO and many many others)<p>6. Baterry life is shorter when you use WMA encoding or when you use WMA and MP3 simultaneosly (because processor must switch between MP3 and WMA decoding). (my player lasts 9-10 hours with Duracell baterry)<p>7. Always check out the newest FIRMWARE. All problems with repeat function or with the WMA files is resolved with new FIRMWARE - DOWNLOAD IT!<p>This player is GREAT, you can talk anything about corruptions but for me it works PERFECT. I must learn some knowledge about it but actually i have player that WORKS GREAT (without any corruptions for about 5 months).<p>C'ya

<Content>I love the design of this product. It's a USB key disk with a built-in MP3 player. It's tiny, and runs on a single AAA batter for  several hours.<p>Unfortunately, the firmware has trouble reading the filesystem properly, it seems. You can't, say, delete an MP3 and replace it with a different one. The player will begin jumping around between tracks and will then stop reading altogether. If you want to change some of the music on it, you need to reformat it and start from scratch. Similarly, you can't mix data files and MP3s. In part, I wanted to use the MuVo to shuttle files around, and it just isn't very good for that.

<Content>It is a great idea to combine the portable USB 128 mb memory with a portable MP3 player. However, Creative LAB has failed to look at the obvious little details. <p>1. The USB 128 mb memory is not plug and play, this is totally unacceptable when most/all 128mb USB memory stick are plug and play in the industry. <p>2. The MP3 cradle gets hot when you leave your battery in it. Of course you can always take the battery out then it will cool down, but you won't be able to use it. <p>3. The battery slot cover is very poorly made that is difficult to close. You have to fiddle with it to get properly aligned in order to close the cover. ...this is not worth it.

<Title>handy removable storage and simple MP3 player
<Date>Fri Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The main problem is that there is a brief length of time after powering the unit off when it is still not safe to remove the player/memory from the power module.  The only time I had problems as described by others was when I was shuffling batteries in and out quickly trying to find a good one.  Fixed by a couple attempts at power on/off, no problems since then.  I just make sure I wait about 10 seconds after powering it off before I disconnect it, but this is a similar precaution that must be taken with most USB storage devices before unplugging them.  The Muvo needs the same treatment when being removed from the power pack as any MP3 players needs before being pulled from the computer.  Just follow proper procedure and wait a few seconds.

After spending a little time making sure my own system at home was up to snuff, this product has been great. <p>For these bad reviews from people that are having issues with this product, maybe you should take a little time and make sure that you have all of your drivers for your computer, and BIOS updated, that is not Creative's job, but your job. <p>Creative great product, maybe someday you will make a car system that this can feed into.

I bought my unit from Dell, and they were great in sending out a replacement, but after reading these reviews, I am not so sure I want to deal with this again. <br>Creative really did come up with a great idea, they just need to follow up and make it not only cute, but dependable.

<Date>Mon Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have the muvo, 2 weeks it dies. I put it away for a month. Then I finally called creative. Turns out, there is a bug that the player does not turn on when there has been data sorted on it. You need to go to the site and download a patch. Now mine works perfectly. So, I went from happy, to angry, to happy again.<p>Sound quality is great for earphones, but if you hook it up to a receiver, sound is ok, but not CD quality obviously.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Mon Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the perfect player to commute with.  It holds 30 to 40 songs, which gets me through about a week of traveling back and forth to school.  I am far from tech saavy and find this player easy to use precisely because it is uncluttered and has limited functions.  Since I am a law student and constantly tote around my laptop, it is the perfect player for me since it plugs directly into my computer with no extra wires.  I highly recommend it for anyone with a highly portable lifestyle.  The sounds is great and in four months I have had none of the problems that others are complaining of.

<Title>Do NOT buy this!  For many, it fails out of the box...
<Date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the MuVo 128 for Christmas.  It worked great until just after the 90-day warranty expired.  The power/play button locked up and would not power off.  After pressing each of the buttons to try to unfreeze it, I finally had to resort to pulling the memory stick/player out of its battery case.  After numerous emails to Creative's tech support and following their instructions, it still does not work.  When I asked to escalate the trouble ticket, they chose to ignore me and closed the ticket.  I replied to let them know how dissatisfied I was and that if someone didn't contact me by June 1, 2003 that I would begin contacting consumer watchdog reporters.  No response.  Currently, I preparing documentation and compiling negative customer reviews...to submit to a reporter who has contacted me.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT!  ...

<Title>Not bad
<Date>Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My first experience with MP3, and I can't say it's been the best.  Download is a bit cumbersome, and the control keys are hard to get used to.  Also, don't seem to get more than a couple of hours from the battery.  I'm going to try another manufacturer.

<Title>So easy to use and tiny to boot!
<Date>Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>After seeing this reviewed several times on TechTV, I purchased this mp3 player as my first one ever.  It's extremely easy to use and figure out, even for beginners.  The music transfers over quickly and you can use both MP3 &amp; WMA formats.  I love it's ability to hold files, photos and more as well.  It never skips or freezes and it's small enough to fit in your palm.  It uses a AAA battery so it doesn't weigh much at all.  The only down side that I can see are the size of the ear buds (they are too big for my ears and fall out often) but those are easily replaced.  You do have to hold down the play button for a few seconds to power it on and off, but I am pretty sure that feature was added so that it doesn't get turned on by accident (say, in your purse or pocket) and run down the batteries. All in all, I'm pretty happy with it and have had no problems.

<Title>Works for only a few months!!
<Date>Fri Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It seems that most of the glowing reviews for this product are from people who have only had their Muvo's for a couple of weeks.  I loved ours too - while it worked - but we also experienced the same thing I've recently read in these reviews. <br>About 3 days after the 3 month warranty expired the thing just died.  I emailed technical assistance and they guided me through the recovery process.  It worked for another 3 months, and then - after pushing the pause button - wouldn't play again.  We tried the same recovery exercise, emailed tech help again, and their final suggestion was that it must be defective & to send it back with $$$ to put towards 'repair or replacement'.  I don't know about you, but when I've already spent $$$ only 6 months before, I'd rather not sink more money into a defective product, or a company that won't do the right thing.  Bottom line - it's great at first, but spend your money for something that's great and lasts for a while!

<Title>This unit is  built to last
<Date>Sun Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Like many reviewers at this site, my unit locked up after a few months of use. It basically stopped playing music in the middle of a song. The red light stayed on and all the buttons failed to function. The standard repairs (new battery, reformat)didn't work. As a final effort prior to trashing the unit, I sent an email to Creative Labs. I emailed them at about 8 AM on a SUNDAY morning and I received a response in about four hours. They told me to download the newest utilities and reformat the unit twice. I did so and the unit started working again. It's been fine ever since.<p>I've also found that premiun brand alkaline batteries give twice the play hours of the cheaper store brands.<p>For sound quality try converting your music CDs to WMA files created with Microsoft Media Player 9. They sound much better then MP3s. Not all MP3 players are able to play WMA files, but the MuVo can. I would also recommend upgrading to better head phones. <p>This unit doesn't have all the feature the other units have, but it has all the features you need to hear quality music from a ultra tiny player.

<Content>Just like what the other people have posted. This product is very unrealiable. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Then it got to the point where you're unable to turn in off(I have to remove the batteries to power it off). And then one day it just stop playing. And the warranty just expired last month. <p>There are other products out there; don't waste your money on this.

<Title>MuVo Improves My Day Considerably
<Date>Tue Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Creative MuVo is an ultra-compact digital music player that will allow music enthusiasts to easily transfer MP3s, WMA files, or regular data files from place to place with a USB connector, and can hold up to two hours of music. <p>This device, designed with ease of use in mind, weighs less than an ounce, and is only slightly larger than your average butane lighter. Thankfully, the MuVo will play for up to 12 hours on a single AAA battery. No special drivers or cords are needed to operate it. <br>  <br>The MuVo comes with a set of bud headphones, and a lanyard if you want to carry it around your neck, or under your shirt, but I would recommend to Creative that they also package it with an adjustable velcro strap or clip-on case -- since almost everyone I sell a MuVo to intends to use it while jogging or running. <br>  <br>Since I also see people buying these two at a time (his and hers, sister/sister, roommates, etc.) I'd suggest to Creative that they might want to include some color stickers in the package to keep arguments down and help people more readily distinguish between the two. <br>  <br>The MuVo has a unique two piece design made of molded plastic. The light gray piece featured in the graphic above is essentially the memory stick (where files are stored), with a headphone jack on its right side, and a USB connector on its left (concealed by dark blue plastic on bottom left of graphic). The silver track and power controls are on the front of this gray piece, and the silver volume and loop buttons are on the bottom of this gray piece. The power button has a bright phosphorus green LED that can even be seen through a white tee shirt, if you were to wear the MuVo under your shirt as I sometimes do. <br>  <br>The larger blue piece, of the two-piece MuVo, is simply a receptacle for the gray piece -- and also holds the battery compartment. You can snap the two pieces together by pushing the gray memory stick into the socket of the blue grooved handpiece along a sliding track. <br>  <br>MuVo has a silver eyelet mount on its upper right corner -- ostensibly for people that may want to carry it on a keychain or hang it from a lanyard. After some short length of time I found it too easy to scratch, so I no longer carry it on my keychain as I did for awhile. <br>  <br>Be careful when removing the memory stick from its plugged-in state, especially when you are still attached to a computer. Make sure you have properly exited any open programs, as if you were to remove the stick memory abruptly it is possible to damage the flash memory. <br>  <br>Since I have both a PC and a Mac, I am happy to report that the MuVo can be operated off of either platform. On my PC I use my RealOne subscription to rip and convert files from CD to MP3 for use on the MuVo; and on the Mac I use iTunes to rip and convert files from CD to MP3 for use on the MuVo. <br>  <br>On either platform, after ripping and conversion, all you have to do is drag and drop the songfiles onto the device. A music file is a music file is a music file. Songs will usually play anywhere, no matter what your equipment. <br>  <br>Not only is the MuVo good for music, but it's great for carrying photos to another persons printer or computer, carrying a spreadsheet from work to home or vice versa, or toting a print job to a graphics company for output on their large-scale image setter. <br>  <br>Working off of my 9500X PC laptop, I can usually store two CDs of MP3 music on the MuVo. For some unknown reason, when working off my Mac with iTunes, I can only store one CD of MP3 music on it. I think maybe I'll need to read up on file-compression schemes unless somebody else out there has any ideas. I generally don't like the WMA format, but the file sizes are supposed to be more economical for storage and theoretically I should be able to fit more music on the MuVo when I'm using it in conjunction with the other computer in my home, so I think I will have to experiment with it a little more and get back with you later on this specific facet. <br>  <br>You may enjoy the MuVo much more if you have a cable broadband internet connection such as Comcast, a RealOne subscription, or access to either EZ CD Creator (PC), MusicMatch (PC), iTunes (MAC) software, or Limewire Pro (MAC). <br>  <br>I've been able to load pretty much anything I've tried to onto the MuVo, with the exception of a few tracks off of the George Harrison album Brainwashed, that, for whatever reason, just would not copy over correctly. I bought this MuVo a few months back, and although I now consider this MP3 player to be high priced for what it does, I am still basically happy with my purchase. <br>  <br>WHAT'S ON MY MUVO RIGHT NOW? <br>  <br>HOOTIE & THE BLOWFISH <br>New Self-Titled Album, Their Fifth Studio Release <br>  <br>Track 1 <br>Deeper Side <br>I found a reason to dig deep down <br>There's a part of you that, that I ain't found <br>It's in your deeper side <br>Instead of wondering what I should do <br>I tried to learn a couple of things about you <br>From your deeper side... <p>  <br>SOUNDS GREAT!

<Title>USELESS AND WORTHLESS
<Date>Sat Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the MuVo 3 months ago on www.Amazon.com and I must say that I am just on the brink of trashing it. Every time I want to use it, there is a new problem. The item completely crashed upon the third use and I had to reinstall the software which is not obvious. The worst is however that the playback volume of the MuVo is so low (subdued conversation level at max setting) that it is useless as an MP3 player unless you wish to listen to whispers of music.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Muvo player is by far the smallest and lightest player i have seen. It is unsurpassed in simplicity and ease of use, while the 128 megabites are enough to hold around 40 songs. <p>My computer runs windows 98 SE. The included software installs quickly and i was downloading songs just after a few minutes. There were no problems whatsoever.<p>The only downfall is the lack of a screen, but it is not exactly needed. Also, the battery does play for the published 12 hours. <p>The earbuds that come with it are good, for the free ones you get with a music player.<p>Just a hint, to get the songs in the order that you want, put them onto the player in the order you want them to be played. <p>The light and tiny muvo is perfect for even the smallest pockets. It gets great sound, and unlike one other review i saw, the volume does go very high. If you follow the instructions, even remotely, you wont have any trouble at all. <p>I have used mp3 players in the past, and this is by far, the smallest, lightest, simplest, and cheapest i have ever used. I reccomend it to all, except people who want more memory, then you may want a different one.

<Title>Best non-hard drive MP3 player
<Date>Sun May 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I take my MuVo snowboarding, and i love it.  It works perfectly 100 % of the time.  Ignore others' reviews that say it &quot;broke&quot;, because the same thing happened to me.  I believed my MuVo to be broken, and i was very upset and worried that i had wasted my money.  I wrote an email to cretive, asking for a replacement part, and i recieved an answer the next day.  It said that my muvo was not broken, instead it needed to be reformatted.  Within five minutes it was working perfectly again, and i still love it.  So anyone who reviews it and says the battery pack broke is wrong, they are just too lazy to spend a couple minutes writing to creative labs.  BEST 125$ YOU WILL EVER SPEND!

<Title>Bad idea for runners...good otherwise
<Date>Tue May 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>If you're looking for a product that will accompany you on long runs, this is not the one. The player comes with neck strap allowing the player to constantly move as you do. To keep it stable, you must use an armband (not included in this buy, see manufacturer's site for the limited edition bundle, same player with armband) or pin/tuck it into the waistband of your shorts. Then comes the fact that sweat (a big No-No) will get into the player, causing it to break very easily. This model is very volatile when it comes to any amount of moisture. I've only had the product for two months and although the sound quality is good and the downloading easy, it's not exactly practical for a workout model. I recommend this product for folks who aren't looking to take it into the gym.

Like the previous reviewer, i can also use the memory stick portion of the unit when its plugged into my USB port, but cannot get it to play any files when attached to the battery pack.<p>I called creative support and recieved no help at all since the warranty for these units is a paltry 3 months.  Apparantly Creative Labs is aware that these units are poorly made and break quickly, which is why they dont bother to warranty their work.<p>Save your money and purchase a unit from a company that actually cares about the quality of their work.

<Title>Lost data!
<Date>Tue May 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>When my new Fujitsu laptop came with a free MuVo (64MB version), I was pretty happy that I got a super-compact MP3 player, even though I save most of my MP3/WMA files on my iPaq 1910 Pocket PC.  But after one week of use, I was sorely disappointed with this poor-quality Korean-made product with the Creative Labs name.<p>I've been a fan of Creative Labs ever since I replaced my dead AdLib sound card with a Creative over 10 years ago.  Over the years I've been happy with their sound cards, so the poor quality of the MuVo came as a very sore disappointment for a loyal customer like myself.  Let me tell you what happened.<p>I loaded the MuVo with about 10 songs.  I went on a short trip, and when I got off the plane, I found the files on the MuVo corrupted!  It couldn't have been an airport X-ray scanner problem, since both my iPaq 1910 and my Panasonic e-wear camcorder are totally fine, no errors with their flash memory.  I reformatted the MuVo and loaded a few new songs, but as I type this right now, one of them is corrupted and not playable.<p>Since I got this free, I probably shouldn't whine, but judging from recent reviews of Creative Labs products posted here on Amazon, I don't think they are the same innovative, customer-friendly small company from Singapore any more.

We'd get it started, it would work for several weeks, then simply stop and refuse to play. <p>There appear to be fundamental flaws in both the the design and production of this device.

Also, it's cool that it will store any type of file (in fact, that's about all that remains cool about it).  But that's where the good stuff ends.<p>I ignored all the amazon comments about this player's poor reliability.  I bought one.  It stopped working after THREE DAYS.  Support from creative has been horrible.  It just gives up the ghost, and no amount of reformatting or cursing will help.  <p>Oddly, it keeps files just fine... so I now have a fine method for transfering files between machines.  Alas, I could have bought a 128MB smartcard (or other media) for much cheaper.  <p>But no matter the idea that it transfers files, my muvo won't play music.  Must be a problem in the interface between the two pieces of hardware... don't know; not my concern.<p>THREE DAYS.  That's it.  Poof.  Spend your money on something else!

<Content>Don't discredit this incredible MP3 player!<p>When I got mine for my birthday in April, of course it broke on the fourth time turning it on...just expect to wait two weeks instead of one for this player, (one week for the original, one for the replacement) and make sure to test it like crazy. leave it on through the nights, continually transfer music files (and any other files) on and off of it, and make sure that it breaks within your warranty, because it will break.<p>You may not understand why I'm supporting a flaky product, but let me tell you that it's a REALLY GOOD flaky product. On the second or third try you will get a PERFECT Muvo, you just have to be patient, and believe me, it's worth it. Besides, the customer service is excellent anyway, so don't worry about slow email responses or mailing fees. just accept it as part of the process for this little treasure.<p>This thing has INCREDIBLE sound (especially if its hooked up with Koss &quot;The Plug&quot; earphones, then it REALLY rocks), a simple user interface (the less buttons, the less things to break), and a really cool way to transfer files. Throw away the CD that comes with this...any modern PC recognizes it as a removable device in which you can simply drag and drop files window to window. And by the way, there are no cords--that little white piece slides out and plugs right in to the back of your computer...incredibly simple.<p>Overall, this light-weight, high-quality, totally cool MP3 player goes only to those who deserve such a product, after all good things come to those who wait. Think of the extra weeks as a test, and only those who pass it get the benefits, just don't forget those Koss plugs!<p>P.S. This MP3 player is really, really, cool...trust me.

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Wed Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this MP3 player as a graduation gift for my sister.  We opened it and plugged it into the USB port and the computer deteched it fine.  We then copied the MP3s to the memory and that's when the problems came up.  Some kind of memory corruption occurred and the Muvo was in Recovery Mode.  No problem I thought, I'm a Computer Engineer and I can figure it out.  I went onto Creative Labs website, downloaded the latest drivers, performmed all the formatting instructions and the problem was still not fixed.  The LED was not even lighting up meaning that there was a major hardware/communication problem going on.  After fiddling all night on different operating systems I finally gave up.  Creative Labs Tech support was pretty useful, they told me to return the item.  I guess I should have known on an item with a warranty of 3 months- what a joke, a device that costs over [$$$] with a 3 month warranty.  My particular Muvo could have been a dud, but after reading all the other reviews I doubt it is more than coincidence.  Stay away from this thing, it still has tons of issues.

<Content>Woow, so out of specification. Nothing is right<br>about this product. Yes, the sound quality is good<br>but ony when the battery is full, otherwise you usually<br>get static noise nothing else. THe only advantage<br>of it is being small and ability to be used as a usb<br>drive. I'd only recomend you to think twice, nope ten<br>times buying before this product, it smells trouble<br>it is trouble. A good example of a bad product causing<br>a company it's brand name..no more creative for me.

<Title>Survived the laudry!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have a love-hate relationship with this product.  It has failed for me maybe twice but always worked again after reformatting the drive.  Once it quit after I put some files into a folder instead of just putting it on the drive (I don't recommend doing that) and the other time it failed I dropped it from about 1.5 ft.  Today I left it in my pants that I washed and I thought for sure it was ruined.  AMAZINGLY it still works great.<br>Great sound.  Small enough to fit in the back of my mountain bike jersey when biking.  Great design and ease of use.  A little unreliable.  Very pleased but not quite 5 stars.

<Title>Great for Portability, Storage and Sound for its size
<Date>Mon Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is my first MP3 player. I'd been looking at a number of players for a long time. My criteria were <p>i) portability, <br>ii) storage, that can carry more than an hour of music, and <br>iii) above average sound quality. This was it. <p>I was able to transfer music files to the player within 5 min of opening the package and out jogging with it in an hour! My complaint about it is its plastic covering that make it look flimsy... but make it light. Some features worth noting.... there's no random playing, no display screen and always start with the first song. But this is it if you're looking for a good portable player!

<Title>Simplicity itself
<Date>Tue Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>It may have no lcd screen, it may lack decent play modes (random), and may come with very poor headphones but i love my little MuVo. Its so simple to use. <br>Using Windows Explorer to put files on the player couldn't be simpler and means i can upload where ever i find a computer with a USB port without mucking about with cords and specialist software.<p>The sound quality is good despite the lack of an equaliser. <br>The battery life is about 10 hours which is excellent compared to my last mp3 player. <p>Finally a mp3 player to get excited about.

<Title>Opinion - not a review
<Date>Tue Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was considering purchasing this product because of its size and capacity (128mb version).  I also loved the fact that it doubles as portable storage for data transfer.  I read reviews including one in PC Magazine that were good and some stated that the MuVo has great sound quality.<p>Because MuVO works by just plugging into a USB port and does not have management software I was wondering how I can control the order of songs in the player.  I asked Creative and below is the answer.  Additionally, please note that this product does not have a Random Play option.<p>Also note that it has been reported that you cannot play songs that are stored in a folder in the player.  Only root songs will play.<p>Here's Creative's response to play order:<p>&quot;When transferring files to the NOMAD MuVo, the playlist order will be that of the files copied to the MuVo. If they are transferred in Alpha Numeric order then the NOMAD Muvo will play them in the same order. <p>To change the order, the files will need to be removed from the NOMAD MuVo and re-added back on in the order they are to be played.<p>To change the order of files:<p>Create a new folder on your desktop and set the view to Details.<p>Move the files from the NOMAD MuVo to this new folder in the order desired..<p>Copy the files back to the NOMAD MuVo now.&quot;

<Title>Great device!
<Date>Thu Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This little keychain usb storage device works great for that purpose...but even better, it's an mp3 player!<br>You couldn't ask for a smaller player, and the sound quality is really excellent.  It does sacrifice some features, no equalizer, no display, no adding storage cards, but none of these are anything I really miss.<br>What's truly excellent is that it will store and move any files you have...a powerpoint, a movie, a bunch of image files, your doctoral dissertation, whatever.  The 128meg version holds plenty of songs, and still room for files.<br>I'm also really pleased with the ease of use.  NO software necessary (well, you will need a driver if you use Win98, and it won't work at all with NT).  Just plug it into a USB port, and it shows up as a drive in Windows Explorer or My Computer...you can drag and drop at will.<br>If you like MusicMatch Jukebox, you can use that to make playlists, and just export them to the device.<br>If you want a full-featured mp3 player, you can probably do better.  But if you're looking for a &quot;keychain&quot; usb storage drive anyhow, get this little beauty and you'll have the mp3 player, too.<br>The only cons are that it won't work with Windows NT, and that it has no &quot;random&quot; or &quot;shuffle&quot; mode.  Other than that, I'm completely happy with it.

<Title>Amazing Product
<Date>Sun Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I got the 128MB version of this product, but except for storage capacity both models are the same.  The first thing that gets you is the size.  The photos don't do it justice.  Like, it's really, really small. We're talking 1 1/4 x 2 3/4 x 1/2 (inches).  And, it weighs almost nothing.<p>There have been some negative comments on this product, but I feel the negatives are what make this product what it is.  You see, you have to look at this thing as a USB memory module -- that just happens to play music.  One complaint has been the lack of a display, but a display would just make it bigger.  Another complaint has been the lack of a memory.  When you turn it off it starts back at the beginning.  Well, I assume a memory feature would use up battery life.  And another complaint has been a lack of controls.  I mean, how many controls do you need?  It's so simple I had it up and running 10 minutes after opening the box, and that includes loading files onto it.<p>It does feel kinda cheap (plastic), but the controls work well, and the only problems I've had are sometimes when you click to move up or down a track it might miss by a track.  Fast foward is not audible, so you hold the button and guess.  Otherwise, it works extremely well.<p>Another thing that makes this product unique is that the memory module separates from the battery compartment and plugs right into a USB port.  No drivers are needed for Window Me/2000/XP, but you will have to load the included drivers if you use Windows 98.  I work on a lot of computers and often have to transfer files from one to another.  The MuVo makes this a snap.  And hey, if you happen to load a few MP3 files on it you can listen to some tunes while you're walking from one office to another.  <p>Sound quality is determined by how good your MP3 files are and your headphones.  I have a pair of Sonys that do sound better than what comes with it, but not much.  And here's a tip:  The free version of sofware that came with your CDRW may not rip MP3 files at 128kb (about the lowest quality that sounds decent).  I did a bit of searching around and found a program called CDex that works quite well at getting decent quality MP3 files off your CDs -- and it's free!<p>The MuVo also has a repeat function.  You push a button at the beginning of where you want the repeat to start, and again where you want it to end.  While this is a lot of work if you want to listen to one track over and over, it's perfect for any musician trying to learn a song.<p>If you're looking for CD quality and lots of features, I suggest you get a good skip-proof portable CD player.  But, if you want a very small MP3 player that sounds pretty damn good, and is extremly small and lightweight, this is a great product.  By the way, everbody I've shown this to has been amazed at both the sound quality and the size.

<Title>Good Things DO Come In Small Packages!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Anybody on the fence on this one needs to get off the fence and experience the awesome sound quality in this little package!  It's great for jogging and working out at the gym, it just fits in your pocket or hangs on the cord they give to put around your neck, without getting in the way.  It was beyond easy to download songs onto it!  Creative you have made my day!  I'm looking forward to 256mb unit in the future.  This is one purchase you won't be sorry you made-it was well worth the investment!

<Title>If you want simple - buy this one.
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my little neffew.  This is his first MP3 player.  This player is very simple, and non-frustrating for a first-timer.  It does what it does quite well, and it is about the size of a pack of gum.  However, if you can still find this one (it has been discontinued by the manufacturer), and you want simple, buy it!

<Title>This is very good, durable product.
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this 64MB Muvo from WalMart, like 4 years ago, when I was in college. It's still working properly. It can take high temparature. I keep this machine in my car and I live in Florida. It's very hot in sunny day in Florida. But this machine is working fine. I dropped this machine many time on the concrete floor, and it's working fine as like nothing happended.  Only problem is its memory size. It's 64MB. Actuall memory we can use is like 54 MB. It provide drag and drop transfer, which is very convinient. I know some MP3 player requires convert format of files when we transfer into machine. I can store like 10 songs in this machine. But I can re-loaded song when I got tired of songs. Someday, I will get new larger memory MP3 player. But I am okay with this product right now.   I think current MP3 player manufactures do not know what customers want. They just put many un-neccesary features like Text view, photo view, and Video view, Voice recording and etc, which most of cunsumers will never use.  What I want from MP3 player is  1. Durability like this machine and  2. Easy Inteface(Easy Usability) like Ipod. 3. Quality sounds like Samsung mp3 players.
