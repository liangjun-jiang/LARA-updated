<Title>Finally, the drag and drop MP3 player I have always wanted
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the Sony Network Walkman and the Apple Nano Ipod.  Both sucked with the proprietary software to get MP3s on to the device.  This is the best MP3 player out there right now.  The only reason why I gave it 4 starts was due to the USB cable which has a proprietary connector.  If you lose this cable, you are screwed and will have to try and buy a replacement from SanDisk.

<Title>By far the BEST flash mp3 player on the market
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the e270 about two weeks ago and really put it through it's paces.  I travel on a plane about 10 hours each week, so I've gotten some use out of it.  Oh, and I watch tv shows on it too, which is surprisingly tolerable given the small screen size.  Positives: -The screen is way bigger than a Nano, and it's really nice -Plays Video -User changeable battery (when they release it, which I'm sure will be soon) -Flash upgradable using MicroSD (also, there will be full albums coming out in MicroSD compatible "gruvi" cards) -Sound recorder, with easy to use record button -VERY VERY sturdy, with a metal back, that looks great and does not scratch easily (I don't even have a case) -Plays FM radio -6gb for the same price or less than a 4gb nano  Negatives: -The charger is USB only which for 98% of people is not an issue, but if you need one reportedly the Griffin Powerblock works fine, as I would suspect any charger that allows a usb cable to be plugged in -A bit thicker than the nano, but I actually prefer the e200 form factor

<Title>Love It
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a beautiful player, a little bit bigger than the IPOD nano but that doesn't bother me. The fact that it has FM, and can hold pics and video is enough that I can deal with it being a little bit bigger and maybe heavier, but it's negligible.  Good: I like the scroll whell on this. I don't like the IPOD scrolls because I always move past the selection that I want or tab it by accident and select something I didn't want. This, you feel the wheel click so that won't be a problem. The buttons around the wheel is a bit small but I have small fingers so it's not a big deal. The interface is easy, I just dragged my music over and it was fine. Battery life is great. I already watched one movie and listened to ~5 hours of music and I still have 3/4 of my battery.   Bad: You have to use a computer to charge it. When it plays movies, it pauses in between scenes for about 5-30 secs which can be annoying. The screen is a bit small that you can't see the pics too clearly but it's a small player with a flash drive, so that's unavoidable. You have to convert the movies/pictures using their converter, which freezes my computer sometimes and it takes a while for it to transfer movies (~20 min for a 650MB movie). Also, there aren't that many accessories you can buy for it. I've been trying to buy an adaptor so I can use it in my car but haven't been able to find anything. And when you plug it into the computer, you can't do anything to the player.   Overall, I think it's a great player. It's a flash drive, so you can take it running and not worrying about possibly damaging the harddrive inside. I originally had Creative Zen Sleek Photo but returned it and got this one and I'm VERY glad, not that Creative don't make great mp3 players but this one is much smaller and has video and I can exercise with it (assuming I get off my butt and actually go to the gym)

<Title>So far I love it!!
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this from Amazon a few weeks ago and so far I love it.   I had an iPod 30GB video player that died loading songs the first time.  Apple replaced it and then the replacement died the same way.   (Apple gave me a full refund to their credit!)   I'm not sure why my iPod didn't work and so I've been a little gun shy with the SanDisk, but I haven't broken it yet!   Turns out, when Windows Media Player tries to sync with the device - it get's screwed up.  (Hold down the power button for 20 seconds to reset.)  But - when I drag and drop files - it works perfectly.  The album art is not displayed on the SanDisk and the Windows help site has an item on their FAQ about this saying it is a SanDisk problem.  Also, the radio reception is not the greatest, wish it had a little antena or something.  Also, I'd really like a wall charger for it.   Other than that it's perfect!   I REALLY like it - and - I haven't broken it which is amazing considering my experience with iPods.   Update on 7/14/2006.   The Sansa did lock up when trying to load over 700 songs until I did the following: 1)  Changed the USB Mode Setting to MSC from MTP. 2)  Formatted the Sansa from Windows specifing "Fat-32" - You need to be in MSC mode to specify Fat-32 formatting. 3)  Then I changed back to MTP mode and haven't had it lock up anymore.     Maybe with a new firmware update this won't happen, but I read about this tip on the web and it helped me.    Also - the odd song doesn't show up on the player (but IS in the Sansa Music folder when you view it through Windows) and I have to copy it over again for it to show up to play the song.  Also, I wish there was a easy way to merge songs in WMP like there is in iTunes.  And I still am not getting the Album Art to show up.   However, I have to say I LOVE this thing and I've been very happy.

<Title>Do All The People Who Have Reviewed This Product Work for SanDisk??
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>They must b/c I don't know how they're all so happy with it.  I'm not going to write a long diatribe here, but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270.  For starters, it's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services. It is compatible with Rhapsody, but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer. The MTC protocol (see, I told you it is difficult. . . and I'm not that technologically savvy) only works with USB 2.0, not 1.1, which I have.  Also, it scratches way easily. If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it.   The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next, but the scroll wheel is pretty cool.   I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better. The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you're in the gym or on a plane, you can hear all sorts of backround noise b/c it isn't loud enough. (And yes, I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $150 and I'm still not pleased with the sound performance).  I can't totally trash the player, although I'm super dissapointed with it. . .especially in light of how much money I spent on it.  Customer Support has been great. Quick and responsive. The player design is cool. It's small, but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate. The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking.  Overall, if you're looking for a player that's compatible with all of the music to go, subscription-based services, look further than the e270. If you are cool with paying per song, go with the Nano and itunes. Oh, and who cares about the expansion slot. 6GBs are enough.

<Title>Good, Serviceable Player
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This marks my 3rd MP3 player and I have been quite happy with it.  It doesn't have the capacity of some of the larger hard drive based players, but I've discovered that I don't really miss the capacity.  I had a 20 GB  player that I was very happy with until I left it on a plane, but I'm not sure that the extra capacity was worth the extra size, it was over twice the size of my Sansa.   I also have a smaller 1 GB player that I'm giving to a friend now that I have this one, 1 GB just wasn't enough capacity and the player itself was also just too small. The biggest plus I see with this player is that they have FINALLY incorporated the feature I've been screaming for ever since these players first came out, a flash card slot.  With flash card capacities now getting into the multiple GB range, I've been after a player that accepted cards in essence giving you unlimited capacity, as long as you're willing to buy more flash cards.

<Title>Doesn't work
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful machine, and I was very excited to buy it. Unfortunately, it locked up twice, once while synchronizing, WMP 10, and once while listening. Both times I could not turn it off, and it was unresponsive. I did not call tech support, because I have little patience for products that don't work as they should.

<Title>Very, very Satisfied
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I narrowed my selection to the 4G Nano, and the Sansa e270.  I selected the Sansa due to 1)Larger memory, 2) Available expansion slot, 3) Larger screen, 4) More Durable, and 5) It was different from what everyone else had.  The unit worked perfectly right out of the box.  The large display was excellent (I can't read a damn thing without my glasses, ^$#& middle age), I don't need my reading glasses to navigate and make my choices.  Sound was just as good as my Discman (I picked up some higher quality earphones, the ones that are included are good, the ones I added were better).  The unit was extremely easy to use, and stored practically everything of interest I had, from Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears to Green Day and Velvet Revolver.  And still has room for more.  FM reception sucks, but be serious, if FM radio was any good after Clear Channel ruined the industry, why buy a MP3 player in the first place?  The only down side is item 5) in my criteria, since its not an I-pod like everyone else, there are very few accessories.  Other than that, I'm happy with my choice, and would make the same one again.

<Title>Video clips?  Not really.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported. However, the video clip implementation is terrible.   They list a variety of supported clip formats. THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device. Everything must be converted. This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files. Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings. Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly. It will not work.   You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.   1. You are supposed to be able to import VOBs. WRONG. It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone. There is no way around this bug.   2. You have absolutely no control over compression settings. If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate. The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.   3. If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these. There is no way to avoid this. If you try to join the files, they will not play.   4. The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.   5. The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.    Pros:   This is really a nifty player.  I like the wheel implementation.  The battery life is amazing.  I have run full color videos with maximum sound and had battery left after 8-10 hours...I did not have patience to test further.  However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future. You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk. If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.   I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.    Update  The firmware is very unstable.  Do NOT try and read data from the unit, or it will go into a nearly infinate loop "UPDATING DIRECTORY".  You will need to reset several times, and if your file is large, wait up to an HOUR for the function to either work or fail.  Very frustrating.  ONLY use this unit with the supplied software and ONLY with Windows Media Player for management.  Anything else is a recipe for potential disaster.  I talked to SanDisk USA support, and they confirmed were aware of some of my observations.  Firmware updates are to fix these things.....someday.

<Title>Not worth it
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the SanDisk SDMX4-6144 Sansa e270 6 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot a few weeks ago and I am very disappointed.  The features seemed to be a better value that the Apple Ipod Nano but the thumb wheel for selection feels cheap and requires quite a bit of pressure to operate.  If you have a lot of songs on the unit, you will wish there was an easire way.  Also, after 2 1/2 weeks of use, the unit froze up on me during a synchronization and I have had to return it.  I am getting a refund and buying a Nano instead.

<Title>iPod lovers beware...
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPOD lovers beware.  There's a new player in town. The Sandisk Sansa E200 series.  Now for the review:  The iPod nano.  You can listen to music and look at photos. 4gb.  $250.  I don't get it.  The Sansa Sandisk.  You can look at photos, watch movies, listen to music, listen to FM, record FM, record VOICE, expand the memory via microSD cards, etc. for less than $250 for a 6gb player.  I have had my 4gb Sansa Sandisk, and directly compared it to an iPod nano 4gb.  Here's my thoughts. 1. Screen is better on the Sansa E200 series, brightness is unmatched 2. Back of Sansa is extremely difficult to scratch, Nano is very easy to scratch. 3. Sounds quality: Equal footing, i couldn't tell the difference between the two. 4.Navigation: I almost prefer the iPod nano on this one.  The Jog dial on the Sansa is a bit too tactile for my taste.  However, I am now use to it and doesn't harm my enjoyment of the Sansa. 5. Sansa e200 series you can import photos...such a small screen its not very worthwhile to put a high-detailed photo on there, but some photos look good. Ipod the same. 6. Sansa you can watch movies. I imported a Family Guy episode, and imported Lawrence of Arabia onto the Sansa.  Family guy episode went great, and fast.  It was only around 15-20 minutes long, and the sansa had to break up the file.  However, the only pause I saw once it transitioned from the first file to the second was a slight "jump" in the film and a small distortion in the sound.  Not bad at all!  Lawrence was the same, but the 4th file didn't copy over at all. Not sure where it went. I tried again, and it copied just fine.  The movie plays great.  Software is okay, but fine overall. 7. Accessories.  This is where any MP3 player looses out.  Apple is everywhere with iPod.  Car stereos, speaker docks, etc.  Time will tell how well Sansa competes in this area. 8. Battery life.  My sansa played music for a total of 18:42.  The Nano (with the same playlist) played only for 14:55.  Thats almost 4 hours extra.  Nice job Sansa!  And the battery is user-replaceable! 9. Software.  I used Rhapsody, Media Monkey, and iTunes to sort and transfer music to the MP3 players.  Itunes only worked with the IPOD, and Rhapsody and Media Monkey were fine with the Sansa. I much prefer Rhapsody than Itunes.  The feel of it, the ease of transfering, the playlist/last listened to features are superb, though itunes is good as well (it just won't work with the Sansa) 10. Stability:  Nano wins here.  The Sansa is on its 2nd firmware release, and a 3rd one promising a LOT of improvements is just around the corner (as of 7/14/06).  The Sansa has locked up once while transfering music, and locked up for 10 seconds while I was trying to back out of a movie.  The Nano never once locked up.  Good job Apple, but Sandisk is giving their Sansa a lot of support.  Overall I love my Sansa.  For the price i paid for the 4gb ($150 on deal, coupon) at almost $100 LESS than the Nano, the Sansa wins by a good margin of features for the price.  I just hope Sansa keeps up with developing new firmware to help out the stability of the player as well as add new features.  This and more accesories.  I talked to Sandisk and they said a compatible speaker dock as well as a car charger/FM broadcaster were going to be released this fall for the e200 series.  Sandisk, i give your Sansa a 5-star rating.  Ipod Nano, compared to the Sansa I knock you down to a 4-star rating.

<Title>Not so bad
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What I like about the sansa e270 is the fact that I can play videos, mp3s and listen to the radio. when I'm walking on the streets I like to listen to the radio, when I'm on the subway train I play mp3s or watch a movie, that's pretty much what I need, the picture thing, I don't care about it. A way to make this mp3 player the best is improving the radio reception and the sound like any sony product. It sounds good, but it will be excellent if it has bass boost.

<Title>I'm so glad I waited!
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been researching and looking at mp3 players for almost two years.  I finally decided I preferred a flash-drive versus a hard drive, and I really wanted a battery that was user-replaceable. I didn't want an iPod, mainly because I felt like part of a herd - - I knew other options were just around the corner.  I've been looking at the Sansa products for quite some time now, and was nearly going to settle for a 1gb w/expandable SD memory card capability.  Then I found the Sansa e270, with 6 gbs of memory and expandable with a microSD!  For just over two hundred bucks, I got more than enough mp3/wma storage, PLUS a beautiful color screen to watch movies/video/pictures, a voice recorder to remind myself to pick up milk on the way home, and an FM radio (with capability to record off the radio - - do people still do that?)!  It has been so easy to convert my cds to wmas and synch them using Windows Media Player.  It even puts the album cover in for me.  It is so cute!  It is black, and sleek, and the buttons are very easy to use, even with my big hands and long fingernails, I don't have any trouble getting it do to what I want it to do.  I am assuming Sansa will be adding more accessories in the near future.  I would love a car adaptor and more selection in covers (only grey and white are available now).  The propietary cable is not a big concern to me, but I hear Sansa now has them available.  The sound is great, too!  All in all, I am quite pleased and very happy with my selection.

<Title>Very disappointed in this product
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've waited 6 months for this production only to find it very dispointing.  I've had an IPOD, Zen, and I've always wanted to search for a better player.  I thought this was it.  The ideas are great.  But the way the product was implented was terrible.  Here's some of the pros/cons:  Pros: Nice color screen, the size is small and feels good in my palm, the recording feature, the photo and video feature, the micro SD feature.  Cons: #1 disapointment of all is the navigation and control of this terrible, terrible device.  the scroll wheel is raised up too high and it is too slow in scrolling up and down.  It is raised up so high that the 4 buttoms surrounding it can't even be pressed.  You gotta use your long nail to press those little buttoms.  You have to rely on those little buttoms that are so hard to press to navigate through songs and FF/FR through your songs.  Besides the Pros I've listed, everything about this thing really kills me and pissed me off.  Now I have to sell it back on ebay since I can't return it for a full refund because I've opened the package.

<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me begin by saying "I am NOT a tech head".  I struggle to get by with most computer related technologies.  I have had no problems learning and using this mp3 player.  I like the fact that I can use the Microsoft software and all I did was plug the player in and the music was down loaded.  I added all of my CD's and was able to carry over 1200 songs with me on my last road trip.  I also use this with my workouts.  I only use the player for music.  I was considering the Apple Nano initially.  The software and Itune monopoly and high cost forced me to consider this product, I am very glad I did.  Alot of people have mentioned that they don't like the "cheap" feel of the wheel; I agree with that.  I also agree that the four buttons around the wheel are marginally hard to get use to.  If you have been considering a flash mp3 player, this one should be at the top of your list.

<Content>This MP3 player is good and easy to use, and easy to download music from your CDs from Windows Media Player. However one big drawback, the Sansa does not have a recharge plug.  The USB plug must be pluged into the USB port of ones computer, which is OK if one has their computer on, however on the road without a computer can pose a problem if one needs to recharge their Sansa e270.  This was an over sight or SanDisk had their head where the sun does not shine when they designed this system.  Hopefuly SanDisk will see the light and continue to give iPod a run for the money.
