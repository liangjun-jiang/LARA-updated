<Title>Hardware Problems
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First let me say that overall, this is not a bad mp3 player. The internet radio is a great feature (especially when you aren't willing to pay for premium services like satellite radio). The menu transitions seemed to lag a bit, but that could be resolved with future firmware updates. However, I rated this for two stars because of unreliable hardware. The first one I had would overheat and shutdown when it was playing and charging with a car adapter. After a days use it also started to turn itself on everytime the player was plugged in and lock up before it finished loading. If I plugged in the player while playing music, it would also lock up. I sent that back for a replacement, which had a nonfunctional volumn down button. If you really need WiFi capabilites, wait for something better to come along.

<Title>Wifi????
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Sansa Connect arrived yesterday afternoon and I spent the rest of the evening trying to get it to connect to my home wireless internet, my neighbor's unsecured network, anything. Nada! I even took the MAC filtering off my home wireless router, completely disabled all security, and it still would not connect. VERY frustrating.

<Title>If you like Yahoo! Music and Internet Radio, you will love this
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best Father's Day gift I have ever gotten. To really enjoy it, though, you need a subscription to Yahoo! Music Unlimited To Go. Depending upon promotions, this will cost anywhere from $7-14 a month, and will allow you to download basically whatever albums and songs you want from the 2 million in Yahoo's catalog for that one fee. No more paying for each song or album.  With that subscription, the player really comes alive. You can do things like listen to Internet Radio customized to your musical tastes (you rate songs as you listen and it learns from that--an awesome way to discover new music). If you like the song that's playing, you can instantly download it (or the entire album) to your player--no computer required. You can also download mixes of songs that Yahoo! thinks you'll like, again without a computer. If you like a song, you can tell the player to make a mix like that song. The entire mix gets downloaded to the player and updates in the background as you listen to it. This is of course in additon to the standard procedure of transferring music from your computer to the player, which you can also do.  In a nutshell, this player is the Yahoo! Music experience made portable, and it's what I've wished for ever since I first discovered their excellent Launch (Internet) Radio. If you like discovering new music, as opposed to just buying a few favorite albums and listening to them over and over again, this is the player for you.

<Content>bought this as a gift for my wife after she lost her ipod. she absolutely loved it. it was easy to set up and she can upload the songs herself and can always have a "fresh" selection. battery life could be better, but the player will work while recharging, so no worries there.

<Title>Wonderful Internet Radio
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having Yahoo! Launchcast Plus included with my AT&T DSL service, this Sansa Connect player has been a great way to enjoy internet radio without having to use my computer.  The stations are far more varied musically than satellite radio, and I am planning to drop my Sirius subscription to use Launchcast Plus and the Sansa Connect exclusively.  The interface is easy to use, and the screen is bright and has lots of active animations.  In fact, it is easier to mark and access favorite stations in Sansa Connect than on the Launchcast website (and it's impossible to do so in the Yahoo! Music Jukebox application).  So why not 5 stars?  Here are some disadvantages: the device is compatible with neither networks that have hidden (non-broadcasted) SSID's nor with networks with WPA-Enterprise encryption.  So, if you have a non-broadcasted SSID for security's sake, you'll have to start broadcasting it to use with the Sansa.  Furthermore, if your school's wireless uses WPA-Enterprise encryption, you won't be able to use it there.  Hopefully, Sandisk will start supporting these kinds of networks.  Finally, I haven't found a way to listen to "fan" stations that are related to the genre stations.  For example, on the Web, you can listen to the Noa fan station from the Middle Eastern page, but there is no similar access on the Sansa Connect.

<Title>The Unlimited to go service the WiFi depends on may be shutting down
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unfortunately yahoo has just removed the "Unlimited to go" option from their website unless you've bought a Sansa Connect.  Based on that and reports in reputable sources such as the WSJ and other business based reporting it may be that the "To Go" option is being phased out. Actually, IMHO, I think that Yahoo is coming to the realization that the Unlimited to go pricing model just doesn't work.  It's based on the assumption that a person will only download about 8 - 9 new songs per month to their MP3 Players (figured as $.79 per song and the price differential between monthly Unlimited and Unlimited to go subscriptions).  Most people, when they learn the potential for 'all you can eat music' download much more than that.  From a financial point of view the $6.00/month "sample all the music you want on your PC" and then get a $.20 discount for buying the music makes much more sense.  Unfortunately this will cause major problems with the Connect unless they can set up an option for an "Unlimited" account to be accessed on the unit and then you hit a "Click here to buy" function.  This will also required them to allow for a wider access to their on-line store through the Connect something which may not be possible. Oh well, I'm just glad that I'd found this out before I bought a Connect for my son for his birthday, I'll now consider a satellite radio/mp3 player (such as the Inno (we're XM fans)) or just get a something like a view or the E series unit. The only advantage I ever saw in the Connect was the ability to wireless transfer music and playlists and since that may be going away I'm going to stay clear of the device.  Without the wireless download capabilities the device offers no advantage over the other Sandisk players and I'm not going to pay the premium for a functionality which may become useless in the near future.

<Title>The Mother of All Devices
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I happen to be a SONYphile...I live a SONY lifestyle...well, that's what they wanted wasn't it...but to this day, other than a player that plays movies which I rarely have time to watch...will anyone, including SONY come out with a small and attractive device as cool as this.  Ooops, it plays movies too by using their Media Converter...so watching your favorite flicks while eating lunch or waiting for the Doctor is a snap.  I've been a MusicMatch guy for years and was rather pissed when Yahoo! bought them out...BUT, wait...Yahoo Music Unlimited To Go is the coolest service on the planet.  I own a Creative Zen Vision M (retired) and could load all of the music that I had downloaded from Yahoo! on to that baby and listen to it in my car...DEAD!  Now I own this little WiFi bugger and it is the absolute best.  Recently, Yahoo! upgraded the software on this device to give you much more latitude in your music attitude...you can now download any artist using the scroll wheel to spell the name out...or just stream your Yahoo Music Playlists, whcih update immediately after creating on your PC...It is unbelievable, really what this device provides.  As others have said, it offers an enormous library of music that is easy to download and sync with either Yahoo! Music on your PC or thru Windows Media Player 11.  I have a little SONY Bluetooth transmitter that I hook up to this rig and play my tunes thru my SONY Bluetooth headunit in my truck as well; I have the Kyocera KR1 Mobile Router with a Sprint EVDO Card and can play Launchcast Internet Radio thru this device in my car...it is very cool and the sound is of the best quality...almost no gaps as this device has a large buffer cache.  All in all, it's the best $120.00 that I ever spent...but unfortunately, I'm still gonna have to feed my SONY Jones and get the new   NWZ-A818 Silver...because, like Mt. Everest...it is there.  If you take me up on my advice, I hope that you too enjoy this little and versatile music device.  All the best,  Warren

<Title>Just too cool!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved my Connect for several months now but the latest software update really puts it over the top. My biggest complaint before was that you could not search for specific songs from your Yahoo unlimited music subscription but the latest update allows you to do that and more! By more I mean you can search by song, artist and album but on top of that you don't need to download to listen you can just stream if you are in WI-FI range. Sansa has basically turned this into a MP-3 player with a 3 million song capacity. And if your leaving the hot spot just download. Why anyone would consider buying an i-pod and spending $.99 a song when you can get this device for $108.00, spend $120 for a two year subsciption and never pay for music again no matter how much you listen to. Like I said just too cool!

<Title>Great Product, almost
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great features, great construction, great concept.  What's wrong then?  Battery life is ABYSMAL.  I'm talking 30-40 minutes when the device was brand new and running on a full charge.  In my opinion it's pretty much unconscionable to ship a portable music player that isn't really portable for more than 30-40 minutes.  Even with the WiFi turned off it's not much better.  Contrast this to my 5th generation iPod (which the Sansa was intended to replace) which gets 13-20 hours per charge.  I never even worry if it's charged or not, it always just seems to have plenty of battery life.  I was excited to receive the Sansa Connect, even told all my friends about the concept of unlimited downloads.  Sadly I'm very disappointed with the product.  I don't think it's worth paying a subscription fee to Yahoo Music when the device isn't even portable -- I could just stream music for free if I wanted to be tied to only places with power available.  The other very bad thing about this product is that if you are already a Yahoo Music Jukebox user it's nearly impossible to get the software for the Sansa to work properly.  Unlike with an iPod where you just plug it in and it offers to transfer your songs, I had to uninstall, reinstall, delete songs, re-download songs, etc. etc.  It was a total nightmare.   Also, if you don't sync it frequently enough it gets screwed up and you have to reload everything.  Yahoo offers no helpful tech support either.  I'm someone who loves the concept of DRM'ed subscription music.  I don't like the idea that I need to back up my iTunes library, and was looking forward to switching to this device.  Sadly it is no substitute and I regret buying it.

<Title>Yahoo Service to be discontinued
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>FYI...Ive just learned that the Yahoo To Go service that is built into this device will be discontinued by Yahoo "Mid 2008". Other services like Rhapsody will stll be available but I believe you will need to connect to your PC via the USB instead of utilizing this items built in WiFi
