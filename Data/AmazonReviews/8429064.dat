<Title>Cowon iAudio 7 is fantastic and versatile!!!!!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't even think about iPod.  The Cowon iAudio 7 fills all your audio needs with none of the headaches of iPod.  The computer recognizes it as a "removable storage device" so there is no special software necessary, although it comes with Jet Audio software which is great in its own right.  You can just drop and drag files into the player. The sound is phenomenal and much fuller and richer than iPod and Zune that I have tried. Although versatility is its greatest asset.  It just does what its told, without acting all parental like iPod and Zune.  My only regret is that I wish I had bought the 16 GB model.

<Title>Forget ipod - iAudio products are outstanding
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned an ipod 4G - nothing but issue after issue until it went out of warrantee and became no longer worth working with.  The files would corrupt, I'd have to reset it, re-install, and iTunes or even gPod was just awful.  After listening to iAudio, the sound on an ipod is not so good, actually.  Beautiful design, but 400.00 for a barely functional player? Never again.    I researched much more carefully when I purchased my next player.  iAudio products play mp3 or ogg and a couple of other formats.  I rip at 196 or even 210 bits, instead of the default 128 crap files - because you can hear the difference, especially in ogg, on the iAudio - I'd also recommend finding a pair of Ultimate Ear in ear monitors, just outstanding.  Makes flying on a plane with a baby in the next aisle totally do-able.   I just bought the 8 GB.  I have an iAudio x5 60 GB hard drive player, 2 years old, never a problem.  I had a 1GB flash player by iAudio - four years old, and my son has had it for the last year and a half.  It weaned him off the ipod habit.  Again, never an issue. I'd never buy an ipod again, ever.   Great sound, real audiophile quality.  Play it through a set of Bose Companion speakers when on the road and it's like having a home system with you.  Work out with it.    Drop files on the players - they mount on windows or linux as drives, and the files can just be placed on the players without special software.  I rip to both mp3 and ogg, and use the ogg files exclusively on the iAudio players. Use Exact Audio Copy and oggenc2.exe and lame to rip.    Highly highly recommended - these are five year or more players, absolutely the highest quality.

<Title>Very Nice
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>pros - awesome sound quality (blows ipods away) - enough power to drive good headphones - crazy long battery life - record FM radio (you can also use the timer to auto-record a show) - FLAC and Ogg Vorbis support - connects like any other extermal storage device so you can just drag and drop music, files, whatever. This lets it work with podcastready too which is a small program you keep on the player and then you can update podcasts from any computer (you manage the podcasts from their site, it's really slick). - Also due to the above it is Linux and Mac compatible. I believe the software for converting videos is windows only (maybe Mac too?) though, but I haven't tried running it under wine in Linux (don't care at all about playing videos personally). - text file viewer (handy I suppose if you want to throw a shopping list or directions or whatever on there)  cons - FM tuner reception is a bit weak - voice recorder is less than spectacular - fingerprint magnet - conrols are touchy and take a bit of getting used to. It's easy to accidentally start the voice or FM recorder. The hold switch is essential if you are carrying it around (disables all controls). I have it set so I can still pause and change the volume. Aside from some minor gripes the UI is very easy to use once you get the hang of it though and hopefully will continue to get better with firmware upgrades. - the stock headphones actually sound pretty good, but were uncomfortable and constantly falling out. My ears are small though. I'm using some $20 JVC air cushon in-ear phones for now that I really like, but will probably invest in some high end in-ear phones at some point as I use it almost 8 hours a day 5 days a week. - thick (I don't care, it's still tiny, but yeah it doesn't look as slick as an ipod).  Overall, highly recommended.

<Title>MOVE OVER IPODS HERE COMES COWON
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For a very long time I have been looking for an excellent sound performer mp3 player.The first thing I did was purchasing a reliable set of headphones, my final choice after many trials was a Westone UM-2 dual drivers,expensive $300 but worth every dime.Now the problem was matching these to a comparable player; the answer: cowon's I7.The sound quality with so many wistles and bells avail,you can twick the music to make it sound just perfect.Imagine having a variable loudness control just like in the old Mc Intosh amps,you get perfect amount of bass and I mean clear Low end bass, the custom EQ lets you match your headphones to your personal taste, no overwhelming mids and annoying high ends.The amp is very powerfull and it does not compromise the battery life, you can actually get 15 hours of play.  The only small problem I found is getting use to all functions since there is no manual avail. Now the fun part, since it supports Flac compression (among others)one can rip a cd without loosing any quality of sound , problem found in all mp3 playes due to the compression support system. If you are looking for a generic player and sound quality is no issue , this is not the unit for you. If you are an audiofile purist and demand that the music be heard as natural as possible,please consider this player.I just love it and all my other players have been put to rest. Point made.

<Title>Wonderful audio player
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm very happy with the iAudio 7 - it's light, fast to boot, good storage space, excellent codec support, lots of nice features (such as embedded lyrics) but most of all the audio quality is SUPERB!  Using it with high quality earphones such as the vmoda vibe are allowing me to hear subtleties in songs I've never heard before (particularly when playing back flac), but high bitrate ogg/mp3 over the included speakerphones is also surprisingly good.  With regular use I haven't been able to move the battery indicator off of "Full".  I found the controls easy enough to get used to and have come to like them quite a bit.  As to the got-to-have it factor ... well, there was a time when having those white earphones meant you knew something everyone else didn't.  Now, you're driving a black Ford model T (and paying too much for something non-exclusive -- go figure).   The only downside is that it is a fingerprint magnet ... on the plus side a single wipe and its clean.  I do recommend upgrading the firmware to the 1.15+ (apparently 1.17 is just now out as well).  Be aware that flashing the firmware clobbers your files so back it up first :)

<Title>cowon iaudio7
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I'm in my 60s. I've enjoyed making music files all my life, going back to using reel-to-reel tapes, and then cassettes, and then CDs. This machine does what it says. The line in recorder function allows easy download from any number of sources. (You do need to buy the linein audio cable separately, its not provided). The FM receiver is very strong. I live in a radio fringe area of the country and can pick up a strong FM signal with the iaudio7, and the super simple button push to record the FM is great. The sound is very powerful, and the equalizer and bass effect really enhance that. I figure I have replaced a wall of high quality sound equipment with this little player. The control buttons and slide mechanism are sensitive, as many people say, but I find it easily manageable once you adapt to how lightly you need to touch the controls to get what you want. I agree with the company statements.......its an extreme mp3 experience and delivers on all that they say it will do.

<Title>A pain in the rear for a Mac owner
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned the Cowon iAudio7 for about one month and am thinking I might have been best served to buy an iPod.  I'll confess at this point that I am a Mac owner.  Based on several user reviews and what I had learned on CNet and a few other consumer electronics review sites, I thought I would be able to work with the disclaimer in the instructions that indicated "data transfer only" beside the campatability listing for Mac OS.  Well, "data transfer only" means data transfer only.  The supplied software with the Cowon IAudio7 is only for Windows.  I can run Windows and therefore the Cowon software on my Mac; however, the software is not nearly as intuitive as iTunes.  Now, I'm a recent convert to Mac (~3 months), but when the manufacturer of a device claims to be compaitble with Mac, I think it's reasonable to expect it to be FULLY compatible with a Mac.  Worst of all, the iAudio7 doesn't play songs imported from CD which have been converted into m4a format via iTunes.  It seemes to only play MP3s without any tinkering around.    Pros: Large capacity for the price with good sound.  Not like all the other kids on the block with iPods.  Great battery life.    Cons: Incredibly awkward navigation both on PC side and player.  Doesn't seem to recognize as many file formats as some reviewers claim (unless I'm doing something incorrectly).  Small screen, sensitive buttons, and screen orientation make it a bit difficult to navigate songs quickly while working out.  Available armband seems to be a two-part contraption that is more expensive than one might think it should be.    For a PC owner, this might be just the thing you're looking for.  I just didn't want to believe that with a Mac, the buck stopped at an iPod.

<Title>Perfect for Audio Books
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iAudio 7 is what hours of research boiled down to, but in the end, I am finicky when it comes to electronics. This player passes the test. First off, upgrade the firmware and then complain about the sensitivity. Default on the player when I got it was So sensitive that I literally did not touch the buttons and they would trigger. But firmware (1.17 currently) has fixed that. Normal sensitivity setting is perfect now.   This player is Audio Booking made easy. I had an iRiver H10 which was horrible for audio books. It didn't have bookmarking, so if pause/resume failed, I had to search through the hour long music file at a few seconds per tic of fast fwd. However, what my research did not uncover was, you can set the fast forward rate up to 30s per tick. I have it at 5s for now and it blazes. That means at a rate of 30s per tick of ffwd, you can reach 30min into a chapter in just a few seconds. That's handy. And of course you can save 20 bookmarks.   The sound is as good as everyone boasts. I like the look and am not worried about it cracking as i would a wimpy ipod.   There is a lot to program in the settings, like secondary functions of buttons - hold the Menu button down to Record Radio, Bookmark, Voice Record, etc. whatever you want to set it at. 2 programmable function buttons like that.  Pros: bookmarking, fast fast forwarding, programability, great sound, sturdy, mega battery, sharp looking.  Cons: small viewing screen for movies, must convert movies from avi/mpeg into the jetaudio format, which takes about 30 minutes for 700mb.

<Title>Does what I want, and does it well!
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros 1. Phenomenal sound 2. No proprietary software 3. Excellent battery life  Cons 1. Small screen 2. Thick  First off, a little bit about myself and my mp3 player purchasing so you can properly evaluate whether this review will suffice your needs.  I am a self-described audiophile who likes to listen to things with the best possible sound.  I originally started out in the mp3 player market with a Creative Nomad Jukebox (had a 2.5" 6gb hard drive and ran on 4AA batteries for about 4 hours).  I later upgraded to a Cowon iAudio G3 in 2004 or 2005.   The play button no longer registers on the G3, so I started searching for a replacement.    Design The device is similar in dimensions to a bic lighter, just a little wider and a little thicker (about as thick as a AA battery).  I like the fact that the device has some dimension but weighs very little.  The controls on the front of the device are touch sensitive.  People have complained that it's too sensitive.  I so far have not found this true, however when I keep it in my pocket, I use the hold button, which prevents accidentally skipping tracks.  The cover over the USB port feels solid.  As for the screen, it is small.  Probably about the size of a postage stamp.  I would not this device for video purposes.  Also, the device is very glossy, which is very fingerprint prone.  I have no case for the device, and I still have no scratches (although realize I have only been using for about 2-3 weeks at this point).   User Interface This is the area where there are lots of differences between users.  As mentioned above, the touch controls are sometimes rated to be too sensitive.  However, one nice feature is that the user can adjust the hold button to permit the buttons on top of the player to continue to adjust volume as well as play/pause.    As for file searching, I tend to use the folder mode, for two reasons: (1) I previously had the iAudio G3, and that device was only folder mode, so my music is organized in folders in a very easy to search way and (2) for whatever reason, Cowon does not have a way to use DPL (Dynamic Playlist - the ability to create a playlist on the fly) when using ID3 searching.    Features  This device has many features beyond just audio playback, but even with audio playback, it can playback more than just mp3 and wma.  It also can playback ogg and flac.  It can play video files (I hear that a conversion is required to put it on the device, but I have yet to use this for video).  In addition, it can record both voice and line-in.  I hear that the line-in recording (wire not included) will automatically start new tracks when there is a gap in the music.   There is also a radio with decent reception and, if you are listening and hear a song you like, you can record. Performance Music Transfer is purely drag and drop.  No need for any proprietary software.  And all very good is that the device uses standard mini USB, not a proprietary software.  First off, let's get this out right here - I have NEVER opened the earbuds that came with the device.  I am listening to is using my Sennheiser PX100 (entry level portable headphones).  One of the main reasons I purchased this device was my level of satisfaction with the G3.  It sounds absolutely phenomenal.  It's almost like having a portable stereo system.  Between BBE, Mach3Bass, and customizable EQ, this device sounds amazing.  As for other playback features this device has (video, pictures, text, etc.), I have not used tested this device.  As mentioned earlier, the screen is very small, so it probably is not the greatest device for these other options.  Summary If you are looking for a device for quality audio playback, look no further.  This device sounds phenomenal, especially when paired with a good set of headphones.

<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I currently own a Sandisk e280 and this Iaudio 7 mp3 player. Sound quality on the I7 is by far much much better than the e280. The equalizer on the I7 is far superior also. Not only do you have presets but you can also create your own. It also has an advanced EQ settings where you can set the frenquencey of each band. Wide,normal and narrow waves are available for the EQ as well.   You can delete a song as it is playing which is a great idea. The touch pads are not as sensitive after updateing the firmware. That by the way is really easy to do. Did an experiment on the battery life and got 36 hours out of it. Keep in mind though I kept the display on and had a set of speakers hooked up to it at the time. With normal use will get 50+ hours easy.   The headphones used for sound quality testing were Sennheiser PX100,Grado SR 60, and AKG K 26 P. This little player was able to have punch on all three even the Grados. That is amazing from such a small unit. Only thing is I wish I had gotten the 16GB model.   Update: 02/13/08. After normal use the battery life lasted 54 hours before it flashed red. This thing still gets a top vote to me.

<Title>Every bit as good as advertised
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product was everything it was advertised to be.  The primary reason I bought the Cowon iAudio 7 was because of how much Cowon stressed it would be completely simple to use with Linux, and that is totally the case.  Yeah, it is a little thicker than an iPod nano, but when it's still this small does it matter?  And that extra thickness sure serves is purpose. Packed in the little device is an FM tuner and an outstanding battery.  I've had mine now for 3 or 4 weeks, I take it to the gym and to work, and I've only had to charge it three times.  The headphones that come with it are pretty cheap.  I got a nicer pair and the sound is even better!

<Title>Great Sound, OK Usability
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had the 8GB iAudio 7 for a few weeks.  First, the good:   - The sound quality is excellent, with lots of adjustments to tweak the sound to personal taste.  I have used several players before, and this one is the most flexible.  You can equalize (of course), bass-enhance, set the soundstage for varying 3d effect, etc.  The only caution I'd give is that it's tempting to layer too many enhancements just because you can, and it is possible to overdo it.   - Rated battery life is outstanding.  I have not tested to the 50-60hr rated limit (I've read both), but in playing for many hours I haven't been able to budge the battery level meter.   - Support for file types: Having FLAC and OGG support is not common, and allows the player to reach quality levels not possible by those only supporting AAC, MP3 and compressed WMA.   - In MSC mode, can automatically execute a program when plugged into USB port.  This is handy for easily starting a podcast download program when it's connected.  I have had trouble setting this on other players.   Needs Improvement:   - The FF/REV slider is a cool concept that works ok, but it needs improvement.  Others have commented that it's overly sensitive despite having three levels, and that's true.  However, at any of the levels the performance is inconsistent.  For example, I listen to long podcasts, and when fast-forwarding through commercials the player will sometimes revert to the start of the file.  This is quite frustrating, since it can take over a minute to get back to the right point in the file, and of course it can happen repeatedly.  Interestingly, it hasn't happened in the reverse direction.  I returned one player due to this problem, but the replacement isn't much better.  In summary, if you want top quality sound, there's no better player than this one (to be fair, other Cowons have similar features with less battery life).  To maximize quality you'll need to buy top of the line earphones...I use Ultimate Ears and they're fantastic.  I no longer carry around my bulky noise-cancelling headphones since they were bigger with inferior sound.  If you want to store FLAC files, buy the 16GB unit or else you'll be limited to a couple hundred songs.  Happy listening.

<Title>Great FLAC player
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this because I wanted a flash-based digital audio player that would play FLAC files natively.  (I have a 4G iPod with the Rockbox software installed, but Rockbox is frustratingly sluggish on my iPod and my iPod has occasional battery and disk issues anyway.)  My observations are generally in line with what others have reported.  It is smaller than I expected, and the screen is indeed tiny; it really looks like it's the size of a postage stamp, but fortunately it's clear and bright.  I don't think this would be as good as, say, the iPod Shuffle for those looking for something for workout sessions based on the screen size and sensitive controls.  The battery life is excellent; I haven't had to recharge mine even after several weeks of occasional use.  The controls are indeed extremely sensitive, and there is a learning curve to using them (I accidentally kept setting an A-B repeat in the middle of a song instead of browsing the menu as I intended to do).  If you are dissatisfied with the sound, there are several options to make it fit your taste (customizable equalizer settings, crossfade, MP3 enhancement, etc.).  The capacity is of course nowhere close to a hard-drive-based player, but that's the price you pay for lossless audio.  With a pair of ear canal headphones, this makes a very compact travel audio system.
