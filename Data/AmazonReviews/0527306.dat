<Title>Hate It.
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is absolutely terrible, I have had the same experience with other Disney Technology related items.  I love Disney World, movies, and tangible products; but anything related to technology that I have purchased, by Disney, is absolutely horrible.  Now I have been burned again.  Do yourself a favor and buy your child an IPOD it will save you a lot of grief.  If you have a MAC by all means forget it and even on Windows it is a very counter-intuitive and difficult and this comes from someone who has buit PC's and set-up LANs.  I have had similar disappointment with Disney's games for Macs.  If your child likes Hanna Montana as our whole family does, do yourself a favor, buy all Hanna's media and put it on an IPOD so you kid can actually enjoy it.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I researched this product on amazon, most reviews were bad, so I was skeptical of getting it. I'm 13 and a huge fan of Hannah Montana and my friend also had a mix max but it was a Tinkerbell model. She had no problems with hers so I decided to give it a try. It works perfectly! No glitches or anything! I love it! All my music, pictures and videos work fantastically! I bought the SD card for extra storage, and it works fine. It says to only use a 2 GB card, at maximum. People also complained about the clock going back to 5, I've never had any problem like that! I would for sure recommend this product!

<Content>This is a great product.  Easy to download, easy for my daughter who just turned 8 and is in 2nd grade.  The best thing I ever did.  I control what she listens to and I don't have to share the CD player with her anymore.

<Title>Works great  -  for a short time! 
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a fantastic concept, and our daughter loves it, when it works.   The first Mix Max had problems after 3 weeks - screen froze and the clock stopped at 5:33am. I was able to return it for an even exchange.   Second Mix Max worked for 2 1/2 months, then it started having inermittent blank screens, the Disney card movies would not play ("file not supported" messages appeared) and the time locked at 5:33am. The center > play button is not working properly - when pressed it does not always play until you find a "sweet spot" that it accepts.   Daughter loved it so much that against better judgement we bought a third Mix Max.  The 5:33 "feature" is still there.  When you reset the time it appears correctly, but the first time you cycle the power - you are back to 5:33. After 3 1/2 months the intermittent blank screens started. 3 sides of the "mickey ears" used for navigation stopped working after about 4 months (when we were 1 hour in to a 7 hour airline flight - UGH), so now our daughter can only get music or a movie by reinserting a card and IF the autoplay decides to work.  Really disappointing since this was our third Mix Max and we bought the Jam Stand, case, travel charger and all the movie/music cards with purchase #1.    We tried calling repeatedly for support for the issues with all 3 - were told each time that they "looking into" the problems, but have no fix and because we were outside the 90 days from initial purchase were out of luck as far as a replacement or exchange.   Great idea, cool features - if you get one that lasts longer than 90 days. Lesson learned, next time we will spend a more for a stable player from a company that supports their products.   The positive reviews must be from new owners.  Would be interesting to see the percentage of Mix Maxes that are functioning properly after 6 months of use.

<Title>DON'T BUY!
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter got this a xmas present. Worked great initially, downloaded all her CDs and some pictures, an she was able to watch the mix max disney clip with no problem. After a few hours, the screen went dead, and we thought thr player needed to be charged. Unfortunately, my computer no longer recognizes the player, and we cannot get it to turn on no matter what. My daughter is distraught because she loved it. I am going to try and return/exchange it but it is really a piece of junk and I should have spent the extra money for a zune or ipod. If I can return this, I will buy ipod next time so my child does not get let down. I suggest anyone considering buying this do the same. Its not worth it just because it says Hannah Montana or High School Musical on it!

<Title>Great toy!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just a fabulous toy!  You do need some software programs to rip the DVD's and put them on the player, but after that it is easy!  And she loves watching her movies on it -- and moving them back and forth from her computer to the player, so she has different movies to watch.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Disney Mix Max (Hannah Montana version) is very easy to use. We just got it for Christmas. My 7-year old figured out how to use it immediately.  Downloading music from CDs is a snap, and the picture and sound quality are so much greater than you would expect for the price. We have a few of the clips.  We haven't tried to download any movies on it yet, but everything else so far has worked with no trouble. I would actually consider getting one for myself!

<Title>Poor customer service
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one for my grandaughter for Christmas and she enjoyed it for about a month before the ear piece plug in broke.  Digital Blue refuses to help because I bought it on-line and do not have a proper store cash register receipt.  They know it's a new item and I suspect from what others have told me that this is a common problem.  This company is obviously one of those that is more interested in a one time sale than cementing future sells with good customer service.  I cannot recommed doing business with this company.
