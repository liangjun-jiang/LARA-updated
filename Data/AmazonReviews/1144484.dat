<Title>WORKED GREAT...UNTIL IT STOPPED.
<Date>Tue Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in love with this seemingly economical alternative to an IPOD until it just stopped working. Not sure if it's a short or whether the battery power is just not getting to the MP3 memory/player. Suffice it to say, it lasted 6 months so if you can live with that, it's a nice little player. You get what you pay for.

<Title>Not bad!
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isnt a bad mp3 i mean for jogging working out etc... the built in microphone is one of the best features in this mp3.It records very clearly. One of the features annoying is the small amount of space, but if you can cope with it then its ok. The second thing is that it doesnt have a line in, that means you cant copy music from another mp3 or media source. All other features are really good including the sound its very loud. Overall this mp3 is good for beginners so if you still dont own one go for it otherwise dont because its very basic.

<Title>Lasted 8 months
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A good product once you figure out how the shuffle key works. Good  versitility allowing both MP3 data, Flash drive data and FM sound. Volume seemed low but I tried other headsets and it seemed to work okay.  After 8 months of normal use the LCD panel no longer displayed and the buttons did not work.  Contacted Creative tech support and they said I should send the unit in. However, I must also send in a $25.00 Non-refundable check to test the unit. If the unit was bad they would replace it but keep my $25.00.  The warrantee on the unit is one year but does not cover labor after 90 days. They recommended I take it back to the store.

<Title>DON"T BUY THIS PLAYER
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB MP3 Player that is great!  But, I paid the same for it as this 128MB player is currently listed for.  You can get a much larger capacity player than this for the same price.  Unfortunately the newer 2GB MuVo V100 has some significant issues with download speed and folder/track navigation so I can't recommend it.
