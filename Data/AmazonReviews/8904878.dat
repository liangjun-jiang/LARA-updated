<Title>Good Player for the Price
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved my PANASONIC SV-MP010 Digital Audio Player today, and so far have been pleased with it.  At about 100 dollars, I knew this player wouldn't have features that would blow my mind.  I simply wanted a small, funtional mp3 player- I didn't need to fit 20 thousand songs on it or choose sound options like "Theater" or "Stadium".  This simple mp3 player certainly covers the basics and gets the job done for a reasonable price.  While it's a bit bigger then "a tube of lipstick" and definitely heavier then one with the battery in, the player is still reasonably compact and lightweight.  The earbuds are okay, but not wonderful.  If you want high quality, you'll want to invest in a better pair.  I was pleased to find that despite its relatively low cost, the sound quality of the player is quite nice.  Uploading files to the PANASONIC SV-MP010 was a cinch.  I was thrilled at the fact that there is no hardware to install.  All you need is an available USB port.  I was instantly able to transfer files from Windows Media Player without a problem.  Navigating the menu system took me a couple tries, but the manual was helpful in clearing up my slight confusion.  Due to the small display, viewing folders isn't as easy as is it with other players that offer large screens.  However, if you are planning on storing a relatively small amount of files, it shouldn't be too cumbersome.  As far as battery life goes I haven't had the player for long enough to judge.  However, I already have several rechargable batteries for my other electronics and intend to use them with this player.  Hopefully it will continue to be reliable; this is my first try at a Panasonic player after dealing with a malfunctioning mp3 player from Creative Labs.  All in all, this player seems to have fufilled what I was looking for: basic features, compact size, and decent bang for your buck.

<Content>I just recieved this Pink Panasonic MP3 player and I love it! Easy to download your music and the sound from this MP3 player is darn good!  You can change the sound mode from normal,rock, jazz, classical and pop.  You have surround sound effect and remaster sound enchancement. I prefer using a battery operating  MP3 player than having it recharged from your computer.  I have read some bad reviews about rechargeable MP3 players. What do you do when the recharger fails or it burns out? That means it's time to buy another player. Stick with the battery operating MP3 players.  The body of this compact MP3 player is built alot more sturdier than the ones I have seen and owned. The stereo earbuds that came with this player is decent but not great.  I bought Griffin Ear Jams to enhance the sound quality and it's a real improvement. The ear jams were design for the IPOD white earbuds but it works fine with the earbuds that came with this MP3 player.  I really don't have any negative comments about this MP3 player except for the fact that this player didn't come with a lanyard to hang around your neck. The player is a compact oblong shape so finding a case for it was a bit challenging. Fortunately I did find one that fit the needs. The MP3 case is made by Case Logic and the size is a cute square compact padded case that will fit and protect this MP3 player.  The case has a little opening at the top for your stereo earbuds to attach to the player. It comes with a an adjujstable arm belt and a belt loop at the back so you can hook up a lanyard if you want. I got the case at Target for $9.99.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!

<Content>great long hours! A must buy if you don't want to spend too much on battery or keep having to charge your mp3.  Bad for people like me who listen to songs other than english, because this little thing can only support english.
