<Title>An updated version is better
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After i read millions of reviews of this product, i went to target and bought it.I was sceptical that it would hold enough music for me to be happy with, but decided to give it a try.    Several Reviewers complained about sony sonic stage..i think its no worse than the i-tunes software and once you get the hang of it (one or 2 days max) its really simple to use, once you buy music from the sony connect store, it automatically downloads to the program, and if you choose, will send straight to your mp3 player as well.Its simple to arrange the playlist into folders. One downside is that the sony  connect site is only for sony products, but you can convert to mp3 and burn a cd straight from the program as well. Ive come to a conclusion that all the programs want you to buy music, and all will make it hard to exchange music from one computer to another. sony will let you authorize up to 5 computers to accept music from..   I give this 4 stars because the first nwe305 i bought, the cover for the built in usb connector was breaking. I returned it to target, and got a new one, no hassle. the new one i noticed is remodeled slightly from the other one, so i think that the usb cover has been strengthened.   I love the sound quality, and lots of options to choose from on the display. I did get some better headphones from sony. I recommend this, cause i forgot them one day and used a cheapie pair, i couldnt figure out why it sounded so strange. then i realized it was the crappy headphones. It does make a difference! I like the sony ones that go behind your neck. they are the least obtrusive and dont fall off when running.  I happen to love that the thing charges from the computer,no ac adapter needed. the battery lasts days and days after charging an hour max. I really wanted to test the battery myself, so i intentionally left the thing on all night, about 10 hours strait and it was still on 3/4ths battery.   I am pleased with the amount of music i am able to shove into this thing. IVe so far put 123 songs on here, with 345 supposed to be max. Im at about 1/2 memory left, and lots of my tracks are really long.   I am hoping they will come out with more accessories for this item, I find it odd that the player comes with a spot to hang a lanyard or hook something on it, but there wasnt anything included. Its not usually a problem but when i dont have a pocket it is inconvienent.

<Title>Nice looking but too fragile!
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one of these cute lil' "beans" for a present, and it was extremely adorable. Nice feel when you hold it in your palm. (Received quite a bit of ooh's and ahh's among my friends!) But there was some sort of a bug when I installed Sonic Stage. With some frustation I got it solved, finding that SS  was a very bad software. You cannot drag files directly into the bean. SS also makes your computer very slow. Then, just as I was starting to enjoy this little guy, it fell from my table and went bad. A table no more than 3 feet and with a carpet on the floor! Now the bean does not funtion properly--its keys are extremely sticky (does not  respond regularly) and there is a big ugly crack. I am now planning to send it back--or maybe buy a new mp3 that is tougher.  Still, the bean is really really cute--if you are careful enough!!

<Title>Doesn't convert wma or wav files
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this radio and returned i tthe very next day, why? because they force you to buy all the music from their Connect.com website. I had 50 songs on my windows media player and some songs I bought off walmart.com for .88  NONE were compatible with the MP3. they were in either wma or wav format which it "says" it can convert but it never did, it always stayed on 0% when converting, I ended up calling their customer support the next morning and they told me no song that was copywrite protected could be downloaded (even if I paid for it legally on walmart.com) I would have to re-buy all my songs through their site for them to be compatible. I returned it and bought a RCA that is compatible with my windows media player.

<Content>At first, I got it for christmas, and it was great, great sound and great all around. Then my first problem came, I couldn't download ANY songs off the conect store and the support team was no help what so ever. And then a couple days ago, I dropped it on the ground maybe a 2 foot drop and it will not turn on. So know I am going to buy a new mp3, and it won't be a bean!

<Title>Definately do your homework on this one
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the bean just before I had my first baby thinking it would be great to have in the hospital.  Boy was I wrong.  I brought it home and tried to install the software onto my computer.  The program kept canceling the installation process and when I went online to get the so called patch it did nothing to help me.  NONE of the music that I had PAID for and downloaded onto my computer were compatable with the SonicStage.  I became very frustrated and deleted the whole thing off my computer and returned it.  When I went to return it the lady told me that it sounded like I got a corrupt disc, which I bought her story and exchanged it for a new bean. Same thing happened, I couldn't get the program to complete the installation process and took the whole thing back AGAIN to Target.  Definately a waste of my time.  The player looks cute and is nice in your hand but definately not worth the hassle it has with it.  Don't waste your time in my opinion.

<Title>The coolest littttle gadget, much nicer than the  ipod Shuffle
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow This Baby is sooooooooooo nice. I don't have any comments at all other than the software it comes with is clunky, but just DL from sonys web page and its much easy to use. I do think 512mb is a bit small, so maybe go for the 1gb instead. I love this thing, its PERFECT for when i workout or play poker. The hidden USB plus is the coolest feature about this gadgets, it is spring loaded behind a small little door. Man this is nice. Give it a try!

<Title>Great deal!
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did not buy the Bean through Amazon - I actually got it as a gift. But, I did want to say a few things about the product, because I was surprised there were a few bad reviews on the page...  First of all - the software was an effortless install, even with my anti-virus running the entire time. If you have a PC running anything but XP, you might have issues (and the install instructions CLEARLY warn you of this possibility). But, let's be serious here. It's 2006 - upgrade to a machine with XP loaded as the Operating System.  Secondly - the software DOES convert .wav files and Windows files.  And, finally - Stop with the complaining about having to pay to download from the Sony store. You can use the included software to burn music you bought from the Sony store to a CD - as well as using it to upload to the Bean. With iTunes, you can upload ONLY to the iPod... and you can forget about burning to CD ANY downloads from the iTunes store...  For the money - this is a great deal.  Only complaint I have is about the Sony store itself... While there is a lot of available music, I would like to see more.

<Title>Great Little Bean
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I could have purchased something a little cheaper with the same storage size, but we love Sony products so I went with this after looking at mp3 players for a long time.  It is SO Cute!  Mom's need a few cute things that are their own.  512MB seems miniscule compared to the multi-GB models of players out there now, but really, I just download radio show files that I don't get to listen to normally to listen to them when I walk...along with 50 or 60 songs that I really like.  So it's perfect for me.  You can always swap them out.  Plus I'm not storing my entire music library on there, and I don't think most people that have everything loaded on their players listen to 10% of the files.  I LOVE the USB connect/charger.  Easy to use.  The software isn't so bad.  My computer is just under a year old, so that might help.  I'm still trying to figure out the details on it, but I never read the instructions so it's my own fault...and thanks to the other reviewer that mentioned the wallpaper thing.  I don't wear a watch normally, so the fact you can put a clock on there is great to know.  Only downside I've come across is the slow fast forward function...I get by though.

<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment.

<Title>Don't Believe The Bad Reviews On This!
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many people just straight bomb on this thing without a second thought. I just bought this from Sears for $80.00 a week ago after reading some of the bad reviews on this site. I figured that as my CD collection grew( Yeah, I still buy those things), I could just buy a player with a larger amount of space. Besides, the space, the bean comes with an FM radio, a pop-out USB connector, and 50 hours of battery life. But before I just go and tell you why you shouldn't listen to some of the negative reviews on this, I'm gonna clear up a few things: 1)The USB cover on this thing is NOT flimsy. You have to push the cover all the way back and then the USB connector will pop out. When you're done using the Bean at the computer, you disconnect it, and push the USB back into the Bean and push the cover on it. I can't believe I almost didn't buy this because of the amount of people saying the USB was flimsy. 2)The Beans construction isn't as bad as people make it out to be. The 5-way D-Pad does not feel like it's flimsy. In fact it's built extremely close to the bean itself, so the D-Pad feels like a button, not a joystick. 3)The Bean can take a fall. I'm 5'11 and I dropped the thing on my carpet in my room and the thing works just fine.When people say that things are flimsy, they usually mean that didn't use the thing like it's meant to be used.  With those out of the way, I'll tell you about the software. Sonicstage is just as easy to use as Creative Mediasource or the Windows Media Player software. The people who say that Sonicstage is hard to use are the people who say things like "My camera is defective. I dropped it on the ground and it's lens is messed up." The only thing wrong with the software is that you can't change screens when ripping music and it's a little slow. However, you could just not run any applications while you use Sonicstage. You shouldn't really be on the computer putting music on a player for more than 10-15 minutes anyway. This thing does what it's supposed to very well. I can liten to my music in smaller formats without compromising (that much) sound quality.I listen to alot of old school hip hop like Ready To Die, Reasonable Doubt,Illmatic, and some new stuff to even things out. (Just copped the new Busta Rhymes CD. If you plan on buying it,go ahead. It's right up there with ELE, The Coming,When Disaster Strikes,and Anarchy.) I've charged the battery last week and the battery meter still reads full. The Bean might not win any trend setting awards, but it's still worth having if you only have 345 songs.

<Content>This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP.

<Content>First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable.

<Content>I like this MP3 player because it is fairly easy to use and was reasonably priced.  I love the design and shape, although at times it is slippery and easily dropped.  Their software was pretty easy to use, and you can update it online.  I don't find the software 'clunky' as other reviews describe it, but if you don't need advanced music editing, it's great. :-) The only other thing I didn't like was that the 'hold' function was very sensitive, going off even when I pressed the up arrow.  I would definitely recommend it!

<Content>The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.  The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.  It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket.

<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you're a fan of mp3 players, but don't have the $$$ for an ipod type device, then this might be the player for. Easily stored, this device fits just about everywhere. And ladies, this player fits in even the smallest of purses. It is also great for the gym to be able to hide anywhere. I especially like the usb so cleverly hidden which makes it easy to sneak in a charge on any computer without having to carry extra cords. Don't get me wrong, this player goes about 50 hours before it completely runs out of battery (the battery life does vary from player to player). It holds a great amount of songs which obviously is great. The color is cool, and we all know that a majority (if not all) of Sony's products are good. At least it has never done me wrong and I have a 12-year-old Sony Walkman to prove it. Of Course, it doesn't have the color screen and solitare that an ipod has, but if your looking for a quality mp3 player for a decent price (my fellow on-a-budget citizens) then this is definitely a mp3 player for you.

<Content>I had it replaced four times and got totally fed up.  For all four times, the on-board battery died and the entire unit had to be replaced.  I urge you to stay away from media player units, like this one, that have permanent on-board battery systems that you can't replace yourself!  You're better off purchasing an mp3 player that has a battery you can remove and replace easily without help.  I ended up purchasing a SanDisk Sansa c200 series media player and am extremely happy with it!

<Content>Over a year ago I owned an iPod Mini and was totally in love with it, unfortunantly i found myself out of work and had to sell it. Once i got a new job i found the urge to buy a new mp3 player but didnt wanna spend all the money on an iPod when all i wanted it for was for running and walking. I picked up this device and have to say its been great, especially for the price. I havent had any issues with it whatsoever, also the software that it came with was actually quite easy to learn to use, also it connects to my xbox 360 quite easily with the extension usb connector it came with. Also the FM feature works out awsome when im at the gym working out because they have tv's set up that transmit to unused FM channels so that you can listen to the tv you want to watch while using the bikes without bothering the people next to you. Like i said this is a very user friendly unit and cant be beat for the price.

<Content>Nice piece of hardware...  Everything I was looking for, retractable USB, rechargable battery...  Sounds pretty simple and if they kept it that way it would have been real nice...  But it looks like Sony was trying to impose their standards through hardware...  The software is ugly and painfully slow..  My biggest complaint is that you can't just drag and drop MP3, WAV or WMA files on to the device using windows explorer...  Well, you can but you can't play them...  Anything you want to listen to has to go through the Sonic stage software to be converted to OMG format, which is very slow as well as unnecessary (in my opinion).. So you can't just go up to any computer, plug it in copy files and listen to them...  Looks like I just bought an expensive thumb drive...

<Content>My iPod having died on me a while back, I was hesistant to buy another this time around when I developed the need for an mp3 player. Intrigued by the bean's design, I hesistantly bought it. I am thoroughly and pleasantly surprised. It's design is awesome, the perfect size for a smooth fit in your hand, with handy features. The screen glows in the dark, and songs can be arranged in folders and searched for on the player. There's also a cool screensaver with fruit. The color is a nice pearlescent white, and the usb port is nicely sheathed and protected. The headphones also deliver quality sound. I see some previous complaints about the software, but I found none. I'm very technologically challenged and was sure I'd have to have a friend set it up for me, but it was quite easy to set up and transfer files. The software also connects to a music store, and the buyer will recieve a gift certificate for five free songs from sony. Overall, a wonderful, stylish, functional product.

<Content>I bought this for my daughter the Christmas that they first came out.  She used it so much, I bought one for myself about a year later.  Hers died with some sort of overload or short to the USB port but Sony promptly repaired it.  Neither of us have had any problems since.    I'm from that older generation, tech worker but not enough time/resources to be much of a tech player.  I found it easy to use.    My daughter and I both just replaced our PCs with new systems running Vista.  The move of the Sony Sonic Stage software to the new systems was painless, though you must be connected to the internet to retrieve the necessary software.

<Title>JUNK! 1 STAR, Updated Review
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided to update this review after only having used my player 2x, and having for only three days. First off, I see why all the complaints of the software. The software used to transfer your music is a program that puts the music in a format only recognized by Sony players and gives them a extension that is unable to be converted by any media player that I researched. So if you spent hours upon hours of ripping your CD's to the player, you think, great, the music is  put in a seperate folder so if I decide to upgrade my player to something besides the Sony, I can drag and drop them for easy transfer. WRONG! Once they are converted over to Sony's proprietry Garbage software, they become use-less unless you want another Sony player, and for the price there are many other brands I researched that are better and cheaper EX. Samsung, Sandisk...I thought this would be a good starter player, it only cost me thirty five bucks with shipping, but I should have taken my money are threw it in the garbage, just like I did the Sony Bean MP3 player when all the buttons froze, and I couldnt get anything up on the screen but the word Selection. What a piece of Junk. Never again Sony. They might make some good products, but MP3 Players isnt one of them. I didnt even feel like returning it since it would have cost me more money to ship it back,and then wait for another to arrive, what to have that one break again. DONT BUY THIS PLAYER. Even if you are just going to put a few songs on it, go with something 10bucks more such as Samsung or Sandisk. At least you wont have a expensive paperweight.

<Title>Sony Sucks
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Buying this product was a huge mistake. I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect. It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.  The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect. All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect. It makes adding music to the player because of share rights. Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless. Customer service is terrible. That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole. I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I HATE YOU SONY!
