<Title>Zen Sleek Works Great!
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Aesthetically it looks beautiful! It's a little heavy, if you're used to the small flash player types, which I'm upgrading from. I started years ago with a mini disk player and loved it, but hated how I had to "record" everything to it instead of either burning or syncing, so I went for the iRiver MP3 CD Player and used that for a couple of years. Loved it! Then I bought a 512MB Samsung Yep. It was very nice for about 6 months and then everything I put on it had an annoying clicking noise for accompaniment. So I ditched it and went big with the Zen Sleek. It took about 5 minutes to get 1500 songs on it, and I guess I still have room for about 8000 more.  Navigation is very simple. Sort through artist, album or all music, listed alphabetically. Be sure to update all you ID Tags in MP10 1st. Radio reception is very strong. Haven't tried recording using the mic yet. Photo's uploaded easily, but contrary to the Amazon description I haven't been able to listen to music while I browse my photos yet, but that's not too important as photo viewing is just a bonus to an mp3 player anyway.  The only thing I'm worried about is the screen. I wish they made a case that had a protective screen built in, but unfortunatley I cannot find that many cases, other than the leather pouch and rubber skins for this player. I'd say if you're looking for an easy to use player, with photo, radio and recording ability, this is THE PLAYER at Amazon's current $169 price. Something with 20 gig 5 years ago would have cost us $2000. It's just incredibe how prices of high tech drop so fast. I always say buy the best from the last couple years and you'll be very happy, or get the latest and pay twice as much.

<Title>Very Disappointed
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a former Mac user who went over to the Dark Side with the purchase of a laptop PC which I love.  When it came time to finally buy an MP3 Player, I researched everything I could and I chose the Creative Zen because of the price, the capabilities and that it has a radio.  The second day I had it, after downloading 35 cds, it would not turn on.  I finally had to stick a pin in the reset hole and then the screen was filled with unrecognizable characters.  I ended up having to download the firmware on a ONE DAY OLD machine.  I figured it was "User Error" even though I did nothing wrong.  Today, a full two weeks since I bought the &*^!! thing, it won't turn on again.  Same problems PLUS the PC wouldn't recognize the USB connection.   I love my Toshiba Laptop and won't go back to a Mac but my next MP3 will be an iPod.   Now I hope Amazon will accept this back and give me either a refund or credit!

<Title>Software!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I saw this item I liked the idea having 20GB at my disposal.  Some people have complained about the controls on this is kind of hard to master.  I had no problems figuring out the buttons on the player itself.  When I ordered this, I was really hoping it had the "drag and drop" feature like many Creative MP3 players have.  This one doesn't.  You have to install software to use it.  Here's the problems:  I tried installing it on my PC.  It installed with no problem.  However, the program WILL NOT recognize the device is plugged in.  I went to the Creative Support sight, no contact numbers.  Just a email service.  Got their email back, did everything on the list.  Still doesn't work.  SO, I tried installing it on my laptop, the software wouldn't even install.  Just gave me an error message.  Once again, I have sent an email to Creative.  This is the 3rd day I've had this MP3 Player.  So far, all I've gotten out it is that I have a wonderful silver colored $180 dollar paper weight.  Needless to say, if these software issues don't resolve quickly, I am returning this item and getting an MP3 player that may have less memory, but DEFINATELY has the drag and drop feature.

<Title>Will not recognize....horrible customer service
<Date>Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player and I was pretty excited. I hooked it up to my computer and it worked fine for two days. The third day it stopped recognizing the device. I did everything I could think of...checked out the online directions and did everything they suggested as well. Still couldn't resolve the situation. I called customer service and they wouldn't help me. Rather, they insisted on emailing me links to their website with directions to possibly fix the problem...rather than helping me fix the problem and walking me through it personally. I think this is horrible customer service. Needless to say I went back and forth, following the directions, not fixing anything, then calling back customer service to get another stupid link with more directions to follow. Finally the tech. rep. told me to reinstall my whole operating system since "that had to be the problem" I spent a whole day!!! backing up my files, and reformatting my whole computer. And guess what?? Same thing.....my computer still does not recognize the player when I plug it in. I have windows xp service pack 2 and they said this is what the player is designed to work with.   I really did not want to go with an iPod or something like that but I think I'm taking this back and I'm now through with Creative players. Take my advice and get something else. At least until they get this software issue sorted out. Very dissappointing player indeed.

<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good buy for less than $170.   I had no issues with the player so far. Sound quality is very good, and all the extra features like FM, voice recorder, alarm, organizer and the 20GB capacity adds its overall appeal.  The 2 cable design (1 for usb, a separate one for charge) is a bit weak.  Vertical touch pad is challenge to get used to - if you set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low, its easily usable.

<Title>My exact vision of the perfect Mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing Mp3 player in everyway possible with a few minor drawbacks, but of course, every Mp3 player has their drawbacks, and this one less than all the others.         it is a bit heavy, having a nice solid feel to it. the design is pure and sleek, with easy navigation controls if you are used to the touchpad. the surface is mettalic, so its really hard to scratch, and in my opinion, it looks waaaay better than those weird looking ipods.        all the control buttons light up beautifully, and clicks easily. the touch pad can be set to low, medium, or high sensitivity. the screen is just pure amazing, the photos look better on the sleek than it does on my computer. i jumped from a 1g no-brand name mp3 player with flash memory to this one and im astonished by the difference, and regret not getting it sooner. all the functions work, including radio, microphone, calender, time, etc. you can even manually set the items on the main menu.         when you are tired of the microphone in your ear, then you can connect the player to the speakers, and let music fill the whole room.         the sound quality is great! you really feel as if the band is right besides you performing.        the software is not at all hard to use. you just open it and put songs into your sleek, then after that you can organize them into playlists.       the only thing i dont like are the wires. they are quite the opposite of the sleek, being big and stupid. there are two wires the usb and the charger and when you want to charge, you have to connect the usb cable as well.... well its worth it.        i dont think theres another 20g player with photos for under 200 bucks....... its a great deal.        i bought mine on buydig.com for 147 bucks and am very happy with it so far. i hope this review helped you decide on the perfect Mp3 player for you. (although i suggest the creative zen sleek photo)

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In comparison, most commonly with the Apple Ipod with photos, i think this far exceeds the competitor.  The Creative Player has many adjusting features including how sensitive the control pad is as well as the vibrant colors and premade backrounds. Another great feature is setting a photo as the backround, which personalizes this player even better.  Though the Creative Player weighs more and is thicker than its competitor, it has a smaller perimeter, which is better for pockets anyways. Lastly, in comparison, Ipods tend to freeze frequently, but this creative player has not failed me once, and if it does it is programmed with a reset button on the side which will help tremendously if need be. I have and am currently enjoying every feature on this MP3 player and revel in the price differences as well between the  Creative player and the Apple Ipod.

<Title>After over a year, still a good little machine..
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this MP3 player since Aug. 2006. I use it at least an hour everyday. It is used mostly for listening to books that I download from my local library and speeches from my college website. I transfer and delete files all the time. It has had minimal problems with a lot of use. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It recharges fairly quickly on computer or using the electrical cord. It can be a little slow to change files, no big deal. It has taken a lot of abuse.

I find this incredible if true, so maybe I'm missing something. This is my only real complaint and the reason for a 4      Oh, documentation is a joke - hence my uncertaintly about the previous item.  Photo and other media cababilities not tested.

<Title>Wicked Awesome
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great bargain if your looking for a high capacity music player.  It doesn't have all sorts of bells and whistle but does all the key things that you'd really want such as being able to listen to music while it charges via USB, FM radio, voice recording, view photos, data storage/transfer and so on.  This is my first Creative MP3 player and the interface rocks - easy to shuffle, use playlists, find songs, etc... Not a big fan of the scroll/touch pad thing but its okay.  I've had a Gigabeat, iPod, and an iRiver previously and this is the best for about half the price I paid for those.  Actually the iRiver was pretty cool too because it had digital SPDIF inputs/outputs which was actually very usefull.  Battery life is decent.  Built quality is solid. I really don't have any complaints. Especially at the price.

<Title>Touch Pad Drives Me Crazy
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Zen Juke 60Gb device for 5 years and was upset when it failed (headphone jack became unstable). After reading many articles on MP3 devices I found that they are considered "disposable" and should be happy it lasted as long as it did. All that aside, after reading reviews on iPods I realized they are a product of marketing and not worth my attention. Being a big fan of Creative devices I started looking for a fairly low cost solution to my MP3 dilemma and settled on this product. I am very happy with the sound quality and seemless integration with Windows Explorer. Due to the 20Gb "limitation" I do not use the Photo features at all. I am extremely happy with the small form factor and ease of use. My only complaint (that I took a star way for) is the senstive touch pad that makes it hard to navigate while driving. That may be my bad but a easier to navigate device would definitely reduce my distracted driving and make my insurance company happy. Overall, buy this device over any Apple cutie pie iPod.

<Title>Excellent Alternative to the I-Pod
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you don't want to bow down to the restrictions of I-Tunes, then this is the MP3 player for you. Creative includes a small program that easily allows you to add new songs to your Zen or modify playlists. You can even synchronize with Windows Media Player. My only complaints are that you can't swap battery packs like the Zen Micro Photo and that the battery life is less than advertised. The Zen Sleek Photo advertises 19 hours of battery life while i've only observed around 10 hours. Final Verdict = This is an excellent product that i would recommend to anyone.   -SDG

Everyone told me to get the ipod, but this is clearly better. The software is so easy to use and the sound quality rocks! Only glitch is that sometimes after you transfer songs and take the sync cable out, the mp3 freezes and you just have to restart it. Thats about it.

Creative MP3's (I had a Zen Micro before this on) upload twice as fast as my son's Ipod, and I have had no problems at all with my Creative MP3 freezing up like the Ipods do.  With that said... Creative could do a better job with their power cords and accessories.  The power cord is kind of funky and accessories are very limited.

<Title>Great player, another problem with software
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about a year now, and there have been a few problems. After a year of usage, and three or four falls, the dirt and dust is starting to sneak into the screen. On this note, the player held up very well. Now about the software. I've read some reviews saying that you can use a different software choice. I used the included disc, and the problems are as follows. When you download songs and CDs, it will re-arange the music to be in alphabetical order, not in the track order. Also, when the download was finished, it did not show up on the player, so, a little disgruntled, I repeated the entire process, only to find that the songs and album art was already there. That was frustrating. Now in my search for different sources of music, I used MusicMatch, which is now Yahoo! music. I have had mixed results with the compatability of the songs. Some songs came out loud and clear, while others were soft, (could of been recording volume) but some songs only played halfway, then played static for the rest of the song. I recommend using LimeWire or some other free music source. Another note, I tried iTunes, only to find out that I had to burn the songs I bought onto CDs only to rip them onto my player. By now, there are many different choices, and maybe Creative worked out the kinks, but I am going over to the iPod.

<Title>for a 20GB player this is the best...
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For the money this is one great MP3 player, you get a lot of features i.e. FM Tuner, Photos, ability to change the themes for your color screen (which makes this a better value and not to mention just as attractive or more so than ipod). I found a silicone skin on the street here in NYC and so mine is staying in pretty good shape. I did drop it on the cement/sand street in West Africa (turned out ok, never had any damage other than a few scratches) and OH I forgot, the charger is dual voltage which is sweet if you travel all you need is the adapter. I have only had this freeze a handful of times on me but I just pushed the reset button on the bottom and it took a few minutes to re-build the library. My eyes are looking at the 80GB Zune now though if Creative does not come out with something comparable in price.

<Title>Strong mp3 alternative to Ipod
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As stated above, this is a good alternative to one of the Apple products for those that perfer to use Windows Media Player as their chief music listening program.  I personally switched from the disasterous Ipod Mini, and was been well satisfied with this product so far. The only major problem i've run into so far is converting files from iTunes to Windows Media Player. Almost everything plays fine, but for me many files in iTunes were in mp4 format, and I wasn't able to easily find a way to convert the files to .wma or .mp3 formats.  For those that this is a problem for, this product can be considered a 4. For those that do not have this problem, this product is a definite 5 and seriously worth considering.

<Title>King of mp3s
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Most people seem to be drawn to ipods for some reason, this mp3 player has so many easy to use programs in it that u constantly find. Navigation is extremely nice. U can even change the sensitivity of the touch pad. I have a few friends that use ipods and constantly have trouble with them. They are quite jealous of my zen. Its colors are very good quality along with the sound.        On most mp3s the custom eq doesnt do anything but on this it makes all the difference. I listen to everything from classical to death metal to hip hop and this player handles it perfectly. The only problem i had wasnt with the player itself but installing the program into my computer. I think the problem was my computer though. The most surprising part is the price. A 2gb ipod cost 200 and a 20 gb creative zen cost the same price. If uve been searching for a while your search is over. Buy the zen.

<Content>I recently purchased the Creative Zen Sleek photo mp3 player.  It was a good purchase.  It's moderately priced, easy to use and has a rechargeable battery similar to that of a cell phone that gives 15 or 16 hours of playback if used wisely.  And with 20 GB of storage, one can take several hundred hours if music in the palm of your hand! I would venture to say it is as good a buy if not better than the ipod.

<Title>Extremely Great Buy
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I strongly recommend the Sleek Photo! The screen is large and bright, and the colors crisp (the custom wallpaper setting is really cool). The software is easy to use, it's just drop-and-drag, basically. Sound quality is perfect. Many people have complained about the touch-scroll wheel, and I'll admit it takes getting used to, but you'll get the hang of it in no time and you'll like it. You can even adjust the sensitivity of it, so it's not a problem. The photo viewing is an awesome feature, the display is awesome, there are so many great uses for it. The Sleek Photo also features date/time, a planner, alarm, voice recording, radio, radio recording... all in all it's an awesome deal for a low price. Do yourself a favor and buy the Sleek Photo, you won't regret it!

<Title>Lots of storage!
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been very happy with the Zen Sleek.  It was easy to set up and it's easy to add music to.  If you check the ID tags with the music, before you load it on, you'll be able to catagorize it the way you want to.  If you're loading singles and they have a designated album, you will have a list of many albums in the album catagory. You can change this with the ID tags. The sound is great.  It seems to hold its charge.  I used it on a long drive and there was no problem.  It still had plenty of charge left on it.  The software it comes with is easy to use.  I've never used an IPod, so I can't compare the two.  Once you've loaded up the software, you can add any type of music you like.  It doesn't have to come from a specific place. The controls are easy to use, also.  I would recommend this player. It's a good performer and although you're laying out the cash, you're getting a little more for it.

<Title>Functional, Chic, tons of storage
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my 4th MP3 player, and my second from Creative. I bought another brand and was extremely disapointed, so I did alot of research and comparing before I bought this one. -Number one selling point is price per Gigabyte. I couldn't find anything that compared in this area. -Second, I like the size. I've got a Zen Touch, and I have found that it is a bit too bulky. They scaled this down very well while keeping a decent sized screen. -I love that it is multifunctional. Keeps music and photo files, and has a good enough display that you can actually look at a photo on it. Additionally it will sync with Outlook, so it can be a backup for all of your phone numbers addresses and appointments, and again the display is good enough to actually view these things. -I bought another MP3 player (later returned it) and one of my complaints was that it didn't come with a manual. This player comes with a manual, but it is so easy and intuative to use, that the manual is not needed. I haven't opened it yet, and have had no problems. -FM radio is a nice bonus compared to my Zen Touch as well. -All in all, this is a great product, and I would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a fairly large capacity MP3 player at an affordable price.

<Title>Some shortcomings - but probably better value than IPOD
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Could have been great, but a couple of serious but silly shortcomings -  1) Charging the device off the supplied AC adapter requires a special purpose USB cable to which the adapter plugs in. Means that when I am travelling, I now have to carry an additional cable for me to lose! 2) The creative explorer software did not load on my win2K machine - with a very cryptic message saying about the OS not being supported. There isn't even a README file on the CD> 3) In use the device is still clunky - if you want to change the graphic eq for example, you have to go through a couple of button clicks/scrolls. When using the radio, you cannot adjust the equalizer while the music is playing which I find astonishing. YOu have to stop the radio and then adjust the equalizer!. At least it has an user adjustable equalizer. 4) Radio does not seem to have a selectable mono/stereo switch. You will be stuck on listening to multipath distortion. The radio quality is pretty good, but the sensitivity sucks. 5) You cannot use an external microphone - except through maybe the docking port at the bottom - but a mic that works through a port at the bottom will also cost 10 times as much with all the connector and cabling and besides, this mike won't work anywhere else. 7) At its brightest, the OLED screen is not that bright. Its like any other TFT screen, possibly a tad worse except for viewing angle - as if that matters on a small screen. 8) Limited compatibility and peripherals as compared to the iPod. 9) The adapter could have been much smaller. However, this adapter will also power the creative Travelsound - a bonus if you happen to have their excellent portable speakers. 10) You need to load yet another software on the computer - since the device won't work via win explorer for music and photo upload/download purposes. 11) The device appears quite sturdy, but the port at the bottom which you have to use all the time for charging - is fragile.  Other comments -  1) The touch pad works quite well - and its sensitivity can be set. I wonder why people complain about it being "too sensitive" when one can adjust it perfectly. 2) The device otherwise is well designed and I do like it. However, the clunky cable arrangement for charging, fragile port, and software problems lead me to take 2 stars away from something that would otherwise deserve all 5.  Update - I returned this and got the Toshiba Gigabeat F40 (40 GB version). See the Gigabeat review for a comparison..

<Title>Creative Zen is AWESOME
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Our family now owns two iPods (a mini and a nano) and two Creative Zens (a Sleek and a Vision:M).  While the iPods were easier to set up and use out of the box, the Zens support more formats and integrate easily with a lot of different music library management programs.  In addition, I think the sound from the Zens (don't use the included headphones) is much better.  In the future, I will avoid the hype and stick with Zen players.

<Title>Good hard-drive player
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>           Almost two years after buying a 20GB iRiver to store my favourite music, I decided to buy another 20GB player for two reasons -- firstly to store all my audiobooks, and secondly to see how the technology had evolved over time.  I'm very pleased with this machine so far. Unlike my music, which I recorded at top quality, I recorded all the audiobooks at lowest quality, which works out at about 25MB per CD, in practice. For spoken word, this quality is fine. It is astonishing to store about ,000-worth of CDs on the machine (i.e. about 150 audiobooks) and well over a thousand photos, and still have only used up about half of the disk.   And the really wonderful thing for any traveller is the obvious fact that the machine doesn't get any heavier with all this content!  One bonus: I've seen several trade descriptions of this product which don't even mention the built-in FM radio. This radio gets reliably better reception than either my iRiver or a pocket DAB from Perstel that I probably shouldn't have bought.  Heartily recommended.

<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are looking for a new mp3 player like i was and contiplating the ipod or creative.. i would say go for this mp3 player. Cons.. It has frozen up on me about 3 or 4 times in 2 months. Its a lot bigger than an ipod. The touch pad is not that hard to get use to the first couple days it is difficult but once you get use to it its fine. The earbuds that come with the player are very uncomfortable they are loud but uncomfortable. Buy this mp3 player you wont regret it... 20 gb is plenty of space..pros.. bigger clearer screen then an ipod way more capacity for the money. you dont have to use itunes which itunes in itself is a pain. if you are thinking about buying a really nice mp3 get this one!

<Title>Creative Zen=Very Awesome!
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, so there have been a view reviews here that cite that the player broke. Well, I'm not sure what the deal there was. The player works fine, believe me. It seems to have just been a sad and unfortunate coincidence that they recieved players with faulty hardware or manufacturing.  The player however is wonderful. Hold's a very large quantity of music for a low price (might find it even lower somewhere else...). The touchpad is not the difficult to learn with, and the sensitivity can be set on "low". If you can use an iPod, you can use this MP3 player (thankfully plays WMAs and WAV files).   The software it comes with is okay. Windows Media Player, though, can sync music just as swiftly to the device as any other program. You can set date & time, calendar, sync your tasks with Microsoft Outlook, create playlists, download photos, live recordings, and mess with a bundle of audio and visual settings.  Overall, I very good portable media player. There really are no drawbacks. You get exactly what you pay for (Might want to get new headphones, or use ones you already have). THOUGH, it is SMALL and made of PLASTIC AND SMALL PARTS. So it is FRAGILE. Handle it carefully. I suggest carrying it in a case (Zen makes leather cases for the Sleek Photo Player) or put a plastic skin on it. Place it in the velvet pouch provided WHEN NOT IN USE. Use common sense.  Also, buying a service plan or replacement plan wouldn't hurt either. Note: It lacks accessories. An FM transmiter, docking station, plastic skin (available in a range of colors), and a leather slip-over case are the only ones provided by creative. If you search for Zen Sleek on amazon, a few more should show up.

<Content>I've had this mp3 player since September, and I have to say, I'm loving every minute of it. I don't know how I went without having an mp3 player before now.  The options on it are great, I love the way it looks, and I've just not had any problems with it at all. Though I live in fear of dropping it and ruining it, since it's not a solid-state type memory.  But, I knew the risk when I bought it.  Being able to import your own pictures and use them as backgrounds is a nice feature as well.

<Title>Wonderful Alternative to iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Though iPods seem to be the most popular MP3 Player around, the Creative Zen Sleek Photo is, I think, far bettter.  I was given one as a Christmas gift and absolutely love it.  Despite the lack of accessories, it can be personalized greatly.  There are many photos that come with it, all of which can be used as the background wallpaper for your Creative Zen.  I've downloaded many songs and podcasts onto my Zen with ease.  The only thing I dislike about it is that you cannot look at pictures while listening to music, but that is not a big deal at all.  It froze once, but was fixed as soon as I pressed the reset button.  I really do love this product and suggest that you buy one if you are looking for a wonderful alternative to and iPod.

<Content>This MP3 player worked awesome for several months! then, about a week after the warrenty ended, it wouldn't work. there about 4-5 screens it goes onto regularly on the boot process, but mine goes to the second, freezes for about 3 minutes, then goen to a malfunction page. there are choices to erase all of the memory, reload the firmware, reboot, and something else. Only the reboot works, which just brings you back to the same screen. I can't sell it now, because it doesn't work, and creative won't take it back, becuase it's not warrented. I would not suggest this product to anyone!

<Title>Good Player
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because i'm headed to college and needed one.  I was looking for high capacity, easy to use, and under $200.  I've had the zen sleek photo for about a month now and so far so good.  It was easy to use from the start.  The touch pad took a little longer to get used to but its fine. I have it all set up so as soon as i dock it, all new songs sync to it automatically which makes it even easier.  The battery life is also very good. I've never had an ipod so i can't really compare to that.  But it has done everything i need it to.  The only cons are that you can't see the display in sunlight, and the a/c charger is connected to the usb cord, its kind of a hastle but you can buy a separate a/c cord to charge it for about 10 bucks. Also i noticed some dust getting under the screen, maybe a skin or screen protector will keep this from getting worse.  Overall i am happy with my purchase, as long as it doesnt die or something on me, knock on wood.

<Title>Satisfying
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player because it was a great deal and you should too because Apple is going to give you way fewer GB's for the same price.  Now, the Zen Sleek Photo may be last generation devoid of any video capabilities, but, seriously, can you justify spending $100 more on an Ipod to watch videos on an itsy-bitsy screen?  This is an excellent bargain, plain and simple.   But don't get me wrong, this player is by no means a slouch.  It has a smooth interface that takes all of 5 minutes to get used to.  The included software is simple and I had no problems with it on my laptop.  The player may be a bit on the chunky side, but it is by no means awkward.  The charging/transfer cables are poorly designed when compared to other players, but they still work fine.  However, ound quality on the included headphones is noticeably good, though.  I've had my Zen for several weeks now and have been toting it around campus without any problems.  So fragile, this player is not.  Overall, what you get here is a quality player from a quality company other than Apple at a great price.  If you're in the market for a cheap player and are not concerned about having the latest and greatest, by all means, pick this one up.

<Content>I've been looking for an decent mp3 player for awhile but never wanted to dish out the 300 clams for an Ipod video. I just bought this player from walmart for 166.00 and the extended warrenty is only 22.00 for three more years!! This this is simple to use and simple to load up with tons of music. I've recorded music off the radio and I share all my pics with my friends who are super impressed with the bright clear screen. The sound is awsome!!! The only down side so far is the touch pad is sensative even on low. I recommend this 100% I couldn't figure out something and I called customer service and the lady was nice and solved my problem for me. NO waiting for 20 minutes. Go buy one, atleast for a present, I would have been stoked to get one.

<Content>I think it is better than iPod. It offers more features such as awesome LCD screen, radio and a chargerr. It takes about 2 - 3 days to get used to the touch pad. Sound quality is just great, can't complain about it. You can also set wallpapers which I find very cool, but you can't watch the photos and listen to music at the same time which isn't that good. The "settings" option is feature packed and easy to naviagate. The "select" button which is the middle of the touchpad is very annoying, you press it too much by accident when sliding your finger up and down. Other thing which I think is very stupid is that you need 2 cables to charge it. You need USB cable and the charger connected together - bad design.  I would never give up this player for an iPod. I swear you'll love this product.

<Title>Great player, great price, way better than anything Apple can come out with
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 gb player is the perfect choice for serious electronic and audio junkies, such as myself.  The thing I noticed first about it is that it has some real aesthetic appeal, with a good sized view screen that supports vivid and varied colors (great for viewing photos), and it combines the touch pad with buttons. The touch pad took a little getting used to, but I consider that something minor. Besides, its sensitivity can be adjusted to your preference.  Yet beyond just the aesthetic appeal, there are some major pros for this player. First is the battery life. I can get roughly 20 hours of play time with it (compare that with the iPod's 12 hours for their 20gb model), and the player is fully charged in roughly 2 hours.  The second is the way it feels as I carry it. It seems a little bit on the heavier side, however that lends to a very solid feel. I have already accidentally once onto a tiled floor, and with no interruption or even structural damage (not even a scratch) it kept right on playing as though nothing had happened to it.  The third is all the nice little bonus features that come with it. It comes with an FM tuner, plus the ability to record live broadcasts over the FM band. 32 presets ensure that you can quickly find your favorite stations. There is also a voice recorder built right into the player (as a college student this appeals to me), and then it also syncs with Outlook, so your schedule can go right onto your player.  And finally I had absolutely no problems transferring files from my computer onto the player. It was recognized by both Windows Media Player and Real Player. Plus, the software that comes with it is simple to use.  This is a very good, all-inclusive player. And at a price that is lower than what Apple can boast on their comprable players, it is a steal. This SHOULD be the standard by what other players are judged.

<Content>I bought this mp3 player for my teenage son for Christmas and he loves it.  Great capacity (20GB), easy-to-use buttons, easy to load and manage songs with Windows Media Player 11.  It's very sturdy but we did purchase a separate skin to keep it safe.  The charging cord is great because it can be plugged into a computer via USB or converted to plug into an AC outlet.  The only thing that could be better about the cord is if the end that plugs into the mp3 player was a standard camera-style end rather than the proprietary Creative end.  Great battery life.  Great sound.

<Title>Shocking Customer Service - Cheap parts
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a new player. The power connector (at the base of the player) got stuck with the player because of over heating (I had connected it for exactly about half an hour to charge it). I could not detach the cable from the player. When I finally did - the whole circuitry ripped off from the player and I could not power it anymore. I had the 90-day warranty that comes with the player. When contacted the customer service - they were rude to the core and said I had inflicted physical damage and they are going to charge me - $ 130 ( I bought it for $160) to repair it.   I vow I will never ever buy anything from Creative because of the cheap parts and the rude customer service with lying warranties.

<Title>There are better ones out for the same price... get the 30G...
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had mine for about a month and it crashed. When it worked it was nice, good picture quality, and the program it comes with is better than Itunes. It can play many different file formats. For about the same price you can get the 30G model. The 30G model also plays videos. I know some one that owns that one and it works great.

<Title>Good features, seems reliable
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After some few mistakes I was able to learn the navigation system, which is not that obvious.  I was unable to find how to download a video yet, although I am not that keen on having it.    Good performance at a reasonable price. The human interface needs some inprovement.  I guess, after playing with an iPod, everything seems more challenging.

<Title>Creative's User Interface
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I find it interesting that folks spend so much time knocking the Creative UI, and pile the usual 'whoppies' on Apple for it UI.  I find it interesting because Apple had to settle suit with Creative over patent infringement;  the issue - the iPod menu is based on the Creative menu.  Apple went to Creative to co-develop the iPod, Creative said NO (somebody at Creative must have suck on a bullet for that decision), so Apple 'borrowed' the UI.  So, if you want to beat-up on Creative and tell everyone about how great the Ipod is - please find a new angle, NOT the UI (menu) and NOT the Touch Strip.  Honest iPod folk will tell you that controlling the touch ring is just as "Hit & Miss", as controlling the Touch Strip is.  I'll also note that "professional" review/ers have made a significant mistake in judging Digital Audio Player products.  All players should receive two scores;  the first for the player by itself, the second as a system, meaning hardware plus software.  The simple reality is, that currently - no one is prepared to match the iPod 'experience', so when it comes to the system - the Pods have the lead, and everyone else is playing catch-up.  Note: the 'pros" seem to like the Sansa e200R (NOTE: R seies) system series a lot.  When it comes to hardware ONLY, there are several players that can best the Pods, including Creative, Sansa, and Toshiba.  And if you are into OGG and/or FLAC you have to go elsewhere, as none of these four companies service these Codecs.  And to all a good night...  a.

<Title>Pretty good actually....maybe
<Date>Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this Zen for almost a year (i got it last August) and it's been working pretty well seeing that I've dropped it way to many times to count. Since this is the only brand I've ever bought a decent mp3 player from I can't compare it to any Ipod but my friends. I definiately think its better.   You can download songs from more than one device (as said in many reviews before, but I'm reassuring you), seeing that I loan the thing to friends and they put whatever they think I'd like on it and they all have different players(thanx guys). The screen is really great. The colours show up very well in the pictures. I don't like that you can't see your album art at the same time a song is playing. It has to be a picture. And you can't listen to music while viewing pictures either, but hey thats okay. And I've never really mastered the art of making a slide show, but I don't really need one.  The alluminum back and sides get scratched up pretty bad it you drop it onto concrete or asphalt and the screen gets scratched up pretty easily if you don't have a cover on it, but it's still in pretty good shape for me being a klutz and letting my friends borrow it. The buttons still work fine and everything and the touchpad still picks up. The cool thing(in my opinion) is that you have to use your finger on the touch pad, you can't use a pencil or anything but your finger, which is cool cuz it has to sense that its a finger.  I have over 2000 songs on this thing and over 300 pictures and its barely dented to memory which is awesome. It has like 17 GB left which rocks.It really does hold alot. But it's realy stupid how when you get a brand new mp3 and you plug it in and it has like 19.75 GB and it's completely empty though the thing is supposed to have 20 GB.   The sound on it's fine, but I can complain. Since I go through headphones really fast(I break them so easily) I constantly have to take the headphones out of the jack hole(hehe jack-hole) thingy which made the little plastic thing that's in the hole that holds the headphones in place and presses down so the headphones connect to the player get loose and break out. So everytime I take the headphones out that piece comes with it and I have to make sure I don't lose it and always put it back or the sound sounds like crap (it won't play on the right side and  it sounds far off and distant). Because that little thingy(I don't know what to call it) is loose that sound quality is much worse even with it in there. The headphones don't connect as well so it sounds a lot more far off and distant.  A friend used to have one of the dell mp3's and it weighed about the same as the Zen and was thicker. Compared to an ipod the zen weighes a lot more and if ur not used to it, it can get tiring. And it's so heavy that it slides off things easily and drops heavily to the ground. I'm suprised mine hasn't broken yet.  As with most things as they get older they don't work as well, the battery life on the zen drops greatly as it ages a little bit. I can listen to the thing for at the most seven hours now when I could listen to it forever without the battery even moving when I first got it. And now I'm having problems with it charging. It won't charge at all unless the battery is completely dead and it won't charge all the way up which sucks because I listen it this thing a lot.I don't know if thats normal or if its a defect.  I would reccomend this to somebody if they took care of the thing and didn't do stupid things with it(who knows what my friends did to it). I'm sure it would last ages if you actually took care of the thing and charged it at the right times and everything.    Don't get this if you donn't want to have to take care of it. Or do and just watch the thing lose its life.    Get it if you want a cheap 20 GB Photo mp3 player that you might have a few little problems with but nothing so bad you have to take it back.    Live with it and enjoy the ZEN.

<Title>Great little device for a great little price
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm no hard core user, so for me, this is the perfect device.  I have about 2000 songs on it so far and it has been working perfectly.  It freezes up every once in a while but the reset button takes care of that.  Some folks are putting a bad review on this and I don't think that is fair.  It's an inexpensive player, what do you expect?  It's no Ipod, but I'd still take this over an Ipod any day.  I've had it for about a year now.  I haven't had any complaints worth mentioning.
