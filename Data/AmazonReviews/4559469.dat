<Title>Excellent Choice
<Date>Sun Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently purchased a Muvo 256MB Nomad and its excellent.  I use it to run and workout.  Its a great choice over other mp3's.  Its so small and very easy to use.  I recently bought the Rio Cali, but the software and difficulty connecting to the computer and downloading songs persuaded me to return it for the nomad.  This is a great product.

<Title>MuVo NX is the Perfect Workout MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo NX is my first MP3 player and based on my experience so far, it could be my only!  It really is perfect for my needs - gym, commuting on the subway, air travel...  <p>I spent a lot of time researching these things and chose the MuVo because of it's ultra-portable size (it's smaller and lighter than a Zippo lighter!) and the way you simply plug it into your USB port and drag-and-drop music (I didn't want yet another piece of music-management software on my computer).  The MuVo is the perfect player for folks who a) want the smallest, lightest, most easily navigated digital music player on the market and b) have the ability to actively manage their music on their PC.  While you can't take your entire music collection with you, the 256MB MuVo swallows music.  I have 60+ tracks on it right now (and it's not full) organized in several folders...one for the gym, a jazz collection, a blues collection, etc...  The ability to drag and drop whole folders is key...organize your tracks on your computer and swap entire folders back and forth between player and PC. <p>Features and navigation are great.  The screen, while small, has a cool blue backlight and displays all of the important info - track timer, song title, play modes, etc...and navigating through menus, folders, and options is intuitive and can be done with your thumb alone.  The provided case/belt clip and armband make this thing truly "wearable."  Having traded in a CD player for the MuVo, I can't imagine a workout with anything else!

<Title>Adequate for what it does
<Date>Mon Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the previous model of this player a year ago.  Since then, it has survived my marathon training and a run through the wash.  I just hit my first snag with the volume stuck on full blast with no way to turn it down.  <p>Along the way, I found that it eats batteries so its good to invest in rechargables.  Also, when the batteries gets low, it will do random things from either shutting off or blowing static at full blast into your ears.  I almost fell off the treadmill when it blasted me one time to the delight of nearby runners.<p>Static will cause this little guy to do weird things.  The sound kept dropping out on me until I noticed that my headphones were hitting the treadmill, causing the dropout problem.  Also, every once and awhile, the drive will become corrupted.  Creative includes software to reformat the drive.  When it becomes corrupted, it will sometimes mush your songs into a frankenstein monster.<p>Also, it plays in the order that files are copied to the drive.  There are some free programs out there that allow you to reorder it on the fly.  One such program is muvolist.<p>Overall, it's a great player for working out.  Just be prepared for problems and when they do happen, remember that the internet is your friend.

<Date>Sat Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Create MuVo NX is wonderful. I've only had it for a few hours and it's been wonderful. I could transfer files onto the device easily and quickly and it has been very cooperative. The earbuds have been great and seem to play sonds louder than my old headphones. The uneven cable lengths is a style issue, not a quality issue. The songs on the devide are in alphanumerical order, but I ususally jump song to song manually, so it has no impact.

<Title>Cables different length for a reason
<Date>Tue Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>People complain of the headphone's cable length being weird, but this is on purpose to wear on the arm. This allows one side to reach further behind the back (like a cell phone hand's free). Other than that, great size for working out. Who needs to have a 4 to 40GB hard drive on them, this is for people who don't want to search 5000+ songs to find a good one while using. Anyone who has that many mp3's just screams music pirate anyway :)

<Date>Fri Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>just got my MuVo NX 256 MB MP3 player today and i could not be happier with it.  the software loaded easily, plugged it in, starting uploading songs immediately, and within minutes i was listening to music.  now if yer looking to get music quality you might hear from a CD on yer stereo at home or in your car, yer expectations are a bit much, but i think the sound is great! it weighs next to nothing, so working out with the armband shud not be a problem.  if you are looking for a moderately sized MP3 player (holds about 55 songs), the MuVo is solid.

<Title>Mighty Muvo!
<Date>Sat Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great and tiny alternative for those who think other MP3 players are too expensive, big, or complicated. As a Mac user using System 9.2, this couldn't be easier to use. Even without the battery, the tiny unit plugged in right into the USB port and came up instantly on my Mac without having to install anything; true plug &amp; play! This also makes sharing songs with other people easy (assuming you want to risk the wrath of the RIAA, not that I'd ever do it of course). Windows users will probably have to install the enclosed software. Then it was simply drag and drop. This makes updating it so easy! This is especially useful when you just want to hear individual songs. It will hold folders of songs like if you want a whole album, but unless you preface each track with a order number (01, 02, 03, etc), it will play the folder in alphabetical order. It has a decent MP3 display for song titles (not artists). Also, the headphones are crappy but the sound is very good if you replace them. And yes, there's a slight buzz when the backlight goes on for a second, but if you don't make any adjustments while playing you'll never hear it like during a workout. Also, the single AAA battery lasts 11 hours which is also replacable, unlike iPods which you have send the whole thing back. It holds 4 hours of music in non-compressed CD quality (a minimum 128kbs), which is plently of non-repetetive music for the commuter, excersise enthusiast, or pretty much anyone. It can hold more in a more compressed format, but you'll notice the difference in sound. It includes most of the major playback selections like normal, repeat, and shuffle play for the whole player or folders. No programming feature, but that can be fixed by making a folder on you computer of songs and tranferring it to the Muvo. It also doubles as a voice recorder or for holding any small non-audio file. For the very minor problems it has, this a very simple machine that really delivers.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My biggest concern was the voice recording capability because I intend to use it during lectures at school. After trying it out, I'd have to say that I'm satisfied. The sound quality is great, and it's fairly easy to use. I also really like the storage capability. All in all, this mp3 player is everything that it was advertised as. Small, compact, easy to use, etc. However, there are two improvements I would like to see. One, I wish it had radio capability. When I'm in the gym, I would like the option to tune my fm frequency to listen to the tv without switching to my cd player, which does have fm capability (but then again, I knew this when I was buying it). The second problem is the speed. It really is not a huge deal, but the 1.1 USB speed is pretty slow. When you're only deleting/adding just a couple songs at a time, it probably won't be noticeable, but when you're loading up 40 songs at once, you'll wish it was quicker. I guess it's all about cost/benefit. You can pay 30-40 bucks more and get the TX which uses 2.0 USB. Other than that, I really like this player. The armband/belt clip comes in handy as does the extra battery pack.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue May 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received this MP3 player a couple days ago and here is what I have to say about it.<p>This is a great package. The packaging comes with everything you'll need, including headphones, two colored battery holsters, an armband, a belt loop, a AAA battery, as well as all the documentation you would ever need.<p>Right out of the box this thing impressed me. The CD installed very smoothly and easily. Within 20 minutes I had already loaded over 70 MP3 files on the player and was already listening.<p>The sound quality is fair, it lacks bass, but I think that's the headphone's fault. The headphones are nice looking earbuds, but I am not too fond of earbuds. These are the best I've seen out of all the earbuds I've experienced, but they are uncomfortable after a long period of time, and they fall out of my ears /very/ easily. The sound is very clear, but the lack of bass led me to purchase a pair of Sony behind the neck headphones, which should improve this a good bit. More on that when those arrive though.<p>The belt clip is really nifty and works well, the player stays put and doesn't move around or fall out. The armband is a little confusing at first, but once you figure out how to use it, it's quite simple and good for the active person who is running around outside playing sports or what not.<p>I've heard talk about a few things, mostly rumors that I would like to dispel. First off, the headphones are NOT defective. The left side fits in like normal, and the right sides goes BEHIND your neck and into your right ear. This makes the length fit just perfectly for most people. I actually prefer it, as now there is nothing hanging out in front of me when I'm out playing around with my yo-yos; nothing to get them tangled in. Also, there is talk about slow transfer speed. I'm not sure how patient these people are, but the speed is fairly decent, perhaps 5-7 minutes for 70 or so songs. Not too bad in my opinion. I just start the transfer, and do something else for a little bit, and then I'll check back and they'll be done. It's perfectly fine for everyday use, and unless you feel like paying $40 more for the TX (which is the same size, only using a USB 2.0 interface), which I don't think is worth it.<p>So here is the rundown of things that I do like and things that I do:<p>LIKES:<br>-Very small, very compact<br>-Very easy to set up<br>-Easy to carry<br>-Transfer speed acceptable<br>-Holds plenty of music<br>-Battery life is decent<br>-Looks very clean and sleek<p>DISLIKES:<br>-Headphones are sub-par<br>-Fits upside down into my front mounted USB ports (cannot see the screen to know when it's completely done transferring files)<br>-Armband has no instructions, have to figure it out yourself or from a friend.<p>Overall, it's an excellent product, just needs some better headphones.<p>Jared<p>EDIT: I got a pair of Sony MDR-G72 Behind the Neck headphones to replace the somewhat sub-par earbuds that the MP3 player. The sound quality that you will hear from these headphones are the perfect complement to the Muvo NX. Absolute perfection for ym ears, I love it.

<Content>As an owner of an Archos 30GB jukebox, which I love, I needed something that I could take a CDs worth of music with me while I work out.<p>I bought this player and it is THE best thing I have ever taken with me. I can take about 2-3 CDs worth of music, put it on my arm while I run, exercise, etc. and it works beautifully. All the buttons are easy to reach on my arm. The menu is EASY to use, it doesn't skip (flash memory), and haven't tested out the battery lifve, but using a AAA battery, it's no big deal to just put another one in. <p>This is the best portable I have used, I now carry it EVERYWHERE I go as it can be used as a portable drive as well. I love it.

<Title>IF it was a woman I'd marry it.
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Okay, So this is the 4th MP3 player I purchased in the past month. I tried the Dell Juitbox 20G. A Samsung and a IPOD. I needed to take off a week of work to stay home and figure out the Dell. On my Harley the thing kept freezing and finally just bit the dust after 2 weeks. The Samsung would NOT let me download from Musicmatch WMA files. The IPOD was miserable to figure out menus. So I purchased the Creative Labs Muvo NV 256MB as a last resort before returning back to my simple Tape cassette player on the bike. Plain and simple: This is SO SIMPLE, beautifully designed, AGAIN SIMPLE to use MP3 there is. It downloaded all songs both MP3 and WMA files no problem and no glitches. The menus on it are superb, easy to read, easy to navigate, no brainer toggleing. Its tiny, amazingly free of glitches, and wont freeze on my Harley. Plugs directly into the USB port with no wires and no problems with my windows XP like the others had. I actually hired a guy to help me figure out the other MP3 playes I purchased and even he was boggled. I didnt even call him for this. Whoever invented this thing is a genious and realized that I AM NOT. BUY this thing and dont think twice. Enjoy.

<Title>A must have for the gym.
<Date>Wed Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So, a little while ago I was in the market for an MP3 portable device.   I pretty much ruled out the iPod (I'd rather be dead than cool) and the Creative Nomad. Even though these are top notch players, I felt they were just a little too big for the gym, which would be its primary use.  After much research I decided to go with the Creative Muvo NX 256mb. I wanted more variety at the gym and the cost jump from 128mb to 256mb was minimal. I also went with the NX model instead of the TX model because the only things the TX offers that the NX doesn't is USB 2.0 transfer and FM Radio. The content on FM absolutely sucks, and the transfer rate really wasn't a big deal to me, plus the NX was $40.00 cheaper.  If you're running Win XP or 2000 (which you should be) the install is a snap. Just plug it in! It will auto recognize and install all the necessary drivers. The only good thing about the included software is the format utility. If you have MusicMatch or any type of mp3 ripping software, the rest of the Muvo software is a waste of time. From there all you have to do is drag and drop as you would with any other folder.   I read from just about everybody that the supplied headphones have much to be desired. So that being said I went out and purchased a set of Sony MDR-E829V Fontopia Ear-Buds ($10.00), and kept the included buds as backups. Most of my mp3s ripped to 160kbps. As far as sound quality I have no complaints at all, even at 128kbps. I usually have the volume set to max in the noisy gym atmosphere. Which brings me to battery life.  This bad boy runs on a single AAA. I usually get about 12hrs out of the Energizer E2 AAA that I use (volume at max, backlight turned off). But of course the battery life will vary depending on how much you fuss with it and volume level.  The on screen display has a lot of other options like EQ, play modes and such, everything you would expect. It also has a voice recorder which I haven't used, and probably never will. PLUS, it has a killer nylon strap u can put on your arm, its super convenient for the gym, never gets in the way.  The low down.  Pros: Super small and convenient Excellent battery life and sound quality Easy to use.   Cons: Stock ear buds need to be upgraded  **If you go to the gym often, this is the perfect mp3 player for you, hands down!

<Content>I have owned several MP3 players including RCA's Lyra, Nike-Philips and a couple of variations of Rios.  I am multisport and tend to be hard on equipment.  I got this MP3 player two months ago and have been waiting for it to fall apart, but it has not. It is very easy to use out of the box, I love the direct USB attachment (no wires), it's functional, the arm band is great and I could not be happier with the sound, size and performance and especially the price.  I highly recommend it.  The RCA Lyra--I always encountered memory problems after seeveral weeks of use--I could not change up mp3s without major issues. Low cost, but tech headaches.  Nike-Philips--DO NOT BUY IT it stinks.  hard to figure out. Crappy outsourced support in India which was HORRIBLE.  Limited memory. It's a great design and looks sexy but like the sneakers its all marketing--no substance.  It is all glitz and packaging. Really not worth it.   Rio--Expensive and not worth the money when there are products like Muvo that do a better job at a fraction of  the cost.

<Title>Great little doohickey
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, got this for my birthday to work out with. I wanted a nice and small unit for jogging, that would hold at least an hour's worth of songs and work in Linux.  Since I use Linux 100% of this time, this is great, because it just works! I have usb and mass-storage compiled in my 2.6.8 kernel and can mount the drive (it uses fat16). The file names get truncated to 8.3 dos format when you copy them to the device. Also it doesn't like spaces in the file names.  My only compaint is that the ear buds are a little large and get uncomfortable after about 20-30 minutes.  It takes about 5-7 minutes to fill the device from 0 to 256mbs. I kinda wish I had gotten the USB2.0 version, but I can't complain, it was a gift.

<Date>Sat Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Somehow,the music is'nt great. I ripped the music from original CD's using Muvo's software, but this tiny player can play things right, but music is'nt that rich when compared to other MP3 players like iRiver or iPod. It has a shrill, mechanical undertone (ya, i tried to fix it by adjusting the equalizers, but no good),and lacks the normal bass. An advice for Amazon: I know Jeff's gotta big store, but please send me CDs, not boomerangs!! Sorry for the wry humor! The included software cd was very wavy and cud'nt play. It almost damaged my ultrabay device of my thinkpad.I had to download the required software from www.nomadworld.com Endnote? Just buy it for the heck of it!

<Title>Very "creative"!!!
<Date>Thu May 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found the other reviews very helpful in making my decision and will just add a couple of things.  <p>First of all, I found the design to be very "creative".  Basically it is a flash memory stick that plugs into a USB drive to copy music or data files.  Then, you just snap it into a battery pack and you have a player, which is very small (the size of a lighter) and very light.  There is no need for a cable, and you can also use it as portable memory.<p>This product is perfect for jogging or going to the gym.  You won't fit your entire collection on 256MB, but you'll get your favorites in and the new album you just got.  I fitted more than 120 songs on it.  <p>Concerns:  It might not be loud enough for some people.  In a noisy gym, I had to turn the volume up all the way.  Finally, it uses a AAA battery.  I would have preferred a more powerful, rechargable internal battery.  <p>I decided on this flash-memory based player vs. a hard-drive based one, such as the i-pod.  Those i-pod like players which can store your entire music collection are very close to being obsolete.  New products, like the Archos AV380, are coming out which can not only store music, but movies as well and can do so much more than just play music.  However, the Nomad will still remain useful because you'll probably still want to have something this compact.  Even if you stop using it for listening to music, it can still function as flash memory and should be quite useful for transporting files between home and office.

<Content>When I first saw this item on Amazon.com I couldn't stop going back to read the reviews. I decided after reading many positive AND negative reviews to buy this item. I was so shock when I got this item a day after I ordered it. I couldn't wait to open the box! I started transferring MP3 music into this device that same night! I was up almost all night! I can't believe how GOOD the sound quality of this device! It sounds better than my stereo in the car! <br>The earphone, is NOT defective. It's meant to be worn around behind your neck. It's like a regular earphone, you just need to put the Right earphone around behind your neck to your ear. I personally think this is a genius idea! I was fed up many times for having my earphone taggled up when I am trying to do things, like lifting weight, etc.<br>So don't wait any longer. Get this Creative Labs Muvo NX 256 MB MP3 Player and you won't be sorry.<br>Amazon.com RULES!!

That way the rechargable battery doesn't wear out and you don't have to spend time recharging it, you just change the battery and go.  Anyway, you can still buy AAA rechargables to use if you want.

<Title>Perfect MP3 Player!
<Date>Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is really a review of the Creative Labs MuVo TX 256MB MP3 player which has the 2.0 USB connection, which is super fast, much faster than the 1.1 that almost all other ones have.  I purchased this so I could have music for working out and so I could have a portable drive for power point presentations etc.  <br>First, it is the perfect size and comes with belt clip and arm band.  It plugs directly into the USB port on your computer so you don't have to lug around all those cables etc.  The display is excellent, backlit blue, the controls are easily accessible while running, the software included allows you to build your own play list folders and to take music off your CDs and put it on the MP3 player.  The latter is an awesome feature as I have several CD mixes that were burned that I love to run to and I was thrilled to be able to easily transfer them to my new MP3 player.  In order to load music to the player you just click and drop them in.  <br>It sounds like some people had trouble hearing with the headphones, but I thought they were fine.  I am however using Sony earbuds as I think they do have better sound and are more comfortable.<br>I would highly reccommend spending the extra $$ on this product as I think it is exceptional.  I am truly pleased with it.

<Title>Everything I was looking for

<Content>I needed something to use while running and other situations that favored ultra-portable.  This player is very smartly engineered (I'm electronic quality engineer by trade).  Buttons are in all the right places.  Arm carrier is great.  Love the way I can plug this in at work and listen without downloading MP3's onto the company computer (a no-no).  At first I thought 256MB might get old but it's been more than enough for my tunes.  The best part about this is it's not Sony, who's so paranoid about copyrights that they handcuff their users with their software.  Great job Creative Labs.

<Title>Small / Lightweight / Perfect
<Date>Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the perfect small MP3 player.  Easy to use, easy to work out with, what more do you need?  Instead of having a big MP3 player clanging against your body like an IPOD while you are working out, you hardly know this one is even with you.  Except for the fact the sound is great.  USB could be a bit faster and battery life is ok, the higher the sound goes up, the shorter the battery life.  But, overall, this is a great player.  I have used mine traveling, running, reading, and it has worked well for 5 months.  I have little to complain about.  B+<p>Joseph Dworak

<Content>I got this mp3 player as a present and I loved it. I use it for my Karate forms and the voice recorder is very usefull if I need to remember a correction in my form.<p>Pro's: - Nice sound quality<br>       - Good volume control. You can put the volume up loud enough to be used as a mini radio, or you can make it a whisper.<br>       - Good storage<br>       - Nice small desighn<br>Con's: - Well I guess I'm supposed to put something here, but I couldnt find anything so I look at it for a while and the only thing I could find was that the headphones are earbuds, but you just have to get new ones.<p>PS: some people have said that the earbuds are defective... come on people they were made like that one side is supposed to be longer (duh!)
