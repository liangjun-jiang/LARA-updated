<Title>Awesome, well-designed little player
<Date>Mon May 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a fanatic...I normallly do alot of research before buying anything...I looked at the Creative Zen, mini-IPOD etc. Then I came across this beauty by chance on Amazon, released at the start of April. It is incredible..very light and tiny, beautiful clear screen, user-friendly software, great sound. The earphones included are terrible but thats pretty normal for this sort of purchase. Everyday use is childs-play, uploading songs is quick and easy. Controls are perfect too and well-designed.  I took a chance and bought this without any real knowledge of its reliability..so far so good..dropped it already and no problems. Also comes with a handy case.   Most of my friends have mini IPODs...I was tempted to join the masses...but everyone agrees this jukebox is superior...and its far nicer to look at..the aluminium finish is superb, though it does get smudged easily. I am a very proud owner so far. Added addition is ability to look at photos.  Be brave and buy this...you will not be disappointed!!!

<Title>Pretty nice mini-DAP
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good Stuff - Small dimensions, average build-quality - Shiney, polished-metal style materials (plastic, actually)  - 5Gb MicroDrive  - 5-way joystick plus a mechanical wheel-scroller for zooming quickly through lists  - Charges over USB  - Color screen (not TFT, the duller type) - File/Folder browsing AND iD3 based browsing (Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Year, etc)  - Profiling (can scan tracks and self-databased iD3-tag info like Rio Carbon, no software required)  - View photos  - 5-band custom EQ  - Choose MSC or MTP complient in the Settings Menu. First time we've seen this ability. Might as well stick with the Mass Storage Complient option unless you're a big fan of WMP10  - Damn near gapless MP3 playback  - Power output (volume) is very strong, like 50 steppings - Includes a protective case with belt clip and AC adapter (you don't get these with an iPod anymore) - Includes Sennheiser MX400 earbuds which are a lot better than you usually get for freebies  The Bad - No dedicated play controls, use the joystick instead  - Color screen is small (1-inch), colors are washy  - No FM radio or recording  - Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time - Battery life doesn't seem that great so far, like old iPod Minis - case does not have cut-outs for controls or screen  (...)

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Sun May 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased this product and expected a lot from it. The overall design is sleek and the advertised features impressed me. While the price tag is a bit steep, I nevertheless forked out the cash. To my surprised I was very disappointed by its performance. The USB cable was flimsy and didn't seem to fit my player properly, my computer would not recognize the device. I was forced to use an extra USB cable I had. While the music transfer was a breeze, my player began to get extremely hot in minutes. And froze on several occasions. While this might merely be one time malfunction, nonetheless for the 250 dollars I paid I expected a lot more. I would not recommend this product.

<Title>How RCA Lyra works with Napster To Go
<Date>Sat Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>How to make RCA Lyra RD2765 be recognized as MTP player and installed as Napster To Go device.  There are 2 settings you should check:  1) Be sure that your Protocol is set to MTP (Microsoft Transport Protocol) to insure that your device will work with N2G.   2) The correct MTP driver must be installed by Windows XP. If not, it will only be recognized as a USB Mass Storage device.  There are 2 protocols in this device: MTP & MSC.  You can switch between MTP & MSC if you are a Windows XP user. Unfortunately, old Windows O/S users like Win98 cannot make this switch. It will be fixed to MSC.  How to switch from MTP to MSC and vice versa.  1. From the settings menu, rotate the Control ring to select Advanced.  2. Push the Control Joystick to the right to view Advanced options.  3. The current protocol will be displayed.  4. Press the Control Joystick to switch be tween MTP and MSC.  5. Push the Control Joystick to the left to return to the previous submenu, or press the M button to exit the menu.    More information on MTP & MSC:  Why do I want to use MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) Mode?  MTP Mode is essential if you want to transfer DRM content to your Lyra Jukebox. Today MTP Mode is only supported in Windows XP and through Windows Media Player 10.0 or other special software provided by your music service provider. In MTP mode you Lyra Jukebox will no longer show up as a drive letter. So programs that were designed to work with a device that shows up as a drive letter will not be able to work directly with the Lyra Jukebox.  Why do I want to use MSC (Mass Storage Class) Mode?  If you are using Windows 98SE, ME or 2000 you can not use MTP Mode only MSC Mode is available. Your Lyra Jukebox will always show up as a MSC device.  If you are using Windows XP your Lyra Jukebox will show up as a MTP device, but we have provide you the option to be able to switch it to MSC Mode with a setting in the Advanced Options section of the Lyra Jukebox. Once this setting is set to MSC Mode every time you connect the device to the PC it will show up as a drive letter and allow you to use any software that can work with MSC Mode. This will also allow the current version of LyraDJ or any other playlist editing program to find the device.  All supported content put on the device in either mode MTP or MSC will be available to play on the device once it is disconnected from the PC. So you could add mp3 files in the  MSC Mode then run LyraDJ, Profile the device and disconnect it. Then switch it to MTP Mode and reconnect it and add DRM content to it.

<Content>personally i think that this thing is a great mp3 player if you intend to only have it for a few months, i've had mine for 3 months today, and so far the only thing that i've found is that is, wheel used for ajusting the volume sucks! and then eventually the little joystick will stop working and it is very hard to keep clean. It is currently in the process of being sent to the manufacturer so that i can be fully refunded my money.

<Title>I'm not impressed
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My unit is actually the red one that is 4 GB but otherwise the same. I'm not impressed at all. Within TWO DAYS of gentle treatment the screen had a line through it. I didn't like the musicmatch software or synching with Windows Media Player. I DO like the hard drive factor  and once I changed it from MTP to MSC it worked better. I thought it was a good price for a 4 GB model, but I'm not sure I'm even going to keep it now. It is small and cute, but not very sturdy. I also can't find a case to fit it appropriately and still allow access to the controls. All the cases seem to be made for iPods.

<Title>This thing is worhtless
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating.  I should have read the reviews here first.  It won't even connect with our computer using a USB port I use all the time and we've tried 3 cords, 2 of which are verified.  The device just says 'connecting' and windows says the device is malfunctioning.  I hope we can get our money back since we ordered it through an Amazon affiliate.  We've tried some of the settings suggestions posted here to no avail.  I would give it a negative star if that was an option.  Maybe it's just this one that is a lemon.  But this is a real disappointment as it was a gift for my husband and I spent a lot of time researching this purchase.  Paint me a sucker.

<Title>Terrible service
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am still waiting to receive my player from having it shipped off more than 1 month ago.  Got the player for Christmas, got it up and running with no problem.  Putting required software on my computer was a breeze.  I really like the sleek, shiny look of the player and it had good organization of files, etc.  Anyway, after about 2 days, got a message when I turned it on that "File system was corrupted."  Player was still under warranty, so I shipped it off to their processing HQ in TX.  They received my package (as shown by UPS) 4 weeks ago.  Called once, after 2 weeks, and they said it had not been logged into the system, but would get it taken care of.  Now, today it is still not logged into their system and I can call back in 24-48 hrs to check my status.  Calling in takes every bit of fifteen minutes of listening to horrendous Pan-flute music looped over and over again.  I think this would be a nice player, but customer service is sorely lacking.  I will write a real review of this player... if I ever get it back.

<Title>Great MP3 Product
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Christmas 2005 I purchased 1 RCA MP3 player and 1 Samsung MP3 player, the RCA one was so easy to load songs onto, I was done within say 15 minutes.  It took me 2 Hours + sitting there playing with the Samsung MP3 player and to no end couldnt get it to load any songs unless you used their software and napster, and even the napster software wouldnt load onto my computer.  So we took the Samsung MP3 player back, and found another RCA online through Amazon, and again had the songs loaded onto it within minutes, the Jukebox program is so easy to use, its just a really really good MP3 player for anyone who already had mp3's on their computer.  I would recommend this 100%

<Title>Adequate except battery life.
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is very attractive to look at and the controls are better than some other players. The battery life doesn't come anywhere close to what is advertised. I have found some flaws which I'll discuss below.     1. The player requires Windows Media Player 10 in order to be recognized by Windows. If you get a message that the unit is malfunctioning, just hold down the center button continuously while plugging it in the USB port and it will reboot.     2. I am using WMA files at 64kbps. I know that these files are fine because they work perfectly in other devices. In this Lyra there is a tendency to skip a few times each song. No lockup, just skipping. After backing up the default folders and clearing the songs I did a format as this usually fixes the problem. After reloading the songs I found the problem still there. Not good.    3. The unit gets VERY hot if you are downloading for a long time. I wonder if this has contributed to the meager battery life. I am fortunate to get 3 hours between charges.    4. Do NOT let the player profile songs by itself after a hotsync. You will wind up with album titles but the song selection will say "track 1", "track 2" etc. The right way to profile after downloading is by doing it on the computer. In the taskbar there is a LYRA icon. Right click and select profile songs. Everything comes out perfectly and it takes seconds instead of minutes the other way.    5. If you are in the middle of an album and have to turn the player off don't expect to be returned to where you left off. Every time you turn it off you go back to square one and have to start all over again. I think that this is the most annoying trait of the Lyra. Very, very annoying.    6. The included case is well above average but the power button couldn't be in a worse place. You have to hit it when taking the player out of the case and it sometimes engages while in your pocket. Also, when you activate the hold function to lock all the buttons, it doesn't really lock the power button. Here's why. You get a message to unlock the player on the color screen. And it stays on until you unlock. I took the player out with a full charge and on hold. It was in my shirt pocket. I unwittingly must have pressed against the power button. It is so easy to do. Well, a few hours later I went to use the thing and noticed the unlock message. It must have been on for some time because after unlocking it the thing died. Dead battery. I recharged the battery and then duplicated the situation. Sure enough the message stayed on; the screen stayed lit and the battery died after only an hour. This is unacceptable.        Overall, I would have liked to give this Lyra 2765 a higher score. It is the right size and the controls are very user friendly. However, it seems that on the whole this player was not well thought out. There are other players out there for the same money that do a much better job. It made me wonder when I first opened the quick start guide that the first thing you read is a notice that if you are having trouble with WMP 10 go to a certain website for a fix. Apparently RCA doesn't have much confidence in their product either. I hope this review helps anyone thinking about buying the Lyra 2765.

<Content>This unit is quite nice to operate, software is good. But when the battery gets low, there is no warning before the unit just freezes with backlight on; you can't turn it off, you can't charge it, you can only wait...days...until the battery finally dies from drawing power to the backlight, then it can be recharged. If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars. But alas, it gets just 1 star due to that, and a return for refund.

<Title>Customer Service is a misnomer
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I hope you like this product because you will grow old waiting for customer service to do anything about it. We purchased the LYRA 2765 on January 2, 2006.  It would not hold a charge.  After several calls to the RCA/Thomson Customer Service department, I was given a Return Authorization #.  I returned the player on January 20.  After several more phone calls, I was told on March 2  they could not ship a replacement and would refund my money.  I have since faxed them 3 times with copies of receipts etc.  and made several more phone calls.  (Bring a cup of coffee to the phone when you call Thomsons Cust. Service, because each phone call to Thomson requires a 20-40 minute hold.)  On April 13, I was told the refund was being processed.  On May 22, when I tried to call, I was told the wait time would be from 30-60 minutes.

<Title>If you're looking for fingerprints...
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Almost everything about this player is above satisfactory in my opinion.  Playback and sound is awesome.  Nice volume control with several different playback EQ settings.  Also a setting for manual EQ.  The battery life is decent--I've played it continuously for over three hours at variable bitrates and still had at least a half-charge showing on the display.    Windows Media Player is a pain if you use it to upload your MP3's WMA's.  I've found MusicMatch or just plain drag and drop to be much more convenient.  In fact, the only way I've found to utilize the album art function is to edit the song and upload with MusicMatch.  My wife has the red 4 GB earlier model, and it also is above average in quality.  The only drawback to mine, though, is the fingerprints that cover the entire "chrome" casing.

<Title>Almost perfect...
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this MP3, but there are some drawbacks that do annoy me. The first, is that you have to use the joystick for everything, and that really limits ammount of controls it accepts. The second, is that my songs work fine on my computer, but when I transfer them, about 1/10th get really messed up. My songs get melded together, so I will hear the first half of one song and the end of another, the get cut short, so I hear a minute of a song, and then it restarts the song until the song should be over, and all sorts of other things. This doesn't bug me too much because I have so many songs after a while, you learn to skip over the messed up songs, and I don't usually mess around with it once I turn it on. Its almost perfect, but not quite!

<Content>Works fine as a music player but didn't perform the function for which it was purchased: to play downloaded audiobooks.  At least in Massachusetts, audiobooks are downloaded from libraries as single files of up to 150 mb.  However, this player lacks a "bookmarking" feature so you cannot listen to 10 pages worth, stop the player, and pick up where you left off the next day.

<Title>It's nice for a beginner or newbie mp3 owner.
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello, I've decided to write a review on my experience with the RCA LYRA 2765. I owned it for about 9 months before I got that horrible "File System Corrupted" message. Now this little gadget worked nice , it had on average 6 hours of playtime (No, It does not play for long periods of time, so forget that *12* hours promise on the box) The file transfer through the USB cord was fast, but when you wanted to profile a long list of songs, it took over an hour, or would freeze and you had to start again. It was durable, I dropped it a couple of times. However, it did get dirty. I mean really, smudged, icky looking dirty becuase of the shiny silver chrome. It won't be shiny after a few weeks, trust me. I was able to get about 1,400 songs on the 5 GB hard disk, most of them in WMA format. You can also change the background picture, but don't bother using this as a photo viewer. It just sucks at holding photos. They were all tiny and screwed up. Also, be aware that this MP3 player will not last past 1 year. I've never talked to an RCA LYRA owner who has had one for more than 9-10 months. For some reason, no matter how nice you take care of it and no matter how good your music is in formats, eventually this little message pops up that says "File System Corrupted". I tried to reset it, over an over. I tried to take the hard drive out and clean it, but it still had that message (ALSO, if you do take your LYRA apart like I did, it voids the warranty) But Thompson has some crappy customer service so don't bother calling them. ANYWAY, It's a nice gift for someone who has never had an MP3 player before and wants to test drive it. But for a real, long lasting player, go with Creative or Sony. Or sell your soul and buy that iPod.

<Title>Don't Buy!
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this item in March 2006 to start my new workout regime. I used it for music only. It started off nice, I had about 400 songs on it (lasting between 3 and 4 minutes in WMA format). When I first got it, I could get some serious playtime out of it. As I used it only for the gym, I can't estimate the number of continuous hours of play. In any event. After about 3 months of usage (June 2006), it wouldn't last more than an hour. So I deleted the songs that didn't do much for me in the gym, bringing the total songs down to about 300. In August, I lost my workout steam--much like the Lyra lost it's music play steam--and put it away for a while. I recently started back using it (December 2006) and I now get about 15 minutes of play time from this device.  Man, I wish I'd purchased an Apple iPod.

<Title>Good little player ^_^
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my little Lyra RD2765A at the local FYE about 2 weeks ago. I can say that so far, I'm very happy with it. I pretty much stick to using the basics of it, transfer files to it using browser windows instead of any program, aside from the Lyra DJ ( I also do my own music file tagging before hand in Winamp, RARELY do I ever use Windows Media Player ).   File transfers are simple to do, the sound is GREAT, and the volume control sensitivity is VERY nice. I do agree that using this to look at images is kind of pointless ( why would people want to look at a highly detailed image on small screens anyway? Give me a full 17" computer screen, thank you. ).   I like the little navigation joystick, it's easier to feel for when you have to keep your eyes on the road or where you're walking. The only downside to it is that you have to lock the player when you put it in it's sleeve so when the joystick moves, it doesn't affect anything.   Also, trying to find car adapters if a car doesn't have a tape deck is a bit annoying, as most adapters out there now are made to fit Ipods sockets, and not much else. Same goes with protective sleeves. There are NO protective sleeves out in the market that fit the design of the RCA Lyra RD2765A. And yes, the shiny mirror finish DOES show off finger prints badly. But it's nothing a little TLC can't take care of.   We'll see what my opinion on the player is during the next few months, but so far, I'm very happy ^_^.  ~~Bee
