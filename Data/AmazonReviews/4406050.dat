<Title>If you are in the military stationed overseas don't buy RCA products!
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my son last July. Six months later, it stopped working. Contacted the company and was told that I had to send the item back and they will issue a replacement after I pay $69.95. I sent the item, and authorized them to charge my credit card. Several calls later and I have not received a replacement. Every time there is a new reason why the item has not been sent. After six months of waiting, I was told today that they cannot ship the item to a Post Office Box. Well,  we are in the military stationed overseas and only have a post office box. The funny thing is that my husband came today and said that he found an RCA MP3 player and would like to buy it. My answer: over my dead body!

<Title>Zero Customer Service, I would not recommend RCA Products
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Phillipines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.  We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund.
