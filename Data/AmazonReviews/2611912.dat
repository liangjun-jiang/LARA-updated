<Title>it can't be better!
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got one! it's just awesome on video playback, awesome! my friend insist that i should compare it with PSP, but here is my point: it's about two third thickness of old 60G, and it has 2.5 inch screen, it play awesome video. what else you want from an iPod?! To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen. No block at all!  But there are several thing to remind you, there is no POWER Adapter in case, and they trade off a like-leather case. check the size of the new iPod, i don't think any solid old iPod case fits perfectly.  New iPod has screen lock function, like chubb lock. that's interesting! Since i just got it less than 2 hours, i can't give more information about the battery or other new functions. But, no doubt, it fullfills me really well. Take it, it will never turn you down!

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my fourth iPod and definitely my favorite, it's a great player and I love the ability to be able to watch videos.  I'm not bothered by the fact that they left out the charger block as I already have two, plus you don't really need one.  For everyone who is considering getting on or already has one and doesn't know how to convert video to it here's a short guide (assuming you already have video on your computer, from wherever).  Ok, very easy, the PSP uses the exact same video format so use google to find a PSP video converter and make your video 320x240 and either 512 or 384 kbps.  Use mp3 audio at 96 or 64 kbps.  This will make video about 200mb per hour plus it looks great on the iPod.

<Title>Great player, hard to find Accessories
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my 60GB model through the Apple website along with some accessories.  This was my first iPod purchase and I am very happy with the unit and how easy it was to load it with my mp3 library.  The unit is small elegant and packed with features.  However, I was disappointed to find no AC charger included (I had wanted to use one in my office and the IT folks won't allow me to load the software to use the USB cable).  I was also disappointed to find out I could not easily find a case for this model (hopefully they will be available soon).  The biggest disappointment was that many of the accessories for previous models (including FM transmitters) are incompatible with this model since there is only a headphone jack and no charging jack on the top.  I'm sure the after market guys will soon develop more accessories, but it is frustrating to own the flagship model and not be able to use it in the same manner as people who own less expensive or older models.

<Title>Solid if not spectacular
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had for almost a week now. Solid (first) attempt at place- and time-shifting video programming. Video color screen is vivid and rich. 60GB of storage is more than abundant (I honestly think 30GB will suffice for most users). Using my iBook, I'm able to convert full-length 8GB DVDs of movies into 600MB MPEG4's for "downtime" viewing (e.g., commute, slacking off during lectures or meetings) on my iPod using a free downloadable (Apple-only) program called HandBrake (available at versiontracker dot com) (this process takes 4-6 hours, and is something you start before going to bed....in the morning, just load the finished product onto your iPod as you would music files). Much more elegant and not as bulky or expensive as other portable video players, although not as flexible in terms of content sources either (see Archos' player).  No mechanical or cosmetic problems yet (see iPod Nano). Video capabilities would be better served if screen utilized more real estate (i.e., make it widescreen; but I suspect that's a technical limitation at present). Comes with USB cord, software CD, and earbuds, but no AC or desktop charger. Limited 5G iPod 3rd-party accessories at present.

<Title>Great product but can still improve a little
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked this up yesterday because my mini's 4Gb just wasn't enough anymore. The new color screen is extremely sharp, just like looking at my LCD monitor. I love being able to watch my favorite music videos on it although iTunes didn't have my favorite, Stacy's Mom. But I'm sure their video library will expand every Tuesday just like their music. It's also a nice feature to be able to download TV shows from ABC to watch at my convenience. But once again, the selection will need to improve on that one as well. I've only had it for one day and I bought a leather case with it but even the case made for it has already started to scratch the glossy black surface. So I'm disappointed with that. The operation of the clickwheel is slightly different than my iPod mini. When I'm scrolling through artists, songs, etc., it will scroll at normal speed and then jump maybe 4 times faster than normal so you're going from Aerosmith to Pink Floyd and the next thing you know you're looking at ZZ Top. On paper the feature probably sounded like a good idea but in reality it's just annoying and as far as I can tell, it's not an option that can be turned off. Overall I'm still very happy with it and highly recommend it.

<Title>pretty much a cynical rip off for the money
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. After barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. I initially got a 60 GB photo which I discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new Altec Lansing IM 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with Apple (obviously Altec's fault - not Apple's) I discovered that the new 60GB (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so I swapped my photo for a video only to discover Apples cynical exploitation continues. I was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals I have like iTalk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. The better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60GB, another deliberate cynical ploy. The video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. I dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. As for the limited TV series drivel currently on the itunes PPV web site, enoough said!!   I originally had a 4th gen 40GB which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. Each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. This time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. Unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. I use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. I found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  And I can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. Its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1GB or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. If you buy decent headphones - at the very least Shure E3's or better, owning a 60 GB ipod is an expensive toy. Doubtless Apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so Apple's profits will continue. Hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. I make this observation as a free market loving Republican. I suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  My music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy I have ever owned.

<Title>Converting Video to 5G iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let any of the reviews about difficulty of video conversion dissuade you. I found an app off of download.com called SUPER (freeware) that perfectly encodes videos of virtually any format for the new iPod. It's fairly quick, though CPU intensive. For the most recent version of the program, check out  http://fever.link.free.fr/SUPER.html#Dnload. Don't spend money for Quicktime Pro when better (and free) alternatives exist. Oh yeah...get yourself a new iPod in black. Sexy as hell. I'm the first of my friends to get one, and everyone is jealous.

<Title>APPLE IS AMAZING
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again with the new 60GB ipod video. This unit is beyond amazing because not only have they improved upon the size, color, function, and battery life of ipod, but what is great about this thing is that it plays VIDEO. The picture quality is crisp and clear, and so far, my only gripe is that the unit scratches too easily. I'm still waiting for a case that doesnt suck. Also, the fact that there is no AC adaptor that comes packaged with the unit should be a crime. But despite these gripes, its still the best music player out there, and now it plays video.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Can't mess with Apple!  For $400, you get 60GB, a beautiful screen, and a cool black design.  As always, the major gripes are with the cheap earbuds and lack of early accessory support.  You do get a case with it now, a thin slip-on deal that does make it easier to put the iPod in a pocket or briefcase without scratching.  I would disagree with people who don't like the accelerated wheel scrolling.  At just over 30GB on mine, scrolling through the artists or albums would take a long time one-by-one.  The acceleration is fairly intuitive once you get used to it.  The screen is big and clear.  I seriously doubt anyone would watch movies on it, but I can see downloading news and half-hour shows to watch while on a Stairmaster or riding the train.  At this point, you're on your own for video content unless you're a Disney lemming.

<Title>Yes I Have This One, & With VIDEO, Now It's Worth It!
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got mine alittle over a week ago directly from Apple.  (Sorry Amazon, but it's the same price, + free laser engraving & shipping)  I HAD bought the iPod 60GB photo for about a week, but as soon as I saw these new ones coming out, I sold the photo on ebay and bought the 60GB video in black.  I got the new one for 3 main reasons:  1: The iPod is finally in BLACK!  2: It's thinner = more portability.  3: Yes, it plays video.  Now these reasons are listed in order.  I didn't get this new one just for the video.  I got it as a music player first and a video player second (or third).         First off, since it's the new feature, lets talk about the video.  The video quality is excellent!  (considering that the screen is only 320x240 pixel)  I say this from putting my OWN videos on it, meaning videos that weren't downloaded from iTunes.  $1.99 isn't too bad a price for a music video or an episode of a TV series, but at the same time, most of the music videos and TV series episodes they offer aren't everybodies can of beer!  (I don't care for Lost and especially Desperate Housewives...unless the 4 women did the show nude!)  All I did was rip the DVD of a TV series or whatever I want, then transcode it into a format that the ipod can read, and Presto!  Now I know while your reading this your thinking, "If I get this iPod, how can I put my favorite stuff on it the way this guy is talking about?"  No problem, I'll tell you!         First, if you want to get a movie or a TV show off a DVD, chances are it's probably CSS encrypted.  (Pretty much any movie or TV series DVD you buy at any store)  To rip these type of DVD's into a video file, you'll have to get a DVD ripping program that can decrypt CSS.  You can find a number of them online for free or cost alittle $ to download.  My experience, most of the freeware ones can't rip any decent quality video, so you'll probably have to shell out afew bucks to get a decent one.  I had already downloaded one called AoA DVD Ripper afew months ago for about $25 or $30.  (Do a google or yahoo search to find the site)  It does a really good job of ripping the DVD's and the video/audio quality is great.  (Especially using the DivX 6 codec)  Next, you'll need to transcode the video file into a format the ipod can read.  (Go to apple's website for video specifications)  I already had Quicktime 7 Pro, which comes with a setting to save videos it can open to the proper format.  I tried using it; it took an hour just to convert 5% of the video!  It was only a 22 minute video!  WAY TOO LONG A CONVERSION TIME!  (would have taken almost a day!)  So I went searching online for another program that would do this faster.  I found a freeware program called Videora iPod Converter.  (Again, do a Yahoo search to find the download site)  It comes with a number of options and it does a great (and fast) job of converting the video to the right format.  TIP: When using this program, ONLY certain video settings can be used for the converted video to work on the ipod.  Check the forum of the website you download this program from to see what other settings people have tried to get it working.  It may seem like a lot of trouble, but if you want to be able to watch certain videos, it isn't that bad once you get everything set up.  (It only took me a total of 30 minutes to put an episode of Chappelle Show on my iPod using the process I described above!)      Now that the video is out of the way...The sound of the ipod is excellent.  I read somewhere that they also fixed 3 minor sound bugs that were present in the earlier versions of iPod.  (Another bonus)  Overall, there isn't too much more new about the new ipod besides what I talked about.  One drawback that people have mentioned, but hasn't affected me; the 4 prong connection that was on top next to the headphone jack is gone.  So if you already have ipod accessories that use them, tough luck, they won't work on the new one.  They'll be coming out with accessories to replace the older ones sometime though that exclusively use the dock connector on the bottom.  (Already have in some cases)  Also, if you don't like using iTunes to transfer music to your iPod, there's a program out there called Anapod made by Red Chair Software.  It integrates into Windows Explorer and just drag and drop!  Has a lot of cool/handy features, and they just put a new version out that supports the new ipod!  (Namely transferring video)  It costs about $25 -$30 depending on which version you get.  Well worth it though, I think.  Hope this review helped you out!

<Title>Ipod
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My ipod changed my life.lol  Im in the navy, so everything has to be compact.  No more carrying around CD's DVD's TV's etc.  Now it is all in one place.  I can watch movies in my rack now without a bulky laptop.  The picture is so crystal clear.  i fought the hype for a while by buying a creative, a gigabeat, a lyra.  They cannot compare by far.  Having an ipod is like belonging to a club.  Trust what ever you want a mp3 player to do the ipod does.  A little advice though, learn how to use itunes fully.  People at work are always asking me to hook their ipod up like mines.  Itunes is simple.  It will organize all your stuff for you if you take the time to learn how.  Fyi don't buy that 100 dolar cable to hook your ipod up to your tv.  Just go to walmart or somewhere and get a 20 dolar cable that plugs into your headphone jack and converts to audio and video rca's.  Normally these cables are for digital cameras/cams.

<Title>One of the greatest devices ever w/ a couple of pleasant surprises.
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I've owned this 60 GB 5th gen Ipod for over a year now and it's been a blast to own. I often tell people that if it were any more versatile that I'd consciously use it in my sleep :). During the time that I've owned it it has been a snap to operate. ITunes is very easy to browse through and buying and transferring new songs to your IPod likewise is a snap (you can make $$$ disappear really quick while browsing ITunes :)).     So far it's held up remarkably well I have my IPod in a simple case and I've dropped it a million times and thankfully it hasn't given me any problems. The worst was when I accidentally dropped it into a bucket of water I freaked out (naturally when you pay as much for something like this) the rest of the day it didn't work and I was bummed and thought I'd have to send it in, but remarkably the next day it worked again :). So in closing this is one of greatest devices ever is quite durable, worth the money, saves you the risk of sifting through 10 million CDs while driving, and is among one of my most valued possessions as in if I lost it I know I'd have to have another ASAP. After owning this wonderful device it's no wonder that there is so much competition trying to compete for a slice of the Apple pie.

<Title>The care needed for this amazing device
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After purchasing the Apple iPod Black 60GB last September 2005, I noticed that once the clear seal which protects the screen and iPod wheel was taken out, I found the surface to be very sensitive. The surface is succeptible to scatches easily. If you are planning to own this device, I suggest that you purchase adhesive plastic cover or iPod skin to protect your investment. Other than that, the iPod 60GB is an amazing device that can fit approximately 20,000 songs depending on track lengths and MB size.   Looking for new music? iTunes, the desktop companion to the iPod, offers one or two free songs every Monday online. Want Podcasts on your favorite topics? No problem, just use iTunes search engine to see if it's available in the iTunes website.   Planning on using your iPod during long drives? Purchase the iPod iTrip which easily fits underneath your 60GB player. Look for a clear station on your car stereo and start dancing or singing away!

<Title>Best iPod Ever
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 60GB Video iPod- there's plenty of storage room with all my music, photos, videos and room left over to backup my data.  If you look at the price per Gigabyte, this is without a doubt the most cost-effective iPod model. The Battery lasts for hours upon hours when playing music and still for several hours when watching video. I love the fact that I can hook this up to my TV with a video cable and watch my video on the big screen. It also works great when coupled with the dock and remote, before the Apple TV, this was the best way to watch my iTunes movies and videos on the big-screen from my sofa.   The iTunes software works great for managing all my media and the sync process is easy and fast with the USB 2.0. Just plug it in and go. I was really surprised at how clear the video screen was - yes it is small, but it's fine for occasional viewing such as when on a trip. Made my 8 hour overseas flight much more enjoyable. I also bought an iPod compatible stereo for my car and now I rarely use anything else. Great for podcasts and audio books, especially for long commutes.  Oh yeah, and last but not least- it's absolutely gorgeous.

So, first things first, I recommend searching for a smaller-sized model if you don't have a very large collection.  I have owned a 5th gen 60 GB iPod video for almost a year now and felt that it was a good time to write a review about it.  I've read reviews from people who have complained about their iPod breaking and freezing, and I have my own input regarding this.  One of the abilities of the iPod is to play videos.  The iPod will only play .mp4, .m4v, and .mov format videos, so be careful!  iTunes DOES take care of converting videos for use with an iPod, but I'm not reviewing iTunes.  Assuming you've converted your home movies for the iPod and have downloaded the latest season of your favorite TV show, it's now time to put it onto your iPod.  Once you've got it sitting nicely on the 60 GB hard drive, you can access it in the menus and begin to watch.  On a fully charged iPod, video playback is noted at up to 3 hours, and I've found no problem with this, though over time that length might decrease just like most electronic products over time.  The video quality is superb on iTunes purchased movies and shows and the audio quality for those shows is just as good.  With your own movies, it can be a different story.  Basically you just need to make sure that the audio quality is good enough and the video resolution is good enough for the iPod.  If you've succeeded in those two areas then the video should view GREAT!  I have found that, over time, my iPod was filling up with shows and movies and I had little room to store other new videos.  I would recommend regularly updating your iPod.  This means that once you've watched a movie, if you have no future plans to watch it again, delete it off of your iPod.  This way you can always save space for videos you may want to put on your iPod in the future.  But remember: ALWAYS make sure to keep a "hard copy" of the video on your computer.  Otherwise you may find yourself an unhappy camper.  Music has always been the main focus for the iPods ever since day one.  My music has always worked GREAT on my iPod and I've never been failed.  Many people have complained about the lack of an option to use alternative audio formats with the iPod.  Unless you're looking to put all .wma files on your iPod, you won't be disappointed.  The iPod works well with most usual audio formats.  Just as long as you keep your non-iTunes Store music as mp3 audio you shouldn't have any problems.  Audio quality is great for great quality audio.  It all depends on the kpbs.  160 kbps is nearly indistinguishable from CD quality for most people.  192 kbps is a much larger file but is just the safer route.  iTunes Store music sounds great at the quality they have set for all the music.  Podcasts work great with the iPod and work very similarly to music on the iPod, as they are all audio files.  The only difference is that the iPod treats podcasts as they are and they have a separate folder within the iPod.  Photos work fantastic with the iPod too, and the picture quality is great for the most part.  The size of the image you upload to the iPod has a lot to do with the quality.  But for the most part, your standard digital camera pictures will look great.  I have not played any of the iTunes Store games that are available for the iPod but have heard good things about them all.  I don't think this is a relevant feature for the 5th generation iPod at this point seeing as how there are so few games available for purchase.  No outside source games are compatible with the iPod to my knowledge.  My only complaint with the iPod is the occasional freezing/slowing down of some media when playing it.  This is largely due to the fact that this is a hard-drive based player, and most problems can be solved with a reset (pressing the menu and center click buttons at the same time and holding).  My iPod has also been scratched a bit on the screen, even with a case.  With proper care and treatment, this should not be a huge problem after prolonged use, and the scratches on my own iPod are due, for the most part, to my carelessness with where I put the iPod.  If you put the iPod in a backpack that has dirt or sand in it, it WILL get inside the case you bought for the iPod, and WILL scratch the iPod if you do not remove it quickly.  This is just common sense.  Overall the iPod is an extremely fun player to use and can be very easy to use, given that you actually read the instructions.  Make sure that your bases are covered and you will be fine.  I would also like to add one last bit of information that will help some people, I'm hoping.  The Apple iPod has a TV-Out feature that is extremely useful for when you would like to hook it up to a TV and watch it at home with the family.  Apple has a sleek little RCA cable that you can buy for a pretty penny to be able to hook the iPod up to your TV, but be assured that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT.  With these steps, you can have your iPod playing on your TV in NO TIME:  1) Go to a local electronics store and buy a standard RCA cable with the red, yellow, and white plugs on one end and a 1/8 inch plug (headphone jack) on the other.  Again, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THE APPLE BRAND RCA CABLE FOR THIS.  Don't waste your money.  You can pick up a great RCA cable for a few dollars that will work fine for this feature. 2) Turn on your iPod and select your desired settings concerning TV-Out.  I enjoy the Widescreen format and the "Always Ask" option ON.  This ask option is just so that whenever I choose a video to play, the iPod will ask me if I want to turn TV-Out ON or OFF. 3) Once you've selected your desired settings, grab the RCA cable and plug the 1/8 inch end into your iPod's headphone hole. 4) Locate the analog input holes on your TV (red, white, and yellow) and grab the RCA cable.  Here's the tricky part that Apple "accidentally" forgets you to tell you.  Instead of matching colors and plugging the RCA cable into your TV, you've got to switch colors around.  Plug the RED END into the YELLOW INPUT, the YELLOW END into the WHITE INPUT, and the WHITE END into the RED INPUT.  Apple switched the way the composite video signal and analog audio signal comes out of the iPod on us!  Once you've switched the colors around and you're plugged in, switch the TV to the channel or mode that matches with where you've plugged into, select a video to watch, select TV-Out ON if you haven't already, and sit back and relax!

<Title>The iPod revolution continues...Great device
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a GREAT device.  On a Mac, it's a snap to load videos to watch on the go, and has the usual superb iTunes management system for music, not to mention the iTunes Music store for downloads, music videos and limited at this point TV episodes.  A few downsides keep this from being a 5 star device...It scratches from the moment you pick it up, which you will do a lot to watch video...In a week waiting for an Invisible Shield (which does protect - albeit in a cumbersome fashion) it had dozens of scratches on the black finish and screen.  When more cases are available, this should get better, but Apple's stock case is suprisingly shoddy for the usual Apple elan...And besides looking horrible, the case doesn't allow you to use the player, at least for video.  Accessories are pitiful, and you will probably need at least one or two besides a halfway decent way to protect this.  So add another hundred dollars for a charging unit, and a dock...But whatever you do, DON'T buy the Apple remote.  At least as of this writing, it's not designed to do anything other than turn the unit on and off, volume  up and down and skip to next music track.  NO video controls, NO menu screens, NO playlist management.  It's also a surprise for Apple to be so irritatingly poor.  But this is another groundbreaker...Not the first Video player, but the elegance, ease of use, and absolute superiority of the iTunes management system are all top notch.  Highly recommended.

<Title>poor user instructions
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>yes, it's nice but how does it do all it's suppose to do?  I downloaded the user's manual and looked at the video demos and they mainly tell you what it WILL do but not how to do it in detail.  For instance it says in order to download music to your iPod after the data has been stored to your computer "go to 'source' in iTunes and find 'options'" and then it continues it's instructions.  I CAN'T FIND the 'OPTIONS' they are talking about.  Does somebody know of a more detailed user's instructions I can get that is NOT distributed by the Apple people, just some 'good ole joe/jane' that can talk people talk and not company advertising talk?  Thanks, Sub

<Title>THE Case
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are some good reviews here already on this great product.  I want to address the case issue. The iPod WILL scratch. It comes with a crappy, discardable sleeve (along with discardable earphones, but they're another issue!) that will provide some false assurances of scratch protection. However, if the tiniest bit of a foreign substance with a Mohs Scale of Hardness number of 2 or greater gets inside the sleeve, your 'Pod is scratched.  I recommend the purchase of the "invisibleSHIELD" (google it) to protect your 'Pod. I installed it on mine and couldn't be happier. This product is a tough plastic "decal" that is almost bullet proof! There is a video of guy using a car key to try and scratch a protected iPod. This stuff is tuff!  Application can be a bit tricky, but I got excellent results the first time. The screen is still crystal clear, but I'll have to admit that a "protected" iPod is slightly less beautiful than a new, "bare" one. However, it's still way more beautiful than any case can be and it will stay scratch free!    When it's time to sell your iPod, it will still look new. InvisibleSHIELD says that their product is removable, but I can't attest to that personally. I would think that a buyer would want to keep it on anyway.  Bottom line: I love my iPod. I would never want it to be without this protection.

<Title>READ before you spend your money AGAIN
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went to my local Best Buy today after reading the reviews, and almost bought one. BUT, then I came to my senses.   Let's see, I purchased the 20 gig Ipod, then the 40, then the 60. Then I had to buy another 60 gig cuz the screen on my first got crushed (totally my fault). Was happy again for the most part, but had some problems with the video screen darkening (which I never had on any of the previous) and Apple was not at all helpful. So I went on, enjoying my music, but not my screen and then the Nano and Photo come out. Someone bought me the Nano as a gift, but I decided to buy the Photo because I am a photographer (amateur, but...).  And now, Apple wants me to spend another hefty chunk of cash to buy the video Ipod. Well, it looks great, sounds great, and love the black case, BUT......  I refuse to spend anymore money until they get it right. I am tired of having to dish out a few hundred dollars every 6 months or so to get their new product that does basically the same thing as the previous version.  I am going to wait 6 months or a year or however long until they get it right. An Ipod that continues to play music, shows photos, plays video (for longer than 3 hours, I mean c'mon), has all the normal cables and hookups and software, doesn't scratch with the slightest bump (or comes with a protective case that works). And something that is UPGRADABLE would be nice.   At this point, Apple is starting to look like Microsoft. They know they have the most popular product, so they feel they can just keep releasing new versions every few months and people will keep spendingthe money toreplace the perfectly good version they had before, for an inferior upgrade. Well, not me. Get a stable platform, with upgrade capability, and a decent battery life, and no constant extra cost for me and I will be happy to buy, but until then, this is getting stupid.  Imagine if you had to do this with your TV, your Microwave, your Clock Radio and every other electronic device you own. You couldn't afford it and you would say no. Say no to Apple until they get the product right.  They make great stuff, but this is getting stupid.  Just my opinion. I am not a paid Apple employee like some of the reviewers on here.

<Title>Beautiful screen, huge hard drive
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I upgraded from the U2 black and white iPod mainly because I wanted a color screen. The screen is a major reason to get this iPod. It is crisp, sharp, and the font is much easier to read than the B&W models.   The video ability is a nice add-on, but not really important for me. I have an Archos PVP and found that watching videos longer than a few minutes on a small screen is annoying. Plus without a backrest, I can't imagine watching a movie with the iPod -- holding it in the hand for 1 1/2 hours doesn't seem like much fun.  The 60gb space for me is fantastic. Although I have over 60,000 songs in my collection, I am able to put tons of songs on the iPod.   One note of caution: a few hours after I had mine, I noticed several hairline scratches all over the front of it, from the left of the wheel all the way onto the screen. I'm not sure if this is a nano-like issue, but it scratched easy and fast.  Apple needs to address that issue. Otherwise, this iPod is a work of art!

<Title>Not good for excercizing!
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple forgot the coolest feature from all previous Ipods.... I have a 30 gig Ipod which I love to use when I ride my bike or go skiing.... The video version doesn't allow you to connect an extension excessory that enabled you to switch songs and volume.... with the video version you would have to remove the ipod to do this....  poor design....

<Title>Smaller, Sleeker, Massive Space and Great Display
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my 60gb black video iPod for about a week now.  I upgraded from a 1st or 2nd generation 20 gb iPod, which was an upgrade from an old Archos Jukebox.    When first announced, I didn't think the video feature was cool enough to upgrade for, but after taking a look at the product in the Apple store, I was amazed and had to jump on board.  The display quality for such a small screen is wonderful.  When not playing video, having the large color display makes for easy visualizing of what songs you are playing.    I do think the hard drives moves a bit slowly.  It takes longer to load up the next song when fast forwarding.  My older iPod would do this seamlessly.  Now there is about a once second delay.  This is a bit disappointing, but doesn't really change my favorable opinion of the iPod.    I'm not sure if the unit will scratch or not.  I'm not chancing it, so I've left the plastic on that it came with it until my case arrives.  I don't think the scratching should be a deal-killer either.  The sound-quality, ease of use, small size and great looks makes this the best mp3 and now video player out there.    This also integrates seamlessly with iTunes, of course.  It's nice buying some of the older music videos I grew up with.  Apple needs to get a bigger selection of video quickly, but for now, it's a pretty good range of videos available.    So overall, this is a great product.  It's the best out there, and will satisfy most people's needs for the next couple of years.

<Title>The best iPod so far!
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  This is the ultimate iPod, for example, the unit itself is slimmer and more updated.  The screen is huge and bright, the storage capacity comes in either 30g or 60g.  It also comes in either black or white, I got a black one just because it looks different from the older iPods.  The screen size is humongous compare to the previous iPod.  The unit plays music videos, videos, pictures and the normal mp3, which are AAC encoded.  And the function is all the same with the usual iPod, click wheel and games, with the addition of a clock and stop clock.  Overall best iPod so far...........  Cons:  But it has some flaws.  The thing is a scratch magnet.  I really hate the scratch on the screen because it makes the screen look distorted, even though it is not.  Second there is a timing lag when switching songs, the title takes longer to load than the music, and mine crashed or stalled when I switch to a previous song.  When a certain song is done playing it will not switch to the next song because it is a different artist.  The music videos look fantastic, nice and clear, yet the music for the music video is less than great.  The battery life is said to be at 20 hours, but I think it might be less.  Maybe I touch it too much.  And last is the price.  It is quite hefty, and only comes with the basic accesories, ear buds, USB cord, and the CD.  Overall this might not be the iPod for everybody.  If you have thousands and thousands of songs, love music videos and have the funds for it, I recommend the 60g iPod video.

<Title>THE BEST TO DATE.......
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the 60 gig Ipod photo first and was blown away by the sound, size and scroll wheel. I decided to get the 60 gig Ipod with video and I'm glad I did. I wanted to put my home videos on a portable device. I was reading more reviews after I ordered the ipod video and realized that not many people went on record saying they had put home videos on their device, so I got worried that it wouldn't be right for this application. It came, and within a day I found PQ DVD to iPod Video software. It works like a charm and converts any movie file into ipod useable ones very quickly. The movies are great on the ipod and it really is amazing to watch and hear your videos on this unit. The screen seems so much bigger than the Ipod photo. NO PROBLEMS CONVERTING YOUR MOVIES OR VIDEOS TO PLAY ON IPOD!! Could use sub files to make things easier and Apple is just too concerned with making as much money as they can to be a user friendly company, but they make a great product anyway. GET A CASE BEFORE YOU GET THE UNIT! DON'T BOTHER WITH THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AS THEY GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND AND DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON CUSTUMER SATISFACTION.
