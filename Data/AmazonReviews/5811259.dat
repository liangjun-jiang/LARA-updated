<Title>Noticeable improvements
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my 8 GB nano to replace my 1st gen 4 GB, and I have to say that everything about it is better.  First, it has double the capacity and battery life, and yet it slightly thinner.  Second, the aluminum exterior is a big improvement, because it is much more durable and does not show scratches and fingerprints nearly as much as the plastic on the previous generation.  Lastly, the screen is noticeably brighter and sharper, and the sound is a little clearer with more bass.  The new headphones fit in my ears better too.  In my opinion, this is the best flash MP3 player available now.  I have had 5 MP3 players in the last 4 years, and I've found that iPods are the best-selling for a reason.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow! This is a wonderful machine - with easy to use (and to read) functions, and a great sound. I use mine mainly for music, but a friend of mine keeps a large library of photos on his iPod. It seems to be highly durable, but time will tell. To be honest, I was skeptical whether it would be worth the price, but I have not been disappointed.  Other reviewers have noted that you really need to have a USB 2.0 port for this, and I heartily agree. My old computer was wheezing and sputtering until I ended up getting a USB new card.

<Title>Many problems and glitches with 2nd Gen 8 GB iPod nano
<Date>Tue Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: After initially giving the 2nd gen nano 1 star because of the problems I was having, I am updating my review to 4 stars....BUT it won't let me!!  I still belive the 2nd gen nano to be of lesser quality than the first (click wheel quality, and lock out swith quality)...however, the combination of the 2nd gen firmware update and the software update to iTunes 7 has fixed the problems I was having. I occasionally still have to reset my nano when playing through my Alpine head unit in my car (NEVER had to do that with my 1st gen).  And occasionally, iTunes has a heck of a time when I go back and forth from 1 iPod to the other.... That said though, my experince has been good enough to now recommend a 2nd gen iPod to anyone.  NOW it is a good product!  OLD POST: This is my second nano. After my first, I built my life around the iPod...I wondered how I lived without one for so long...I purchased all of the goodies...3 sets of headphones, 4 different types of cases from workout to casual, I upgraded my car stereo so it plugged directly into the Alpine head unit, I purchased a 'remote' unit that plugs directly into my Audio Video controller at home...life was good.  Then came the purchase of the 8GB 2nd gen nano...and all hell broke loose.  The 'data' has been 'corrupted' three times in as many weeks. And every time that happens you have to follow the 5 'r's that Apple recommends, which basically wipes the memory on the unit and you have to reload all playlists.  The iPod itself, I have to reset on a weekly basis...my Alpine head unit will all of a sudden not recognize the nano, until I reset it.  The 2nd Gen nano has been VERY disappointing so far...  In addition, the 2nd gen nano, is slimmer and taller than the 1st gen...many accessories for the 1st gen (workout arm bands etc) won't fit the second gen nano...  NOTE++++Make darn sure, the accessory you are purchasing SPECIFCALLY says it will fit a 2nd gen nano!!!++++buyer beware!  RECOMMENDATION: I would purchase a 1st gen 4GB iPod nano since they are on sale, and wait for Apple to get the bugs out of the 8 GB 2nd gen nano.  I have gone back to my 1st gen, and everything seems to be working just fine.  If it matters to you--The 1st gen nano battery life is 2.5-3 hours...whereas the 2nd gen nano is about 23 hours...

<Title>The best MP3 player ever!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod has to be the best MP3 player ever made.  The sound quality is superb.  Navigation is extreamly easy.  The ultra thin profile is a brilliant.  I keep it in an armband and can hardly tell that it's there most of the time.  It's also nice to have the comfort of not having to worry about breaking a hard drive when working out.  I had no problems transferring music over and had fun buying music from the iTunes store.  The remodeled headphones that came with these are way more comfortable that the gen ones and don't fall out of your ears as easy.  The rounded edges of the body of this Nano are even slightly more comfortable to hold.  With all that being said, I'm having problems finding accessories to fit the gen 2 Nanos.  That's the only problem I've had with it so far, if one would consider that a problem.  I'll definately recomend this iPod to all my friends.

<Title>Dumped 4GB nano for this
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb.  However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding.  Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb.  Here are my 2 cent:  The Good: - The finish now resists some scratches, which is what we are looking for - Probably the best quality 8gb player on the market at this price range.  Big bang for your money. - It seems more responsive than the previous nano. - It supports song searching now.  The Bad: - Personally I perfer the silver color, but the black color is the only option for 8gb.  - The packaging looks like a cheaper product than the 1st nano; in fact $249 for a mp3 is not cheap at all - I don't know if the sound quality has been improved or degraded using my Shure earphone.  But at least I can recognize the default "EQ off" has been tweaked, which I need some time to get used to. - The LCD display is brighter, but the contrast does not look better than 1st nano. - I can't get iTune 7.0.0 working on my PC.  It seems like Apple was forced to release it the same day Steve speaks.  It is a big disappointment.  Finally 7.0.1 came to fix my problem. - It does not fit to 1st generation Nano Dock.  It is an unexpected big disappointment.  I really don't understand why Apple can't make it compatible with the former dock, as the connector is just shifted to the edge a mm!  The 2nd nano deserves a 4-stars, as it does not beat the 1st nano.  Anyway it is a hard competitor for Zune to beat.

<Title>The best MP3 player ever made
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you like me wondered if buying the 30 GB video or the 8 GB Nano (as they both cost the same $249), think about this: - are you really going to watch movies on the small screen of the iPod Video?  - do you really care about watching pictures on a MP3 player? - do you want a small and slick device or a bulkier one? - do you really need 30 GB, or 8 GB (2,000 songs) cut it for you? - and what do you think is giving less problems: a spinning disk (with the issues we all can immagine if the head bumps on the disk while running, jumping or , well, falling) or flash memory?  While everything pointed me in the direction of the Nano, I wasn't sure about the 8 vs 30 GB. What I did was to install iTunes, rip all of my CDs, all of them and make a backup on an external USB disk (even with the 80 GB iPod you still need to backup the data somewhere, as it is not a matter of if but when you're going to loose something) and while it was more than 8 GB, I knew I didn't want to listen to all of my songs. As a matter of fact, there are some albums I only care for a couple of songs. So I started rating my songs and putting in different play lists. Guess what, I didn't even get close to 8 GB, not even if I double my collection.  This was the final answer I needed, I ordered the 8 GB model and WOW! It's amazing. It's my first iPod, I used many other MP3 players in the past but this is by far the best, most complete, most advanced, really outstanding sound-reproducing device I ever used. You can't realize how small and handy it is until you have one in your hands (and you know it's yours!).  In other words, it's amazing beautiful (yes, the wow factor is important too for this price), very easy to use (I already want to get rid of my last MP3 player) and even if it doesn't have a FM radio or voice recorder, who cares, I wanted an easy to use MP3 player and it's 100% on target. Pictures, games (which it has some), calendar, contacts and so on are nice, but I have a cell phone for that so I'm not too hot about them - yes, nice to know I can add that too but I really, really love what it primarly is: a great, for my the best, music player since the introduction of the portable CD player.

<Title>Superb!  Exceeded all expectations.  Most limitations aren't.
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Absolutely fabulous mp3 etc player. Exceeded my expectations.  Had for two weeks now and I couldn't be happier with this one.  I've been a skeptic and hold out on iPods forever. Previously had a Creative MuVo 4gb mini hd system.  It was the tiniest by far in it's day for it's size, and had features, in theory.  But here's the real world thing.  The software on that suc*ked.  Caused me to not use it much, after the initial honeymoon, or kinda forced honeymoon.  This beauty in contrast, in addition to being just about the perfect form factor, incredibly thin, pretty narrow, and the right amount of tall, and a very sleek black plastic, bright color screen, has wonderfully easy to use software.  I guess that's been true of iPod's generally for awhile but it sure is of this one, with improvements.  Now what about the 8gb "limitation" compared to current HD iPods of 30 or 80gb? The thing is the iTunes host PC synching software is so easy to use that it's real simple to simply move around what's in the thing.  Just set up lots of playlists by artist or album, or type of music, or whatever.  Same kind of idea with podcasts.  Really well done.  Really easy to vary each day, usually only in part.  Or every so often,etc.  This baby's plenty big enough if you go this way.  Not to hold all you own, but why do that?  That's what big hard drives on PC's or external firewire's for laptops (like my 300gb for just music) are for.    Now what about Apple's locking out subscription services and tracks?  Simple.  Buy $50 Replay AV, or something like it, though that one's real good.  There are TONES of internet radio stations broadcasting in streams that software can capture, often at 128k and sometimes 196k shoutcast mp3, and it will even divide into songs AND TAG THEM WITH ARTIST AND TITLE.    As well there's now a nifty $50 (ok way overpriced, but excellent) Apple fm radio, shirt top TINY control button for everything, accessory.  Recommended.  As is Belkin's $5 on Amazon silicon rubber protective sheath and (detachable) running armband combo.  Couldn't recommend more highly.  This is the way to go for portable music today!

<Title>Much better than iPod Minis
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is slick.  It sounds great, the form factor is awesome, very small and thin, yet feels durable enough so that it won't break in your pocket.  The color screen is very nice and the controls are very intuitive.  That being said, the only reason I bought this iPod was because the battery in the old Mini I had was absolute crap, yet I had invested a tidy sum in music from iTunes.  Hopefully this iPod will perform better than the mini series but, malfunctioning batteries or not, the best bet is to buy CDs and burn them to MP3 so you are not locked into buying iPods all the time and the outrageously overpriced accessories required to do anything but listen to it with headphones.

<Title>A great looking product that even works sometimes!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of Nano and that's a good thing. There is roughly 7.5gb free space for storage and that's a good thing.  However! Buyer beware, because I have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch:  Approximately 1 in 3 of the mp3 file's I uploaded to the 8gb Nano won't play. Instead the screen turns black with a white Apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the Apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. Sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.  I haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread. As much as I love it and want to keep it, I will probably be returning this iPod and waiting for a more stable version to be released.  :'(

It works great and I will eat my negative words about IPOD! It is a high quality and seems like it will be a long lasting device.  I recommend this IPOD (mine is the 2nd GEN IPOD 8GB not the new smaller one-I don't know about it).

<Title>Mixed Feelings
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this item for christmas.  I am using it primarily for running and at the gym.  It has some good features; high capacity, light weight, nice look.  However, I have found the controls to be akward in many situations.  The control dial is to sensitive, and the controls are not easy to navigate while running.  I added the Nike+ system and have had poor results.  Specifically, the menus are confusing, and the sensitive controls often leave me on pause during a workout or have my workout being logged when I don't want it to be.  I've had to re-load the operating system twice as I keep getting errors.  I also found when you turn the unit off, it will not come back on again until it is docked.  There is no manual included, you have to go online to figure out how to use it.  In all it has potential, but it is not easy to use right out of the box.

<Content>This is a neat one.  I like how the metal case is all one peice and wraps around the unit, unlike the other color 4gb ones that have the shiny back.  Looks super cool in black, if you are unsure about it, I can tell you it grows on you.  Much more solid then 1st gen ipods, mainly due to the flash memory instead of a hard drive.  Battery lasts forever, I use it to work out and it can go weeks on a charge.  Sound quality is also better, as is display contrast.  I have a new 3rd gen and almost like this one better, more compact and discreet.  Shows album art when available, but no cover flow like 3rd gen.  Also has nifty screen lock, so if u use it for party tunes you can prevent ppl from messing around with your playlist.  Basically, it looks dead sexy and works well.

But I sometimes use it to go like downtown and other places I know that my ipod touch will just be a big disturbance. I love this ipod but now I realize that if i had to choose between the color I had originally got and this black one I would have chosen this black one.. but oh well..the thing that matters the most is how it works not what color it is. Now I wish that can get the 3rd generation ipod nano..but I think that is too much with the ipods and will have to wait a while b4 i can get it..atleast till my ipod touch(not Itouch ppl) wares out on me. I overall love this ipod that if I had to recommend an mp3 player to a friend it would be this if they still had it on stock.

<Content>At first I thought someone forgot to pack the iPod in the box. But this slim, narrow black "card" turned out to be my 8 GB iPod Nano.  This is my first experience. It took me two days to figure out how to shut it off. The wheel with it's subtle places for directions seemed to be designed for the fingers of a 8-year-old not an adult.  The online instructions are somewhat helpful, but actually, it proved so intuitive that by just fiddling around with it I think the the iPod teaches me itself.  I am glad to have bought the 8GB. I wasn't sure it was going to hold all my music and audio books, not to even consider favorite photos. Yet as of today I have put everything except photos on and it still has about a third of capacity left. The price was great, too. All my stuff fits in this tiny, black package. I love it and only hope I won't lose it.

I wanted an Ipod smaller than I previously have because sometimes I just want to carry a smaller device and this fit the bill. I recomend a Ipod nano to anyone who wants a smaller Ipod than the original Ipod. I also purchased this one so it would fit the hat and visor I bought to insert the Ipod into. They both only will fit the Ipod nano at this time. Great little ipod and it basically works just like the bigger ones.

<Title>8GB 2nd gen. iPod nano
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>2nd best iPod I've ever owned.  I rate it second due to lack of capacity, but that's what the iPod w/video is for..storing all my stuff.  I got this after my 30GB 5Gen iPod died, as a hold over until the news came out this fall about the new lineup of iPods.  I must say the sound on the nano almost seems better than the sound on my dead 30GB, and who can complain about the size.  It definately took a while to get used to the much smaller scroll wheel and screen, specifically the location of the smaller click wheel in reference to the size of the whole nano.  I have a library ~40GB, so having to switch to manually managing my music and deciding every few days/weeks what to take off and put on got kind of old.  After hearing of so many issues with the new generation iPod classics, I went to the Apple.com store and bought a refurbished 80GB 5.5gen for a little over $200.  I'll keep the nano for the beach, biking, etc, and be able to keep all my music on my 80GB.  Overall, a solid 5 star iPod.  Especially for people with smaller iTunes library's who don't have to worry about what to put on or take off the iPod nano!

THe battery life on this ipod is also great.

<Title>I don't get the hype
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I kind of expected to really like this thing - I felt I had been making do, sound wise, listening to audio books and other mp3s copied onto discs and played over cheap mp3 players, so I figured this would be a big step forward being able to listen to anything, not just what was on a given disc.  But the iTunes software is to me, horrible, nonintuitive and time consuming.  I would pretty much need to go thru my entire list of imported songs and tweak each entry to make it really usable.  I suppose if you're downloading stuff from the store it may be different, but working with a library of my own stuff it really blows.  I would MUCH rather simply deal with files and folders directly than have to do it thru the facade of iTunes.  I may end up using a 3rd party ID tag editor or something to get thru it.   The instructions, or lack thereof, fail to cover many of the basics, and web support is similarly confusing.  Likewise with the iPod itself.  Again, a nonintuitive (to me) interface, with many mysterious things happening.  Typically, when I add songs, I can't play them until I reset the iPod.  What a great feature that is, right?  Hooking up the iPod to the computer it regularly gets into a mode where it doesn't want to disconnect.  Never mind that nothing whatsoever was done or needed to be done, i.e. the battery didn't need charging, no songs needed to be synced.  But it doesn't want to let go.  Now it could be that I got some kind of hardware lemon going on there, but that still doesn't excuse the software.  Can't say I know of any great alternatives product wise, but I'll damn sure try something else next time around.  It's hilarious that I imagined that this would be a great product - I had thought everybody raved about their Apple products as being so user friendly.  Live and learn.

<Content>I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down.

<Title>If it works, it's great
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is great.  We only had a snag when it was first shipped to us--it couldn't complete the setup.  But after it was replaced, it was great.  The hassle of shipping it back and forth was disappointing and cost more in terms of shipping.  I'd be interested in how many people have to go through this process to receive the product they want.

<Title>Good but possible defect?
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.  Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself!  UPDATE:  So I went to my nearby Apple store, put each Nano on display to my ears and 1 Nano in the entire store produced the same buzz sound as my unit.  I talked to the Apple tech person and he explained it was not a defect and that my nano was to spec.  He rationalized that essentially it is an electronic device and different nanos may behave slighty different.  He offered to exchange my brand new nano for another one but could not guarantee the replacement won't produce the same buzz.  Since I bought my nano through pcconnection.com, it could not be exchanged ultimately.  Oh well, kudos to him for even offering in the first place.  I've decided to live with my "buzzing" nano and am a happy camper.

<Title>Would be great, IF it worked...
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!  This product does not work as advertised.  If you put more than 1000 songs onto this device, On-The-Go playlists cease to function.  This is very, very sad for a player with 8GB of memory. It's supposed to hold over 2000 songs, but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded?  Wow.  Unbelievable.  This is a well-documented bug on the Apple discussion forums, yet Apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet.  Will they ever?  Who cares?  Why should they, if consumers like you keep buying it and RAVING about it?  I bought my 8GB Nano, but returned it two days later when I found out the problem was known, but not fixed and not fixable.  Apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them!  Don't they test these things?!?!?!  By the way, the same problem also occurs on the 4GB Nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it, which isn't all that hard to do...  If you don't care about having more than 1000 songs, or you don't care about On-The-Go playlists actually working as advertised, what are you doing shopping for an 8GB player?  Better stick with your 2GB models...

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this ipod in order to replace my mini and it has turned out to be a great investment. The design of the nano is by far the best design of mp3 players on the market. The nano is small and may appear fragile but truthfully is strong, durable and scratch resistant. This 8gb nano doesn't hold movies, but who watches movies on an ipod? Also it has the capacity to hold 2,000 songs with its flash memory which has been proven to last longer than a hard drive like on a video. I fully recommend this product.

<Title>Apple continues to deliver
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I waited a couple of months before reviewing so I could put the 8GB Nano through its paces.  It has performed flawlessly.  Like all previous IPODs and Nano's, the user interface, navigation, and ITunes integration are superb and worth any extra money you might pay for this product.  The sound quality is excellent moving between songs seemlessly, but the earbuds do not give it justice so I prefer to listen with lighweight headphones.  The screen's detail is great and it is so bright you could use it in a pinch as a flash light.  And finally the battery life as advertised is much improved.  I can go days and days without recharging.  I'm sure the next generation will have more memory for less money but 8GB provides a lot of listening pleasure.

<Title>Waited Until Now To Buy One!  Now Part Of The Culture!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I saw it years ago when it first came out and did not think much of it; until you gradually realized that everyone has one, either an ipod or nano; and you wonder why? or/and how could they be so stupid to shell out that much just for a recorder that plays back their songs!  I will tell you my personally experiences and in the most simple but concise way that I know - - - "It simply wonderful!  Not only is its sounds reproduced in so excellent quality; but it an art piece to be admired for looks and the cut edge of technology.  The loading of songs is very simple and the menu systems is also very simple to navigate.  Makes life simple in a complicated world.  That the beauty of it.  Did I mention that the nano is very thin and small, plus it is black.  The second generation earbuds have vastly been improved upon too.  All in all, how could I have function all this time without my nano?"

<Title>Good, not great.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Much has been written about what makes the new iPod Nano great, so I won't repeat all of those reviews here. Instead, I'll focus on the flaws that have  slightly marred my experience, though not enough for me to regret my purchase. I'm still glad that I bought it.  As soon as I read about the new iPod nano, I ordered one straight from Apple. I liked the Mini with its all-metal body, and have been wishing I could get a Nano like that since the Nano came out. However, I'm somewhat disappointed with the diminished quality of this new iPod compared to the previous iPods I've owned -- the a 20GB 4G (I've owned two) and the first-generation Mini.  A lot has been written about the great new features of this new iPod, so I won't get into those much. Other than the nice small form factor and the 8 gigabytes of space, I like the new volume lock feature the most.  This list is grouped into several categories.  Design Flaws:  The center button is now slightly recessed instead of being slightly raised like in previous models. When the button was raised, it was a lot easier to follow around the scroll wheel with my thumb.  The screen is hard to read without backlight. With older monochrome screens, which work just fine for reading what song I am listening to, I could read it without the backlight in all but the darkest environments.  The GUI is often jerky. My hypothesis is that previous iPods used separate chips for the GUI and for the audio decoding and the GUI, while this one uses the same one.  The "Now Playing" screen displays some titles center-aligned, some left-aligned. I haven't figured out what the deciding factor is.  The headphone jack being on the bottom is very inconvenient. This is obviously a personal preference when you are talking about just walking around with the iPod. But this also makes it virtually impossible to unplug the data/charging cable without first unplugging the headphones.  Software Bugs:  Apple has already released firmware version 1.1.1 for this iPod. I have installed this firmware. Despite this, I have already discovered several bugs in the software:  Album sorting seems to happen based on several factors other than the track number. In one nine-track album, the first track was actually listed and played last. I was able to remedy this by clearing all the tags other than artist, album, year, and track number for all tracks in this album.  It seems to choke on certain files that play fine in other players. I have yet to figure out a pattern.  Quality Flaws:  The screen in my iPod is slightly crooked. This is, in my opinion, unacceptable from a "premium" music player. I admit that this would not bother everyone.  The hold button has some play, and often the orange hold indicator shows through despite the hold switch being off.  The center button (and the entire scroll wheel area) also has a lot of play. I imagine that, beyond communicating a lower quality level, this would also invite dust and dirt inside of the iPod.

<Content>Got tired of my quirky MP3/CD player and decided to give the iPod a shot.  I always thought people were overpaying for these, considering there are plenty of other less expensive mp3 players that do the same thing.  Boy was I wrong.  The interface (wheel) on this thing is great, quality of the music is great, iTunes is OK, and allows you to import your own MP3s.  If you plan on using an mp3 player more than a few hours a week, then I'd recommend getting an iPod for ease of use and numerous available accessories.

<Title>Upgrade from Ipod Mini to Nano
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review is for users who, like me, want to upgrade to the Ipod Nano 2nd generation after using another Ipod product which required installation of ITunes on your computer. (If this Nano is your first Ipod purchase, you can skip to the last part of this review for comments on the Working Nano.)  In my case, I had a 4 gig 1st generation Ipod Mini that I used for about 18 months and then the battery life was down to about 1 hour.  I was faced with sending in the Mini to get a new battery installed (about $70) or getting a new Ipod.  I chose the latter, and got this 8 gig Nano with an alleged 24-hour battery life.   Apple support hasn't caught up with this product -- at least in terms of the upgrade process. The small booklet that comes with the Nano is perhaps useful only if you don't have ITunes on your computer. There is a 60-page manual for the Nano that you can download from the Apple website that is somewhat useful, but does not clearly address the situation of using two Ipods on one computer account with one ITunes Library.  I initially hooked my Nano up to my PC, hoping to download onto it all the tunes I had in my ITunes library for my Mini.  Well, not so easy. Computer freeze, brain freeze, and many resets of the Nano.  I had read another review here about how someone just plugged in their Nano and it input all their ITunes library.  This did not work for me.  Unaided by anything I could find on the Apple website, I had to find out how to get my ITunes music on my Nano by trial and error.     I found that ITunes is specificly dedicated to your first Ipod product (Ipod One).  To use another Ipod product, such as using this Nano (IPod Two) on the same computer as your Mini, and to take advantage of the ITunes Music library you accumulated for Ipod One, you have to do several things: 1) RESTART your computer each time between hooking your Ipod One and Ipod Two, 2) set your Ipod Two (Nano) to Manual Download.  3) Once your Nano shows up on ITunes, Drag a group of tunes (in clusters of no more than 20 at first, then up to 40) over to the Ipod Nano icon - DON"T DRAG PLAYLISTS!!.  The tunes should start loading. 4) Once you have dragged groups of tunes  to your Nano icon and have all your tunes on the Nano that you want, THEN drag your playlists up to the Nano icon.  This may seem redundant, but hear me now and believe me later: I COULD NOT DRAG PLAYLISTS TO MY NANO without first directly loading in (dragging over) the tunes from ITunes.  Maybe this is just me, maybe it's a PC thing, I don't know.  I am just telling you what worked for me.  What I have not told you about are the 12+ hours I spent figuring out the foregoing.  During these hours, my computer froze every time I tried to "auto input" tunes to the Nano or "sync" my Nano to the ITunes library and every time I tried to download a playlist without first loading the tunes from ITunes. I had to "restore" the Nano several times.  The one bit of advice Apple provided that was useful was to switch USB ports if you have trouble restoring your Nano to factory settings.  And be patient.  It may take up to 5 minutes for a seemingly frozen process to suddenly complete itself.  This is likely a PC thing.  OK, now that that's out of the way, here's a review of the Working Nano.  It is small, it is tiny.  If you lose it, it will be gone.  I walk my dog at night and listen to tunes.  I once lost my Mini in the grass but was able to find it because of the size and bright color.  If you lose the black Nano in the dark, good night.  I don't know how you could possibly find it unless it was in a place that had a light background and you had significant light.  Apple should have provided some kind of basic clip-on attachment to help you secure the Nano.  It doesn't come with anything but earbuds, a connecting cord to the computer and a small stand to hold the Nano upright on your desk.  The placement of the input jack for the headphones is awkward.  It is on the bottom.  So the Nano will naturally hang upside-down after you plug in your `phones, which will probably weigh more than the Nano.  Apple should have configured this differently.   The screen seems brighter, mostly because the lettering is darker.  The battery does last a long time - I can vouch for 6 hours playing time with barely a dent in the battery icon.   The music quality seems clearer, with better stereophonic effect, as opposed to the Mini.  So this is one neat little product.  You just have to figure out how to get your ITunes music library into it and then how not to lose it.  I hope the tips above are helpful.

The earbuds will fall out with any movement and the sound is terrible. I did have to purchase a quality earbud system to compliment the Nano.

<Content>I have only been using this product for a few months, so no reliability info.  But it's supposed to be much more reliable than the hard-drive based video iPod.  Sometimes it jumped to the next song before the end of a song.  Other than that, no other problems with the device so far.  At home, I connected it to my home stereo system using a Nyko Stereo Link cable through the iPod connector.  The bass is much stronger than the sound coming from the earphone jack.  I dropped it a couple of times, but luckily the iPod was protected inside a Contour Design iSee clear case.  The case also made the iPod look more beautiful.  The iTune is very easy to use.  I rippped all my classical music CDs using Apple lossless decoder.  So I could only store about 30 CDs, and swapped different playlists every few weeks.  Have not played my CD player since I bought the iPod.  Interestingly, I listen to music much more often than before.  Highly recommended.

<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I know this iPod is the same price as the smaller iPod video. There are many reasons I bought this one. 1- I wanted the small size, to have in my pocket while working. 2- I was trading in a 6Gb mini, I didn't want less space. 3- I prefer 2nd generation computer stuff, so I'll wait until the next release for the video iPod.  I love this iPod. It's fantastic. The size is perfect for 1000+ songs , a couple of audiobooks, some language lessons and a bunch of podcasts. I have yet to outlast the battery on any average day. The controls, though smaller, are just as easy to use. The screen and colors are fantastic. I even stuck a photo of the cats on to show off. The size and weight is fantastic. I like the black color, though I have also bought an iSkin case to protect it while working. The playback and volume is flawless. I was wary of the 1st Nano's cases, but this redesign for the 2nd gen, not only reminds me of the great mini design, but feels very secure and durable.

<Title>8GB smaller than my wallet
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 2nd generation Nano is great! I've had the 8GB model since a week or two after it was released, and it's been great. I originally bought to replace my old 20GB 2nd generation iPod when I was at the gym. Since it stores 8GB of music, I am able to transfer the majority of my music collection that I tend to listen to onto my iPod Nano. As a result I find myself rarely using my old iPod since the Nano fits in my pocket and I don't even know it's there.  The new headphones are nice too. They fit my ears much better than the previous headphones that came with the iPod.  I don't have much desire to watch video on a small screen, so the Nano is a good solution over the regular iPod of the same price, but with 3 times the storage capacity.  In my opinion the iPod Nano is the sleekest MP3 player out there, and for all of the people out there claiming Apple is defective by design because of the DRM on music purchased from the iTunes music store... all of the digital download sites have DRM. If you don't like the restrictions, buy CD's and rip them like you had to before if you wanted LEGAL music.

<Title>Nicest upgrade so far.
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I initially held off buying an ipod until the 3rd generation 30gb a few years ago, which I used every day, for most of the day (actually the battery would always die before my day was over & I could get home & recharge). I did have a problem with that one, but Apple replaced it & it's been fine since. I've tried using it at the gym & exercising, but found it cumbersome. Not long ago the battery died & I replaced it. It hasn't been until this model of the nano, that I've felt a need to buy a new one. I have a large (terrabytes) music/audio collection and so the smaller players just didn't have enough new features until now. This model is significantly lighter and smaller, while also being a bit sturdier & more scratch-resistant than the 1st nano. For me, 8GB is about the minimum I need (while syncing everyday) to store all the Podcasts I listen to, plus have music mixes for the gym, my calender & contact info. I don't have much need for watching video while away from the house, so having a flash mp3 player was more important than having a (video) player with greater storage capacity. The improvement in battery time is significant. Now I can use it all day & don't worry about when it'll run out.  I always used my 3G with the original case in my pocket to protect it from bangs or drops, so I bought a rubber case for this one, but found the case to be more annoying (the belkin model collects lots of dust and dirt & the button openings don't quite fit right, it also collects moisture if against your body) & so I usually keep it bare in my shirt pocket, where it's less likely to get banged around. It is very easy to take to the gym and use one of those arm band holders. So I use this one now for exercise (DJ mixes) & podcasts (which I listen to while working) and use my older 30 gb model for the car. One thing this ipod seems to do is collect moisture on the aluminum's exterior (from sweat/body heat) more easily than my older ipod, particularly if it is in a case. However it is much easier to take running. Not only does the flash-based player make things lighter, it doesn't skip (as my 3G has a tendency to do, particularly with large song files). I also bought a Nike + unit which is a nice add on (to be reviewed later).   While there are many features I also wanted to see in a new ipod (exercise aids, gps, voice recorder, radio, etc.) it is nice to see that Apple is keeping the iPod simple & maintaining a higher quality player, with the potential to add on the features. All-in-one might be more convenient, but I prefer something of quality & is durable over something that has every possible feature. I'll review the Nike add on under that product, but one disappointment is that there aren't more of these things.  Come on Apple, where's the high-quality recording module? or the radio tuner?   The best new feature on this version is the ability to play full albums without any gap between songs (and without having to import the entire album as one track). I vowed to wait for this feature before buying another ipod & it looks like Apple finally heeded customers' complaints. The sound quality is significantly better than my 3G, but I can't say whether this is because of an improvement in components or the fact that there's no whirring hard drive to produce additional noise.  The earbuds are also nicer (smoother) than those that came with my 3G (which developed an annoying buzz in one ear after only a few months), though whether or not they will last, I won't be able to tell, since I already lost them & have replaced with Sennheisers (which I find have a better sound quality, though not as nice of a fit).   The ipod seems to function more smoothly than my 3G for the most part. Screen selections flow more smoothly & quickly. The newer control (with buttons on the scroll wheel) is easier to use without having to look at it than the 4 separate buttons + scroll wheel on my 3rd gen. However, turning off the iPod by pressing the play button is more difficult. I have to try many more times than on my 3G. I also have a more difficult time trying to do the Menu + select button combination to restore the nano than the combo on my older ipod. However, the lock/unlock switch seems to work better on this nano than the one on my 3G I also don't like the fact that the earphone jack is right next to the connector opening, which means you can't recharge/sync your ipod with the earphones still attached (which I can do with my 3G). Another drawback is that this model syncs/charges by USB 2.0. My 3G was firewire based. Since I have a computer with only USB 1.0 & firewire, my older ipod syncs much more quickly. If there is one thing that Apple is doing wrong, it is dropping support for its Firewire standard, a much faster and efficient means of connection than USB. The last shortcoming is the screen. Since I don't view photos on my ipod or play games, I could care less about color. The screen on my 3G was much easier to view in daylight without the need for the backlight to go on. While this nano provides a significant increase in battery time, the backlight eats into that time much more significantly. The choices for the back light timing aren't very good (2 secods is too short, 5 too long) & are not customizable. It might not seem like much, but when you realize how much battery life it eats up when you use it more frequently, you realize how important this is.  Another drawback is that this model only comes with a USB 2.0 hot sync cord and a little adapter to put in older docks, but no dock or case or remote (all of which were included in with my 3rd gen. ipod). Ultimately I'd give this model 4 1/2 stars (knocking off for the shortcomings I've mentioned), however kudos to Apple on the packaging of this model. Very compact & more environmentally friendly than most consumer products. With this small packaging Apple removed the CD & all the packaging material, and instead used just a plastic container (ok we can still work on that) and crammed all the parts very efficiently into the plastic container with minimal use of plastic & paper. Apple can now ship more units while taking up less space (saving on fuel costs). Smart move & the reason why I rounded up rather than down on this one.

<Title>Major issues -  Freezing and skipping songs! 
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nowadays, it is very common to throw unfinished software on the market letting us, the users to beta- or even alpha-test the product. And the software is IPod's major issue, because the hardware is really sweet! I love the design and I love the handling too, but the firmware is total crap! Because, like I wrote in the title, my iPod having the firmware ver. 1.1.1 (which is not 1.0) installed, skips and freezes at songs that are ripped from original cd's or downloaded with iTunes. The forums on [...] are full with exactly this kind of complains - now, I'm asking myself, are there ANY developer tests in the Apple house before a bugfix is released? Do we really have to wait before we buy ANY product that has software installed until the Service Pack 2 comes out?  Anyway thank you, Apple for providing me such a beautiful player, which skips so many songs!

<Title>Bad Nano cost me 4 hours--now I've got to wait 5 days to receive a "repaired nano" back
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So I get the Nano.  Download itunes follow their brief instructions.  Got my music arranged and started to synch.  ERROR "The iPod " " cannot be updated the required file cannot be found."  So I download iTunes and reinstall several times.  Still same error message.  Then I figure okay I'll try a restore (back to manufacturers settings).  Okay that comes up with an error message The iPod "" could not be restored --unknown error (1418).  Sunk.  Try it several times same error what do I do now.  Wade through all sorts of help options--still nothing the same error.  Finally 3-4 hours later.  Do they have a human I can talk to.  Call talk to someone who could barely speak English and after wrestling around the guy finally says call back in 4-5 hours they will send you a "repaired nano" to replace the bad one you have.  So now I get a repaired nano for the price of the new one and have to wait 5 business days to get it.  I'm glad their sending me a "repaired" one (why not a new one).  What a disaster.  Tell me about Apple someone... what a joke. I hope the next one will work.  If not i messed over as it is a gift for Christmas.

It pretty much said.. hook up to your computer and go to the apple web site. Once I got there it was relatively easy. I am very happy with my NANO, the itunes site is very easy to use and convenient. Dont let previous reviews that are written by obvious frustration sway you away from this great device. I am a runner and I have found a whole new world of music and podcasts dedicated to runners.

<Title>Small ipod, big rating
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this ipod a week ago, and have used it every moment after that, and it's great. I started off putting on my 2pac collection and the sound quality is great, just not on the ipod headphones. Yes, you may have heard it before, they are crappy quality and they hurt your ears. I am currently using them though, and in a few days my sony headphones will arrive. Well back to the actual ipod, the picture feature is good, I can view all my pics but of course its small so I guess for pics get a bigger screen player. The shuffle feature is great and is practically stutter free. I don't know if its me or what but seems as if my ipod screen is crooked, but I don't really care I guess but this and the phones bring it down a star. The click wheel took me a day or two to get used to but now its comfortable. The playlist feature is kind of tricky though. Overall, I'd recommend this, it's a great piece of electronics.

<Title>much better than iPod video
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had 2 30gig iPod video players.  Both developed hard drive problems after about a year or so.  I decided this time to go with the 8gig iPod nano since it did not have a hard drive.  I have it loaded with music, podcasts, and audiobooks.  Thus far (about 6 weeks since I bought it), it is doing really well.  I noticed that the battery lasts much longer than the iPod video.  I bought an iTrip (FM transmitter) to go with it and this provides me with plenty of good listening for the daily commute.  I think the real benefit of the iPod nano will be seen in a year or so when it will not have hard drive problems!    There are only 2 minor problems with my nano: 1. sometimes after it has been in sleep mode, it will lockup when I start to play a podcast. The easy work around for this problem is to press the reset and restart the software. 2. it is a little small and tends to slip out of my hand easily.  To fix this, I bought a soft rubber case which also holds the ear buds. This helps make it a litter bigger and easier not to drop.

<Content>Upgraded to the 8 GB nano, and it is great.  Was thinking of the video IPOD, but I am a runnner, and the weight of the nano is ideal.  Unless you are just downloading entire CD's, an 8 GB nano is more than enough for songs and pictures.  Also, I think that Apple will revise the video IPOD to look more like an IPhone, so if you are thinking about video vs. audio, I would wait.

<Title>Very good so far
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a 54 year old man and it's been a month since receiving my first Ipod - the 8gb Ipod Nano 2nd Gen.  Since that time I've spent time loading it with music and listening to it.  Ipod device- It's small and thin, but even my big fingers have no trouble with the controls.  I can read the text without my reading glasses but a choice of larger print would be a nice future feature.    Itunes- I've loaded about 40 CD's onto it via Itunes.  Much to my surprise, I like the Itunes user interface.  It's anticipates my desired actions and allows me to perform many functions eg. my brother wanted to hear a song that I'd ripped to AAC format but he uses MP3 - I was able to convert it within Itunes fairly easily.    I've restricted my Itunes to Ipod interface actions to the SYNC operation and have yet to attempt to exclude music on Itunes from being downloaded into my Itunes.  The SYNC operation to date has been fast and painless.  As with any good piece of software, simple operations are ready-to-go for the novice on Day 1.  I expect to spend the necessary time to become familiar with the more advanced features.  Earphones- I don't like the bud earphones that are included with this and many other portable music devices - my ears just don't fit that big knobby thing.  I'll be looking into one of these other earphones I've seen that have a smaller semi-funnel appendage that goes into the ear canal that may work better but my budget is tight.  Auto transmitter cradle- The cup holder-like cradle providing an FM transmitter works just fine for playing my music from the Ipod and thru my car stereo system.  The only negative here is that the cup holder is down at a lower level and I cannot see the display on the Ipod.  Summary- My first Ipod is well thought out and it would seem that feedback to Apple from users of all the previous Ipod versions have helped produce a well engineered, although not perfect, portable music device.

<Title>Thinking of Switching from 1st to 2nd Generation?
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The headline for the second generation Nano is that you get twice the storage and twice the battery life for the same price you paid for your 1st generation Nano.   This is true of both the 4 and 8 GB options.  While this justified my purchase because I found 4 GB confining and, especially 15 months down the road, the battery life inadequate, the other improvements are modest:   *I do like the new, all metal casing, which is colored on both the front and back (the first generation was chrome colored metal on the back regardless of frontal color), it has no seams except for the barely noticeable plastic inserts embedded on top and the bottom, and is much less prone to both scratching and smudging with fingerprints.   Overall, the new styling is sleeker still.  Apple does cool well, and even has the good sense not to offer a brown (brown?) player.  *A number of simple games (like Solitaire) and other small software goodies are included, as well as a contact list that synchs with the usual MS suite.  *The lanyard earbuds are of better quality for playing music, they are smaller to better fit the ear canal so more comfortable, and the chord is slightly longer.  *The same USB connection devices will work for either generation, and iTunes will allow you to use both generations on the same computer, though not, to my knowledge, at the same time, so I recommend an auxiliary USB device for keeping the old and new charged up.  *The screen is brighter still.  *I was annoyed by the way a decal or paint atop the hold switch immediately began to chip or peel on the 1st generation, which is not a problem now that there is a solid plastic hold switch of the same color as my player.  There are two arguable detractions.  *The 2nd generation is slightly longer than the 1st, though I think it is also slightly slimmer.  *The placing of the earphone jack to the extreme right of the player makes it align rather uneasily with my one leftover accessory, which is the armband holster for the player.  The added length also makes the player at least seem somewhat less securely anchored in the holster, which might be a concern if I were still a runner.

<Title>A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped. Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix. Forget it. At that price, I might as well get the new one. So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression. I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves.  1: The case. Though relatively minor, the case that the Nano comes in, as well as what's included with it, has been slimmed down to the bare essentials, which I actually prefer. The small plastic case uses very few materials, which is good for mother nature, and has no CD that you need to install before using it, which is good for your patience. There's also a few apple stickers, which I promptly got rid of as well as the new Apple headphones, a bare-bones manual, a warranty card and an adapter for a dock. One minor thing, the case can be a little frustrating to open, though it's worth it, believe me.   2: iTunes/connectivity with your computer. As with all iPods, this thing has nigh on perfect harmony with iTunes. I've got around 2 gigabytes worth of music, and it was all transferred and ready to play within 7 minutes. Unless you balance the Nano on the cord just so or get a dock, it's going to be lying on your desk, so make sure not to have any dust on it. As with the other iPods, the Nano uses the proprietary connector, which is cool with me, with the slew of accesories that are available for it. Just don't lose the cable, since you'll lose all ways of charging and syncing it. Again, a small complaint here. The Nano isn't fully charged right out of the box; you have to charge it for around 45 minutes to get it 100% juiced.   3: The differences. If you were to go through the pros and cons of the 1st generation and 2nd generation Nano, 2g would win hands down. It is a hair thinner and a hair taller, but the curved edges make it feel simply, well, Nano. Another very good addition is the use of color. With the previous generation, the lovely dark color ended as soon as you flipped it over. Not so with this sucker. The whole thing is clad in anodized alumium, which happens to be nigh on scratchproof and extremely resistant to fingerprints. The bad part about that is that the case is seamless, so anyone trying to open it up will have to go for the much more difficult top or bottom openings, which are still plastic.   As for the differences with the guts of the Nano, they are small but noticeable. The vaunted click wheel is still here [and with good reason, it's the slickest and easiest control scheme in the portable world], along with the only other button on the thing, the hold key, which I hope proves less breakable than the one on the previous generation. The screen is noticeably brighter, easily the 40% claimed by Apple. There are also some handy new features on the inside: when you're scrolling quickly through songs, a letter will appear in semi-translucent text to make it easier to tell where you are. There's also a search function, and you can set a volume limit if you don't want to give yourself a headache. Other than that, things are pretty much the same.  Finally, the complaints. First of all, I dislike Apple to a very large extent as a company. They make decisions that would stop me from buying this iPod if I hadn't already made a substantial investment in the songs that I had purchased. For example, Apple makes it impossible to use the 1st generation Nano dock because they moved the connector port about 1mm to the left, for no apparent reason other than to get people to buy the dock, again. This'll also be a problem for any other docks/radio transmitters that have an enclosed connector, since those are bound to be designed to the first generation.   Those complaints aside, I am well and truly happy. Apple truly has made a great product, and if they stop making these stupid money-making changes they will have no significant obstacles in retaining their title of Maker of the World's Best MP3 Players.

<Title>How to Defeat Apple!
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here is how to defeat Apple:  Know your enemy.  THe iPod is great; we all know that.  But, IT IS A COMPUTER.  It has a hard drive.  It is NOT BUILT to be used at the gym, or jogging, no matter WHAT APPLE says.   Everyone that uses one in exercising and on the go knows that Apple EXPECTS you to buy a new one within 2 years.   Not so, with the Nano.  It has NO hard drive.  It has been run over by cars, had the widow cracked and it still plays.  It can be thrown, dropped, stepped on, and beat up and it still plays.  If you have a TON of music, get an iPod and a nice Bose player.  Leave it alone there and enjoy your 10,000 or 20,000 song library.  Then, go and pick up a Nano....you can even get them refurb'd at apple for as little as $29 for shuffle, $89 for 1 gig, $99 for 2 gig, etc.   Change your music whenever you want and use your nano to mow the lawn, shovel the snow, walk, run, lift weights, dentist office, doctor's office waiting room if you live in Canada, or whever you want to de stress with music.  It is virtually indestructible.  The new one is great.  tons of music, plus TONS of great pictures.  If you get stuck sitting in court all day, what a way to pass the time!   It is far less expensive and can last a long time.  Keep your iPod for your home stereo (yes, the Bose really sounds great) but use the Nano for portable music.  Check out the iLogtech 55 speaker system on ebay.  $139 in Circuit city.  Refurb'd on ebay for 39 bucks.  Best portable sound with lithium rechargable battery that I have found.  Comes in its own case, too.    Don't let Apple defeat you by having to buy an expensive iPod every two years and go through the whole mess of having to download or copy 10,000 songs (iTunes will not give you the songs back you lose when your iPod must go in for repair).  Get YEARS of enjoyment from Apple by this little bit of common sense.  When you are relaxing to Dylan's Modern Times at home, but have to go out and cut the lawn, put on the Nano and some upbeat music and the time will pass nicely.

<Title>You Forget It's Even There!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received a "Product Red" Nano as a Christmas present from my husband.  I've been the owner of an iPod Mini since Christmas of 2004.  Fortunately I had the extended warranty with that one (and I have it with the Nano as well), because I went through 7 minis in the span of two years.  I was reluctant to become a Nano owner, but I'm truly glad I did.    I still want to use my iPod mini and needed to address the issue of sharing iTunes with two different types of iPods.  I read previous reviews of the Nano and prepared myself for a headache.  I have to say that initially it was as I was not even able to manually load my songs onto the Nano.  After finally (after talking with 2 unhelpful customer services techs) getting a very knowledgeable person (magic words if you are having a problem is "product specialist") at AppleCare he fixed the problem.  To share multiple format iPods, each one needs to be assigned a separate computer drive. Doing this allows you to manually copy songs from iTunes onto your Nano. My husband further suggested that I not go through a USB hub but rather have the iPod connect directly to the USB port.  When I connected directly to the USB port I was able to copy the songs automatically.  Today I had my first long workout (3+ hours) with it at the gym.  I hardly knew the device was on my arm, it stays in place (my iPod mini on an armpad doesn't always stay in place), and best of all sounded awesome. Now all I need to do is load some new music on it.     I'm giving this 4 stars only because I think Apple needs to do more to educate customers on how to do certain things with their products.  I searched the Apple web site for information regarding my issue and there isn't much there.  I mentioned this to their "product specialist" and he said he's heard it before.  They also need to stop the practice of giving refurbished models to replace ones that have to be returned and are under warranty.  It's no different from having a refrigerator that you purchased the extended warranty for...if that dies because of a manufacturer problem you get a new one (happened to us this summer).

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i love the iPod nano. its great and its form factor is amazing. quite frankly i dont want a radio because i have all the music i could ever listen to anyway. my problem with the ipod was that i had to use itunes to sync my music. that is not the case anymore. i had used itunes for all of 20 minutes before i got rid of it. it couldnt handle importing 15,000 songs at once. needless to say i was not pleased.   luckily i had recently switched and also got rid of winamp. what i originally used to manage my music. but, the interface just isnt as smooth as i would like to handle a massive library. i needed something that can handle it and handle it well. thats where mediamonkey comes in. it slices... it dices... it julians... syncs to iPods... and can take the music off the iPod back to a computer... lets see iTunes do that. lol... plus it can import well over 15,000+ songs in one go. it also supports gapless playback.   sure iTunes has the store and can download your album art... mediamonkey does it as well. its fully intergrated into... oddly enough... [...].  you can save the art to specific mp3's or put it in the folder that they are in. and it doesnt require the installation of quicktime. need i say more. ... check it out. plus they even have a skin that will make it look like iTunes...  mEdiamOnkey  i would say that mediamonkey would not suit your uses if you actually use the iTunes store to purchase DRM'd music that is restricted to its uses...  to each his own i guess.

<Title>A Layman's review of the 8g Nano
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been debating over the past three months whether to buy a Zen Micro, a 30g Ipod, or the 8g Nano. In the end, I chose the nano because it had a 24 hour battery life and was much slimmer than the other two models. However, I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and elsewhere where people really nitpicked this machine, saying they didn't like the click wheel or other minor things. All these things are minor and unless you're a baby, they won't bother you. Honestly, this is my first major ipod (an upgrade from the shuffle for me) and I love the thing. I crammed about 1500 songs onto it so far and a lot of pictures. More than happy, I am ecstatic about owning it. If you want to carry a big, bulky thing around get the 30g or the Zen Micro. I'm a guy who carries this thing to work every day in his pocket though, and for that its perfect. Also, I don't know if this is true on other models, but the special edition red Nano has a sleep timer. A major plus in my book since I listen to audiobooks when I go to sleep at night.

<Content>I've only had my 8 GB ipod (2nd generation) for a few days, but I can say emphatically that it is the best sounding MP3 player I have ever heard. And I am here to say that those reviewers who praised the ease of use of this technological marvel were right on the mark...even a novice will find it user friendly (especially its compatability with itunes).  I won't repeat any of the comments by former reviewers, except for the suggestion that you include, in your budget, money for a good set of headphones. I tried the set that comes with the ipod and after trying various settings I was sorely disappointed, especially with the bass. After replacing it with my Sony earbuds (a $100 set, but you can get by with less), I found myself immersed in sonic bliss. With a good pair of headphones you'll experience the quality that the ipod was meant to give you.

<Title>My acclaim for the Apple iPod 8gb
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned an ipod mini but the battery life began to slack, and I didn't want to pay $50.00 to have it replaced when I could just purchase a new ipod.  I knew I needed something new, but I also wanted to improve my ipod somehow. I decided to purchase the nano with twice as much room; I know I made the right decision. I own many CD's, and it was relatively easy to fill my 4 gigabyte mini up to capacity, but with this 8 gigabyte nano? It's not as simple. I enjoy being able to add two or three songs to my ipod everyday.    	I'm impressed with this second generation iPod nano. The battery life is definitely wonderful; Apple boasts that the battery life is about 24 hours, and although I don't know how accurate that is, I do know that is lasts twice as long as my iPod mini. I picked up on a few improvements with the nano as well.  When you have 1,000+ songs on your mp3 player, looking for one song can be tedious, however, iPod made this task easier by providing a transparent letter in the background to indicate which letter of the alphabet you are on. You can also search for your music by artist, genre, album, among other options.    Apple's come equipped with something that is very useful to me: the "hold" button. I can sometimes be careless and nonchalant with my gadgets, and my iPod may accidently turn on, but since iPod owners can switch to the "hold" button, I don't have that problem.  This new iPod is significantly smaller than the mini, which, for me, serves as a gift as well as a curse.  The nano is so tiny that it can easily slip out of your hands, and it probably easy to misplace.  Also, the only color the 8gb comes in is black, and because black is so common, it's easy for the nano to be camouflaged, which would make is even more difficult to locate if you were looking for it around the house. Also, where is the FM radio? The radio isn't a big deal to me, but if Apple really wanted to transcend this product, they would privilege buyers with this amenity.    This is the most popular mp3 player, and I see why. It's a great item to have if you exercise, if you are a lot of boring places, or if you like music to be at your fingertips all the time. I highly recommend it.

<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Getting started was a little difficult, but I finally managed to start downloading music and podcasts. I was very disappointed that I cannot download eAudio books from Net Library because Apple does not offer the kind of copyright protection that libraries require. The library told me that they had repeatedfly tried to negotiate these features with Apple, but had no success. The biggest disappointment, however, was that contrary to the iPod advertisements, you cannot sync calendars from Outlook.  Outlook Contacts can be synced, but not calendars.  I managed to find a support number at Apple, and they told me that although their manual gives very specific directions about how to sync Outlook Calendars, they do not support this feature....so, basically, you can't do it, and they don't care if the advertisements and the manual lie.

<Title>Amazing Storage Capacity
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge.  I was a bot late to the game myself on this one.  My children, and their friends, really led the way on this.  Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use.  In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod.  I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD.  I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet.  In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio.  This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the price.  To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's.  By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive.  Once or twice will teach you how to do it.  If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class.  This is a 5 star product.

Sleek design, easy to use (even in converting my WMA library to iTunes), and good performance.  So far I'm very glad I made the switch to the iPod product line.

<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm in love! I had put off buying any MP3 player because I just wasn't impressed by what people who had bought them had to say. Who cares if you have a bunch of songs in your pocket if they all sound like scratchy LPs. I love jazz (had 431 DAYS of CD's to download), faithfully listen to podcasts on my laptop which meant devoting myself to actually sitting in a room with my laptop to listen and have gotten a few audiobooks for the car so I finally "bite the bullet" and decided on this Apple 8gb iPod...LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I couldn't stand the earbugs although the sound was good so I also bought additional speakers and an adaptor for my car...but that's my thing. If you don't mind ear buds there's nothing left to do but download iTunes and play!

<Title>Nano Field Recording
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only usd the Nano for recording classes at a music camp.  I used the Micro Memo from Xtreme Mac with it.  It seemed to work fine for my purposes.  The recordings are certainly clearer than most of the tape recorders I heard but not as clear as an Edirol.  What I liked was the recording time and not needing other memory sources.  With better mics the recording might have been clearer.  There is a hum that was present but it didn't affect my use.  The buttons are a little sensitive but I got used to them and only accidentally deleted one file.  At the end of camp I had it in my pocket. Maybe I was continually pressing a button by mistake but the Nano froze.  I solved the problem by letting the battery drain and recharging it, which took some time.  I look forward to using it like a regular Nano.

<Title>The Best But.........
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought three other MP3 players before finally giving in and buying the iPod. The 2nd to last unit I bought, a Sansa e280 almost fit the bill but in the end, the iPod had a couple things none of the others had. 1) You can not beat the human interface and ergonomics of the iPod and, 2) The after market of iPod accessories is 2nd to none. There is so much more available for the iPod than all the others in the form of docks, cables, skins, cases, car and home stereo adapters, etc. So I caved in and sold the Sansa and bought the iPod. Now, iPod has faults also and they are not trivial. 1) Hard to replace battery. The rechargeable battery will die and it should be a lot more user serviceable. 2) Kinda closed PC interface. iTunes is nice but it shouldn't be the only choice and everyone ought to standardize on a play list format. 3) Cost. Expensive little buggers. To an extent, you get what you pay for and the iPod has great build quality, packaging and design but it is still expensive for what it is. I am happy with it and would recommend it to others looking to buy the best of the category.

<Content>I only have positive things to say about the Apple 8 GB ipod nano: 1) Excellent battery life- more than 20 hours of constant play 2) No moving parts, no stalls during hard running (unlike the hard disk ipod) 3) The usual excellent Apple ipod design and itunes synchronization software  For running I strongly suggest the H2O Audio Outdoor Case that protects the ipod, attaches it firmly to a fanny pack or wrist or upper arm, and allows full use of all ipod functions.

<Title>Modern Miracle
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The second generation Nano is a big improvement over the first generation Nano. The exterior of the 2G Nano (which is similar to that of the Mini) is much stronger and much more scratch resistant, so you don't really need to carry it around in a case (which you pretty much have to do with the 1G Nano). Even the best cases make Nanos almost twice as heavy and bulky (since they're so small and light to begin with), so this upgrade is huge. The 2G Nano is so light (without a case) that whenever it falls out of my shirt pocket, it doesn't hit the floor because it isn't heavy enough to detach from the headphones or pull the headphones out of my ears. It just dangles, and I put it back in my pocket. Also, no case makes working out with the 2G Nano in an armband much easier. Since the 1G Nano needed a case, you'd have to take it out of the case to use an  armband (especially the "official" Apple armband, which is the lightest and best), and put it back in the case when you were done. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but doing it every day becomes annoying.  As for memory size, the difference between 4 GB and 8 GB is very significant, since about .55 GB is dedicated to the operating software. For most people, the difference between 3.45 GB of music and 7.45 GB of music is the difference between having to make difficult decisions about what to put onto your iPod and being able to carry 95% of the music you really listen to with you everywhere. I have a 30 GB iPod (non-video) with absolutely all the music I'd ever want to hear, and I almost never use it anymore, since it's so much easier to carry the 8 GB Nano -- having the music I only listen to 5% of the time is just not worth the extra size and weight. My 30 GB iPod is now relegated to vacation duty (I use it as a hard drive to offload photos from my camera).  The 2G Nano headphones are much better than those that came with all previous iPods, but I'd still recommend buying at least the Sony MDR-EX71 headphones (about $30), and maybe Etymotic or Shure (E3G or E4G) headphones if you have money to burn.  Finally, the battery life on the 2G Nano is much better than its predecessors. It may not last the 24 hours Apple claims, but I don't recharge it more than once a week (I use it a lot), and it doesn't go dead for a long time after the first red warning icon appears.  I'm sure Apple will continue to improve the Nano, but how much better can it get? If they make it any smaller, I won't be able to read the screen. Sure, Apple can (and will) add more memory and lengthen the battery life, but at this point it's such a fantastic product that I won't feel the need to upgrade until my 8 GB Nano dies. Anyone who complains about the 8 GB Nano should remember that 8 years ago we were carrying around Walkmans with 90 minute tapes and 3 hours of battery life.

<Content>You not going to find anywhere else 8GB player, as slim and slick, as Apple. iPod is the best on the market, because the player is slim and stylish, has a nice menu and navigation, and compatible with Mac and PC.If you are looking for a portable player that fits any pocket, that's the right one to buy. This player doesn't have any disadvantages, but the headphones. Unfortunately, Apple is not making any good headphones, so, order them in advance. I personally bought Creative headphones for $32. They have good reviews, and not as expensive as others(like Sure for $100). Enjoy! Apple is the best in making personal audio!

<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a 3G iPod (10GB), and was very interested in the first-generation Nano when it came out.  The only thing that stopped me from buying one was the storage capacity, at 4GB it just wasn't enough for my music collection.  So, when the 8GB 2nd generation Nano arrived, I ordered one immediately.  Apple really hit the mark this time...plenty of storage, unbelievably tiny size, menus that are intuitive and super-easy to navigate...what's not to like?  I've had my Nano for several months now, and couldn't be happier with it.  I was always afraid to take the 3G iPod on trips because of the hard disk. Since the Nano has flash memory, I no longer worry about it getting dropped or jostled, and I take it everywhere with me.  I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this product.  Buy one!

<Title>Not perfect, but still amazing
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my 8GB ipod nano mainly to replace the towering heap of CDs that was taking over my living room. I have to say it totally boggles my mind how all that can fit on something slightly larger than a book of stamps. Now my CDs are boxed up in the closet and my ipod fits nicely into the gaping hole where my CD changer use to be. If you have an ipod, life is good! There are a few things, however...  Itunes can be a little quirky. It might be just my computer but it has a hard time downloading CDs and playing music at the same time. The music starts to skip real bad and I have to stop the music and download in silence. Older MP3 progams I have such as Windows Media Player, Music Match Jukebox, etc. never had this  problem.  Itunes can be a little annoying sometimes when you have to download a CD that it can't find on it's website. Sometimes if you try to manually fill in the track info, itunes tends to download the CD and send it into space. Seriously, like the tracks totally vanish into thin air!  I should also note that ipod and itunes are specifically built around the AAC file format. While it might be better then MP3, most other programs and MP3 players do not recognize AAC at this time. On Wikipedia it says AAC is not propriatory, though I hate to take the risk of getting locked into Apples Regime if AAC never catches on. Fortunately itunes does allow you to change the file format to MP3 for downloading CDs. However I can not speak for the itunes store as I have not downloaded anything from there yet.   As weird as it may sound ipod is almost too simple to use. I like simple, but in this case simple sacrifices a lot of control. I'm particular how I organize my music but Itunes seems to think it knows best and wants to organize everything itself. Granted most the time Itunes does a pretty good job, but its not perfect. Itunes is pretty good with newer mainstrem CDs but, with older lesser known CDs it can be anybodies guess where your stuff is gonna end up. In one case I had a compilation with 15 different artist on it, and itunes decided put the songs in 15 different locations!   Another lack of control issue, sometimes if you put a CD in the computer that you've already downloaded itunes will ask you if you would like to replace the existing files. If you say no, then it will try to make a second copy of the song. It does not give you a choice whether you want to download or not. If you try to stop it while it's down loading you will end up with half a song saved right next to the original. Truely quirky!  I intended to primarly use the ipod with my home stereo, though unfortunately the ipod only comes with a USB connector (no power cord). I was able to purchase a dock that plugs into a regular outlet for an additional $30. I also had to purchase an audio video spliter cable from Radio Shack for a couple bucks to plug it into the CD port on my (very old) reciever.   Eventually I will replace my old receiver with a new Harman Kardon. Aside from the great audio quality, their receivers have a built in port where you can connect an optional "bridge" just for your ipod. That way you can control everything with your receiver remote and not have to fumble with the little ipod wheel all the time. Apple also offers a doc with a remote control if you don't mind parting with yet another $100 on yet another overpriced Apple accessory.  With all that said, I love this thing. The benifits far outweight the gripes. I can't wait until they come out with a 16GB ipod nano. I'll be there to buy it when they do.

<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod. It's my second one, I previously owned a 20gb iPod with photos and I much prefer my new iPod to the old one. I mainly wanted to upgrade because of the drastic size differences. The Nano is much smaller then the 20gb, less then half the size. This iPod has both music and photos, but because of it's relatively small storage space I haven't put any photos on mine. The new features are very nice on the Nano. For one thing, the start-up time is a lot quicker. It used to "go to sleep" if left off for more then day and then would take a while to reboot. Now, it only takes a second, no matter how long you have it off. In addition, when quickly scrolling through lists (i.e. "artists") it will highlight the letter you are on for ease in finding what you are looking for. The screen resolution is also much nicer; the colors are brighter and more defined. The body of the iPod is very sleek and much more attractive. The headphones have been upgraded as well, they are much more comfortable! These are just a few of the very nice changes Apple has made with this product. The Nano is definitely not for people with an enormous music collection, but it is for people who want something small, classy and convenient.   One thing to note: the Nano does not come with a charger, only a USB cord. Therefore, if you do not have a charger from a previous iPod you will have either to only charge your iPod with your computer or buy one separately.

You hardly ever have to charge it, it's durable (flash memory), and it is easy to use.  If you've never used and iPod or iTunes, of course there is going to be a learning curve as with anything, but once you understand the general functions, you are set.  There is a reason Apple has a substantial market share over any other MP3, and that is because it is the best all around player available.

<Title>Apple keeps raising the bar...
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a 6GB iPod Mini for two years and loved it!  I was waiting for the next Apple product that would top its functionality.  When the first iPod Nano was released, I didn't think 4GB would be enough, so I waited until the 2nd generation 8GB Nano and purchased it immediately.  It has quickly become my best friend... it is so small I can carry it everywhere.  It holds all my favorite music plus 6 books on CD.  In other words, wherever I go, I have entertainment.  The lyrics feature has also become very useful, as I enjoy music much more when I actually know what the artist is saying.  Some of my friends are reluctant to purchase an Apple product, as they are afraid it won't be user-friendly on a PC.  I own a PC as well, and have had no issues with iTunes.  It allows my computer and iPod to sync seamlessly.  Actually, now I am much more likely to switch to an Apple computer (maybe this was Apple's hidden agenda all along).  If you are considering this product, but are not yet convinced, I highly recommend driving down to an Apple store to check it out, or ask someone you know to allow you to test drive it (I'm sure you have at least one friend that already owns one).  You will not be disappointed.  The 2G Nano is truly "the best thing since sliced bread."

<Title>ipod nano 8 GB
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unbelievably small.  So tiny, yet it still contains plenty of room for all the music you may want to carry with you. If you plan to use it in the car it is best to have a direct connect to you radio/stereo as at least in a large metropolitan areas there are so many stations on the  FM band that interference is common- this is not the fault of the ipod but of the FCC allowing too much crowding of the FM band.   The only minus is that there are so many add on's for this unit ( or any ipod ) that it will certainly cost you more than just the price of the unit.  Enjoy the music

<Title>8 GB Ipod Black-2nd generation
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Ipod Nano was a christmas present for my son. He already had an ipod shuffle, but it was worn out. Needless to say we already had the Itunes installed on our pc. We spent hours christmas day trying to install the new Ipod. The problem was he wasnt using the cord that came with it!! So make sure you use the cord that comes with your ipod!! Other than that it is great and he is really enjoying it!!!!!( The cord he was using was an extra that we had bought never thinking it wouldnt work with the Ipod.)

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought two of these MP3 players for Christmas, one for me and one for my girlfriends Christmas present. We both really love them. They are light, have an amazingly long battery life and can hold quite a few songs. Both my girlfriend and I have a rather large collection of music, so we just set itunes to sync a random assortment of music everytime we plug it into my desktop.   A couple of problems I have with this product is iTunes and scuffing. Itunes is a rather large download, even on a cable internet, because you have to download quicktime to use iTunes, even if your model of ipod doesnt support video. This iPod doesnt which is fine with me, I dont think I would want to watch video on the small screen. Its just big enough though to have no trouble to see your music, whether you are using it during the day or night. It is easy to scuff this product, even with the new metallic body that this ipod sport. I bought a silicon case to cover it, which had a built in scree protector, but didnt have a click will protector, which is what I have scuffed. It doesnt seem to effect the product in the least though.  Overall a very good product.

<Title>Lives up to the hype
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nano definately lives up to all the iPod hype.  As my first MP3 player, I wanted something that could hold alot of songs and that I could take running.  It works great for everything I need it to do.  I am still getting used to the iTunes software, and have had issues with what I have on my iTunes library to match what is actually on the iPod.

<Content>I bought this ipod nano for my husband for Christmas.  He opened it two weeks early and hasn't put it down.  He uses it at the gym and just sitting at home.  We are both new to ipods, but love this one so much that we are going to buy another one for me!  The ipod nano is extremely small and light weight.  This is a fantastic item for anyone that loves music or podcasts!  It is easy to use and small enough to take anywhere.  I highly recommend this item.

<Title>What's not to like?
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're reading reviews to convince yourself to buy a nano, then be convinced. The only concern would be cost, and it's worth the money.  If you have a wide variety of musical taste, a couple thousand songs you always want on call, and use your nano daily, then get the 8 gig. If you only use an mp3 player for 1-2 hour intervals, and use it sparingly, then the 2 or 4 gig should suffice.

<Title>Handsome, slim and quirky
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the 3rd iPod I've owned - and the best so far. It is very slim, the screen is bright and crisp, and the aluminum is a definite upgrade over the previous Nano. Two minor irritants are that the black color can/will chip away (especially near the top and bottom edges) and I have to reset the iPod (by pressing and holding the top part of the click wheel and the center button) often due to frequent freezing. Irritating yes, but not deal breakers by any stretch. It's great for workouts and general on the go activities. The flash based RAM is much more stable than the larger HD-based video iPods.

I love the Nano - was wavering between the 4G and 8G, but I am very happy that I went with the 8G.  This Nano works seamlessly with the Nike attachment, and has provided much enjoyment during long runs.  Very pleased with this purchase!

<Title>Apple Still the Best for MP3 Players
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the past few years the consumer market has been flooded with a wide variety of MP3 players to choose from. However, I've yet to find one comparable to the iPod's sheer simplicity and ease of use. Even the technologically savvy cannot help but appreciate how absolutely effortless it is to organize and load a music collection onto your iPod. The 8GB Nano is perfect for anyone who wants a very small, very portable audio device but with enough space for a respectable assortment of music. The sleek, thin, black metal casing (similar to that of the iPod Mini), is durable and attractive.   The only downsides to the new generation of Nanos include the fact that you cannot load it with music videos (even though the capability exists), you must use the iTunes program in order to load any music (which may or may not be a bad thing, depending on your preference), and the price tag is exactly the same as the 30GB iPod (with video capability included).  To counterbalance these issues, one could argue that not enough space exists for video capability to be worthwhile, iTunes is a decent program, and the 30GB iPod is several times the size/weight as the Nano.   In any case, I would most definitely recommend the 8GB Nano not only for having such a large amount of disk space for so tiny a device, but also the fact that an enormous amount of accessories manufactured by very reliable name brands exist for the iPod. To be completely honest, I was never a big fan of Apple products, but I can safely say that in terms of MP3 players, you can't get any better.

<Title>iPod is the in thing for "grown-ups"! Who Knew!?
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never, at my age (let's just say "over 50"), thought about "needing" an iPod. Certainly, I enjoy music very much (my current obsession is Alpine Yodeling!), but I have my stereo and CD player and tape player and (most importantly) I have my RECORD player. Who could need anything more? Well, I discovered that you also need an iPod.  It was a birthday gift from my wife (okay let's say around mid-fifties!) I dutifully recorded all my yodel LP's into iTunes and now have yodeling 24-7 if I want (who knew there were over 1200 yodeling songs in the world?). I'm astounded by the capacity of this little machine and take it everywhere. The sound is amazing and the best thing is that I can use it anytime. I'm often "plugged in" during the night when I can't sleep and can lay in bed listening to music and NOT DISTURB MY WIFE! I can't say enough.  If you love music, get it. (If you love movies, get the 80gb. We got them got our adult children (hey, I'm not admitting to anything over mid-fifties!) and they love them.

<Title>The best MP3 player I've had...
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife gave the iPod Nano 8GB as a gift to me and this is the best MP3 player I've had and used.  Firstly, the iTunes interface is simple and intuitive.  The iPod interface is also simple and intuitive.  Once I got all the tags properly defined, the iPod works like a gem!  One of the best features that are not in most MP3 players is the gapless play.  I love the gapless play feature!  Now, I can listen to live albums without the slight pause in between each track.  Together with a whopping 8GB, I can store loads of songs!  Just on the down side... the iTunes does not come in the package, and you would need to get on the internet to download it.  If you do not have broadband or a fast internet link, find someone who does and go to that person's place to download iTunes, it is about 37MB for version 7.  Also, they do not have an equalizer where you can define your own settings.  All the EQ settings are preset.

<Content>I bought this product took it home, installed itunes, purchased 100 songs and downloaded them to my Nano. While the Nano rocks I got an auto popup to update my itunes.exe so I did. It lost my $100.00 bucks worth of songs and would not do a restore from my backup CD's. I could not get a hold of apple support. They did not answer emails and I could not find a phone number to call. The next itunes update I installed said it could not run on my hardware. My laptop is two years old and runs great. I have XP pro with all updates and nothing else has a problem. I could not contact apple to find out why my audio hardware needed to be updated just to download songs to my Nano? I do not recommend apple products because of the support and you can only download from one application.  John

I really suggest this player for the athletic people, hearphones are long and you can just put the player in your pocket and run, walk,...

<Title>I've been converted
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have always been opposed to buying Apple products, since I felt that they were overprices.  I had previously purchased a couple of early Sansa mp3 players, and I think they make some very players, especially the new models.  They also are less expensive than the comparable ipods. I also didn't like the fact that Apple still doesn't include an FM player.  However, with that said, I have to admit that I am very impressed with the new Nano.  The battery life is unbelievable, the sound is excellent, and with its thinness and lightness you don't even know you're carrying it.  The screen, while very small, is extremely clear, and the menus are straightforward.  I would have preferred the earphone connection to be on top but I guess that is a matter of personal preference.    For those who want more than just music I have started to load podcasts, which have opened up a whole new world of listening possibilities.  By the way, I haven't even tried the Apple earphones, not only based on mediocre reviews I have read about them, but also because I know they won't compare to the ones I use.  If anyone is looking for a great pair of over-the-head headphones I can strongly recommend the Sennheiser PX 100 for an incredible sounding over-the-head headphone that is lightweight and very comfortable.  They are not good for activities where you might sweat, since the foam earpads can get a little sweaty, and you don't want to use them in places (like an airplane or train) where other people might hear them, since they are an open back type of headphone that does leak sound.  But for other uses the sound is amazingly detailed. They go for about $45. If you want a good ear bud I can recommend the Sennheiser MX-450 or MX-500 that you can buy for $14-$18.  As much as I hate to admit it, I have been converted.

<Content>I love my basic black Nano.  8Gigs is plenty.  I have about 300 songs on there now and have used about 1/6th of my space!!!!  If you are a music lover, it offers plenty of room for more than enough music!!!! So far I have not had any problems.

<Title>good but firmware not perfected yet
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a owner of a 2nd generation hard drive based IPOD, I was pleasantly surprised how compact and tough the new IPOD Nano 8gb is.  The battery life is great.   My only gripe about this model is that when you first power it on and select a song or pod cast, it frequently locks up.  This requires a hard reset of the nano.  I suspect this is a firmware bug. Hopefully Apple will have a firmware patch for this in the near future.

<Title>Ipod, I am done with you! 
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Attention possible Ipod Buyer! Please be aware that the Ipod you are about to purchase will likely have sever technical issues with it someday.  I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I have had my Ipod for about 2 years and have a love hate relationship with it.  I love my Ipod because I use it everyday; on my way to work, at work and on my way home.  I love music and I love listening to music.  I really like the way the I pod works, but it has problems.  About a year after getting it and enjoying it with all my may many songs on it, it started giving me an error something like Cannot copy to or read from "Your Ipod's Name here" and that was it. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. I was in shock and did not know what to do.  I was foolish and did not buy the 2 year warranty.  I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was NOT I talk to some guy and told me that they CANNOT help me if my Ipod is NOT under a warranty.  Fortunately, I was able to figure out how to reset it and reloaded my music.  All was fine although after being able to reset and put my music back on it, I started getting the errors again.  I finally stopped trying to do updates because of all of the errors. Now, because of the new Itunes, it asked me if I would like to erase all of my music and replace it with the new library.  I unkowingly, did and now have no music on my Ipod.  I am done with you Ipod!  Done I say! I will find a new source to provide me with my music needs and move on! This has happed to everyone I know that owns an Ipod of any type. Seriously, I am not joking here! So If you don't want to get ripped off, I would reccomend something else.

<Title>Durable, Big Enough (8gb), Truly Take Anywhere
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I also have a 3rd Gen 20gb Ipod, but when I saw that the new nano was increased to 8gb, and the price was reasonable, I decided to get it. I couldn't be happier. 8GB is more than enough to space to have a decent size collection. The new alumnimum casing is way sturdier than the earlier shiny plastic. The size and weight means it easily goes into my pocket/purse/bag w/o even noticing that it's there. My 20gb now provides music at home.

<Title>My First MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Word of caution to everyone first: I've never had an MP3 before this, so some parts of this review MAY be biased(?).  My uncle bought this iPod for me from Amazon for a bit more expensive than mentioned above right now. Here are my pros and cons.  PRO: 1. Capacity: 8GB is a LOT. For songs, you will not need much more.  2. Easy Use: This nano really is easy to use. I mastered all the options within the first few days despite being the dimwit I am.  3. Look: You can't deny it- it looks pretty nice. It's ultra small and thin. Being black adds to its slickness. 4. Lightness: If you put it in your pocket you can't tell it's there. Many times it slipped out of my hand while I was holding on to it by the earbuds, and because it was so light it didn't crash on to the floor.  5. Battery Life: Since I'm not listening to it 24/7, I can last about three days with a fully charged iPod.  CON: 1. SCRATCH: I know about the whole aluminum coating thing (that's why I bought the 2nd generation one). Truly enough, it didn't scratch on the surface. It did, however, on the top/bottom edge. The black on the edges came off, and the top now looks crooked and ugly. I really should have gotten a cover, but it's just that I trusted the aluminum coating too much. 2. EARBUDS: The wires are kind of weak; one almost broke. (I put a band-aid around it for a temporary aid. Besides that it's okay. 3. LIGHTNESS: I know that this was in the pro, but it also is a con. Because it is so light I sometimes forget that it's in my pocket and when it slips off. Extra caution would solve this problem, however.  I, overall, like this iPod. However, it's not my favorite item as I hoped that it would be (My favorite is still the Casio Exilim camera which has MANY scratches) because of the UNEXPECTED scratches.

<Title>Wonderful
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At 8G's it holds all the "important" music I need for when I go running or when doing work around the house. For me the important factor was small size. With an optional belt clip that I bought I can't even notice it when I run. Sound quality is better then any other music player I have had. With a little "self instruction" from the help menu, iTunes is extremely easy to use.  All I had to do was drag my Windows Media Player folder into the iTunes library and all my music was converted. The only negative I have seen is the large amount of hard drive space used with both iTunes and Media Player music on one computer.  Since everyone in our house is now using Pod's or Nano's we have deleted all of our Media Player files to free up space. If small size is important, this is the right product for you. If you absolutely have to take "all" of your music with you at all times get something bigger.

<Title>IPod nano
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this and have been using it for about 1 month now.  Initially, I thought the navigation of the buttons were strange but once I figured out how to use the buttons, it actually works quite well (instructions on their usage were not really clear but I am not sure there is any way to describe their usage without trying them anyway).  8 GB is enough to have about 1000 songs with high quality compression and is fine for my needs.  The weak point of this are the included ear buds.  They are mediocre at best and the color (white) clashes with the black color of the Nano.  Fortunately, I purchased the Sennheiser Mx500 ear buds and they are many times better than the Ipod buds and they color match with the IPod Nano. Another weak point is the power button.  It seems to be very pressure sensitive as I keep the Nano with the Speck cover in my shirt/pants pocket.  Several times, I have reached into my pocket to take the Nano out(I know I turn it off) to find that it is turned on probably by slight pressure on the power button and thus have to recharge the Nano due to draining the battery.

<Title>Impressed
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Granted, I've only had my Nano for a day, but I am very happy.  Small, light, great screen, great sound.  To answer another poster's lament on "sound, not music" -- you oversimplify the iPod.  Because really, it's about convenience, not necessary quality of sound.  Not to say that sound quality was not considered by Apple, because it obviously was.  Personally, I have some pretty nice mid-range audio equipment -- although I am far from an audio snob -- but the reality is that none of it compares to my little mp3 player.  How often am I sitting on my couch just listening to music?  Rarely, because like everyone else, I have things to do, like go to work or travel or whatever else takes me away from the couch.  To really appreciate hi-fidelity you have to concentrate on the music exclusively.  Most of us couldn't do that if we wanted to :)  At any rate, sound quality on an MP3 player is about a lot of things, like: - quality headphones.  Get some, it matters.  The little earbuds that came with my iPod will go into permanent storage.  Sony makes some good monitors that aren't expensive and I like the Sennheiser open-ears when I need to hear what's going on around me.   - MP3 compression rates and encoding.  If you can, use a quality encoder like LAME, and use higher bit rates (192k or higher, variable rather than constant compression to save some space).  A little less music for a lot more sound quality.  BIG difference.  If the sound on your iPod is poor, this may be why. - EQ on the player.  Apple seems to do a good job with their standard EQ.  Much better than the Creative Zen I was using previously.  There is a reason why the iPod is so popular.  They found that delicate balance between usability and performance.

<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have recently purchased two I pods. This one, the 8G. As well as the 60 G Video. Both are exceptional products with excellent quality.  This 8 G I pod is very compact yet potent. Eight Gigs of MP 3 music is about 2000 plus songs. Impressive!  I find the quality of the playback wonderful. Plug it into my high end stereo and the result is beautiful perfectly managed sound. Plug it into a portable boom box or FM transmitted signal for car use, also great.  Well worth the venture! I do recommend you read the manual while setting up. There is so much you can do with this marvel.  Listen to pod casts, audio books, set sleep timers, alarm, and so much more. I like using it with i-Tunes. Down loads fast and easy. Plus keep up to date programing.   Highly Recommend, (and I'm picky)...

I had the 30gb video ipod and the thing was good, but it was to big and all i used it for was music, I saw the 8gb nano online and read alot of reviews saying is was great so I sold my 30g ipod and bought the nano and I have to say it was the best investment I made. I put all my cd's on it and I still have more then enough room. The 8gb of music is perfect 2000 songs is more than enough for me, 75000 was to much anyway.  I have to say that you will have to download the new verison of itunes, but once you get that done you'll be all set.

<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this 2G Nano as a gift. I don't notice anything functionally different about it compared to my 1G, but I actually prefer the form factor of my 1G. The 2G is rounded and is probably a bit thinner and harder to pick up and hold onto. This is actually pretty annoying as I sit  here trying to pick it up off my desk.  The 2G accommodates photos, which is cool.  iTunes is absolute garbage. I recommend an alternative such as xplay, fpod, or anapod.  These should really come standard with the armband, as well. Another small gripe is that the headphones are white; they should match at least the black and the white models, if not all of them.  All in all, a nice device worth buying.

<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try to make this short and sweet. This is about the Sansa E200 Series Mp3 Players  The ipods can't even compare to this...   -Superb mp3/wma playback and features  (includes custom eq,album art,playlists)   -FM radio (includes radio recording with pause and resume function)   -Voice recording (with pause and resume function)   -Picture viewer  (includes thumbnail view, indivdual view, slideshow with song playback)   -Video playback - don't worry about any problems because the videos are SUPERB quality  (includes video converter,play/pause,fast fwd./rew.,depending on what video you put on the player,they can be either fullscreen or widescreen)   -1.8" screen! (almost double the size of the ipod's)   -colorful screen and menus (who wants basic white like the ipod's)   -battery life (average of 20 hours)   -replaceable battery (in case it dies/doesn't work, you can get a new one, unlike the ipods)   -scroll wheel (works very wheel, and it's large enough to use)   -other buttons (don't worry about them being small,they're just the right size)   -ways to put data on the sansa (can be windows media player or by dragging and dropping files onto the sansa's drive/folder)   -size (about same size as Ipod Nano,but a little thicker so it's easier to hold in your hand)   -price ($150 for 2gb Ipod Nano, $160-$190 dollars for 8GB VERSION WITH ALL OF THESE FEATURES!!!! Even if they both did the same things,you get 4 times the memory for about $15 more!!)   If you don't know what mp3 player to get, get this one, you will NOT be dissapointed.   NOTE: the only con is that the Sansa may get finger-printed because it's smooth/glossy.  NOTE: if you take care of the Sansa, it willl NOT break or scratch.

<Content>Consistent with Apple products, the 8GB iPod Nano (2nd Generation) is a wonderful piece of design.  But, unless diminutive size is your primary purchase consideration, the 8GB Nano is a poor value.  For a mere $7.50 more at amazon.com (on 1/18/07) you can have a 30GB "real" iPod with crisp, large display and video capability, among many other advantages. At apple.com this 8GB Nano and the 30GB video iPod are the same price as one another. Why not optimize your purchase dollars and buy the 30GB iPod?

<Title>BEFORE YOU GET AN IPOD...LISTEN UP!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have an iPod nano that I purchased last July. Though they have come out with "2nd generation" ipods that hold more songs, have supposedly better earbuds than the older model, blah blah blah, but the no matter what flashy color they slap on them, or what "improvements" they make on them, the iPod is and always will be, tired.   I know that functionally, the iPod is great. It does what it's supposed to do. I've dropped it a couple of times, and it still works like a charm. So, why am I giving this thing a mere two stars? Well, I'll tell you why.  It's not really the iPod per se, but more like Apple as a company. Be aware that when you get it, the only place where you'll be able to download mp3 files (legally) is from iTunes. You cannot download from Napster, which is a pain. If you want more variety, then you'd have to do Limewire and risk either getting your computer hacked into, or getting prosecuted for illegally downloading copyrighted material. (it's unlikely, but the chance is always there).   When a company imposes limitaions on their customers, there is something very wrong with that. They only want you to download songs from iTunes. Heck, if iTunes actually had a good selection of music, one wouldn't need to venture elsewhere anyhow. But that's besides the point. Get a Creative Zen mp3 player. You can download from anywhere. You're afforded more freedom, and you get more bang for your buck. A 4 gigabyte iPod (2nd generation) holds like, 1000 songs. A 2-gig Creative Zen does the same thing, when the songs are in WMA format (which iTunes does not take. Hmmm...I wonder why!). Plus, you can attain wallpaper for your your Creative Zen. It has a color screen, making the overpriced iPod bland in comparision.  So with everything said. Don't waste your time with iPod. Apple is not the end-all, be-all of mp3 players. If you want something high-end, there's much nicer stuff out there than iPod. And Creative Zen is just the begining.

<Title>Slickest mp3 player yet matures
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You've got to give it to Apple for this little jem. I know people have said it before but they took an incredible player and made it better.  Pros: The screen clarity and battery life have improved over the 1st gen player exponentially and now the 8gb version includes a "search" feature not previously available. I swear they've improved the quality of audio output over all previous versions as well, truly stellar.  The sheer storage capacity of an 8gb player using non-volatile flash memory allows you to carry a significantly larger percent of your collection in a truly, impossibly small device.   Keep in mind that flash memory based players don't suffer from the wear and tear issues associated with using a hard drive as the storage medium.  Hard drive based players are subject to significantly shorter life spans caused by the constant jarring of the device which is inevitable in a portable device. (This was a big factor in my decision to buy this player.)  This player's size and features makes it a more serious competitor to the hard drive based units almost 4 times the size.  Cons: So small you will constantly miss-place it (bought this one cause I dropped and lost my 4gb 1st gen ipod nano) Stock ear-buds are awful (consider Logitech's Freepulse Bluetooth headphones for wireless freedom and excellent sound quality) No video support (this one kills me, creative lab's figured it out, why can't Apple?)  Biggest complaint is iTunes: As with all Apple iPods, itunes stinks when it comes to having more then one player in the house and more then one computer which needs access to the same music archive... Who wants to have 2 or more libraries? I've got a 20g library, my wife has an iPod as do I, we both have laptops and we share one desktop. There's no easy way to keep everything sync'd up yet have separate playlists...

<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very happy with Amazon's service, fast free shipping,and lowest price I was able to find. I also took advantage of getting an additionl $30.00 saveings by opening an Amaon/Chase credit card at the same time.  When I opend the box, the instruction leaflet was almost no help to get me started. After visiting the Apple website Iwas able to download an instruction (booK), some 50 pages or better. I have put over 500 songs on it, so far, and cannot beleave the sound quality. Havent tried pictures, but thats not my main reason for my purchase. A little hard to learn, (for me), but enjoying my Ipod more each day.

<Title>Treble is too high for my taste.  Decent overall, though. 
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new generation model is definitely a big improvement over its predecessor.  I used to own the first generation 2GB nano and while it served its purpose, the 8GB is superior: better battery life, better audio and better design, not to mention less prone to get scratched (though I would highly recommend you purchase a nano skin or a clear acrylic plastic case, which is what I own).  Even the new itunes software is better.  For those of you who still have dial-up like me, I suggest you visit your local Apple store and ask them to burn you a copy of itunes, unless you want to spend hours to download itunes (file size is 36.5 mb).  The biggest drawback (and my complaint) of the new ipod is its overall sound quality.  Yes, it's louder but the treble level is too high at times.  No matter what EQ setting I choose, the sound is still a bit harsh (even when I turn the EQ off), which eclipses any trace of mid-range and bass.  The only EQ setting to remedy the problem is if you select treble reducer, but even that doesn't solve the problem entirely as the sound becomes muddy.  To those who said the earbuds are fantastic, well, I beg to differ.  Foremost, they don't come with foam covers.  I'll tell you, without the foam covers the audio sounds horrendous.  Not only do the earbuds not fit snug in your ears but you are only able to discern mostly, you guessed it,TREBLE.   It becomes unlistenable at times because vocals and/or the guitar sounds too "trebly".  I liken it to a pc speakers that lacks bass.  Why Apple decided to go cheap on something like this is beyond me.  It truly baffles me.  Anyway, to combat this "flaw" I opted to go with an aftermarket earbuds made by company Sennheiser, model # MX-400.  I purchased one on Amazon for $4.99 (sold by Target; shipping cost is exorbitant mind you as they charged $8.99).  It definitely is worth the investment - you definitely notice better clarity of the music you're listening to, not to mention you actually get to hear more instruments and sound effects (i.e. Pink Floyd music) and better bass.  But to my chagrin, even the better ear buds can't eliminate the darn TREBLE that is prevalent in a lot of the songs I listen to (mostly metal, classic rock, grunge and pop).     With all that said, I'm still satisfied with the 8gb nano.  If only the audio didn't sound too trebly, I would have given the nano a five star.  On another note, I'm sure future models will come equipped with an FM radio built into it (you'd think Apple would include one for an mp3 player with a selling price of $249.  While we're at it, they should've come out with better earbuds - like a Bose type audio quality you hear when listening to the dock or their am/fm radio).

<Content>This is a great device, and holds all the (classical and jazz) music I need.  A couple of cautions:  You can use it only with Mac OS Tiger  or newer.  If you use a PC you must have a USB2 connection. I had to buy a card ($ 15.-) to provide that connection.  Also, you can find a nice leather holster with armband at ebay for $ 2.-, and I bought the Sennheiser sports earbuds (with ear hanger) . They sound great and don't fall out during activities.

<Title>Sanity saver on my daily commute...
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've never been an Apple fan and only chose the iPod because it's the MP3 player with the most extras made for it, but I have to admit that I am really impressed. The earbuds that come with it are the most comfortable ones I've ever owned and they actually have very good sound quality. The controls are easy to use and quite intuitive, which is a nice change from using products that make you feel like you need to carry the instruction manual with you everywhere you go. I still wish that Apple would open up their DRM scheme to allow compatability with other services and support more/better file formats (FLAC and Ogg to be precise), but I definitely have no problem recommending the Nano to anyone looking for a great sounding MP3 player.   In fact, my only complaint is with Amazon, not the Nano. I had paid the extra fee for rush shipping and it still took more than a week and a half for my order to arrive.

<Title>very convenient
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i chose to buy the 8GB nano instead of a 30GB video  because I use my iPod strictly for music and have no need for video capability  but even more than that was because my previous iPod stopped working due to hard drive failure and the nano uses flash memory.  considering that i run and work out  i think i made the right choice.  no 5 star simply because i haven't owned it long enough and i would have liked to have paid less or get a little more memory since my music collection is larger that the available space.

<Title>Motorcycle MP-3 Player
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Apple 8GB iPod Nano 2nd Gen is outstanding.  I bought mine mainly to use on my motorcycle ('06 Gold Wing) which has an MP-3 Player plug in.  After doing my research the San Disk 8GB and Apple Nano 8GB were the final two.  After holding a San Disk in my hand I could see that the San Disk isn't as motorcycle friendly as the Apple was.  Motorcyclists wear gloves at times and to operate a San Disk would be a problem with the scroll wheel.  I wasn't a fan of Apple due to the problems I had years ago concering their earlier computers.    I'm very satisfied now with my Nano iPod.  The flash drive is motorcycle friendly along with its scroll features and can be operated with gloves on.  The battery life is as advertised, about 24 hours per charge.  Using iTunes turned out to be very simple in loading my Nano.  I highly recommend a flash drive MP-3 player for motorcycle use or any other use where vibration maybe a factor in a hard drive unit.  I tried a Creative Lab 20GB and RCA Lyra 4GB (both hard drives)in the past on my motorcycle, both of which locked up while operating.  Both also had short battery lives, less than 6 hours on a motorcycle.  Am a Apple fan now.

<Title>Apple and Other Companies Should Be Sued re: Batteries
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The environmental damage caused by units with non-user-replaceable batteries  is no doubt horrendous. Oh, Apple will do you the enormous favor of sending you a refurbished model with a supposedly new battery in exchange for an outlandish fee. They at least have a program in place. Other models like the Toshiba Gigabeat and Microsoft Zune don't even have that!  All that being said, it's still the best on the market. Just be sure you pay the extra $40 for the full three-year warranty, or they'll soak you for $100 bucks with no guarantee that your refurby will work past that warranty end date.

<Title>Total Improvement
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got mine this morning, and I love it.  The package includes: - The new apple earphones - connection cable - adapter for iPod dock  I can't speak for the colored Nanos, but the black one is slick.  It's entirely black other than the white lettering on the scroll pad.  Even thinner than last gen, 40% brighter screen (really an improvement), supposedly 24 hours of battery life (as opposed to 12 hours last gen), and 8 GB for the same price as 4 GB last gen.  Same interface and screen, other than the new search and quick scroll functions.  Also inlcudes gapless playback, which apparently is a big deal (not to me but whatever).  Anyone who was a fan of the old Nanos will love this one.

<Title>Much improved over the 1st gen. ipod nano
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple has done a spendid job in taking the old iPod mini's aluminum case and putting it on the nano instead. I would really say that this new nano is more like a shrunken ipod mini, except with a bottom headphone jack (which I personally don't like). With the aluminum case, this nano is less-prone to scratches compared to the 1st-gen nano and the video ipod.  I got my nano today and I've already played about 4 hours of music with the battery gauge now at I'd say 80%. So the battery should be impressive, probably not the 24 hrs that Apple says but still decent. The interface now allows you the search for your music instantaneously, just like you can in iTunes. However, I wish Apple had put a built-in FM tuner instead of making us buy the little remote. I also was disappointed to see the 8gb come only in black; I really wanted a blue nano, but I also don't want 4gb. The black does still look pretty cool, I will admit that. Overall, I think this is the best non-video iPod to date. Apple definitely should be able to sell thousands of this model (I would say even more if there was a better color selection).  As of today (only 2 days after the release), many of the 1st-gen ipod nano accessories are compatible with the 2nd-gen nano, but because Apple slightly shifted the positions of the headphone jack and dock connector port, there are a few accessories (notably cases and armbands) which are not quite compatible.  But I'm sure the major ipod accessory makers are going to update their products very soon.

<Content>I used the overly large Xtreme Mac Micro Memo and then tried the Belkin TuneTalk. Both work, though I cannot get them to play back over the speakers. Does play over the headphones. Much more, but the sleek new version has some nicer aspects, then, than just curved edges and a bit more memory.

<Title>2nd Gen Nano Vs 5G_Video
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I entered the world of iPod in Oct of 2005 with a 5G-Video. Currently the 5G and the Nano are the same price.  Why buy a Nano if you have the 5G or instead of the 5G?  The 5G scratched easily, and the current 5G is just as scratchable, this nano is made of sterner stuff. It is amazing how disapointed you feel, after paying almost $300 for something, only to find it is extremely fragile, wasn't this made to carry around?  The Nano has a flash drive, no moving parts, technicaly able to withstand a drop without damaging a hard drive. It is more likely to last longer than a hard drive which is being carried around. The flash drive is more expenisve than a hard drive, part of the reason for a close price rang between the two.   The 5G has a 30Gig drive and this Nano only an 8gig. Generally I was carrying around too much music anyway, I found myself flipping through tons of music to get to what I wanted. Yes, you can create play list to bring those songs down to a manageable size, it seemed silly though to carry around such a larger device when I wanted something lighter and easier. You can not possible listen to all your music in one day anyway.  Video, no, there is no video on the Nano. I had a tendancy to use the video on my 5G when It came to lunch time at work. It began to dawn on me that I was sucking my battery dry on a daily basis.  Though, I enjoyed being able to watch movies or tv shows on the go, every time I did, I realised I was shortening the life of this device much faster than if I had been using it for what I originaly purchased it for, listening to music.   Although I had purchased an iPod, I noticed that the market was geared more toward the iPod Nano, which make sense. More people are going to buy the little thing at a cheaper price, so you can find accesories far easier than with the 5G. They can be found of course, on the net and elsewhere. But I found myself jealous of the many options displayed in stores for the nano. (Mind you this 2nd gen Nano does not have much in terms of accesories, but I imagine it will not take long.)  Owning both of these devices now, I know what they are going to be used for. The larger capacity drive will be used at home in it's cradle connection to my stereo. And should I want to watch a movie or catch up on something, i'll carry it with me to lunch time, now and again. I'll more than likely use the Apple Lossless files on this device as well.   The Nano will be on me at all times.  At this point if I had to choose between one or the other, I would say go for the Nano. It is much more likely to last longer and will serve most audio needs on the go. The 5G is just too large to run around with, be active with. I was just star struck with the fact that I could have so much music.  Hope this helps.

<Title>The Best For A While
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new Apple 8-GB iPod is a vast improvement over the older versions.  However, it is not without its flaws.  First, it is made out of anodized aluminum instead of polycarbonate, so it won't scratch so easily.  If you have an old Skin, be aware that this new iPod is slimmer and your Skin won't fit as snugly as before.  Thinner does not mean better in this case.  The battery lasts up to 24 hours, which is a great lifesaver for those tired of recharging their iPod everyday.  The new ear buds claim to have better sound, but I found no difference and use noise-reducing headphones instead.  This iPod comes in a nice plastic box, but there is no CD.  All the information (including instructions) must be downloaded.  There are also many other nifty extras that are too numerous to go into, however, I don't understand why when scrolling through songs in alphabetical order, the main letter of the song list shows up. - Cool, but why?  Jumping from a 2-GB to an 8-GB was a great novelty for me, not having to delete just to add more songs.  I suspect this iPod Nano will be the iPod to have for a few years at least.

<Title>A word of caution to PC users
<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 2nd Generation 8 GB Nano to supplement (and probably eventually replace) my 20GB Color iPod, which has been developing signs of old age, getting stuck at innopportune moments. I decided that 8 gig is really big enough to listen to the music I actually listen to every day at the gym, and I wanted to replace my disk-based iPod with a solid state device.  My first reaction upon opening the box was astonishment at how small the Nano is!  I had never seen one before.  It is very slick.  Itunes is pretty smart about letting me update the 8 GB Nano from the music library I had accumulated for my 20 GB iPod.  It creates a special playlist for the Nano to define what songs are specifically downloaded to the smaller device.  I had actually thought I would have to set up a completely new music library, and go through the tedium of reloading all those CDs.  One extremely important note of caution for PC users: this is the first USB device I have owned (and I own a lot of different USB devices) that really requires a USB 2.0 port.  I didn't even realize that my 3-year-old home-brew Windows machine didn't have USB 2.0; it was never really an issue before.  Apple says that USB 2.0 is highly recommended for the 2nd generation Nano, but it really should be a hard requirement.  The behavior of my PC while trying to talk to the Nano over a USB 1.1 port was truly bizarre.  The Nano basically brought the PC to its knees.  I was able eventually to start updating the Nano but after 24 hours had only loaded about 400 songs.  The response time of my PC during this ordeal was utterly ridiculous.  During the day I bought a USB 2.0 PCI card, shut down the PC, installed the card, and was able to finish updating the Nano in a matter of minutes.

<Title>Not same quality as 4th gen iPods, but still the winning design 
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: It has the perfect design - both hardware and software. Its minuscule size and excellent music management software iTunes makes up for the missing Bluetooth & WiFi. Great sound and battery life too.  Cons: Not same hardware quality as older Apple products - I bought two 2nd gen nanos last week - the 2GB and 8GB. I've owned a few Apple products for years now and I noticed that the quality of the new nano is not as robust as the previous iPods or other Apple devices. The hold button on 2GB nano is loose. The 8GB black had a flimsy wheel that won't stay put. A click felt like 2 clicks, and soon started to make funny sounds as if its going to fall apart. I eventually had to return and get a replacement twice ! I had a similar experience with another Apple product (not iPod) a month ago, the 1st piece was defective so had to replace the next day.  Conclusion: I still give nano 4 stars since in the big schema of things, its a superb MP3 device, specially because its music management software iTunes works much better than others (which by the way is one of the big reasons for iPod's success). It is VERY easy to transfer music to your iPod and that is a big time saver, especially if you plan to change your playlists or download new podcasts everyday.  Bottom Line: I highly recommend iPod nanos. I just wish that for a $250 device Apple paid tad more attention to the hardware quality. Make sure you test your piece well as soon as you get it. You would love listening to your music on it.

<Content>I've used an iPod shuffle for the gym for years because my regular 30 gb iPod was too large for running, etc. The new 8 GB shuffle is perfect because not only is it small enough to be barely noticeable when placed in the Nike armband, but it has so much storage space and battery life that I can go all week without recharging, using it for both the gym and my commute to work (about 2 hrs a day total.) No other personal music player on the market offers this mix of compact size and battery life.

<Title>One excellent device--but be careful about buying accessories!
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Suffice it to say this is one great iPod.  Other reviewers have covered all the wonders of these new Nanos, so I won't recover the same territory.    There are a few caveats potential buyers should beware of however:  --The dimensions are NOT the same as the 1G (first generation) Nanos.  I purchased a set of lanyard headphones at a local store earlier this week and discovered the connector would not fit this new 2G Nano.  The space between the dock connector and the headphone jack is not the same between the two models, so I realized I will have to look for a 2G-specific lanyard.  Please note that any accessories that only plug into either the dock connector or the headphone jack should be fine--the lanyard however plugs into both, and the 1G lanyard therefore is incompatible.  --Consider the new 2G dimensions also when purchasing any sort of covers or jackets for the Nano.  The bulk of these products you'll find out there as of this date (September, '06) are for the dimensions of the 1G Nanos.  The 2G Nano is a little slimmer and the edges are more rounded, so the fit will not be quite as snug.  All in all, I can not recommend this new 2G 8GB Nano highly enough.  However, if you are looking for accessories you may want to wait a while for them to hit the shelves.  And if you're expecting any current 1G Nano accessories you may already have to fit, you may be disappointed.
