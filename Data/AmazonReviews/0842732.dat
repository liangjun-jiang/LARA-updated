<Title>Great custom service
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I won't repeat how great the player is.  What I was amazed was the custom service.  While trying to connect this to my mac, I accidentally erased everything on the player and froze it.  Called tech support number off Sandisk website, get connected with someone (US based) within a minute of wait.  He walked me through, reformatted it, and got it to work within ~15 minutes.   I don't even expect this kind of custom service of $1000's purchases, let alone a $40 player.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new at the mp3 player game (very old fashion) and I bought the Clip only for the FM radio feature.  My wife promptly stole it, downloaded pod casts and music and I haven't seen it since.  She loves it.  (I now have to get another one.)  I was amazed at how tiny it is and how superb it sounds and works.  My only objection is not having a one click method of selecting my FM presets (unless there is one and I can't find it) and not being able to list the FM presets in priority order.  Displaying the station ID along with the number would help too.    Of course I realize that this is an MP3 player first and an FM radio second.  Even for 2nd place this thing is fabulous!

<Title>Excellent buy!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was in the market for a small, affordable mp3 player so that I could have something to listen to while working out. I had originally wanted the Clip when I decided that I was going to buy one and then started looking at the Zune 2nd gen that just came out and was also looking at the Sansa e260 but just couldnt make up my mind. I finally got sick of toiling over it and just bought the Clip when I saw it was on sale.  I LOVE IT!! It was so easy to sync my music onto it and its just as easy to play the song you want to play! It is VERY small and clips tightly to anything you want it to stay on. I go walking and jogging a lot and it works perfect for me! The only regret I have is that i should have gone for the 2GB version. The pink one looks much cuter!

<Title>Just hold it; you'll be sold
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Fantastic doesn't even begin to describe this player. It's slick, afforable, droppable, and easy to use. I took this bad boy to work, and the next monday, 3 of the middle-aged women I work with showed up with one of their own.   Pros: Price. Interface. Features. Feeling smarter than those retards at the gym with a crappy, overpriced Shuffle on an armband (the clip on the back is stronger and more versatile.)  -Nobody's mentioned the handsome blue light the interface makes, so I will: I love the blue ring. It's the kind of high-technology glow that just has you at "hello".   -The microphone is surprisingly high-quality. Doubt I'll use it much however.  Cons:  - Like so many other players, it's really determined to use ID3 tags. Individual tracks, foreign music, and techno mixes all end up in the "Various Artists" category.   -Though they're standard for players nowadays, the shape of the earbuds makes me uncomfortable, and I can't help but worry a lotta sound is leaking. Though this is a strictly personal thing, shelling out another Clip's worth of dough for comfy phones makes the bargain here negligible.   -The reception on the FM radio is rather awful for anything but the mightiest broadcasts. Not recommended if the FM is your main reason for purchasing the Clip.

<Title>Sansa Clip 1 GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa Clip 1GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $35.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 2GB version for $25-40 more.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus  Cons  - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Clip with added features  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  The Zen Clip also has a larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJ5MQG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Sandisk 2GB Pink Sansa Clip</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Somewhat Disappointed
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got this item I was really impressed and thought I had made a really excellant purchase. The item is very attractive with an excellant design, and despite what some others have said I found the sound quality to be good. I also found it to be too loud, however, and since the device only allows for "normal" and "high" volume settings I was not able to lower the sound to a level I could tolerate in bed. My primary use for the device was to be for at work and for workouts at the gym so I tried to overlook this. I was pleased that the device has such a nice, bright display, records songs off the radio and had a clip for my clothing.  The thing that made me return it, ultimately, was the fact that it would not download any music files from my computer! I tried at least 4 times, and my computer clearly showed the music transferring to the Sansa but when i later tried to play it on the Sansa it was nowhere to be found. I called Sansa direct and no one answered the phone. So then i emailed them and got some good Customer Service that way but no one was able to offer a solution that actually worked, though they did try hard. Another problem with the Sansa was that after the first day or two it suddenly wouldn't stay charged more than about an hour; it's charge life kept getting shorter and shorter. It's supposed to be good for 12-15 hours after the last charge-up but mine clearly didn't-and I was not even playing it continuously. I also found that it was unable to get much radio reception outside the city limits, which doesn't bode well if your local gym is on the edge of the city. I was lucky to get maybe 2 or 3 stations tops there, and none of them the ones I wanted.    I think in the future I will look for a player that has a longer battery charge life and better volume control, in addition to finding one that downloads files. This one turned out to be nothing more than a glorified radio, I am sorry to say, and failed even at that in some ways. I'm guessing it's going to cost me more...   Anyway, given the mostly positive reviews on this little player, maybe your experience will be different than mine.  Just don't throw away the packaging or receipt right away when you get it home, in case you have to return it.

<Title>Wow - Who needs an Apple Ipod!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, when my daughter broke her Ipod, I felt like the only thing I could do was hand over mine...and I pouted for a whole 5 minutes, until I found this little gadget - the Sansa Clip.  Wow!!  Who needs an Apple Ipod??  For approx $70 less than an Ipod I got the same size memory (1GB) PLUS a radio and a little voice recorder.  It plays for 14 - 15 hours, and the sound is unbelievable. Also, it is so small - and has a great clip on it.  I just attach it to the back of my name tag at work and off I go "whistling while I work".  Doesn't get any better.  Never heard of "Sansa" before - but that namebrand has just replaced "Ipod"in our house....oh, and did I tell you....my daughter (the name brand fanatic) is now jealous of my MP-3 player. lol

<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was bought as a gift for my 12-year old son.  He seems to be very pleased with it, and the number of complaints and "tech support" questions (to me) have been almost zero.  So I'd say it was a success, and the size and price were suitable for that age.  Yes, he will outgrow it someday, but we all know that these tech gadgets are typically short-lived anyway.

<Title>An extraordinary value
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a player for the gym or for a run in the woods this is a good fit. Super light. Very easy to sync with Windows Media player (version 10 and up); bright screen allowing navigation through your playlists and albums. Good for long podcasts or audio books where you want to resume where you left off. Decent FM radio. May not be as cool as the Apple clip, but I have better ways to spend my money. BTW, you can recharge with a standard mini-USB charger (not included) which is a lot easier than charging from your computer.

<Title>Excellent sound, nice player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just recieved this player a week ago. The sound is by far the best I have ever heard through any of the portable devices that I ever owned. The stock speakers are good enough for day to day hearing and bring out the sound quality. However, I am sure that that the sound is worthy of a nicer set of speaker.  Size, batter life, and menu options leave nothing to complain about (considering the price). I especially like the ability to add songs to the "go-list" (an incorporated play list) and the ability to rate songs on the player it self and play highest rated songs.  The player syncs well with Windows media player on my VISTA laptop. The rating and all are transferred perfectly. Furthermore, it is always possible to directly access the player, which makes the player extremely flexible (especially compared to the IPOD).  The clip has great utility, and the whole system seems to be stable, reliable, robust, and cheap enough! Well worth the 5 stars!

<Title>Cool, but has problems
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It had problems immediately like previous reviews. Kept turning off because of low battery even though I charged it forever. I set it aside for a day, then reformatted it by holding the button for 20 seconds while turning it off. Now it works, although not like it should. Also, my computer wouldn't recognize it. Try turning it off, putting it on hold, and holding the center button while plugging it in, but don't just let go of the center, keep holding it until your computer recognizes it. Then you can go to sansa and download the new upgrade. Besides all the problems, it's cool because unlike the shuffle, it has a screen so you can see and choose what you listen to. It also has a radio so you can listen to the tv's at the gym, which is clutch.

I was looking for an mp3 player and trusted this brand because my daughter received one for Christmas that has unfortunately has already been stolen.  it was good while it lasted though.  What I also like about this device is the fm radio capabilities as I enjoy listening to NPR occasionally while not everyone in my life is interested.  I really don't have anything negative to say about this player.

<Content>This is my first MP3 I've owned and I love it.  It seems really easy to use with the drag and drop folder. The FM tuner is great receiving the channels where I use it to watch TV at the Y while I work out.  My only issue is that it stopped working when I got it all sweaty during my workout.  A couple hours later, it started working again.  By design, it clips onto your clothing.  On the treadmill,  the clip wasn't strong enough for my arm so I put it on my neck line.  I worked up a good sweat and it stopped working.

<Content>I'm not interested in looking at pictures or watching video on a tiny screen.  All I want is a device that will play my WMA-format music and that I can use in the (noisy) gym where I work out. Small, light, easy to use, hard to accidentally turn on or off, great-sounding, with a bright screen and built-in clip -- the Sansa Clip meets all my needs better than most mp3 players and at much lower cost.    The earbuds provided with the Sansa Clip are serviceable, but I use separately-purchased in-ear buds (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUESSU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-2226037-4002353">V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black</a>), since they help reduce the competition from gym noise.

<Title>A lot of bang for your bucks.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This refers to the 2GB Sansa Clip.  I own an ipod 30GB, but I have to get the Sansa Clip because iPod does not play protected WMA format offered by Netlibrary and OverDrive.  I am very impressed with the features of this little gadget; it beats the iPod shuffle by A MILE.  For $60 (I got mine at Best Buy for $45 on sale), you get a little display (believe me it is important because I owned the first generation ipod shuffle and it was mad as hell when you are away from your computer, pushes the Play button but nothing happens).  You also get equalizers, FM tuners, protected WMA support (very important to me).  I will say the music sounds more lively as well.  I do not give it 5 stars because it is not as sturdy and well-built as an ipod.  It looks very nice but it is very fragile.  This is expected because Sansa needs to make money to stay in business, isn't it.  In terms of software, you need a bit of tech savvy to use it, unlike Ipod, where things are expected to work out of a box.  For example, you should know how to update the firmware, to re-format the gadget, and to use Windows Media Player to sync audio files (for mp3, just drop your files to the Music folder, though).  I downloaded a 4kbps protected WMA  file and never got it to play until reading the specifications: the WMA has to be sampled at 16 kbps or more.  So I downloaded the CD quality version of the file from Netlibrary and it plays fine.  In a nutshell, I highly recommend this player: you get everything you pay for and some.  Don't buy the shuffle, Period.  If your budget allows, spend a little more (about $130 plus tax) for the ipod Nano 2nd generation.  Having said that, I would say ipod Nano is not an option for me because of the protected WMA issue.

<Title>Great player and value
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  I own 1000+ CDs, and at age 37, consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I have listened to some songs from my phone, but never took the plunge to a dedicated MP3 player. Even after a few days, I don't know why I put this off.  First, moving music to the player was remarkably easy.  I just plugged it in, and the player showed up in Windows Explorer.  I copied MP3s from my computer, with no specific directory/file structure to follow, and they showed up, sorted correctly by artist/album/song, etc. No extra software to use!  No iTunes or WMP or Rhapsody or LockYourMusicIntoOurStore stuff!  Second, this is a fine interface. Yes, it is text-only.  But that is how I always listened on my phone anyway, I scrolled through the album titles and when I found the one I wanted, I hit "play". Naturally, if you REALLY NEED to see cover art, get a different player.  But if you are buying music, and not cover art (and also not little plastic disks and boxes), then get this player.  Now I have already purchased eight albums from Amazon in MP3 format, with no problems putting them onto the player.  Great playback quality, easy to use.  I won't go back... I can't go back...

<Title>Nice unit
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use mine to listen to Overdrive and NetLibrary audio books while driving.  Connecting to car audio with cassette adapter.  Works great.  My advice: put the numbered book parts in order into Playlists (one book per Playlist) using Windows Media Player and synch those with the Sansa Click device.  Also, go to the Sandisk web site and install their "firmware update", and download the product manual pdf since you don't get a printed manual in the product package.  What I like about the device controls is that you stop the book just by clicking Pause, and the player turns itself off a minute later - handy while driving the car.  When you want to resume the book just turn the player on with the slide switch and click Pause again.  Neat.

<Content>I bought this to jog with because of the built in clip. It stopped working after a month. I have done some digging - a-lot of people are having the same problem.  Bought a Nano instead - sounds great. It's been working fine for a month.

<Content>The player is very easy to use but the battery life is quite poor. I could barely get 1 hour of play time after each charge. The battery would discharge completely, after a full charge, if the player was left unused for 2-3 days.

<Content>The mp3 arrived promptly and was well-packed, nothing broken.  My first mp3 player...very easy to use!  I had no problems figuring out how to set it up on the computer and download the music.  The sound is great...operates with ease...the fm radio is handy.  Great Buy!

<Title>Pretty cool for the price
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Nice player, easy to use, good volume, lots of options, I really like it. Only one problem, the random mode on it SUCKS, you can play the songs in order by tittle, or artist, you can make playlists, and more, but the random just keeps repeating the same songs. Oh well, still really good for the $.

<Title>Very cool and very easy to use
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa Clip mp3 player is my first mp3 player and at first I was worried that it would be challenging to learn to use. But It is very easy, very user friendly. I am not too great with 'newer' technology, so if I can learn to use this very quickly, anybody can!   The sound quality is great as well. I also love the clip on the back which is just right, not too tight and not too loose.  Excellent price too for those of us on a budget. :)

<Title>A whole lot better than I expected
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this because I wanted to listen to my own music while at the gym. I really love it. It is small, has a clip to attach to your shorts, or what ever, easy to operate, and even plays the radio. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the clarity of the sound from the radio and the music I downloaded was superb. For the price, you really can't beat it.

<Title>It's all that, and a bag of chips!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player is one really cool, top of the line best for the money mp3 players. I had a apple nano, and a top of the line zune.  For ease of use the clip blows the others away!  I research things before I buy, even cereal (just kidding)! I also had a sansa before, so I was familar with it.  If I was forced to find one negative, it would be that there is no expansion slot. Otherwise spend your hard earned bucks for this player and know you got your moneys worth!!!!

<Title>Great Value
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this to use on the treadmill.  I orginally wanted to buy the I-Pod shuffle, but I was not very impressed with it.  I found this on Amazon and based on the reviews I bought it.  It is a great player, simple and easy to use right out of the box.  Music is easily downloaded by simply dragging songs from your music folder into the Sansa's music folder. The screen is very handy and the sound quality is great especially for the price. I chose the 1 GB over 2 GB because I don't need an extensive song library.   If you are looking for something to use at the gym this would fit your needs.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great for Netlibrary Audio Book listeners (Overdrive audio)
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this little player hoping to use it for Overdrive audiobooks from my local library.  It seemed from the reviews that it might work.  Well I had problems the first week I had it but a recent firmware upgrade on the sandisk website fixed the glitch and it works great.  If you own or purchase one and want to use it for Overdrive audiobooks I recommend a trip to the help section of the sandisk website.  I found the forums (chat boards) more helpful than the actual helpdesk since I am a newbie to the land of MP3 players.  The helpdesk and the folks on the forums are very helpful, but upgrade to the latest firmware and you will be all set to run all the Audiobooks you could want.  I love this little player, it works great, takes up no room at all, recharges from empty in a couple of hours and holds at least 4 of my audiobook selections at a time and some music without any trouble.  I understand it comes in a 2gb version as well, so if you need more space go for it, but if you are looking for inexpensive and fantastic, this is it.  Also they have great support at the website.

<Title>great for this price
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this for Christmas for our 4 year old. Before you laugh, check out the high dollar "kid" mp3 players that are way more expensive and won't allow anything but CD music to transfer over. My husband and I both use Apple mp3 players, and the Sansa has a somewhat similar look. The menu is great, song downloads are easy and don't require special software. The voice recorder is fun too. We aren't able to get many radio stations here, so we haven't checked out the FM part yet. The Sansa is super small and the clip is a great included feature. The sound is good and the lighted features are useful and fun.  We plan on buying one for some of our adult relatives, to get them into MP3's. If a 4 year old can figure out how to use this (downloading songs aside) ANYONE can handle it.

<Title>Best MP3 Player Value Out There.
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 1GB Zen from Creative right after Christmas, but when I saw this little jewel for the same price, I returned the Zen back to the brick & mortor store and purchased the Clip from Amazon.  And I haven't regretted it since.  This player seems to be built rather solid to me in spite of what some of the others said and the battery lasts longer than the Zen too. The sound quality is up there with the Zen as well.  What? Are you still reading this? Then stop reading and buy the Clip...You won't regret it.

<Title>Great for audible books
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 1 GB model holds 15 audible books (downloaded from Audible.com), and it is wonderfully convenient to use.  I no longer have to change to a top with a pocket -- I just clip it on my collar and go out for a walk.  The sound quality is excellent, both with its included earbuds and the lightweight over-the-ear Sony headphones I prefer.  Recharging and synching with Audible Manager on the computer is also very convenient -- just plug the short USB cable into a convenient USB port, say on the monitor.

<Title>Simple and sleek
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you are looking for a simple MP3 player (either 1GB or 2GB) with a display and good quality, then this is the one for you.   It uses PC's USB port for charging, so it does not come with a charger, but you can easily get one from eBay or some electronic store for about $5 or you can even use some of the cell phone chargers which uses the tiny USB pin.  Yes, it is slightly bigger than iPod-Shuffle, but this one comes with a display and costs about half the price of iPod-Shuffle and with a better quality.  You can even record FM radio without losing any sound quality.  No software is required to copy songs from a PC.

<Content>I have used my 1 GB Sansa Clip for about a month now, and have been extremely pleased with the performance and quality of the product.  I like that I can use both WMA and MP3 formats, and that it is so easy and intuitive to use; downloading files from Media Player is simple.  The sound is excellent, and so is the FM radio.  The screen is easy to read day or night.  I'm thinking of getting my husband the 2 GB model.

<Title>Just Right
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my first MP3 player, and I purchased it for use while exercising.  For this purpose, it seems to be just right.  The only problem I had was that the automatic sensing setting for USB didn't work and my PC wouldn't recognize the device when I plugged it in.  After fiddling around with it, and reading a few web pages, I was able to switch it to the correct mode. Probably a good idea to update the firmware in this little guy, which is pretty easy to do, but you have to get the USB working, first.    The Sansa Clip covers all the bases... The sound quality is good, display clear and bright, and build quality seems solid. It has a good sturdy clip.  Overall, it's well worth 34 bucks.

<Title>A great bargain
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter is delighted with this gift, which makes exercising at the gym much more pleasant.  Does the job and costs a lot less than an I-Pod.  Only glitch was we have an older model computer, Dell 4600, and couldn't get it to accept Microsoft Service Pack II, which is needed in order to recharge the MP3 player from the computer.  But we fixed that by paying $30 to the Nerds at Best Buy, and now everything works smoothly.

<Title>Shuffle killer
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought two for my children and after a family reunion where they show up with the Clip now their cousins, aunts, and grandmother wants one. Some of them were previous Ipod owners. I think it has a good design and features for a very modest price (under $40.00). The display is a big plus over the Shuffle. It is very easy to sync using Windows Media Player and its tiny size and rechargeable battery adds to its manageability. You won't be wrong on giving the Clip as a gift to practically anyone. After testing my children's, definitely I'm going to buy my own after finishing this review.

<Content>Sansa clip is dynamite.  You can easily find what you have stored on the unit and can play or pause or resume playing without interupption and without returning to the beginning of a song.  The only bad thing is figuring out the menus.  The directions are spotty at best, but if you stick with it, eventually you can figure it out and enjoy.  Much better than the IPOD.  You can even voice record and record off FM.

Unlike the ipod shuffle this one shows your song titles and has an FM stereo !! Your able to clip it to anything and just do your thing!!! It even has a cute little graphic equilizer!! I love creating what is called a "Go List" to excercise to those songs that you love to dance too!!
