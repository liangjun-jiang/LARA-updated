<Title>Many defects
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first thing I noticed on this mp3 player after I turn it on is that the screen was not centered.  Very dificult to figure out how it works.  Don't have a lock key and I got it accidentally turn off and on when I move.  Finally, I returned this product to Amazon.

<Title>Well received.

<Content>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my preteen and teenage nieces. They enjoyed it very much. It must have been easy to use because they had both downloaded music from my computer and were listening to it the whole afternoon.

<Title>Doesn't work - On any System
<Date>Sun Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this as a birthday gift for my son.  Doesn't work. Was waiting a long time for this gift and it was DOA. Locked up my computer. Didn't work on his either. Called their support line which they did answer fast, but after trying this and that he said it has a bad memory card. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  Don't get stuck in the Nextar quality hole!

<Title>This Player Is A Bargain
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am giving this little player five stars because of its value to cost ratio.  This unit 1) Supports ALL MP formats plus WMA and WAV  2) Has multiple equalizer settings (seven band)  3) Has multiple playback modes  4) Can serve as a voice recorder  5) Has visual picture menu  6) Has ID3 tagging (which displays as the song is being played)  7) Displays song lyrics if the LRC file is downloaded.  Plus other features - all for $16.  The first thing that you need to do when you receive this player is throw away the "ear bud" headphones - they are worthless.  With a nice pair of bass/digital headphones, this unit has a startling beautiful sound.  The volume is adequate, but not exceptional loud.  That's probably because if the amplification was louder, you would have to put a new battery in every thirty minutes.  Plus, they probably do not want to get sued for damaging your hearing.  If you want it loud, plug it into a set of powered computer speakers - yes, that works.  I'm already happy with this thing.  If it lasts for a year, I'll be REALLY happy.  Check out the other colors that this player comes in.  The red one is very attractive.
