<Title>Review of the Reviews
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't understand why people are writing "reviews" of a product you have most likely not seen in person much less actually purchased and used. As I write this, the iPod Video is not available for purchase, yet that has not stopped people from "reviewing" it here on Amazon, comparing its video screen to the PSP and other small Video devices , etc etc.  It looks like most of the reviews are just die-hard fans or they hate any iPod that comes out because it doesn't have FM.  I plan to purchase one in the near future, and at that time I will write a review, until then I don't see the point in any reviews of a product that is Not Available Yet!  what is latin for "reader beware"?

<Title>WOW
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>OH MY GOSH, THIS IS THE BEST MUSIC PLAYER EVER!!!!! Sure, lots of people complain about how the screen is too small, that not many people will buy it because of that, but I just bought it and it's BRILLIANT. I bought a music video from iTunes as soon as I installed it, played it on my new iPod, and the picture quality was BEAUTIFUL. Of course, if you can't buy it because it's too expensive or you simply don't like it, buy something else. There's the iPod shuffle, nano, photo, mini, the Sony PSP, and lots more. By the way, you don't HAVE to get an MP3 player. But if you absolutely need (or want) one, this is THE ONE to get.

<Title>Very nice (yes, I actually have one)
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As of this writing, no reviews are from someone who actually HAS one of the new iPods (10/19). That is about to change....  My 40GB iPod's hard disk had been deteriorating for a while, until it stopped working altogether. That happened to be the day before the iPod video announcement (last Tuesday).   On to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from Apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:  1) Can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? What about the video quality?  In short, if you're holding the iPod as close to your face as you would hold an older iPod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. The screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old iPod width). If you're wondering how the quality comes out on an iPod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. It takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).  With regard to movies, the iPod doesn't support chapters. My guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. This will allow chapter skipping. That said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.  I loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the iPod would allow. The actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an MPGE4.  2) What the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?  It is about the size of older iPods. It is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo Gen4 40gb). The front is a flat screen, much like the iPod nano, but bigger. The clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older iPods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) The screen  I have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. If you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. This is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....  4) Is it worth it?  Jobs called this a regular iPod with "video capability." I'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. I don't yet have a composite adapter, so I can't see how this comes out on a TV...  With regard to exporting video to TV, there ARE the following options: TV Out (on/off) Video Signal (NTSC/PAL) Widescreen (on/off)  If your iPod is breaking, or is pretty old, I'd definitely upgrade. If you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), I'd definitely get it. If you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.  5) Firewire  The tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so I had been wondering whether it is supported. It actually is not supported at all. In fact, I tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the iPod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. Please use the supplied USB cable."  6) The "case"  I saw that a case was included on the Apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. I got a 60GB model, and it barely squeezes into the case. That said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have SOMETHING to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).  Anyway, I hope this answers any questions you might have. I've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the iPod photo.  If you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. It is really quite nice.

<Title>Excellent except for battery life from video
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me say this is my fourth ipod. Got my first one about 2 1/2 years ago with the 3rd generation. I. got it replaced after about 2 years as the battery died quickly. They replaced it with a 30 gig photo ipod. Then when the BLACK nano came out, I just had to get it! Love it except everything scratches it, including cotton pants! Thats the only downside to the nano. Then yesterday at the San Francisco Apple store around noon the new IPOD with video came out and I snatched it. Its the white 30 gig (thats all that was availible). The thing is spectacular and the picture quality is awesome. The plastic front looks like its made of the same material as the nano so I'm being extra cautious and actually put a screen protector over it that was made for my Compac Ipac. It works great. YOU just have to cut it to fit over most of the ipod and the scroll wheel still works great with the plastic over it.  The bad news is the battery only lasted 1 hour 45 minutes as I just tested it with a full battery. Barely enough for a movie but the ipod is mostly used for music. I can use my PSP for movies.  You have to buy the plug in adaptor as this model along with the nano does not come with one but thats understandable as the units are fairly reasonably priced compared to other MP3 players and the first ipod was only 5 gigs, this is really a deal. My nano is black and the screen protectors works great for that one too. Apple's computers aren't the best but I think their mp3 players are!

<Title>Commuters dream?
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Not really a review, but a feature or service suggestion:  If Apple could provide Tivo2Go for Direc TV with Tivo service on the optional Universal Dock via USB Apple provides with the device (or any DVR docking feature will do) then I will be one of the first to buy one of these devices today and support it.   I commute 2 to 4 hours a day by public transportation (buses and trains) in NYC and this would be a great distraction for me, plus this way I can catch up on all my Tivo recorded shows on my way home and have something to look forward to, going and returning to work to pay for this device.

<Title>The New iPod with Video
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The new Apple iPod with video playback brings a much anticipated facet of technology to the pocket portable world.  With the capability to playback crisp and vibrant video in both H.264 and MPEG-4 formats, the new iPod enables you to take your shows on the go.  Matched with the new QuickTime version, creating your own movies for play on the iPod is just as easy!  The new flat-faced, slender design not only brings a new asthetic quality to the orignal iPod line, but also brings it together with the recently released iPod Nano.  The new, smaller scroll wheel, no longer sporting a rounded center button, fits the overall design much better as well.  The face of the new iPod features the same clear laminate coating that the iPod Nano was treated to, serving to both protect the new 2.5" screen better and allow the iPod to be produced not only in the original white, but the new and decidedly appealing black.  The new 2.5" screen holds to the same Apple quality most have come to expect.  Clear, bright and easy to watch at nearly any angle.  While many compare this to the Sony PSP's larger screen, the two technologies serve decidedly different needs, and the iPod executes its purpose well with the design.  All in all, the new iPod is the same old great functionality and design with the ability for video added in.  The "icing on the cake" as Steve Jobs put it. [...]

<Title>Beautiful, Simple, Another Winner
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Very satisfied new ipod "video" 30gb user.  Overall the thin shape, bright colorful screen and just the classic ipod interface has been a great first impression.  Loading media unto it seems to take a few minutes but after its there, everything just works.  Videos and photos both are sharp, colors viberant, and run with ease.  As most noted, it only works with USB, no Firewire support, but that shouldnt be a huge deal since most users are USB equipped, I would recommend USB 2.0, 1.1 would take a very long time.  Thanks Apple, I enjoy this newest revision, 5 out of 5 stars to you in my book.

<Title>Creative is better
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I literally spent dozens of hours researching, trying to find out what mp3 player was the best.  I can't even list all the ones I looked at, but a good place to go to find the different kinds (...); just search for mp3 players.  In the end it boiled down to two: Creative, and Apple, with Creative standing head-and-shoulders above Apple.  (...)  Another thing is the picture display.  iPods have the worst color displays, with only a 60,000 color OLED screen, while most other mp3 players, including all of creative's colored models, have 262,000+.  This has changed with the iPod video, however, which now boasts the 262,000+ color OLED screen.  The screen is of course HUGE at 2.5" diagonal, but the screen on other mp3 players are never too small, except maybe the Nano.  As far as output, Creative puts all the other companies out of the market.  With a signal-to-noise ratio of 96dB for mp3s, and 46dB for radio (that's right, it's got an FM radio, from which you can even record), their sound is incredible.  They rate their battery time using 64kbps compression, while almost every other company (including Apple) uses 128kbps.  At first it seems like Creative is skimping you, until you listen to it.  Listening to a song at 64kbps on the Creative Zen MicroPhoto sounds better than a song at 128kbps on the 30gb iPod Video.    One thing I prefer on the iPod video that isn't available on the MicroPhoto is the ability to play all of an artist's songs.  On the Microphoto you either play every single song on your player, or just one CD.  Another thing is the touchpad on Creative products compared to the click wheel of the Apple stuff.  I think the click wheel is better because the touchpad is a little sensitive.  You can adjust its sensitivity, but I still think I prefer the click wheel.  The iPod has a couple of games, but they'll probably get real boring real quick.  The iPod lacks the ability to adjust the volume without backing out of whatever you're in, click on "Now Playing," and use that neat scroll wheel, while with Creative products, you either have a volume button or a menu button with which to access the volume from any screen.    Creative products are for PCs, while Apple products are, of course, for Apples.  You can convert from anything to anything with either one, but if you own a PC I think you'd be much better off with Creative.    The MicroPhoto is infinitely more customizable than the iPod, which is a definate plus for people who know what they like.  The iPod does not allow you to change the order of your main menu, customize your EQ settings, change your background, adjust your theme, change the click wheel sensitivity, etc. etc.    I'm listening to my iPod video right now and with only 3 albums on it, no photos, and no videos it has a lag time.  My MicroPhoto, with over 42 hours of songs and hundreds of photos, never had a single skip, bump, or jump.  I even dropped my MicroPhoto a handful of times, sat on it, had a person sitting on my lap who was crushing it, etc.  The iPod has been under no such abuse.    I could probably go on and on for hours, but there are a lot of things you're never going to find out until you actually buy an mp3 player and start playing with it, so my advice is to research (not nearly as much as I did, though, because I almost went insane), head to Best Buy, and buy one.  Play with it, take it back for another, rinse wash and repeat.  If I never had anything to compare it to, I'd be happy with the iPod.  I'll admit that the iPod, especially the 30gb video, is the sexiest looking mp3 player on the market, but if you're looking for better sound, better customization, better picture, more options, faster menu surfing, better durability, and cheaper prices, go with Creative.

My mini never scratched and my 3rd gen 20 gig didnt show scratches like these until after months of playing. There is obviously a problem with the coating that is applied to both the lcd and front bezel. I can only imagine how bad it will look in a couple of weeks :( Beware and stay away from the ipods until apple gets there stuff together and fixes this problem!

The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.

<Title>so far, so good
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've only had this product for...maybe a month, and so far it has worked fine. I do think i have to reset it more than usual when i'm trying to turn it on, which i find weird. Basically, sometimes it won't turn on when i press the play button. i usually listen to it at night, and fall asleep before the playlist ends, and when i try to turn it on the next day, i have to do the 'reset' procedure. maybe i'm just not used to the little quirks of an ipod? battery life has been decent, since i use my ipod practically everyday, i do have to charge it every night or so, but i knew about battery life expectations when i was looking for an ipod. i bought a case for it, because i wanted to protect the ipod (since i use it on a regular basis). Other than these 2 things (battery and reset), the ipod has worked software-wise when i have to plug it into my computer. it has lived up to my expectations for an ipod.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought the 30 GB version and we love it.  - The screen is small but clear and sharp. Go to an Apple store and see it first to make sure you're cool with it.  - The audio is excellent.  - It is very stylish. The 30 GB version is thin and convenient and holds a lot.  - It is very easy to use. iTunes is a breeze to use (we have a PC).  - Chinese characters show up just fine in the iPod text.  - We bought QuickTime Pro ($30) because it was the most convenient software I found for converting video to the iPod format. Videora Converter is free and useful for getting video into the H264 format, but I found I needed QuickTime Pro to get it to the final correct iPod format. The final conversion is very, very slow.  - It comes with a reasonable case, but I'm hoping for an after-market case to hold it and the headphones. Ideally there would be one that would protect the screen and let you view it clearly. In general, we're just very careful.  - It comes with a cable to hook to USB 2.0. Early USB version apparently may not supply enough power to recharge the iPod.  - The Lithium Ion battery charges up to 80% really quickly (less than 3 hours from dead zero), and then trickle charges to 100%. The battery may be recharged at any time w/o risk of "memory" like a Nickel Cadmium battery.  - Playing music, a full battery is supposed to last about 14 hours. Playing video it lasts a lot less. I would estimate about 3 to 4 hours on a full charge.  - Replacing the battery currently means sending the entire iPod back to Apple and getting a new/refurbished one. See the Apple web site for details.  - I saw a review about it hanging on the language selection screen right out of the box. Ours did, too, but I just followed the instructions on resetting it. No problems since.

Video playback is much beter than I expected, but it does drain the battery more than playing music files (naturally)One suggestion--get a carry case so you'll avoid any scratchs and dents for the iPod.

<Title>Better then PSP
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the new Ipod video last week, when it was released, most likely one the few that has it.  I just have to say its great, my sister had the Ipod photo, and the video makes that look obsolete.  The best thing is watching video's on it, the screen might look small, but its not bad watching music video's, etc.  The only thing negative I would have to say is that Apple should come out with a FREE software that will transfer my DVD collections into the right format for the IPOD, they have Quicktime Pro, but I really don't want to pay for it.  But even with that one negative it still is the best ipod out yet.    Comparing it to the PSP, I would get this, the PSP does have internet access, game capabilities, movies and music.  After buying the PSP you have buy a new card, because the standard one is a joke(32MB), you can not store anything on that.  The interent and gaming is cool, but i'll ready have PS2 and a computer, and i'm not really ever going to use those when i'm on the road.  THe games cost 50 BUCKS, to much in my opinion, then for the DVD's that another 20 BUCKs, its get expensive.  To get like 2GB(max for the PSP) you have to shell $100plus.   Apple has 30GB for you to store everything, enough storage for movies and music.  But there is a lot of waste on battery when watching a video.  The battery just gets zapped.  Plus they still don't have a compatible Car adaptor that will let you play video's from the Ipod to you car stereo.

<Content>I wasn't planning on replacing my 4th generation 20GB unit, but I saw the new iPod in person and had to bring it home with me right then. Everything I love about the 4th generation unit is here and it has the beautiful new screen that feels much larger than a 2.5 in 320x240 screen.  The couple of videos I transferred to it encoded in MPEG-4 look great on the screen, but I haven't hooked it up to a TV yet. That said, it's still mainly about the music/podcasts and audiobooks for me, video is just a nice bonus.

<Title>Blown Away by 30gig Video iPod
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a first-time MP3 Player purchaser, I had no idea how the 30 gig video iPod would change my entertainment life. Suddenly, I am now able to rip all my CDs gathering dust on a shelf and play them while on beach walks or even driving to work. I suddenly became obsessed with purchasing and downloading music videos offered on Apple's iTunes Music Store for $2 and playing them back on the iPod. All my friends were impressed by the saturated colors, super-sharp detail and smooth playback. I was a devoted iTunes user, so the absolutely impeccable iPod integration allowed me to create playlists quickly and drag and drop into my iPod. I use Windows XP and no player beats iTunes for easy playlist creation and management, quick burning, fast and efficient ripping to MP3, and also playing back videos -- though it cannot play .wmv and .wma files. So, iTunes 6.0 and iPod go hand-in-hand.  I have a large archive of music videos that I have downloaded off the web. Using Quicktime 7 Pro and Premiere Pro I have converted them to the proper iPod codec and uploaded them using iTunes to my iPod -- and they play perfectly. Now, I can play my videos anytime, anywhere with no required connections and they look perfecto.  The iPod is a marvel to hold in your hand. It is as sexy as any gadget can get. The enemy of anything new is scratches, from your new car to DVDs. The iPod comes with a velvety slip-cover that allows usage of the iPod click wheel through the material. I think a hard case will be my next purchase.  The iPod ear-buds don't fit my ears, so I use Sony's MDR-Q33 headphones instead.  Battery life while watching videos is a concern. There are a lot of accessories for the iPod including an intriguing FM Transmitter so you can tune in your iPod on your radio while you drive.  I now realize the iPod with video capability is a micro-computer, with tremendous potential. Future iPods may offer internet connectivity using a broadband wireless network so you can surf the web and email. A future iPod may take digital photos video -- and even edit videos. But these are only potentials right now.

<Title>amazing little toy
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After owning the iPod Mini for over a year, my music library had far exceeded the memory limit and this beautiful little toy seemed like a reasonable upgrade. After enduring an anxious week of waiting, I finally received the G5 iPod yesterday and have had no problems whatsoever. The design is beautiful and practical. I plugged it in to my Powerbook and after pressing a button or two, my entire library of 1,700 songs was synced within 20 minutes. The screen is very nice; a tremendous upgrade from the previous generations. However, I am not fully satisfied with the resolution, as anyone (or rather, everyone) who is used to the high resolution offered in most television sets or computer monitors will notice a small, but definite difference in resolution quality. This isn't too bothersome, and I have found watching music videos and even full length movies to be very enjoyable. That being said, this iPod is a portable music player with 14 hours of battery life and simply offers the option of video playback. It would be wonderful if Apple found a way to extend the battery life to more than 2 hours on video playback, but that is unforunately not so and should not detract from the other quality features of the machine. It is commendable that Apple managed to retain the same retail price as the previous models while incoporating so many upgrades.

<Title>Ipod Video is the best out there
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my ipod video today at best buy. Downloading songs is a snap. I think having to buy videos at apple is ridiculous especially when we already bought the dvd's we want to download it on. I found a awesome website for 34.95 it is all you need to put your full dvd's on the ipod video and it only takes 40 minutes per full length dvd. Screen is very clear and bright. Not sure if it scratches as easily as nano (i returned that one for this one) because i still have the plastic, but so far it is a great investment and i look forward to using it often.

<Title>A more perfect iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think this one sentence is a pretty concise review and an effective counter to most negative reviews: THIS NEW IPOD IS THE SAME PRICE, HAS MORE BATTERY LIFE FOR MUSIC PLAYBACK, AND HAPPENS TO HAVE VIDEO PLAYBACK. Who cares if the battery life for playing videos is short? It's the same freaking price and the battery lasts longer for music. Video playback is just a bonus. There's no reason to rate it any lower than a normal iPod.  That being said, I was surprised at how good the screen is. Videos are easily watchable on it (my friend has Desperate Housewives on his and it looks great). The image is surprisingly clear. The entire unit is a bit larger to fit the bigger screen, but is also slimmer, which I prefer over the old design. All in all, Apple has done a good job in perfecting the iPod.

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iPods are very cool, they have many more features than just playing music. This one is the best choice in my opinion 30 gb can hold TONS of songs, unless you are a music adict with this baby you will be set for a while. Ipods nano look good, but they don't have much space and they don't play videos. This one is 30gb, plays video and it's worth the same price than a 8gb nano.  However something weird happened to me, I ordered a white 30gb ipod from amazon. And my surprise when I opened the box, the ipod was RED. Yes, red. In the back it said that it was colorware edition, I went into the webpage of colorware and they paint ipods and notebooks, for $100. So I feel unique with my red Ipod haha.

<Title>Perfect yet not so perfect...
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well like most people have been raving about, the iPod Video is the newest and best iPod yet. Yes, the battery life is greatly increased by 5 hours +/-, but thats playing music normally.   Most people have been exaggerating on the fact that the iPod video will only get two hours of video playback? Well remember. It's not like it's desgiend specially to play full length movies. If you do wanna watch a full length movie, just get a portable dvd player. I mean you've all got to say the iPod Video is currently the only mp3 player that can play videos. At least give Apple some credit. A while back they introduce the Nano which revolutionized small mp3 players, but now introducing the Video, Apple has surely gained the lead.  The ipod video has very good graphics, nobody can say it doesn't. It truely does.   4/5 because the graphics are awesome, it has completly changed mp3 players to mp3 players/movie players which is awesome. It is perfect in nearly every aspect. Aside from the fact it doesn't come with a dock and the battery life is WAY SHORT when watching video, it's not bad.  4/5, very good. I suggest buying it if you're not afraid of a little weak battery life during video playback.  Enjoy!  -Alex

<Title>Amazing toy, stupid casing
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first ever ipod, as well as my first ever mp3 player/portable hard drive.  It was a fortunate coincidence for me that Apple decided to release this new version the very week I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase one.  Pros: The ipod is exactly as easy to use as its reputation led me to believe.  Within 5 minutes of taking it out of the package I understood how the click wheel worked and how to navigate the menus, and I didn't even look at the instructions first.  That click wheel is an amazing design feature, probably one of the great innovations in the history of computing.  Another great feature is the screen.  I agree with other reviewers who have said that you shouldn't buy this ipod for the purpose of watching videos on it--you should consider it a music player and storage device that just happens to play videos as well.  That being said, for such a small screen this thing has remarkable resolution.  One of the first things I did was download an episode of Lost through itunes, and everyone I showed it to has been amazed at how sharp the picture is.  I wasn't sure I would want to watch anything on the ipod, but now I'm determined to use it on the bus during my commute to work.  Finally, I really appreciate that Apple gave me 30GB for the same price as the 20GB 4th gen that I almost bought.  I have 1000 songs in high quality format, podcasts, and a couple of tv shows on here, plus a backup of all my Word docs from 10 years of writing and I still have tons of room.  Cons: What were they thinking when they designed this case??  I did my research ahead of time and knew it would be the same scratchable surface as the nano, so thankfully I knew to protect it from minute one.  Even so, there are tiny parallel scratches on the glassy front surface just from sliding it in and out of the soft envelope-style holder that comes with it.  During the 5 minutes I was learning how to use the click wheel I managed to do some permanent damage with my fingernail.  Until I can finally get a skin in the next couple of weeks, NO ONE is touching the ipod but me.  It's especially ridiculous that Apple would release such a scratchable surface when we're supposed to watch things under it!  I would still recommend buying this ipod if you don't have one yet, but if you already have an earlier gen ipod and want one that plays video, I would hold off buying one until 6th gen, when hopefully Apple will offer it with a sturdier face plate.  One other comment which is neither pro nor con: when you buy this, be prepared to spend up to $200 in addition to this price of the ipod.  You should certainly spend $60 on the Apple protection plan (it just doesn't make sense to invest $300 and then not protect it for 2 years) plus $30 on a skin.  I spent $60 buying a USB 2.0 card for my laptop and $30 on a new set of earbuds (the ones that come with the ipod hurt small ears), plus another $15 for an adapter to play the ipod through my car stereo.  There are also an infinite number of adapters and accessories out there.

<Title>Best iPod yet
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got one of these a few days ago, and it is great!  I really don't care that the battery life is short for videos, because when I am going to be watching for more than 2 hours, there is always a plug of some sort (except on airplanes).  Everybody I show this to is very impressed with the quality of the screen, which has the best resolution of any other iPod.    Also, stop complaining about how the screen is too small, or the battery life is too short.  It costs the SAME AMMOUNT OF MONEY of the previous iPod with a color display but no video playback.  Even if you don't watch a single video, you are getting pratically the same music battery life, a thinner iPod, a free case, and 10GB, for the SAME PRICE.    Also, to all of you who want more video content, you can convert your own content using the Freeware Videora iPod converter ([...]).  Great program that I have used to many episodes of my favorite tv show.

<Title>Yes Scratches Galore
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is a problem with the coating.  I put my new 60gig in my dead  ipod 3G's case, since the case it comes with is unuseable.  Yes ipods do die, and they die young. Hard Drive, moveing parts, jogging, need I say more, it was my third one replaced by apple in my first year, untill my warranty ran out.  Anyway it fitted in there and I was happy for a day, then I pulled it out to show someone and would you believe scratches from the case.  I think they picked the coating for looks not durability. I have the black ipod.  The backs always scratched easily and now the front as well.  The ipod has issues but the truth is there is no good alternative.  Seems if sony had thought things out better the PSP could have done it. But for now Apple has the Stage!

<Content>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZAIMI/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_7/103-7100148-9677456?%5Fencoding=UTF8  To keep the price under $300 Apple deleted the AC adaptor that was included with previous iPODS.  You only get the USB charging cable. Remember too that not all USB ports have power on some computers.  So if you ever want to travel or don't want to keep your iPOD charging on your desk all day or in an internet cafe, you need the AC adaptor that just plugs into the wall to charge.   There may be ones that work that aren't appple brand I'm not sure...but you need one, trust me.

<Content>It makes time fly to watch a TV series while in the air or between flights. I have an inexpensive set of noise-reduction headphones I picked up at the hardware store. Place the headset over the earphones and you can hear the show without problem. The 2.5 inch screen is amazingly clear and detailed.   Two accessories I'd recommend: 1) The AC converter/charger recharges the battery without your computer. It's small and can be packed with your toothbrush, etc. 2) The AudioVideo cable lets you hook the iPod to a TV with the red/white/yellow video connectors, and, voila, you've got a screen size and sound as big as your TV.   This is a great little device.

<Title>Great iPod but really painful to import even short home Quicktime movies
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first iPod and I mostly love it.  Great form factor, beautiful screen, amazing click wheel that does exactly what you want it to, huge disc space, etc, etc, etc - all the good things you've read about.  The I-Tunes software on my PC flawlessly imported my picture and music collection, no prompts required.  Thousand of pictures were shrunken and converted all automatically, one big batch, no problems.  Same with music.  Exporting them to the iPod: also a breeze, no prompts required to automatically get all that content into the iPod.  But my videos were another matter entirely.  I was able to download videos from the Apple store, and play them on my PC and Ipod, with no trouble.  But the process of converting my home video clips (taken with digital camera) from QuickTime format (isn't that Apple already?) into the exact flavor of Mpeg-4 that the iPod requires is truly painstaking.  Literally hours of excruciatingly slow processing are required to convert each short home video clip from Apple's own QuickTime format into iPod friendly format, one at a time.  My Palm pilot with a 3rd party add-on plays those Apple Quicktime files just fine, no conversion required - why can't my Apple iPod?  It seems bizarre that Apple's hardware is so incompatible with its software.  Ideally all my Quicktime movies would be sucked up automatically in one big batch by I-Tunes and exported just as easily, as-is, to the iPod.  At the very least you'd expect a "Batch Processing" option, so that the user does not have to manually oversee the conversion of every single movie.

<Title>Great little gadget
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the iPod for my son's 18th Birthday.  He has had a series of other players (varying MP3s)over the years but really wanted to try the iPod. It is quite compact, he has watched several movies on it and the sound is amazing.  He has synced it with Outlook and uses it as his appointment book as well. He had it etched with his name to deter theft as he is in a rural high school and his iPod is the object of some envy.  Apparently it has become a status symbol amoung teens to have an iPod. He had one significant frustration with the product and that is that his library of music he has accumulated electronically over the years in MP3 format did not load seamlessly into the iPod.  It took some hours of effort to download the special software necessary to convert the music and additional time to get the software for DVD playing.  Once that time investment is done, it is an amazing little tool. I do recommend a protective cover.

<Title>Best MP3 player...ever
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Seriously, if you don't have an iPod, you need one. These things are the pinnacle of technology and fashion. The huge amount of storage space means you can put thousands of songs on it without breaking a sweat, as well as using it for storage of non-music files if you've got the space to spare. The screen is huge for an MP3 player that size, although I wouldn't recommend straining your eyes trying to watch two-hour-long movies on it. But the best thing about the 5G iPods? Games. You can get Sudoku, PAC-MAN, and so much more from iTunes, and only the 5G iPods can play them. A must for anyone who listens to music. And that means you, Mr. I'm-reading-your-review-but-I'm-still-not-sure-if-I-want-an-iPod Guy.

I really like the screen resolution and of course the design. I was even suprised to discover the few extra features, like the clocks that you can create for various times throughout the world, and the way you can navigate on your music list using the alaphabetical row of letters.  What I like most is the black version of this iPod.   This won't be my last iPod, but I'll cherish it for a while to come.

<Title>Apple scores......again
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple is a tricky, tricky company these days. The bar they set in terms of functionality have been adequately met. So Apple is not content to rest on their laurels, instead drastically increasing the cachet and sexiness of the Ipod...again. How do they do it? What levels of despair must a well-intentioned executive at Iriver who tries to point out all the technological superiorities of their device be at? Apple has also managed to do what BMW successfully does with their BMW 3-series: create a product for the masses with elite cachet. People will rush to buy these.  The rest is just details: improved battery life? Good, but that's not getting people in the stores. Video capacity? Brilliant, brilliantly timed move: proof of concept was done with podcasts in terms of content, and the message is thinking about getting a competitor's video compatible model? Don't bother. Video's a sideshow anyway, but we do it too...and sexier. Imagine you're the competitor and trying to explain, no, no, no, you don't understand, our pixel rate is X while Ipod's is Y.   Apple's Ipod campaign will be studied in business schools for years. Oh yeah, it's the best Ipod yet---but does that even matter? Give the devil his due.

<Title>Great iPod ... but too big?
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As with any piece of expensive, portable technology, this new iPod requires a hands-on test drive. You need to get a sense as to just how portable it really is, whether it's solid enough for the journey, and, in the case of the iPod with video, just how good the screen really is under various light conditions. I've only had a few moments to check it out, but I'll share my observations. (Having had my nano screen break under normal usage on the very first day I owned it, I brought to the table a real concern about fragility, by the way. Apple, thankfully, replaced the broken nano with a new one, as they have acknowledged an apparent defect with some of the screens.)  First, as you would expect, form and fit are first rate. The iPod seems to get smoother and more seamless with each generation. As with the nano, I think the scroll wheel has hit the sweet spot, too.  Second, it seems more substantial and durable than the nano. Part of that has to do with the astounding thinness of the nano. There seems to be quite a bit more screen protection inherent in this iPod/video's design (and it is, after, considerably thicker than the nano, but still thin -- the 60 GB version is as thin as the 4th generation's 20 GB model, and the 30 GB is 30% thinner than that).  Third, the screen is great. Clear, bright, and easy to read at a range of viewing angles (not that the latter is all that important for most iPods, but video changes all that ...). I must say, however, that it pales in comparison to the Sony PSP's gorgeous widescreen as a platform for watching videos. (The PSP's larger screen is a wonder, both for games and movies. Apple has obviously decided -- at least for the iPod -- to sacrifice optimal screen size for portability. More on that in a second.)  Fourth, the slightly sour note. Once you've held the nano, used it, it makes this iPod feel too wide and heavy. Wide to a point where it doesn't easily nestle in the hand. It's the screen, of course, that is responsible. This is where you'll need to pick one up, hold it, check it out. It may be awkward to put in an armband for sports, for example. I found it consmetically less attractive because of that width, but, of course, you'll need to be the judge. Videos look great on it, as do photographs and album art. It's a great platform for catching with Lost -- or Desperate Housewives. But video comes at a price, of course. (Perhaps Apple could have changed the orientation of the screen so as to keep the width in check. Maybe. I'd have preferred that, I think.)  The iPod/video is a compromise platform where, as Steve Jobs put it, video is "icing on the cake." It may be a bit too much icing for some, given the physical effects it had on design. For those folks, the nano is absolutely perfect, and rumor has it that the nano's capacity will get a jolt upward in the spring if the 2 GB or 4 GB models don't hold enough for your liking.  Another very nice product from Apple.

<Title>Best iPod To Date
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This iPod is one of a kind and I can't wait until I get my hands on one. This isn't a video player indeed but, an iPod that finally has video capabilities, come on, who doesn't want to buy that? There are two colors available for it, black and white, just like the iPod nano. People have noticed that this iPod looks a little wider than the original iPod but it's not true. The dimensions for the new iPod are 4.1" x 2.4" x .4" and the dimensions for the original iPod are 4.1" x 2.1" x .57". So if you think that it's wider it's really not, you might think that because now this iPod has a beautiful 2.5" color LCD display! Well, it's not a major improvement from the 2" screen of the color 20GB iPod but, it's still looks really nice. The resolution of the screen is 320 x 240-pixels while the 20GB iPod's was 160 x 128-pixels. Plus, this iPod is really thin compared to the original, it's about 40% thinner which is incredible especially since it's 30-gigabytes (7500 songs). It's the same price as the original iPod, $299.99, and the box includes the iPod, case, USB cable, headphones, and software/booklets. It's not great but since Apple wants us to think like it's such a great deal for a video-iPod for only $299.99! It's really not, it probably costs Apple like forty bucks to make. So, don't go thinking that it's a good deal while it's not. The old iPod (1G, 2G, 3G) included a better case, firwire AND USB cable (3G for USB), dock (3G), charger (you don't need to charge it from the USB cable from your computer), and much more. The only major improvement is the video-capabilities which, aren't perfected like a PVP's might be. Downloading movies hopefully are easier than the PSP which converting is such a hassle! I don't own it but, hopefully if I get it, it will satisfy my needs. But with it's 14 hour battery life, movies, games, music and more this iPod is looks really nice but, we don't know how it really is. But, I would definetly look into it!

<Title>Great music player, with video too!
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.  The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005.  However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus.  Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.  Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video.  The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240.  What video content can you play on your iPod?  This area is limited, at least currently.  You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod.  Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes.  They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives.  You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer.  If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod.  You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod.  Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player.  You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.  Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you?  Well, it did to me.  The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw.  However, it is not.  The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel.  The only change in dimensions is the depth.  The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it!  Yes, this 30 gig iPod is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model by 30 percent.  What does all this mean?  The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.    Capacity - This 30 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment.  With storage, for up to 7,500 songs, 12,000 photos, or 75 hours of video.   The great thing I love about my iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes.  However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer.  This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer.  See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. The 60 gig version is available, for $100 more, so if you want to use it for lots of video, or you have an enormous music collection, you may want to consider that larger version, which also sports longer battery life.  New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support.  First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously.  Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.   Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about.  This 30 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 14 hours, when playing only music.  Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster.  Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of two hours, when playing back video.  This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet.  You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0.  The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter.  Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable.  You will have to use USB 2.0.    Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC.  The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.    Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting.  Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.    Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish.  The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color.  Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car.  Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks.  You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible.  The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.    Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit.  You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port.  Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer.  The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television.  There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television.  This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.  Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.

<Title>Did Not Go Far Enough - Let's Wait and See ??
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The idea of adding video to the iPod line is an innovation I have been eagerly anticipating, yet the newest iPod did not go far enough to meet my expectations. Since this is the first video iPod, I think we all know that even more advanced features will be coming along soon such as bigger screens and options to download purchased DVD's to the iPod player, much like music CD's. The iPod is the best MP3 music player on the market, and the video iPod is a decent start in the right direction, but its selections for video downloads are so limited that my choice is to wait and see what else is to come. For the moment I cannot see investing more money into a fourth iPod until better video features are incorporated into the series.

<Content>This iPod is definately the best mp3 player on the market as of now, but has Apple fixed all the errors, or is this going to be a repeat of the Nano with lawsuits and faulty players?  I think that this machine is amazing, but I would definately wait it out a few weeks before buying to see what the general population thinks.  As for me, I can only wonder what Apple has next.  An iPod that takes pictures and video?  We can only imagine.

<Title>Same Dog, New Trick
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple surely has done it again. They've released the "same" product with a new feature, that's all. I had a feeling a video iPod was on the way when I noticed that my video files showed up in iTunes. I waited in anticipation for it to be released but Apple dropped the ball on this one. The 2.5" screen isn't as bad as you may expect; it's watchable. The price point is very appealing compared to other players with video playback. A lot of storage for not as much money. The iPod Photo was basically a joke and this is a good replacement.  How did they drop the ball? We've seen this design before (for the past 4 years). Sticking with what works is great, but not when you're adding video playback. What made a good (but over hyped) music player doesn't make a good video player. Though the 2.5" screen is watchable, it does affect the eyes after a while. Two hour battery life for video playback is abysmal. Knowing the iPod, you will be lucky if you get 1 and 1/2 hours. Maybe that is why they are promoting the playing of music videos more than anything else (in addition to buying the music videos from iTunes). Still no FM. Still no removable battery. And no video recording capabilities. And at $1.99 for a music video, they could at least throw in a copy of the song by itself. I don't want to waste battery life if I just want to hear the song and not watch the video (and not having to pay an additional $.99 for the song).  For video playback there are better players out there from Archos and Creative. Popular doesn't always mean better. The iPod is popular, but it's not the best. If this was the very first iPod or even the second, the rating would be higher, but this is the 5th generation and it's the "same" iPod; but with video and a laughable video playback battery life.

<Title>The Best iPod Ever

<Content>I was hesitant at first to buy it because i did no know if it would be worth it. Is it ever. Not only does it play music beatifully but it also holds pictures and video. The video part is absoulutley amazing. The colors are brillant and the clarity is amazing. I have all the episodes of Lost on it and it looks better on the iPod then on my tv, and al the music videos are fun to watch. The only downside is that watching the vidoes drains the battery quickly so i would suggest getting a battery adapter to give it extra power. But in the end it is well worth the $300 for the 30 GB one.

I will not use it for videos and photos - just music at the gym and while travelling.  The nano's size is very appealing, but am worried that 4 GB may not be sufficient.  Do you think the extra weight and dimensions of the video is worth it for my anticipated use - or will 4 GB suffice?  Thanks.

<Title>So close to perfect!

<Content>Ok. You all know the jist of this new ipod: it plays music, videos, and displays pictures all done in full color with style! The other reviewers on this page certainly have a knack for telling you the rundown of what this mp3 player can do. I have myself owned 3 ipods (including this one) in the last 7 months. Why? We'll get to that in a second.  Anyway, if you were thinking about getting an mp3 player but you dont want to buy this one because  a) ill never fill the damn thing!  b) its just too expensive and  c) everyone's got one and I dont want to look like everyone else  well i have a few reasons why you should. To counter my last statements chronologically:  1) you need room for expansion and your ever-changing tastes not to mention the "leave me by the side of the road" trends of technology. In other words, you cant predict the future.  2) dont be cheap. seriously, good technology (like this) comes at a price and you may spend less for another player but you certainly WILL get less. To summarize, just open a bank account and save! its what they're for. And finally 3) Come on! you know as well as I thats a stupid reason not to get one of these. Give me an excuse that "the sound quality is just not good enough" or "ill never use it" and Ill accept that. Dont say you dont want to get it just to fight the undertow of popular culture. In short, there's a reason why everyone's got one of these just like there's a reason everyone's got a honda; it just flat does what its supposed to.  Now, some of you might not like some of what I'm about to say next. Thats fine. Keep in mind that this is my opinion and you know as well as I if you were thinking about getting one of these (or not) you will do what you want no matter how many bad or good things I say about it.   Now that that's out of the way, on to my review.  To summarize bluntly, this is the best ipod ever made in every single way including sound quality. You may have liked your old ipod but by god this one is like comparing a ford escort to a lexus ls430; its just better and beefier in every single way.  Well, I have to say that the photo aspect of the video is just like a regular ol' photo. It displays pictures. whoopty doo. unless your a major photophile, this aspect probably wont intersest you enough to buy it just for this feature.  The video aspect is certainly a refreshing and sort of strange addition to this new device. I say its strange because if you think about it, by definition an mp3 player is designed to play music and only music. The addition of video turns this device into something else which doesnt really have a name yet. Maybe we can call it "multimedia device" for now and leave it at that. The screen is really still too small for this sort of feature, even considering this is the largest ipod screen ever. The screen is plenty crisp by the way and displays videos nicely.   For music this is probably the best mp3 ever made up til now: It's got plenty of room, its small (but not too small), the sound quality is superb and is free from distortion in the high frequencies (which is why I abandoned my old ipod photo 60GB. the distortion is inherent in all photo ipods), and its compatible with most computers out there.  Now that Ive basically turned the ipod into the holy grail, its not without flaws.   The video aspect is great but unfortunately if you want to watch videos in good quality, you must watch it in "widscreen" which further reduces the viewing area. You can turn off the widescreen but it severely cuts off the sides of the picture and degrades quality. Annoying, but this feature can be fixed with future updates and a standardization of resolution for videos played on the ipod. And also, the battery life for watching videos really just bites. You get 2-3 hours. Part of this has to do with the huge size of some videos and also the fact that the backlight stays on when watching videos. Again, some standardizing will help this. In addition, you can watch ANY video on your ipod, but you must convert it to a format that the player can understand. You can do this with quicktime pro, but it takes FOREVER. I'm sure there are other ways to do it which dont cost any money, but i have QTP so I didnt look into this.  Music is played back with refreshing clarity and crispness that has been lacking in all ipods up to this point. Even if you arent an audiophile, you will hear the difference. Unfortunately, with these new ipods, apple has decided that everyone has usb 2.0 on their computers and has abandoned firewire. Most people who buy ipods are windows users, but I'm a mac user and the lack of firewire basically kills this purchase for me. Most people wont care, but for those who do, be warned.   Finally, to explain why this is my 3rd ipod purchase: crappy sound quality, and I dont mean from compression artifacts. All and I mean all photo ipods have a distortion which can be heard on music which is abundant in high frequencies and has plenty of audio "space," like a piano solo. Check out my review of the 60 GB ipod to get more details. Fortunately, the video does not have this problem.   So, there you have it. This is a great player in every way. All the flaws that the player has with playing video can be fixed with a software update which will come once more people have the player. The battery life is VERY good with the exception of playing videos, and the SQ for music is the best of any mp3 player Ive ever heard. Once more standardization comes along, we will all be watching episodes of "smallville" on the metro ride to work. I give this player 4 and 1/2 stars for the lack of firewire because that is an important feature which I think should have been included.

<Title>Good audio and video player. Edited review to add a few comments.
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my new (Black) 30 GB iPod a week ago. Looks great. Nice and small, light, and durable. I can see why people complain about scratches on the iPod, but that is the reason why they all come now with a nice cloth case. I keep mine in the case, when I need to put it in my pocket, and in the last week at least, have no scratches on the iPod (knock on wood).  This is my second iPod, and third apple audio player. I had a 2nd Generation iPod (10 GB), that had a Harddrive failure after a few years of heavy usuage. Not a big deal, I got a hell of a lot of use out of it, so i figure it was well worth the money.   I had a 1 GB iShuffle, that someone gave me to replace my broken iPod. But I hated not having a screen, not knowing what I was going to hear next. Not having control over what I heard and when. So when I saw the new Video iPod, I immediately placed an order.  I have to say, the new iPod made my old 2nd Gen one seem like a heavy brick compared. The color display is nice and crisp. The audio sounds really good. I have put my collection of Tick (animated series) videos on it, and watch them daily on my commute to work comfortably.   My only complaint would be how much of a pain it is to properly format videos for use on the video iPod. A lot of the videos I have formated, don't have sound. Most do, some don't. Very annoying. I wish they supported more video file formats, so you don't have to reformat your video collection.  Otherwise I am very happy with it, and would easily recommend it.  **New comments from edit. I was emailed by someone, with a few questions, and I wanted to answer them here. So everyone can see the answers, and hopefully answer a few questions people might have.  "i am in the market for a media player with video capability. do you recomend the ipod video for heavy video use? and what does it take to get your video to work properly on the device?"  I would not recommend the iPod for heavy video use, unless you would be comfortable with the small screen. You will get excellant clarity, and picture with the iPod, but for heavy use, I know for me it gives me a headache to watch for longer then an hour. Plus the battery life for the video is only 2-3 hours depending on the model (30 or 60 GB).  To get video to work propery on your iPod, it needs to be encoded as either an MPEG4 or H.262 file. I use Quicktime Pro to convert the video to play on the iPod. You can use any video conversion program, that supports MPEG4 or H.262.

<Title>Just bought, anxiously awaiting!!
<Date>Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought one of the white 30g IPOD Videos.  I had the silver mini 4gb, and decided to upgrade.  Loved the mini, but hated the fact I filled it with music and then whenever I wanted to add more songs, had to figure out what to keep or remove.  Anyways, Im wondering if any owners of the new 5G ipod have found a good reliable and protective case for the new IPOD yet?  I've read alot of reviews detailing the "Scratch factor" of the screen..also read one tip from someone who says they are using a Sony PSP screen protector, apparently it covers the entire face for the IPOD 5G?  Any suggestions?  (I figure its good to find a solution to the scratch problem instead of buying one and griping about it, its all about taking care of the "toy")

<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a lover of all things Apple, I want to give the iPod video 5 stars. I purchased this item a week ago today, and have one very minor scratch on the screen. The scratch appeared about 4 days after my purchase. Scratches are normal considering how much an item like this gets used, but I was extremely careful and still got a scratch. Very disappointing. I still have a first generation iPod and it looks great to this day! Aside from the scratch factor, this is a fabulous product. The video images look crystal clear, the sound is super, and browsing through photos is a snap! Plus, the price is reasonable for all this player can do. My advice is to immediately purchase some form of screen protector. An Apple customer service rep advised me to purchase a PDA screen protector and cut it to fit my iPod...much cheaper than the Apple brand ones. Don't be afriad to purchase this item, just take the appropriate measures to ensure that it stays in great condition.

<Title>Great - Using it for 2 weeks 
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my fair share of MP3 players - and this is the 3rd Ipod I've owned. I ordered it the day it was released and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the black one. As far as MP3 players are concerned they play music - and the quality of the music depends very much on your music files. The reason I've preferred the Ipod over the Archos, Rio and Iriver (all 3 of which I have owned at various points) is the sheer ease of use. It looks cool and is a fashion statement - but how did it become an Icon? It is a solid product. As far as the video is concerned - I downloaded the King Kong trailer from the Apple website - and it doesn't look bad. It's not awe-inspiring video - but it isn't too shabby. It's important that the buyer looks at it as a music player which plays video rather than the other way around. The reason I took off one star is that despite being a great product the sheer cheapness and cheekiness of Apple annoys me - It costs them less 5$ to ship the iPod with a travel adapter - do they honestly expect me to pay $30 for one - I luckily have previous adapters which work fine - but this was an annoyance. Secondly, while Apple's website says that this one ships with a case - the case they shipped is downright laughable. From what I read it was a last minute addition because of complains of scratches on the black ipod nanos - but honestly - if you are going to ship me a case ship something usable. I use a case from the third-generation Ipod - which does the job.    However, none of this should take away from the joy of using the Ipod. It's a great product - go buy it.

<Title>Wonderful product -- almost perfect
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've never owned an iPod (or any mp3 player) before this new 30gig model, though I have plenty of mp3s that I carry on CDs to and from my workplace. I was fortunate enough to win this iPod from a local television call-in contest.  I'll not spend time restating the adulations of previous reviewers. Suffice it to say that this is a very exciting and beautiful product.  I only have one complaint about this product, and that is its extreme ability to get scratched very easily. You know how you'll get a new CD and play it a couple of times, then you'll look at the underside of the CD and wonder how all of those micro-abrasions got there? Same thing with this iPod. I swear, the thing must end up scratching itself. With as much as I've babied it, it's got a lot of small scratches that have mysteriously appeared out of no where. My local electronics stores don't yet have any cases for this new 5G iPod, so I'm going to go out and buy a case for the 4G model, and put a sheet of foam in the back of it to properly hold this thinner model.  Just to clarify something that has been mis-reported or under-reported over the past few weeks: You CAN rip your DVDs onto your computer, and load them into your iPod. You can also take any format of video (mpeg, avi, wmv, mov, etc...) and convert it for use on the iPod. You need a couple of third-pary freeware utilities to do these things, but the utilities are easily found and simple to use. So the rule of thumb is "if you can play a video on your computer, you can play it on your iPod." The video quality is amazing, and you can even cable the video out to a standard television (with an optional accessory cable) and watch your iPod videos with acceptable quality (roughly equivalent quality to VHS once it's blown up to a larger size.) I copied Army of Darkness onto my iPod, and it took a bit more than 500 megs. So if you were to only put movies onto the 30 gig device, it would be able to hold roughly 50 to 60 full length motion pictures. Be advised, however, that the power needed to decode the video stream and keep the backlighting on is very high. On a full charge, you'll be able to watch a movie, but you'll likely need to plug it in soon after that.

<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This has been one of the most useful purchases of my life, I think. As such, I think it is well worth the price. If you are a music lover, and especially if you enjoy many different styles of music, you MUST buy this for yourself (or, even better, get someone to buy it for you)!  I tried one other mp3 player previously (Rio "bad" Karma), with unhappy results (bad hardware), before caving in and springing for the higher rated, and more expensive, iPod (excellent hardware). Now I've upgraded to the newer video iPod. I am in my "happy place"! I even take it to work. And at home it hooks up seamlessly with my home theater system, using a docking station, which also charges it back up.  I finally sprang for a better set of headphones, namely the Shure E3c Sound Isolating Earphones. I HIGHLY recommend them. I really love the sound they give out; and since they come with several earbuds, you are bound to find one that fits your ear just right. Comfort and exquisite sound! Couldn't ask for more! For extra noise cancelling I like the triple flange ear buds you can get for the Shure earphones (useful in noisy surroundings, like on planes etc.).

<Title>it works.
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i am a first time owner of an iPod and I got in when the week they announced the newest model. I had long been looking for a digital music player that was extremely compact with no moving parts.  Since most of my music is on vinyl and I continue to buy new and used records, I needed a device that had a line in so I could go quickly from my mixer to the portable. Like a dummy, I bought a Sony MD player. It sucked so bad. The audio was poor and had no more play time than a CD. I sat out of the game for 2 years and jumped into the 30gig iPod w/video. I decided to get in because of the cheap recording/editing software Final Vinyl that allows for recording from analogue sources into the computer as an AIFF file. Brand new vinyl or well kept older records sound pristine in the iPod. I'm using a Technics 1200 turntable w/an M44 needle so that adds value as well.  As a music player it meets all of my needs. The design and interface are modest and unpretentious for a machine with its features.  For a man of 35yrs old though, I don't have time to mess with the video as much as I would like to.  I'll never have time to compress or watch a full length movie.  But what I have been testing with much success is compressing music videos I tivo'd and tranferred them to the iPod just for the novelty.   I compressed 93 'til Infinity by Souls of Mischief.  If you know this vid, it has great composition, movement, color and perfomances. I looked extremely good on the screen. Minimal artifacts and the colors and motion held up flawlessly.  I would say to those considering to buy, if you're a tech head, video and audiophile-GET IT.  ps-When capturing video from a DV tape via firewire into quicktime pro, after you are done capturing the video(use native video capture to get 30fps) watch clip in full because if the computer drops a frame-which happened to me after I captured a long clips that took all day to compress-it will throw the clip out of sync and it will be off never to return to sync.  enjoy its a well made machine

<Title>Great except for scratches which can ruin it
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing is great for music and video. It does all it says. However, it does scratch like crazy. This will be a problem when the video window gets too scratched to be viewed well. I bought this for the video, so to me it is not something I can rate highly. Apple needs to put a little money into a better plastic face for this thing and then it would be just about perfect. As it stands, it is not acceptable. Go see one of these on display in a store and compare it to cheaper units. They are not going to be scratched, but this is. Try it yourself before you buy. I would wait until Apple fixes this before you buy. They have a class action against them for the Nano and it's cheap cover. They should have used better materials in this product. Obviously they have decided they can get away with this shoddy material. I think there will be another class action for this. Don't think Apple will try to get away with ignoring a problem and then be forced to fix it after a lawsuit? How about the battery issues they are having to own up to on previous iPods. They knew they were wrong and they tried to fight it, now they are having to replace/ pay for batteries.  If you have to buy this now, DON'T use it until you have a protective cover. So far you won't find a cover that fits the video version in most stores. I'm buying a $25 invisible shield for mine from an online vendor. Apple should have built it better, charged $25 more and made this product a catch instead of a scratch.

<Title>I wish someone told me THIS:
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned this iPod for a month now... These are the bad things you want to know about:  Your digital "home videos" cannot be loaded onto your iPod until you shell out an extra $30 to Quicktime for a pass-code to upgrade to Quicktime 7 Pro. For videos to play on your iPod, you have to format them into "special" iPod files (this is totally `the quick and dirty', there are ways around this but...) and it has to be done in Quicktime Pro. The software included w/the iPod is only the basic Quicktime (have fun reading THOSE reviews!). Then be careful, don't EVER upgrade your Quicktime unless you want to spend $30 more to get the semi-annual "Pro" upgrades. This iPod also does not come with a charger.   I give it 5 stars anyway because all the other upgrades redeem the misleading video capabilities. I got it to replace my 20Gb 4th G. It is definitely worth the purchase because (vs the 4th G) you get 10 extra gigs, a bigger screen, color display, and photo viewing capabilities. And when you do upgrade to Pro, the video looks great and the $30 feels worth it. Just wish I would have been warned about these inconvenient little surprises. So now you know!

If u want to now more and pointers why you should buy or not here:  THE GOOD: nice ,very nice size           it goes anywhere            up to 4 hours of music and video           it plays videos and music            1,500 of videos and music(put toghether)           very skinny            its made by apple(one of the best hardwere designers)            handleing             ok and then theres the price its about 300-500 dollars but its a bad price because its very delicate(unless you get a warranty) but in other its good .its worth the price except you have to be careful with it

<Title>MIXED FEELINGS
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the 30G ipod video.  Do not carry your ipod in the case that it comes with.  The case collects dust inside and scratches the screen.   Your better off putting the ipod in your pocket with your keys.  I would suggest buying a screen protector as soon as possible.  As of now (14nov05) no one is shipping any cases or screen protectors for the 30G or 60G.  And for the battery life.  If you skip songs or use the backlight, the battery life is around 4 hours.  On the other hand the video quality is excellent.   If you're a mac user you can use imovie to convert home videos or movies to .mov (itunes format) The compression process is very time consuming.  I would guess about 10 to 15 min. for every min. of video.  Some videos do not transfer the sound.   If you're willing to pay for music itunes has a good selection of music videos for around $2.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We bought the 30 GB version and we love it. - The screen is small but clear and sharp. Go to an Apple store and see it first to make sure you're cool with it. - The audio is excellent. - It is very stylish. The 30 GB version is thin and convenient and holds a lot. - It is very easy to use. iTunes is a breeze to use (we have a PC). - Chinese characters show up just fine in the iPod text. - We bought QuickTime Pro ($30) because it was the most convenient software I found for converting video to the iPod format. Videora Converter is free and useful for getting video into the H264 format, but I found I needed QuickTime Pro to get it to the final correct iPod format. The final conversion is very, very slow. - It comes with a reasonable case, but I'm hoping for an after-market case to hold it and the headphones. Ideally there would be one that would protect the screen and let you view it clearly. In general, we're just very careful. - It comes with a cable to hook to USB 2.0. Early USB version apparently may not supply enough power to recharge the iPod. - The Lithium Ion battery charges up to 80% really quickly (less than 3 hours from dead zero), and then trickle charges to 100%. The battery may be recharged at any time w/o risk of "memory" like a Nickel Cadmium battery. - Playing music, a full battery is supposed to last about 14 hours. Playing video it lasts a lot less. I would estimate about 3 to 4 hours on a full charge. - Replacing the battery currently means sending the entire iPod back to Apple and getting a new/refurbished one. See the Apple web site for details. - I saw a review about it hanging on the language selection screen right out of the box. Ours did, too, but I just followed the instructions on resetting it. No problems since.

Before, I always carry my cd player and bunch of compact disc on my backpack but now I'm so glad that I had this i-Pod. Now, I could take all my favorite songs with me in just one device. Also all my favorite movies, and music videos. Yeah! I really love the this Apple 30 GB i-Pod w/ video playback. Each of my four friends bought one also after trying to listen to my musics and watching my videos and movies in it. I enjoy playing games with also. It's just amazing!

<Content>Using every singel function of this little wonder makes my life easier. I`m not only listing to musik I also use it in combination with outlook to update my scheduel and have it handy when ever I need to and so I also have all my contacts with me even if I forgot my cell! I can say I`m more than satisfied with my iPod, the 30 gb space is enought for me to have all my musik with me where ever I go, the only bad thing is the way to charge the thing only on the computer, I`m still thinking if I should buy an additional USb charger which I can use on an ordinary outlet! Enjoy your time with it! The 14 hours of work are more a fairytell then reality but still with at least 8 hours of pure music joy (with zepping around the librarys) are enough for a flight from NY to Germany so why complaining?

<Content>I bought the 30GB ipod for my son. It's sleek and I felt it was a great buy. I saved over 70.00 buying this ipod online then what I would have paid with Walmart and other competitors.  The ipod works wonderfully and so far we have had no problems with this product. I would strongly recomment this product. I would sugguest buying a ipod case because the face and ipod shell can become scratched easily and once you have a scratch its there and lets face it if you are going to put alot of money into something you want it to be protected as much as possible. Note: I also bought my son's ipod case from amazon also and it works wonderful and friend of his wants one just like it.

Its very thin and the music and video quality is excellent, battery life is good, however, if you use accesories, like an FM Transmitter (Iluv) or others it can drain pretty quick. Also the metallic back part scratches really easy, mine scratched only by grabbing it from a table! Of course, with a proper skin, thats not a problem!

<Title>Fit for anyone who can't live without their MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a person who can't get to sleep without listening to some music first.  CD players eat up too many batteries, so I was happy when my boss presented me with an iPod nano last year (he received one of many as a free gift for watching demos).  I loved being able to listen to the 2GB of whatever music I wanted on it, but I told my sister now that the Video iPod was out I would only shell out the great expense of money on it if something happened to the Nano.  Well something did and I bit the bullet to buy the Video player from Amazon.  I'm now a thrilled owner and absolutely love it.  I can now fit more music than I know what to do with on it, which is great because now I don't always have to erase some songs off my iPod in order to fit new stuff on it like I did with my Nano.  I've also got to say that the Video quality on the device is excellent.  I can now watch all the Japanese music videos I enjoy on the go and iTunes does offer free TV show clips from time-to-time (my favorite currently being "Guy Love" from the musical episode of the comedy "Scrubs").  Watching videos does take a lot more out of the battery faster than listening to music but luckily the device can be recharged through the computer USB cord or adapter (sold separately) anytime.  I think this a good investment device for those who listen to music all the time like me.

Install iTunes and just insert your favorite CD and the software copies the music to your iTunes library and then sync's to your Ipod -- this is a very simple process.

<Content>I got this IPod for a graduation gift with engraving on the back, and would have loved it had it worked! The first one I received turned out to be defective, and would not turn on or charge. Apple replaced this one at no charge, but it took over 2 weeks for me to get the replacement (apparently due to the engraving on it). It was certainly frustrating to wait so long for them to fix something that was completely their fault. However, I have my new one now and love it. I use it in my car through the car stereo, and is great for my long drive to work. I love being able to download podcasts and load them onto it, and being able to put photos on it is a very nice bonus. It's like having a photo album that you can carry around without the bulk! The screen isn't huge, but the picture and video quality are superb. I do not watch full length videos on it (the screen is too small, and would give me a headache), but still, it is excellent quality. Ipods are still expensive, but worth every penny in my book. I use mine every day.

<Title>NOT overhyped, it's worth it!
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, so I was originally like all you other skeptics out there when I heard about the release of the 5th generation ipod with video. My reaction, what's the big deal? Nevertheless, I asked for an ipod 2 Christmases ago so I could try it out. The result? It was like any other new toy - I played with it for a week, then threw it aside and found little interest in it.  HOWEVER, I have recently come back to my ipod after a long hiatus and I must say, I absolutely love it (God only knows why I didn't love it when I first got it). It's a ridiculously small price you're paying for such a great product. No more carrying all your CD's around in those gawky cases. The 30gb lets you have 7,500 songs all in one little tiny device. What's NOT to love about that? Plus, in between classes, on long car rides, or especially at the gym, it's great use.  PLUS, I haven't tried uploading videos but I have uploaded photos recently and I must say, the ipod's photo quality is EXCELLENT and crystal clear. Contrary to what I've heard, loading photos on your ipod does NOT take up a lot of memory at all. I've loaded a couple dozen on there so far and my memory meter has barely dropped.  On top of that, it's loaded with some great games, a calendar, and you can synch all your contacts in the ipod, too (among other great features). For those people who complain it's not worth their money, I'm assuming they haven't yet discovered all the great features ipod has to offer.   My advice: buy this product! It's fabulous, especially if you're a music junkie like me who loves all her music in one tiny, sexy little device!

But uploading it is a little complex. like once uploaded from a location if you change its library to some other location and you dont have all those songs (that are present in your iPod) in your library then all the songs are going to for a six.  But other than that the sound quality is great, clarity on the video is great...  On the whole my husband loves it...

<Content>I'm old school so it took me a long time to get used to the idea of an mp3 type music player.  I bought the 30 Gig iPod Video back in April.  I am nothing but pleased with it.  Holds all my music, photos and some videos.  I use my iPod for all my music requirements now.  My only real complaint is the iTunes program required to get your music on the iPod.  The iTunes is a touchy progam at times and until you learn how to use it well it is a real pain.  Once you get the music on your iPod though, it's all good.  I would recomend to anyone considering buying one of these to go for it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

<Content>I was waiting until I use this product for a while, it's been 6 months and now I can write a review for it. This device is like a dream come true. I can't tell how much I love it and how much it helps me everyday. I can keep must of my favourite pictures on the road with me, I can connect it to my car audio without missing any sound, and can do bicycle in the mornings with its headphones (although the ears begin to hurt after 20 minutes I would recommend buying a better headphones), I can copy files from my office and use them at home (iPod works great as a RAM HD).  Pros: 1. Great size and weight for the value 2. The memory is good enough for any mortal, if not please go for the 60 or 80 Gb model 3. The navigation is very easy and you can access anything in a few seconds 4. Personal pictures can be copied at high resolution and watch them anywhere you like, even connected to a TV 5. Music management is cool and FAST. Apple has done a great job here with the iPod and iTunes. I have over 25,000 music files and I cannot imagine use them with any other software. 6. The HD feature works great.  Cons: 1. It would be better to pay a little bit more for the iPod and get at least the basic accesories such as a good headphones and cables to connect the iPod to the TV. 2. The calendar and contacts need to be improved. The idea is good but honestly I never use them although I would love to have a more interactive calendar. 3. The EQ feature sucks. I never use it instead of getting better sound it really makes everything noisy. Apple should consider to disable this one for the next OS version. 4. The video quality needs to improve as well. The speed of access needs to be a LOT faster. This feature I never use it.  This is the best device of its kind. It is not a coincidence the money and popularity that Apple has earned with iPod related products. I don't think that anything in the market can come close to iPod but still iPod lover's like myselft would thank some improvements like I did mention before.

<Title>Nice and convenient but crashed after two days
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod crashed, and then it also infected my computer with some type of virus or conflictual software. Then my computer crashed so I had to restore it entirely (with hp unable to ship me a restoration cd for my media center for over a month) and reload all the software additions and updates that I had installed on it for over a year. Overall, looks like a great device, but for me was just a terrible experience. I ended up returning it and getting a refund. Amazon customer service is the one perfect thing in online buying...

<Title>Couldn't be better.

<Content>The only thing I could want is 60GB instead of 30GB!  What can I say?  The iTunes software is so inuitive and enabling, the iPod itself is a beautiful piece of art, it plays video astonishingly clearly and the fidelity for music playback is stunning.  My wife and I used it on a flight to Europe and we watched a movie and listened to music, and it could have had longer battery life- we watched the movie and had 3 hrs of music before it died.

<Title>iPod is the standard.

<Content>This is the second iPod I've owned and am very pleased with it.  It's beautiful to look at, has great sound, and has intuitive controls.  Nothing else comes close to it's quality, beauty, ease of use, and fun.  Movies look great.  Music sounds great.  I can't say enough good things about this little gadget.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It works great, very easy to download music to it once you learn to manage and classify it with the Itunes,easy to do too, took all of 3 minutes to do it. Battery life is not excellent, especially when I use in my car with the I Trip or to play back videos but hte image quality makes it worth carrying around the cable to recharge it.

<Title>Great, but not perfect

<Content>The first mp3 player I ever owned was a Diamond Rio, which I got as a gift in 1998/1999. At best, I could hold about 7 songs on its 32MB RAM chip. What allured me to purchase the iPod was the capacity and the size. I personally prefer my audio players to have a little bulk and the 5th gen iPods are not much bigger than my original Rio. Plus, let's face it, the unit is sexy looking! My biggest complaint is that I didn't get the 80gb version, as a typically large music collection renders the video capabilities practically unusable (I was expecting I could throw a couple 30 minute TV shows and maybe a movie or 2 along with almost my entire music collection -- but after including album art and not wanting to part with too much music, I'm left with very little memory left ~ 3gb, which isn't very much when you want to store full-length videos).  As for function, I've been impressed with the battery life. I mostly use my player as a portable drive connecting my music to my work pc and listening through iTunes (which keeps the battery charged). However, when its not connected, the battery last a reasonably long time. Additionally, since there is a hard drive inside the unit (at least I believe there is, because I can hear stuff moving that sounds like a hard drive), I've been very pleased with the playback -- constant movement (such as running or a bumpy commute) has never interrupted my listening.  The only drawback that I see with the iPod (and iTunes for that matter) is the method to index your music collection. It is not convenient to find songs without an album. Your 2 options are either navigating to the artist and selecting All, which gives you a list of *all* the songs for the artist -- meaning you need to navigate past the X songs that are associated to an album already before you get to the rest. The other option is to navigate through *all* the songs on the iPod -- which if you have 6,000 songs is not fun. Yes, there is a nice feature when you're 'wheeling' through lists that will skip from letter to letter, but you need to get some good speed going with your finger in order for the feature to invoke and then you need to be quick to stop and/or back up, because it seems inevitable that you'll spin past your destination. In my particular case, I'd love to be able to define the structure, as I have in maintaining my collection on my computer. This is also an issue I find I have with iTunes, though the search function available makes it less a pain. Also, I would prefer to have a clickable button to turn on shuffle and repeat, rather than a setting buried in the settings menu. I am not very fond of having to navigate in and out of menus to change settings.
