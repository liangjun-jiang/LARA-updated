<Title>Good for the money, but,,,

<Content>The gadget itself is pretty impressive. One-thumb controls allow you to change volume and songs in a breeze. A digital FM tuner and an autosearch function along with the ability to save stations makes the radio a real luxury. Play modes include no repeat, one, all, random all, dir repeat, dir all repeat, dir random all and intro. The LCD display has seven selectable colors and even a set to where the color will change with every key press.  One reviewer wrote that the mp3 player doesn't contenue where you left off when you turn it off. It does! In fact, it brings you down to the same second that the mp3 player was turned off. The equilizer allows you to add a little pop, rock, classic, jazz and bass to your music. Although I never used the recorder much, it works well espcecially because you can set up the quality of the recordings. The sound quality of the player is pretty good because the instruments have a solid and supreme tone. For the most part, this mp3 player performs like one twice its cost.  But there are a few bad things about this mp3 player. First of all, the battery life of the mp3 player is supposably fifth-teen hours. But a regular alkaline battery only seems to last for maybe five hours then it's dead. It says in the manuel on page 15 that the player can also be powered over the USB bus when connected to your computer, but I'm not sure that means you can charge it up with the computer or if you can just play it on there. And the SD memory card slot is a controversy. My last mp3 player was the RCA Lyra and the memory card and the internal memory was included in the same playlist. That was pretty cool especially because at random mode there is a large different amount of songs you could hear. With this mp3 player, the memory card and the internal memory are seperate collections. That sucks. Especially if your like me and you have roughly enough songs to cover one GB of memory.   Overall, the mp3 player is a nice choice for the money. But there is room for improvement.

<Content>Holds a ton of music, battery lasts a very long time, hooks up easily to any AUX port or RCA plugs on any radio. The built in FM tuner and expandability via SD card is unmatched. I bought one of these for each of my employees (13) this Christmas and every one of them love it.

<Content>Best gift I've bought myself in years. Now I'll never go back to cds. Extremly lightweight, I can carry it with me anywhere. Great product for the money,would recommend to someone new to mp3s like I am. Very easy to load,I put almost 200 songs on mine in an hour. I also put an sd card in no problem.The only complant I have is I can't figure out how to set it to resume.

<Title>Very disappointed

<Content>We ordered this as a Christmas gift for our son. Thankfully we opened it so we could load music on it so he could use it right away. When we tried to load music, it would get stuck after every song. We would have to power it off and then try again. After 2 hours of trying we gave up and requested a refund!
