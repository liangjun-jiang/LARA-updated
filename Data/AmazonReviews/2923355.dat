<Title>Overpriced

<Content>Being a fan of swiss army products and mp3 gadgets I wanted to check this one out. I buy most of my items here at amazon but this one was an exception.  I bought this at a shop near my home(in Chicago) for 215$. I dont know why amazon is selling it for 259$ !!! The mp3 player works fine ...  fell down a couple of times ...still works fine ...  the battery charge retaining time could be better ... jus comes for 7 to 8 hours.  The FM Radio option is a kewl option ... goes one up against ipods and other mp3 players ... The multiple file format support feature comes handy.  The knife and scissors are of standard swiss army quality but just a couple of them makes one feel handicapped after using the regular swiss army knife.  Could be a nice 'techy' gift to someone you like.

<Title>I was hoping to give this product a better review

<Content>I was hoping to give this product a better review because it had all the features I was looking for in a music player...an FM radio for me to listen to while I walk through Central Park to work every morning, multi format support for my music files, voice recording, radio recording, cross platform capability (or so I thought)...all this in one tiny package.  However, I had to return this product twice because both times the player completely died out on me.    I had each player for around 2 weeks, starting in late December.  The first player could not be used out of the box immediately.  I had to update its firmware, which I found was impossible to do on my Mac, since the only updater found online for it is an .exe .  After updating it on my bf's computer, it was smooth sailing until a week later when the screen died out on me while I was walking to work.  (My theory is that it was caused by the static electricity in the wintry air, and the fact that the outer casing is metal.) The player still worked, the only problem was that I could not see what I was navigating through.  I returned that one in hopes that it was just a fluke.    My second player was more hopeful in the way that I did not have to update it to get it to work.  However, it too died out about 2 weeks later as I was using it outdoors.  I could not even reboot it.    One other nuisance that I discovered that I did not pick up from reading the description online is that the headphone jack on the player itself is not the standard size, so you cannot use your own headphones unless you plug in the extra accessory that comes with the package.  This adds for more wires to mess around with, which became a nuisance after a while.

<Title>Insanely overpriced

<Content>1 Gb mp3 players sell for $20-$80 depending on features and quality of construction. The current price for this is over $200. Look elsewhere, this is beyond a ripoff: it's nuts.
