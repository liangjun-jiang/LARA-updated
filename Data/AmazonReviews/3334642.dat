<Product Name>RCA TH1102 Pearl Series 2 GB MP3 Player
<Title>Great with a few exceptions....
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro: This compact MP3 player with voice recording is a great and inexpensive alternative to certain I-'s! It connects to the computer and comes up as a thumb drive for easy drag and drop song insertion. No complicated software to learn (or be tied to).  Con: Doesn't come with a belt clip or a case, battery is inside a hump which give the case a bulky look. Should use rechargeable coin style batteries. The unit could be a little bigger with bigger easier to press buttons. For those of us with fat fingers!

<Title>Fantastic sound and ease of use combined
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've tried a lot of MP3 players.  This is much better than the rest.    The RCA Pearl is super easy to use.  It can make 96kb MP3, or even 48kb WMA (and everything larger too), sound like CD quality.  Now, that's a winner!  It has a replacable AAA battery so you're never out of action to wait on a recharge.  Its fully compatible with the common recharable battery kits, so you can have the best of both worlds.  Internal sound technology is similar to Creative X-fi, but this RCA product is easier to use, sounds better, lower priced, and more durable.  With that technology, of course it can play back highly compressed files with fantastic quality.  So, you can fit one heck of a lot of songs on here.  For great music, this is just the thing. For extra fun,  There's a simple cord available at Radio Shack that hooks this up to your home stereo.  Aha!  No more need to mess with a bunch of CDs.  I love this little thing.    Caveat?  No caveat, considering its price range.  The headphones that come with it are clear and reasonable; however, the Pearl is capable of pro quality sound if you use headphones of that caliber.  Don't let that bother you.  This is ready to use on the very minute you free it from the box, and it sounds wonderful.

<Title>Not worth it for the price

<Content>The design is nice, and I'm really happy with the storage space (but then again, this is my first 2gb mp3, up till now I've had (about) 500MB ones)(I dumped the music from 2 old players into it an a bunch of newly burned cds, and I still have about 567 MB left), but the headphone jack is on the side making is a bit awkward when I carry it around in my pocket, and it's too small for my (all of them) headphones/earbud; and the buttons on both sides makes it kind of hard to hold and navigate though the menus without pushing something you didn't want to. Then there's the problems with the audio, most of the music works fine (classical and most my techno), but a lot of my fave songs don't work, where you can hear the music just fine, but the voice is barely a whisper, or sometimes parts of it go from being really quiet to really loud. Most of the Rock and Metal just comes out sounding horrible and has a lot of static (though Nightwish actually sounds fine, most of the Rammstein, Oomph!, Flyleaf, and other bands with odd effects or a lot of bass have sound problems), . A lot of the songs also sound kind of echo-y, or Tinny/metallic... I tried out different headphones to see if those where the problem, but the problem stayed the same). Another problem is that occasionaly the music would sometimes skip, as if I was listening to a scratched cd  Then there's the problem with the menu selection. There's only 2 options for the Shuffle: On and Off, and when it's on, it seems to play the same 10-20 out of the 300-something songs instead of going though all of them... couple of times it played the same song 5 times in a row, or every other song For the Dsp, there's 5 pre-set options: Flat, Bass, Pop, Rock, Jazz; and all of them have very little difference between them (the only one I noticed was the Rock, and that didn't help with the sound), and You can't choose the settings of it yourself.  Overall I don't recommend getting this if you're a Music Fanatic/Audiophile As for me, I'm getting another Creative Zen (I had a Nano (512mb) for 2 yrs, but I recently lost it, which is why I ended up getting this), and giving this one to my brother, since his last one's display screen got fried after leaving it in the car (in the sun) during the summer

<Title>Pearl 2 GB
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The device only had 1 GB of working memory rather than the 2 it was supposed to have.  I emailed RCA tech support (there is no number available to call).  I received an automated reply that they would get back to me in 24 hours.  5 days later they still had not replied, so I sent it back to Amazon.  Amazon was very customer friendly about it.
