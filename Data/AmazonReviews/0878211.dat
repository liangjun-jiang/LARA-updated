<Title>great mp3 player, but needs more memory
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 players sound is great!! Its simple to use with w. media player. The only bad thing i can say about it is that it only holds 30-40 songs. I would suggest that you buy the one with bigger memory, spend the extra 20-30$ and get the bigger one. Thats all you need to know.

<Title>MP3 Player Works Great
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The MacVision MP3 player,model MA833A is smaller than most candy bars, but works great.  The 128 mb version will store over 8 hours of audio and in a pinch can be used to transfer computer data files as well.  The stereo sound is good and the user can easily switch from one recorded file to another.  It's a terriffic value for the price.

<Title>Good For Kids
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player for my Middle Schooler, and I was very pleased with the price and quality.  It holds enough music, and it's not so expensive that if he loses it that I'll be beside myself with frustration.  The two real problems I have are that the headphones broke within two weeks; and we still have no idea how to turn the thing off. (There's an auto shut-off that you can set for 5 minutes of inactivity or something like that, but you can't just manually push an "off" button.)   Outside of that, it's stylish and small.  Uploading the music is very easy...just copy and paste.  I'm thinking it has to be in MP3 format.   The player doesn't recognize .wma or other file extensions.  The setup CD comes with some kind of convert feature, but from what I can tell, it doesn't convert anything into MP3 format.    All in all, I would recommend this product for parents who have some knowledge of MP3 devices and don't wish to break the bank buying a one for kids.

<Title>Cool!
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This only uses 119 MB out of the 128 MB to store files. That is the only set back that this device has. It has great sound, neat quality, easy menues and loading files into it is as easy as drag and drop. If you're listening to a song and change to another one, it'll fade the sound out, pretty cool! A single AAA battery will give you plenty of time to listen to your music plus, it can also be used to carry any kind of files. Pretty useful! I recommend this 100%

<Title>It's okay for the price
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this for my 6 year old daughter so she could listen to her favorite music without lugging around a bunch of CD's.  It's cheap enough that it wont be the end of the world if she breaks it.  So far it works just fine.  Be forewarned that this mp3 player will not play copyright protected files.  The vast majority of popular music that you can download off the web (for a fee) is copyright protected.  This means I can easily put songs from my daughter's CD's on the player, but I wont be able to use any music I purchase online.

<Title>Perfect kids first player! Great Christmas gift.
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old, it was the first mp3 in the house. After a little research I found this to have all the features a kid could need at the best price.   Because of the price I was a little worried about the quality, but I am extremely satisfied. This was so easy to use and set up, even as a first-timer I had no problems. It is very durable, my kid loves it and at under $30.00 you don't have to worry too much about them losing it.  I am so impressed that I am buying these players as Christmas gifts for family members. My six year old is even getting one. This player is easier for her to use then her cd player. Also it is cheaper than wasting money on cd's that ruin quickly, The batteries also last longer than in a cd player.  This is the perfect gift for the kids in your life, at the perfect price.

<Title>VERY poorly documented
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The manual included with this device is completely useless. Go to the manufacturer's website and download an updated version - you'll be saving yourself a big headache.  The included manual reads like it was written by a non-English speaking third grader.  Example: "The keys will locked automatically, in the status without any operation and over the system keylock time."  Huh?  "Solution of unlock: Press 'Next' key and then press 'Last' key to unlock"  Needless to say, there is no 'Next' key.  Nor is there a 'Last' key.  REAL helpful directions there, guys.  I'm an IT professional who solves technology problems for a living, and I had a heck of time figuring this thing out.  Unless you're really into puzzles, I'd recommend spending a few more bucks on something that has usable instructions.  Please note that at least one of the people praising this comes right out and admits he doesn't own it - he owns a completely different model.  I'd take a "review" from someone who doesn't even own the product with a big grain of salt.

<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player was good for 3 weeks and then I started having problems. The battery drained fast and then one it did not recognize the battery. I emailed their tech support and gave me a 800 number to call to. Every time I called the 800 number it went to a voice box. Left message no response. Emailed again stating the issue no response. The player was good while it lasted might have been fixed if I had the support. Tech support is really pathetic.

<Title>a few problems at first
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It is very flimsy.  I ordered 2.  One of them didn't work at all from the get-go.  I was able to get a return authorization  for a replacement (item comes with a "6 month warranty"  HA!) Well it has been 2 months now and no response.  I've e-mailed several times- no response.  I've called customer service and all I get is a voice mail.  and No, they don't call back.  Guess what?  they were slow but sent me a brand new player. both are working fine (so far) so I'll go step back and give it 2 and a half stars.   BUT DO NOT GO TO WAL MART TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC because wal-mart's protection label won't work with this player, so you can't play the music.

<Title>DONT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was my 2nd mp3 player (my first was the rio s10, which broke) and right when i opened it from the box the top button was screwed up it could only go one way it was SOOOOO annoying! Then about a month later it was so screwed up that it would freeze, turn off, and make the song sound weird! I threw this peice of trash away and got a Buslink MP3-SK 256 MB player which is way better! I love it! It has a built in loud speaker so i dont have to use those annoying earbuds! So i deffinatly recomend the buslink one over this stupid one!

<Title>Good value if you're clear on its limitations
<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this inexpensive little player for playing podcasts in my car (through a $7.95 cassette-drive adapter). Works really well for that purpose. I agree with other reviewers that the earbuds are horrible, but since I don't use them, no problem. Putting the podcast files on it is easy in USB-key mode, drag and drop.  It's also a good USB key, which is what I mainly use it for. No problems here except that occasionally Windows has refused to release it - I think that's a Windows problem, not a problem with the unit.   It's a reasonable voice recorder, too, especially for the price. I recorded a two-person practice session in a class I was taking, and my voice was very clear, the other person's not - partly her voice, partly positioning, I think. If you were holding it in your hand and dictating notes into it it should be fine. You could even do a podcast interview using it as a microphone and pointing it back and forth. It makes MP3s.  That's what it does well. Things I wasn't so happy about:  * Here on the Amazon page it claims a ten-hour battery life, but I've found that mine tends to drain the battery even when it's not in use, and my batteries don't last nearly that long. I usually leave the battery out now when I'm not using it somewhere that needs the battery to be in (it doesn't need the battery in order to be used as a USB key, for example). Putting it in and out is an extra bit of fiddling I could do without. * As well as the podcasts I've used it to play an audiobook in MP3 format in my car. I got the recording at audiobooksforfree in the form of multiple smallish files (I'm too cheap to pay for a single file). What I found was that the unit didn't always play the files in the order of their filenames - meaning that I had to use the Mode switch to move around and find the next file. More fiddling that I could have done without. * I put a large audio file (about 18MB, 20 minutes long) on it and at first it wouldn't play, though later on it seemed to work all right. Don't know what was going on there.  In summary, if you want a cheap podcast player that's also a USB key and can record your voice if you need that occasionally, and you are using it, for preference, through an adapter so you don't need the earbuds, this is a pretty good buy for $30. It has a few quirks, though.

<Title>This is a handy little recorder
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband and I bought this MP3 player for our 5 year old son over 6 months ago based on reviews I read here.  Just as everyone said, it's very easy to use:  easy to put music on it, very easy to take music off, and recording is a breeze!  It has withstood the not so gentle attentions of an active 5year old boy and stills works like a charm.  Recently I took it to my Sweet Adeline's chorus rehearsal.  After my disappointment in a much more expensive digital recorder I decided to give this little guy a try.  The microphone is great!  It records a whole chorus just as clearly as it does one voice, very little static or fuzz.  It's so easy for me to upload my rehearsals to my computer; just plug it into the USB and I'm ready to go.  My reasons for not giving it a 5 star are that I've noticed it sometimes seems unresponsive when I try to navigate the menu (could just be user related), and the cap over the USB has become loose.  While it still stays on during use, it's not as snug as it used to be.  But seriously, such a little complaint for such a great, inexpensive product.

<Title>Excellent budget MP3 player at a Good price! 
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this player for about 4 years now, the only MP3 player i've ever owned, and it has always been reliable and functioned great. Sturdy build quality on this one too and navigating to different MP3 tracks is pretty easy thanks to the small back-lit LCD display. My only gripe is you need to install the included firmware update disc to make it truly 128MB, otherwise only 119MBs are available, i didn't bother to do this though and have since lost the firmware disc. This thing still works great though, 119MBs is enough to hold at least 2 hours of Good quality music, and it comes with a USB extension cord to make connecting to your PC and transferring MP3 tracks a breeze. Excellent player if your on a budget, can get it Cheap, and don't need anything fancy.

<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>35 minutes ago I opened the box and cut the package to my new Mac Vision MP3 player.  I like to reserve the word "awesome" to describe God, but all good and perfect things come from Him, right? Right.  Well, I'm not speaking about Goodness in Vain... I have used many MP3 players and this one is superb.  My main desire to buy another player was to have one I could use without feeling, touching, being bothered by.  All I wanted was the MUSIC! I sync-ed 4 songs in 40 seconds or less, went to play them, got up to take something out of the oven without thinking, and the praise songs went with me - light as a feather, sweet as bananas!  I am overjoyed.  The reviewers are pretty accurate, and I will be as well... nowhere does it tell you that you have to DEPRESS  the mode switch to really begin playing from the main menu.  So, that is how you SELECT the function you will use from the very clean and simple main menu.  If you have $30 bucks, there is no reason not to choose this player.  Even if you love your Dell DJ (I love mine) or your IPod (pretty decent, too) you need this. Get this as a gift for anyone - it can be used as a flash drive, a voice recorder AND an MP3 player... where can you GET ALL THAT (!!!) for thirty dollars, people?  WOW!  Lastly, I will add that my money would have been well spent just getting the hilariously poorly translated tiny little user manual.  It is a gas. Here's a good line, for example: (verbatim, now) "This machine packs into the battery the each opening the confidential waiting for the first time 10 seconds, need the machine from measure to complete to grow to press to open the machine key the square can show, the inconvenient place begs your pardon."       You are pardoned, and you are hilarious!  Buy this today. I guarantee you will be a happy camper.

<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the macvision MA833A for my son, based on reviews (only bad ones seemed to say the manual is no good, which is true).  It's been easy to transfer music from a CD onto the player, but we can't figure out how to transfer music from the internet!!  For instance, my son purchased a couple songs from msn.com (99 cents each, they downloaded easily onto the computer (windows xp), but when we try to synchronize them onto the player, we get an error message.  One of the reviewers said you can only copy CD music, because it won't play copyright protected files, and most of the music online is copyright protected.  Is this everyone else's experience?  I bought it to get music off the internet, and would appreciate any advice!  (The manual and manufacturers website are no help, as others noted.)  Thanks from a mom who is new to all this, and her son!!!

Works great, really small and portable, EXTREMELY easy to use and transfer files onto, and best of all, it doesn't automatically encrypt your music, so I can share my music with friends. Durable and versatile, great sound. Records as well, just in case you need to tape that meeting at 9:00, just turn it on and it will get everything. Great product.

<Content>Sure, sure, MP3 player producers parade the fact that their product can hold hundreds of songs, play movies, walk the dog, etc etc. But, for those people who dont have     500+ favorite songs, can't name 500+ songs, or can't afford more than 500 songs, this MP3 player is for you.       IT has an incredible amount of features, many of which are missing from leading players, such as a built in radio, multi-colored backlight, a tempo changer, several supported languages,lyrics display, an equalizer, and more. Admittedly, the manual is written in something resembling Pidgin English, but it is easy to grasp their drift  This is definetly a good choice for people who don't care to listen to day-long playlists.

<Title>Excellent Buy
<Date>Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is definitly a very very good buy. If you are running Windows XP just plug it in, wait a few minutes for windows to install it (you don't even need to use the cd that comes with it in XP), and when it's done installing just open up your mp3 folder then drag and drop files into the detected drive's folder that pops up automatically!  The headphones that come with it are't very incredible and kind of awkward though usable, however if you buy a nicer pair (I'm using Phillips SBC HP170) the sound is just as good as if it were coming from my Dolby Surround 5.1 system.  Easy to use interface, scrolls lyrics when you add lyric files, nice voice recorder, beyond excellent especially for the price!  My only regret is that I wish I had bought the 256 MB version!  Just remember to click the Safely Remove Device in the system tray before disconnecting it as with all USB storage devices.

<Content>i bought this piece and i think its great. Pocket size, easy to use, multi language support and most important, reasonable price. i knew these days mp3player always emphasis on the massive storage , but large storage comes with large size, which doesnt work on me. With this mp3 player, i can bring it to the gym or on the street with great convenience.

<Title>Terrible product!
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I couldn't get my computer to even load this properly.  It said that Microsoft couldn't verify it was safe, the language was pidgin English, the instructions were obviously from someone who didn't know English well, and although I tried to contact the support Email and telephone message lines, I could never get anything but an automated "thank you highly and kindly for contacting us..."  Worthless!

<Title>problems with song formats
<Date>Sun Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have songs from both realplayer as well as Windows media (AAC files and WMA files)  This mp3 player would not even recognize the first and though it seemed to recognize the second, still would not play them.  As stated in another review, the instructions and support included are in broken English and not any help.  Maybe this would be a great player for mp3 format music files, but I do not recommend it for anything else.

<Title>Nice for the price
<Date>Thu Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product works as advertised. It played all my mp3's and wma's even ones that didn't play on other players. Not sure what's going on with the other two reviewers here. Sound quality is a bit lacking though. You can hear a lot of noise at lower volumes. Maybe it's the included headphones, I don't have anything better to try it with. I re-encoded all my music into 48 kbit wma (The smallest size stereo variable bitrate wma you can have). Now I can fit 5 and half hours of music on this 128 mb.   Pros: Plug n' play, drag and drop your music files into the player. Bright lcd, included headphone/neckstrap combo is intuitive. Doubles as a usb drive to store other types of files.  Cons: Lousy instruction manual but the menus on the thing is so easy to navigate, it's no big deal to me. I figured out all the features by fiddling with it a few minutes. Sound quality is only ok. Voice recording volume is lower than I would prefer. USB covering does not lock in place, with age might slip right off.  Final Verdict: You get what you pay for and it does everything advertised. But it doesn't do any one thing particularly well. But for a few pennies under $30, I'm happy with my purchase.

<Title>What are you talking about?
<Date>Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this item with a gift certificate, and was reluctant to do so because of a couple of bad reviews, but WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!  For the price, this is a great little player, with pretty good headphones!!  Since it funcations like a memory key, you DON"T EVEN HAVE TO LOAD THE SOFTWARE!!!  just load the music onto it like it was a memory key and your done...  It's a simple little tool, holds maybe 40-60 songs, good enough for a run or a work out session, and even has a backlit display...    EASY TO USE!!  RIGHT PRICE!!  as you can tell I am pleased!
