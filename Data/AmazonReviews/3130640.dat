<Title>Great, but wait.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini is the perfect portable music player for anybody without an enormous music library.  My 1300 song library fits on the iPod mini's 4GB storage.  It is truly small, slightly bigger than my (small) cell phone. This is great, but don't buy it yet.  Announced Feb. 23, the iPod mini will be released with new colors, a full color screen and 5 or 6 GB's of storage.  ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE!!  I am a PC guy, but Apple has perfectly designed the iPod mini.  So wait a few weeks, then buy a new iPod mini.

<Title>Recommended, but With a Few Caveats.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Apple launched its aggressive marketing campaign for the iPod, I reacted with a degree of resistance. Why bother getting an iPod? I own hundreds of CDs, and the disc player I already have is fine as it is. But once I got my hands on the mini, it instantly changed the way I listen to music. The iPod mini is a nice way to listen to/store your favorite tunes, and it deserves both praise and criticism.   THE PROS?   It's easy to install. All you have to do is recharge your iPod mini, connect it to your computer, transfer your music library on your hard drive to iTunes (which you will need to install either from the website or the enclosed CD), and you're ready to play your iPod. It's that simple. If a dolt like me can operate this thing, so can you.   Store up to 1,000 tunes. But that figure assumes that the average song you load is 4 minutes long. Because I like to listen to a lot of extended dance remixes that are 6 minutes or longer, I really have only 700 tunes max on my iPod. Still, that's a lot of music to carry.   Easy to carry and you'll look cool. The iPod mini is my new buddy at the gym, where almost everybody has one. With the right accessories (sold separately), you can clip it to your pants, wear it with an arm wrist, or carry it in the palm of your hand while running.   THE CONS?   Flimsy headphones. The iPod mini has decent sound quality, but you wouldn't know it by using the headphones, which deliver a thin and hollow sound. Not only that, but one of the speakers has already blown out after only a week's worth of use. Apple should be ashamed of themselves for manufacturing such weak headphones.   8 hour battery life? I don't think so! Battery life is such a controversial issue with the iPod, because so many people have claimed that it's much less than 8 hours. If you don't use the click wheel and keep the volume at a low level, then I'm sure you may get 8 hours if you're lucky. But I like to turn up the bass on mine, use the equalizer, and set the volume relatively high - all of which gave me a battery life of only 3 hours. So, the more features you use on your iPod mini, the less likely you'll get anything close to 8 hours. (Note: the new iPod minis now have a battery life of up to 18 hours, which is more than double that of the one I currently have)  THE BOTTOM LINE:   All in all, I like and recommend the iPod mini to anyone with a fairly large CD collection and an up-to-date computer. But it comes with its flaws so consumers should be advised before jumping in. And depending on how often you listen to music, you way want to skip this and get the 20GB, the new 30GB iPod photo or even the 40GB for just a few dollars more. Overall, it gets my green light.

<Title>Just got my 6 GB mini ... Awesome !
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wow!  Got the e-mail from Apple (Since I own the a 10 GB 1st Gen. and a 40 GB 4th) on Tuesday about the release of the new players, ordered it, and had it today, Thursday! 2 days!    Anyway, I ordered the green and I have to say it's a much richer green than the previous 4 gb.  Looks awesome and, as usual with the other ipods I have, the setup and installation was a breeze.  Sound quality excellent!  Ease of use excellent! Just excellent period!  I own, and have tried players from other manufactuers like iRiver, RCA, and most recently, Creative.  All of them have their own set of problems and nothing comes close to the ipod.  The iRiver I own has inferior sound quality, the RCA Lyra locks up frequently, and I don't even want to get started on the Zen Micro.  It froze up so many times I returned it to Amazon within 2 days.  I thought it would be an ipod competitor since it came with an FM radio and a removeable battery.  But, oh man, what a piece of junk!  I'm just hoping Apple will one day put an FM tuner in their ipods. I think if they do, everyone else can just close shop.  I could care less about a removeable battery because there are always new players coming out so frequently, I usually purchase the latest one.  The only small beef I have, which almost made me give it 4 stars, is that they took away something that used to shipped with the previous ipods.  A "wall outlet" charging cord.  The only accessories that ship with this new mini are: a USB cord that goes from the player to a USB port, headphones, a carrying case/clip, and the documentation/CD.  That's it.  No charging dock or wall plug.  The only way you can charge this player, with what ships, is to connect it to a USB port on your computer. On the Apple website, the wall "power adapter" is $29.00.  Personally, I think they should just scrap the crappy headphones that most mp3 players ship with, and include the power adapter.  This new 6 gb is just another fine example why Apple has over 90% of the portable player market.  I just can't wait to see what they come up with next!

<Title>Apple Deserve a GOLD for their Mini-Silver iPod! A Great Buy
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know a great deal about everything, however I've been a huge fan of every iPod model since my very first purchase. I kept notes from that first purchase and every upgrade purchase I've made since then. After finally getting my Apple 4GB iPod Mini Silver M9160LL/A, I decided I would take the time to pass on my thoughts in the form of a review on Amazon.com.  I didn't ever think I would become a member of this sort of "technology cult", however Apple has just blown my mind away with their ability to consistently improve quality and impress me with style and functionality. Apple really pushed the envelope with their design and choice of color schemes.  Perfect? Not perfect, but pretty close considering I've only had a few problems with it-all of which can be taken care of with a sort of "Re-Boot"-all you need to remember is to hold down the SELECT and MENU buttons for just under 10 seconds. It seems to take care of any small issues I've had. I'll bet that most people don't put their machines through the sort of consumer testing that I do. But if you ever DO run into any problems, you can "Re-Boot" or go to the Apple website and locate your particular situation and they've convered all basis with great responses. If for any reason at all you can't locate your problem ,or if a "fix" doesn't work, simply email Apple and you'll likely have an educated response within just a few hours or less.  You will be extremely impressed with the quality of sound you'll hear on your iPod Mini. You will also notice an increase in volume as well. A salesman told me that I could expect a difference in sound but Apple wasn't really advertising each facet of this great device. He also informed me that this model will not likely have problems jumping around or skipping-improvements were definitely made and I can't imagine what any future models will have to offer!  Remember to enjoy your iPod and to not worry about anything going wrong. It's likely that you'll never run into a problem. Be certain to follow the instructions and charge for 4 hours. The rest is all about enjoying great music and being able to depend on awesome sound quality and volume improvements.  I hope this review helped and I'll be sure to keep in touch with any future developments along the iPod line. It's hard to believe all of this coming from a PURE-PC Person. That was before I discovered Apple and especially the iPods!! The truth is that I've been converted! Thanks APPLE!  Enjoy!   Pete Cannice from Scottsdale, Arizona Email: Horsepete@aol.com

<Title>Good Things Come in Small Packages
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had long wished for my own Mp3 player, and my wish was granted last summer. As soon as I saw the iPod mini, I knew that that was the one I wanted. I got my iPod and spent many hours listening to my tunes and buying songs off the iTunes Music Store. However, my happy and perfect time with my iPod mini did not last long when I was pummelled by one of my friends while I had my iPod in my pocket in a tarmac parking lot. My precious iPod was flung to the ground and got stepped on by accident and now has about ten scratches on it (thankfully on the back). I had read in a review of the iPod mini that it was scratch-proof "even if it was placed face-down on a rough surface;" I have now cleanly disproven this statement.  Besides that, the iPod is the ultimate pocket companion for the road. I took my iPod with me on vacation and helped me get through the long hours on the plane. The "Music" section sorts songs by artist, album, genre, composer, and audiobook. My favorite part of the iPod mini is the On-the-Go playlist feature, that allows you to create your own playlist, well, on the go, so you can play your favorite songs continuously without looking for them, and then clearing it again the next minute. The Click Wheel is totally functional and a lot better than the touch wheel and buttons on the old models of the iPods.  Overall, the iPod mini is fun, innovative, and the ultimate Mp3 player!

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've listened to several different mp3 players, including the Dell Jukebox. The Jukebox sound cannot compete with the iPod minis. The colors are fun, and you can customize your equalizer settings to get the sound you want. It holds a lot more songs that it seems and has games to play while waiting in Restaurants. (seriously)

<Title>Poor battery: approx 5.5 hours
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't usually write reviews but I was so badly treated (or rather: ignored) by Apple's service that I felt I should warn others.  Beware of the battery rating.  "8 hours" means one song played over and over.  Under ordinary circumstances you will average about 5.5 hours.  And, heaven forbid, you should skip to the next song, you can drive the battery down to 4 hours or less. On the positive side: the wheel interface is very good.

<Title>A few flaws, but overall excellent
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After some deliberation, I decided to buy an iPod mini. The price was a bit prohibitive ($380 Canadian with tax...ouch), but the iPod mini's ease of use, superb sound quality, and stylish look are worth crowing about. A lot of people have complained about the iPod mini's relative lack of storage space compared to its older brothers, but I consider myself a pretty hardcore music fan, with my fingers in all different genres, and I only have 556 songs on my Mac. That's a lot of music, people. And I still have 1.3 gigs left over! So don't be afraid that the mini has "only" 4 gigs of storage space. You'd be suprised how much you can fit on there.  Now for the bad stuff: The battery life is disappointing. Sure, most of us won't need to go for eight straight hours without a recharge, but if you listen to your mini a lot (as I do), you might be suprised at how quickly the battery drains. Apple's advertised 8 hours, in reality, is more like 5-6.  Also, don't be fooled by everyone around you wearing those white Apple earbuds - they're just trying to look trendy. The earbuds (included in the box, along with a belt clip) are okay, but have a weak lower end (bass) and are a bit tinny. Most earbuds are, though. Pick up a better pair of headphones - I use Panasonic Shockwaves, which get nice bass and aren't expensive at all. Still, if you really want to draw those stares, use the earbuds. Whatever floats your boat.  Another thing: Check out the iPod mini in real life if you can. It's actually much smaller than it looks in pictures (that's a good thing). And a note for PC users: You'll probably have a few glitches setting up the iPod. Such is the nature of the PC. Mac users, of course, could be brain damaged and still get the iPod up and running in a matter of minutes.  Overall, I'm hugely impressed with the iPod mini. It's ridiculously easy to use, it looks great, and having a thousand songs in your pocket at any given time will blow your mind. No more skipping, no more changing CDs...it's golden. Definitely check out the mini if you're in the market for a good MP3 player.

<Title>Mini vs. Standard
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My 3G 40 GB froze and went into Apple Care. So I bought a Silver Mini. Maybe it is my current infatuation, maybe I'm just glad to be back in the Ipods. But this is a superior unit. Much more solid. Love how I can put it in the front pocket of my jeans. My old pod felt like a brick in comparison. As far as storage goes, one really should store their music collection on a computer or external hard drive and off-load onto the pod. A Thousand songs should be plenty. Of course, if you have songs and audiobooks on there, you might start to get space conscious. The ergonomics of this unit are so far superior....its similar to the difference between one of those 5 year old cell phones compared and a sleek and sweet Samsung. My point deduction is for those Apple earbuds. They irritate my ears and basically suck. They really should be wireless. In any event, they should be much more comfortable and have better sound. The shuffle is a toy. The standard is a brick. The Mini is mine.

<Title>Colorful, Efficent, and very small!!
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my pink mini ipod a week ago and I love it. Just one thing to know before you buy the ipod- you need Windows 2000 or Windows XP to download itunes to it. If you dont you can always download XPlay to your Windows 1998 or ME. Even though the ipod is kind of on the expensive side, it is worth it. It can hold up to 1000 4 minute songs!! It has excellent sound quality and is tinier than your walkman or diskman. They are very stylish too- they come in blue, lime green, pink, silver, and gold. I can take my ipod anywhere!! You can take your ipod almost anywhere, except in the water. You can take it jogging, to the office, in your house, etc. You can shuffle all your songs up and discover the songs you never knew about. The ipod also come with 4 fun games that you can play while your listening to music. They are Brick, Parachute, Solitare, and Music quiz. My personal favorite is the Music Quiz because it plays a song and you have to hurry and say what song it is before time runs out. The faster you know it, the more points you get. The only thing you will get frusterated on is downloading the songs. This process may take a while and you will sit for hours downloading music into your ipod. The best way to do it is to do a little bit a day or else you will get totally burned out!!  The ipod comes with a firewire, 2.0 wire, a plug adaptor, itunes cd, the ipod itself (duh!), earbuds, and an instruction booklet. The hardest thing I had trouble finding out was how to turn the ipod off. You dont switch hold, you have to hold the >// button on the bottom for at least 6 seconds. Then it switches out and you can switch it to hold.

<Title>Great product, poor service from Apple direct - Use Amazon!
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Hi,  I experienced really poor service ordering from Apple direct.  I first placed an order for a personalised ipod mini and the lead time on delivery was set at almost a month later from order placement.  I needed the ipod sooner as it was a gift, and I contacted Apple and I suggested changing my order to a standard ipod mini rather than personalized in the hope this would improve delivery.  They told me that the engraving process only took 5 minutes and it wouldnt improve delivery at all.  A few days later I contacted them again in the hope they could improve the delivery and was told by a different sales contact that by changing to a standard ipod this would improve delivery greatly.  I changed the order and the delivery did improve to ship in a couple of days. The day passed and the shipment hadnt been made, and the lead time had gone back out to the same time as the original personalised ipod mini. I contacted them again, and after holding for 30 mins was told that that was just what the lead times could do - just change at any given moment!  I promptly cancelled my order, and ordered with Amazon.  Sorry, Apple, fantastic product, rubbish service.

<Title>The more competition there is, the less great it seems
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A lot of what you pay for with the iPod of any sort is the name, and the design.  Apple is excellent at making a streamlined design, and if that's what you're looking for, they've got you covered.  So far as features to price ratio, however, they're not really that great.  I have had four or five iPods in the last few years, so I'm hardly one to say they're not worth the price.  While I do love my iPods, I realize they're not really for everyone.  I got the mini for working out -- the armband that you can get for it fit my arm a lot better then the behemeth sized one for the regular iPod.  They minis are only about 4 gigs in size.  When I say "only", I mean in relation to other MP3 players.  4 gigs is actually enough room for just about anyone.  After all, not many people listen to every track of every CD they own.  However, if you do, the mini probably is not for you.  For me, personally, it's fine, because the music I listen to is dependent on my general mood -- I'll listen to the same "set" of songs over and over for a week or three, then I'll cycle it out for something new, but I *never* listen to all my music at once.  The mini, in addition to just playing your music (but not your WMAs!), will also do some basic calendar, contact, and notes functionality, along with a couple of games.  It sort of wants to be a PDA, but it doesn't really cut it.  I'll stick to carrying around an extra device for that functionality, so for me those are more "throw away" features.  I don't like the new click wheel.  I find myself, more often then not, changing my selection right before I click, so I end up with the wrong song, or menu item.  It often takes me two or three tries.  I'm not sure if it's because the wheel is overly sensitive, or maybe my nails make it harder to operate (and my nails are not terribly long, especially for a girl).  I've also had a problem with the iPod Mini locking up on me, usually after I've used it in my car.  I will unplug it from the audio jack in my car (not the power adapter) and bring it inside, and it will no longer power on.  I'll have to press some combination of play and menu, hold for 10 seconds, before it will come back to life.  In fact, I returned a previous Mini because of this problem and the new one seems to suffer the same issue.  On the other hand, all the iPod's I have had have stood up very well to the tests I've put them through.  I've kept my iPod Mini in an "iSkin" in the entire time I've had it, which may help, but either way, it has taken a beating in my purse, at the gym, and dropping off the treadmill.  Definitely well built in that way.  For me, the positives outweigh the negatives, mostly due to the fact that it takes a beating and is small but not too tiny.  However, it's probably not the best choice for everyone.

<Content>This is a really great player, but don't get this, apple just came out with a new player that is the exact same thing with extended battery life and is 50 dollars cheaper. Or, if you're willing to pay the full 250, get the apple ipod mini 6GB, which stores 1500 songs. For more info, go to www.apple.com. Thanx

<Title>ipod mini review
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my ipod mini for 3 months & I have found it to be one of the best things I have ever bought.It is well designed easy to operate the instruction book is in plain English & the software easy to install even for a 50 year old former Ludite.My only small criticism is that no carrying case is included otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.So for all those people who spend endless hours travelling I would recommend you buy an ipod as it is much better to be able to listen to Bach or Charlie Parker than have to put up with the music provided by the airlines.I also find it good when reading or at the gym.In fact I am so impressed with my ipod that I am thinking of buying an Apple laptop computer just like Steve Jobs planned ( I hope I got his name right)!!!!!

<Title>Not bad after initial panic
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod took me more than 4 hours setup with my Windows XP.  The formatting process took more than 2 hours and appeared to hang.  The iPod screen and the manual warned me not to disconnect, and I wasn't sure whether I should terminate the process in the middle of formatting.  I began to search google and Apple's support web site. It turned out this happened to other people as well. I was told to terminate the formatting screen because the software would get stuck and need a kick.  The registration process then continues.  But after I started iTune, iTune told me that the drive was not formatted and gave me a choice to restore to factory default, which I did.  After some more work (it took so long that I couldn't remember what followed afterwards), I seemed to be able to connect to iTune.  But the iTune software is not intuitive to Windows users.  It took me a while to read the user manual online and figured out how to transfer the Playlists onto iPod.  It would not take drag-and-drop from Windows Explorer like other MP3 players would. It also took some time to find out how to make the proper eject icon show up in order to disconnect the iPod properly. The whole iTune learning must have taken another hour.   The battery didn't seem to last too long.  play for about 4 hours and I need to re-charge.  Nevertheless, all is well after this. The iPod itself was tuitive and easy to navigate.  I learned to use podcast to download my favorite radio show to iPod as well.  It has been fun so far.

<Title>iPOD IS AND iFRAUD!
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received an ipod for Christmas and still cannot get it to work with my Windows XP. I have spoken to the customer service support people over the phone 5 times and they cannot help me. When I went to my local Apple store at Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton, California the "Geniuses" at the Genius Bar were far from being a Genius. Especially when they said, "We had a lady come in here the other day and we just couldn't get the thing to work on her Windows laptop. Oh well." They refused to take give me my money back even though they admitted that my computer just might not be able to support the ipod.   You call that customer service? I have learned more on the Amazon reviews of ipods about how to get this thing to work than from the *#@%ing Geniuses at Apple. THIS IPOD IS AN IFRAUD!

<Content>First of all I have Windows XP and install was a breeze....basically just put the CD in and it will prompt you what to do.  itunes was simple and easy to use as well.  Within 3 hours of purchasing the ipod I was able to download almost 200 songs.  The longest part was downloading all my CD's on itunes.  The sound quality is excellent and I love everything about it (although I wish the battery lasted longer- it's about 4 hours).  I bought the pink and it is sooooo cute.  For the guys out there- if you are thinking about getting this for your girlfriend/wife you will make her very happy! My boyfriend blew it and bought me a RIO which I quickly exchanged for the mini ipod.  This thing is awesome!

<Title>8-hour battery life?
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Why does Apple insist on lying to its customers?  Maybe an 8-hour battery life would be possible if one listened to the Ipod on very low volume, without touching the dial.  But, isn't the joy of the Ipod that you're supposed to be able to skip over songs, mix up the order of your music... listen to What you want, When you want it?  If you're like me, and using your Ipod as the Good Lord meant it to be used, you'll be lucky if your battery lasts 3 hours.  Which means, almost every time I use my Ipod, the battery dies before I return home.  So uncool.  Especially since Apple promised otherwise.

<Title>In the end it depends on YOU
<Date>Thu Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I see the iPod Mini as the perfect MP3 player for ME, I am not sure about other people, but 4 GB is more then enough for my music library. I mean, how many songs do you want? And if you do fill up 4 GB chances are that half the songs are ones that you don't listen to or put on just for the sake of filling the iPod Mini. Besides, every time I look at a bigger iPod, I cannot get over the fact that it scratches way too easily, and a grey touchwheel does not go with a white casing. In the end, if you are the kind of person that packs there iPod with their favorite songs, not the history of every rock band, then this is the one for you. If you are a kind of person that does not mind scratches, and has a HUGE music library, and I mean HUGE, then go ahead and get that white and grey reflector. By the way, how can you people resist the cool alumininum and smooth casing with the discreet iPod logo on the back, with a white touch wheel and a blue cover?

<Title>GREAT- with a few exceptions...
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my iPod Mini on December 10th so I've had it for about 2 months. I have about 45 songs. I have a capacity of 1,000 songs and I only filled in 45!!! The good thing is that you can put your whole collection on it for FREE!!! Since you just insert the CD into iTunes, it doesn't cost you anything. Not even a penny. The iPod mini tends to get dirty if you touch the click-wheel too much, or if you touch the screen. Even if you have clean hands, you smudge hand oils on the screen. It's a good idea to get an iSkin because it protects it from dirt, dust and scratches! (I'm thinking of getting that soon).  You can also have several problems with iTunes and Apple's Support Service. If you write a problem they might answer it or not. When I had a problem with iTunes, I wrote to them and they told me what to do to fix my problem. But when I had a problem with the headphones last week, they CANCELED my request. It's kind of confusing if you think of all the problems you could have, but if you ignore that fact, it's a GREAT PRODUCT and I advise EVERYONE TO BUY ONE so everybody can have one (who wants one), so everyone can be HAPPY!!!

<Title>Veteran Owner-Has worked perfectly-Tired of negative reviews
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am so tired of all the negative reviews, of people who don't know how to work it (its so easy to use! omg), of the people who give up and return it, and of people who have never even had one and say bad things about it.  I've had my ipod since April 2004 (10 months) Woot woot! So I am more experienced than all of you and have something very important to tell you.  The iPod mini is great, and THE easiest music player to learn to use and navigate through.  Besides that it scores major points for popularity, it is practical. A while ago, it actually malfunctioned (because I had it so long, and thats cool you know), and I had to send it in to Apple Repair Service for a new iPod mini.  The service was great beyond belief! I got the iPod back in 2 days after I sent it, only paying shipping charge. So that turned out really well actually, where I was scared it was over. Oh BTW, battery life is fine, 8 hours is really a lot if you think about it. And 4 gigs is plenty. So as far as specs go, the iPod mini passes the test.  I also bought my mom one for Christmas, and set it up for her too.  She loves it too. Even an old lady like her can use it.   So in essence I've set up 3 ipods (2 of mine cause I got a new one after I sent it in, and my mothers). All times- no problems. Those Christmas recipients who had problems setting it up have no excuses, you probably did something wrong.   Its really easy to use and I recommend this 150%  You truly get what you pay for.  iPod mini is worth every penny. If you're thinking of getting a portable music device, you should really get the iPod mini. Don't let the negative reviews scare you; I know they are potent, but false.  The sense of you joy you get from it is priceless.

<Title>Long Story, Bad Conclusion
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If I could give it zero stars, I would.  First off, I took a chance on it because I thought that it would be a great way to carry all my music in one place.  In the end, I went through four ipods and I'm probably out at least fifty bucks once I finish selling it on ebay.  The first one had problems with the sound, so it was exchanged after less than three months.  Then, it got replaced again for the same problem less than three months later.  I thought my problems were gone, but the next one they gave me had a battery that would only run for half an hour, which eventually dwindled down to a mere fifteen minutes.  They sent me a new one, and I decided that was it and to sell it.  The other thing that most people don't know is that their "protection plans" sounds like something the Mafia would offer. They are just a way to squeeze more money out of you and you'll need them because they don't build their products that well.  I saw all kinds of people in the Genius Bar who had lots of problems with their stuff.  After the last phone call I had with the customer service, they told me that after that call, the next one would be $50.  The protection plan for the ipods runs at about $60.  It's got to make you think, why have such expensive protection plans?  Because Apple has made it so that they're stuff will break so you'll need them.  I'm out of the Mac Cult.   Get an iriver, a sandisk, or a creative muvo.  Just don't bother with this.

<Content>First of all, I am looking into buying an MP3 player, I automatically thought Ipod and I had my heart set on the mini. I am 13 and you see, 250 is a lot to save up at an occasional babysitting job. So, I looked for better deals. I saw the review about the Dell pocket DJ. It seemed like a good deal. But, comparing it to the ipod, you get 1500 more songs in 1GB more space, something's fishy. do they compress the songs or have lower sound quality? If you know, please tell me.  Thanx

<Content>I heard some reviews saying that it was "style over quantity". Duh, do you think we can't see? I'm 13 trying to save for an ipod mini. I have to make charts to try and convince mom and dad that it's a good way to waste my money. It's obvious that the 20GB is a better deal. But it IS style over amount of songs. It's a marketing technique. Apple has figured out a way to get MOST of us to buy something for more than it's worth. But, honestly, I think though it is expensive; the ipod mini has a lot of good features that most others on the market don't. They have made it so we can have access to a slightly less expensive alternative to the 20GB without going to a different company.though an improvement that they could make is to have a voice recorder to compete a little with the Dell DJ. All in all, a great toy for those with the money!  Thanx

<Title>Great, but could be even better. 3.5 stars actually
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll give it five stars for style, software, and versatility, but I've got some issues with the player.  First and foremost, batteries. I prefer disposable and longer lasting like the Rio Forge. When I'm walking and 3 miles from home, if the batteries go, I'm alone with just my thoughts for 3 miles, and my thoughts are usually about disposable batteries.  Second, the batteries last about 4 hours, not 8 or 10 as I've seen "advertised."  Third, the earphones are terrible compared to Sony MDR-EX51LP earbuds. Even the venerable Wall Street Journal rated the Sony as far superior to Apple's. Fourth, I love the wheel except for volume control. When walking, I wan't to be able to get to the volume without looking, and that's really difficult with the Mini in your pocket and the wheel flat against the I-Pod, so flat you can't tell front from back. Yes, you can lock it, but then when road noise gets bad, you still have to adjust the volume which means unlocking and feeling for the wheel. I think a small thumb wheel at the top would have been much better. Other than that - and the fact that it was a gift - I really like the thing.  I still use my Rio when it's raining, when I have to fly someplace, or when I'm otherwise not sure about battery life, but the Mini's playlists etc. make it a joy. (I still give my Rio with 1 gig 4 stars. It's lightweight and uses one AAA battery which lasts for 12 hours. It only holds 350 songs, but I keep thinking about my cassette days.)  I don't use the Ipod for notes etc. That's just too much trouble, but for something to carry around 1,283 songs - that's my "personal best" - wow, that's 100 albums!

<Title>Apple iPod Mini
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really don't like this iPod. The normal version of the iPod is the best you can find. The iPod Mini as gotten very unpopular in 2005. Most people now are buying the 20GB or the 40GB iPods. If you want to buy this iPod the only reason is you want to jog and run with it. You shouldn't care about not holding much songs either because this is only 4GB which only holds 1,000 songs. The 20GB iPod which is only $50.00 more can hold five times more than that! I think the iPod mini colors are really stupid too. I don't know why people like to have colored MP3 Players. You're supposed to use MP3 Players to play music and maybe games but it doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside. All I care about is how much gigabytes it has and if it has a simple but very advanced design. The 4th Generation iPod now almost beats the mini's size. It's really small but the regular iPod is catching up to it. Soon no one is going to want this iPod and they will switch to the fifth generation iPod (which is supposed to have a 80 GB Storage Capacity!)

<Content>I got the mini iPOD for my wife last christmas. My wife never got exited about a gift as much as she did for this one. She can not live without it now. In the car, in the house, and most important when she works out (Arm band is a must which I got too). I am an old iPOD user, and she used my iPOD many times where I thought she needed hers. Our music doesn't come up to more than 5 GB so far. so with this mini iPOD she was very happy and had all her music in it. My 15 GB iPOD was and still is an over kill. I don't think I will ever have this much music. Any how it works fine, I can hook both to my computer (win Xp) and with iTunes I can see both, and transfer music to them. You don't need to buy the base charger, but I just got it for looks ;) I can't imagine anyone give this product anything less than a 5 star.

<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>those apple bastards have rounded up the total storage capacity to 4 gigabytes, when really there are only 3.7 gigabytes. bastards. anyway... this ipod mini is a good little toy, but when you get down to it, there just isnt enough room on there... and besides, it really isnt that small. sure, if this had 20 gigs, i would take it over the current 20 gig ipods any day. its got the cool color and the small size, but what is that really worth. the current regular ipods are still small enough to hold in one hand and use just the thumb and are still quite light.  by the way, the battery life on the ipod mini is totally horrible. if i were to take a 4 hour long car drive, this thing would die, and without the addition of a carcharger, your pretty much screwed.  if the ipod mini costed about, say, 150 to 200 dollars, maybe itd be worth the money.. but at a whopping 250 dollars, it just isnt worth it, seeing as how you can get a 20 gig for just 50 bucks more.  my advice: go for the 20 (which i believe holds like 18.6 gigs or something). only get this 3.7 gig if you, well... uhh... dont get it, that should be enough

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this ipod in February of 2004. It was great, but then about 2 or 3 months later, it stopped working. All I got was static. At first I thought it was the headphones, but after testing my $130 sony's on it, and they didn't work, I knew it was broken. I sent it back, and I'll give the store credit, I got a new one in a few days. But guess what, 9 months later, I'm having the same problem. Luckily, there are still 19 days in my warrenty, but I'm 100% positive that it will happen again. And when it does, the ipod won't be under warrenty. Then I'll have to buy a new one, because Apple charges $250 to fix broken ipods not under warrenty. I'll deffintly go for the 20 gig then. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS. It works great at first, but it breaks easily. And by the way, it's not just an unlucky coincidence that both of them broke. I've talked to other people who had the same problem. DO NOT BUY THIS.

I recommend it to anyone who hasn't really explored all the musical options of the world (teenagers) or someone who loves their music, but has a small music collection. I love it, the design, the colors but the only disappointment was that the battery life is like more 6 and a half hours rather than 8. When they say 8 hours, they mean 8 hours of continuous music, if you turn it on and off alot,use the scroll wheel constantly or use the backlight you have alot less time.

<Content>The sound is wonderful.  Setup is easy.  Unfortunately, batterly life is really, really bad.  If you charge it and start playing, you may get up to 2 hours of listening time.  Unfortunately the battery runs down when you AREN'T listening, too.  So, when I listened for an hour and then did not recharge overnight, by the next morning the battery was out.  And it does not recharge quickly, it takes 3-4 hours.  This has made me disinclined to use it or carry it around -- it basically only works if I have JUST recharged it.

<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod mini (silver) for Christmas. It is a very good product. I highly recommend this product for anyone who loves music.   People are always saying..."why buy the iPod mini when you can buy the 20 GB for only $50 more?" Well....the reason that I bought the iPod mini is cause i wanted a smaller MP3 player than the regular size iPods. And...will you ever fill up the iPod mini? 1,000 songs is a lot of songs and even if you would...you cant even listen to them all without having to charge the iPod...so why would you want that many?   The only problem that i have had w/ this MP3 player....is that it froze once and i had no clue how to un-freeze it. And i had the backlight on and the battery almost went out. Then i finally found out how to un-freeze it.   Thats the only problem that i have had with it. Besides that....it hasnt giving me anymore problems yet.   ~Nick

<Title>great for the gym
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't buy it at amazon, but  i thought i'd leave a review any way. I mainly use this thing at the gym so battery life and storage space aren't issues to me. The only thing that stops me from giving this player 4 stars are the earphones. They suck and there always falling out. I use a pair of panasonic earphones that I bought for about five bucks and they work much better. The playback sounds good to me and it can go loud enough to cover up that annoying aerobics music my gym plays in the area I stretch in.

<Title>Ifs and Buts, mar this nice device. 
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple as always makes great looking devices, aesthetically. Be it Laptops to the MP3 players. The concept is great, it is compact, sounds great. The problem is what is inside it. I know we bitch a lot about Microsoft, but they have set the standard for software capabilities & usability, that you can't expect with others. No wonder Microsoft rules the markets.   Now just imagine, you load your iPod with 1000s of songs, from so many computers and Disks. You cant get them out of it if you lose your hard disk on the computer that has the library. iTunes that comes along with your iPod is quite primative, please use RealPlayer 10. iTunes seems to have a buncha installation and compatibility problems too. They have been in the market for decades, they are stable and the software is available for free download.Does the same thing with a lot more control and capabilities. RealPlayer is made for iPod. Cleaning up the disk on your iPod? Forget it. If you use the Windows Format utility, it is dead. You have to download a 30MB iPod restore software to wipe it clean. Thanks to RealPlayer 10, it will do it for you. Much more clean and easy.   That having said, sans all these, it is a cool, sleek, nice sounding device. Hope you enjoy!!

<Title>Rockin' my face off
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife gave this to me as a gift about 3 weeks ago and I love it. We had our Mini with us during a recent trip to Mexico, and it proved itself with wonderful sound quality, an admirable battery life, and great options. It was a great asset to have during a cumulative 10-12 hours of travel time.  The mini itself is easy to navigate and understand. She essentially told me how to work it, and the ease in which I have been able to use it has been wonderful. At first, I didn't think much of the 4GB amount of space, but it's been great for me as a person who never transports graphic or movie files.   I found the headphones they provided to be more than acceptable and the sound quality I've experienced has been great. At this point, I normally use my Mini while at a desk (while working) and (wonderfully) the mini never gets in the way of any of the work that I have to do. Even better, the mini isn't any sort of hindrance to my coworkers. If I were to ever work in the dark, I know that the beautiful blue hue of a lighted screen would work to light my way (used it on the plane).   My only discrepancies are minor - the Mini is seemingly easy to scratch. I looked at mine yesterday and noticed a few gashes in it whose origin I know not. Further, any sort of accessory for the device seems to be kind of pricey after you spend $250 on it.   The bottom line: This is a great toy to have, albeit expensive. Tons of options and features make for a wonderfully diverse product. Works as a well-received gift or a smart personal purchase. Don't be rough with it, travel a lot with it, and enjoy.

<Title>good investment
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got some Christmas money and had a little more lying around and had my heart set on the iPod mini, especially after one of my roommates got one for Christmas and a guy I know from church wouldn't stop bragging about his.  Both of them said that the iPod was the "best MP3 player" out there.  So I looked further into it and decided to get the blue mini.  I got mine with the three-year warranty, and I have not had any huge problems with it.  I downloaded the iTunes store to my Mom's computer (since I was home during Christmas break) and it automatically asked if I wanted to transfer all existing Windows Media Player files into the iTunes format, so that I could use them in iTunes.  Media Player wouldn't let me download everything-iTunes informed me that Media Player had "copy protected" some of the files in Media Player, so my mom and I are still in the process of re-downloading her Japanese Anime music into iTunes.  But for the most part, my mom is hooked on the iTunes store and the quality of iTunes player itself.  And she doesn't have an iPod or iPod mini yet.  It took me several days to get a good chunk of music into the iTunes player, because I could only work on it in two hour stretches, what with my getting ready for school and all. Once I finally figured out how to use my blue mini, I got hooked on it.  I bought a few accessories, including a cassette tape like thing that allows me to play my iPod mini using my car's stereo.  When I went back to school, I decided to download the iTunes player/store to my computer.  It wiped my iPod clean while it was configuring it (again).  My roommate also had the same problem.  Not all the CD's I have access to are on my computer-some of them belong to my parents and brother, who are a good two hours away.  So not everything I want is on my mini, but I still have around 200 or so songs.  Other than that snag, I have one other problem-the battery.  Every night I have to recharge the mini because in the course of six hours I have an empty battery.  The battery dies faster than the one in my cell phone, and my cell phone is older than the mini.  For the most part, I have liked the mini, though.  The belt clip is nice, so is the sound quality, I liked the ear buds (they actually fit my ears), and the color is nice, although mine has gotten dinged a few times even though I take pretty good care of it.  It works very nicely-and is a good replacement for my discman.  The iPod mini is a pretty good MP3 player, and I like how I don't have to cart around CD's anymore, and it fits in my pocket.  Oh, and I would also like to point out that you do not have to have a high-speed USB port for the iPod to work.  I only have a regular, non-high speed one on my computer, and it works just fine, just a little slower.

<Title>everything is great except the battery life
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>first i should start by saying the iPod Mini is my first MP3 player. i've never used any other MP3 players, so i'm not sure how the iPod is in comparison. i chose the iPod after doing a lot of online research. i had friends that had iPods and loved them. so i finally decided on a mini.   it took a while to set up and configure, but i read through the manual and everything was fine. i do like the iTunes software, and found it pretty easy to import my CDs. the design is nice and fairly simple to navigate. the mini holds about 1000 songs which is fine if you have a moderately sized music collection. i have about 300 songs so far and will probably get another 500 to fit on there.   however, after charging the iPod overnight, i discovered that i only get about 2 hours of battery life. what i was not aware of is that the iPod drains the battery even when it's turned off. after a few days the battery is completely drained, even if i only listen to it for an hour total. i tried to find out if this was normal, and found nothing of help on their support website (which was pretty difficult to navigate). i finally went to an Apple store and left it with them overnight. they said that it got the average amount of battery life when they ran it and that it's normal for it to use up the battery even when it's turned off.   so overall, i gave the iPod 3 stars because it's a good product if you don't need a lot of battery life. i would recommend considering other options before deciding on an iPod.

<Content>After the joy of getting 5283 tracks (some 27 minutes long) on my (relatively) new iPod 40GB, I could not resist the green mini iPod for those special occasions and short bicycle trips but mainly because it is a VERY sexy, sleek little lady which is a wonder of modern design and technology.  Don't get me wrong. I adore my wife and children and get all human pleasure I need from them but for my passion in music, my collection has received the justice it deserves. On it I have reserved only the very best tracks from the best music - such as John Coltane's CRESCENT, Anita O'Day singing SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, Miles Davis playing MILESTONES, Beethoven, Haydn Trios, etc  As grandfather three times over, this little green mini has just added more joy to my autumn.

<Content>This is the best little device I have ever seen.  It has made my life so much easier - no more cd's littering my car, and only my favorite songs so no having to fast-forward past songs I don't like on cd's.  Playlists allow me to have certain songs for driving or working out or winding down at night (it's so small it's easy to jog or wear while working out).  The cassette adapter is best for the car in my opinion.  It's so easy to uplosd songs from cd's or to buy music from iTunes.  I encourage anyone to get this.  I belive it's the future and eventually we will all have one.

<Content>I've owned my iPod mini for 5 months nows and continue to enjoy using it as much as I did the first week I owned it.  A few notes:  PROS: - easy to navigate controls & intuitive programming; my sister tried mine out and exclaimed several times, "it's so smart!"  Doesn't take much time to get the hang of how it works. - excellent sound - eyecatching exterior - comes with iTunes, a straightforward, easy to use program for organizing your music.  From here you can purchase music online or upload your own CDs.   - comes with a sturdy beltclip, which is handy when you're at the gym or engaged in outdoor activities  - comprehensive user manual   CONS: - a little pricey - stock earbuds get uncomfortable after more than an hour of use - my iPod mini froze once after siblings tweaked with it; however, the user manual provided instructions on how to reset it & the issue resolved - though you can browse through music available in other iTune stores (e.g., the Canadian or Belgian stores), if the song is not also in the American store you will not be able to download it.  I'm still waiting for the Tragically Hip's "Phantom Power" CD to come to the US!  Final Verdict: worth the pretty penny it costs

<Title>Great, Product, but Expensive
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Battery Life- Battery life is an issue, but I can get a solid 4-6 hours of straight music playing time per fully charged battery. It does drain the battery when it is off, because it keeps the time loaded and other data that you can save on the mini such a dates, notes, and etc.  But it charges 80 percent in the first hour and charges when it is hooked up into your computer through the USB cord.   Other then that I think it is a great product. I was not a fan of Itunes, but it is alright for transferring your songs and is easier to organize your online library.   Some other things to note is that if you are a college student you get a discount, 20 bucks off. Also if you are someone that has a lot of music consider the normal Ipod, because it is only 50 dollars more for a 20 G instead of 5 G memory.  I love my ipod mini, it definitely catches the eyes of people walking down the street. The headphones are okay, but invest in better ones since you are paying for so much anyways for the Ipod might as well get the best.

<Title>Ipod Mini is at the front of the digital music revolution
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love MP3 players, and I have practically traveled across the entire industry to find one the perfect one.  I think I may have finally found it.  The Ipod Mini (Silver) seems to be everything I could have ever wanted in a music player.  It's compact; it has an intuitive design for navigating the player (the revolutionary `click-wheel' technology); it's light (which makes it perfect for workout); it has an amazing capacity for songs (4GB; approx 1000 songs) for a player so small; and, it just plain looks cool.   My Ipod Mini was a birthday gift, and certainly one of the best I've ever gotten.  The sound quality that this player provides is nothing short of amazing.  While listening to my Ipod Mini, I've listened to songs that have been favorites of mine for years and I have heard hundreds (maybe thousands) of times.  Yet, when I hear them on this player, there are layers of sound that are new to me, and the songs all have a richness to them that I have never experienced before.  The sound quality alone is reason enough to get an Ipod Mini (or any Ipod for that matter).  Its capacity of 4GB (approx 1000 songs) may seem low in comparison with its larger (in actually size and song capacity) cousins: the 20GB and 40 GB Ipods.  Yet, unless your goal is to put your entire CD collection on the player, the 4GB size is more than enough.  You must also consider the fact that this player is smaller in overall size, meaning the technology inside is miniaturized and there are fewer moving parts (a definite plus when working out).  I've had this player for over three months and between songs I have downloaded, select songs from CDs that I want, and complete albums that I've put on the player, I've barely exceeded 500 songs.  Thus, I have nearly half the player's capacity left.  Since the Ipod Mini can also act like a portable hard drive and hold text documents and contact information, I will have plenty of space to put those files, too.  The navigation of the Ipod Mini is pretty impressive.  Its `click-wheel' technology lets you scroll through your entire library of songs with just the lightest touch of the device.  While on a song, you can use the middle button to scroll through play/volume mode, play/song length mode, and `rate the song' mode, using the `click-wheel' scroll to adjust the volume, advance or rewind the song, or give it a rating based on a 5-star scale.  The actually click icons on the wheel allow you pause/play a song, advance to a new song or return to a previous track, or go back to the previous menu.  The menu structure is very consumer-friendly.  It starts at the very top with access to the Ipod Mini's different features and then moves down to different ways of navigating those features.  The music menu allows you to access your songs by album, artist, song title, genres, composers, and playlists.   The Playlist is an ingenious feature that allows you organize your songs in any manner you see fit.  You could create one playlist of, say, 50 songs to listen to while working, while having another playlist of 100 completely different songs that you like to listen to on the job.  There's even an `on-the-go' playlist feature that lets you just add songs to the on-the-go playlist as you listen.  The only aspect that I find less than stellar is the iTunes software interface.  This is not a problem with the player. It is just that the iTunes software, which enables the upload of songs from the computer to the player, is not nearly as intuitive to work with as the Ipod Mini is.  This is a minor concern, however.  You adapt quickly to using iTunes and then it's just another extension of this great player. Other than that, the battery life is pretty solid and the built-in battery recharges fairly fast.  Plus, there are also a plethora of accessories to enhance the Ipod Mini experience.  This player comes in 5 separate colors (Gold, Pink, Blue, and Green, in addition to Silver), and each one has its own personality to match that of its owner.   This is a fantastic MP3 player and is at the very topic of the digital music food chain.  For anyone looking for a top of the line music player, look no further.  Your journey has ended.

<Title>Very Good - Better than a Portable CD Player !
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple iPod mini is a very good MP3 player for the person who has a fair to medium size CD collection, and wants to create a greatest hits compilation for travel purposes. The iPod mini is easy to stuff into your pocket without having to carry dozens of CD's in cumbersome cases. I have taken all of my Boston Pops albums, movie themes, 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's music and collected the best hits to store on the iPod for future airplane trips and vacations. So far 750 tunes have been stored on this neat little gadget (over two days of music) and there is still room left for more songs. To buy a larger iPod means paying for meaningless memory storage for which I will most likely not use. The software was easy to download, but you must have the latest Windows XP programs, a 500 mghz processor, and a broadband internet connection to make it work correctly and reap the full benefits of iTunes.   Most other reviewers have hit on iPod's biggest negative - battery power and battery replacement. According to Apple's website they have an external, commercial battery support system for regular iPods. They need to do something similar with power storage for the iPod mini. Paying $100 for a new battery after it wears out is gouging the consumer, and the mail-in exchange process for a new battery is silly. Apple could also work on creating a fade feature to soften the rough edges of music changes. However, the overall sound the iPod mini reproduces is excellent, especially with Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones. The people at Apple have done a great job with the iPod mini, just continue to look for improved battery life and power beyond an eight hour charge, and more convenient features and accessories.

Waiting for a cheaper alternative to the 400 dollar 5GB version, I meant to get the 10GB, then the 15, then the 30, but I was extra cautious about how much I was spending. Then I saw the 4GB ipod mini. Perfect!!!!  This is excellently engineered like all ipods, it's smaller. And you can pick your color instead of spending the extra $15 on iskin. Brilliant sound quailty. This combined with Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2 is the best stereo system I have ever used and heard.  I also noticed the mini is faster than the 20GB click wheel version. Also check my review on the Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2.

<Title>Great!
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my blue mini for Christmas a few weeks ago and I've loved it ever since. I've really blossomed into a big music fan over the last year, so I'm glad to have my entire 550-song collection in one place. It's great to have your entire library at your fingertips - I can go from a new Velvet Revolver song to a 20-year-old Metallica classic with the push of a button. And the mini is so small and compact that you can take it with you anywhere. The user interface makes it easy to navigate through your collection without lifting your thumb, and I had little trouble inmporting my collection from iTunes to my iPod with the help of the instruction booklet.  The backlight is a nice feature - though it drains the battery, it's great for nighttime use. I like the games they include on the 'pod as well - Music Quiz is an ingenious idea, and Brick and Parachute are fun, simplistic time-killers (I don't know how to play Solitaire).   That said, I do have a few nitpicks. One is how fast the battery drains. If you want to use this thing often, be prepared to charge it often - I must've charged this thing at least 10 times in the first two weeks of owning it. I wish they had provided some kind of carrying case with the iPod - I know it's durable and everything, but I'd prefer to shield it from scratches and rough handling in my backpack. The headphones were a major disappointment. Why? They broke just two days ago. I hadn't even had 'em for three weeks! And I didn't throw them or mishandle them or anything - they just broke. Now I can only hear out of one side. That was a pain in the butt. I would have hoped Apple would have provided some better headphones to go along with this excellent device.  But those few problems aside, this thing is awesome. I would definitely recommend it to someone with a music library of up to 1,000 songs who wants an easy, convenient way to carry around all of your tunes. A very worthwhile purchase.

<Content>I love this thing.  I use it every day, everywhere - home, the office, the gym.  The mini holds about 900 songs.  A great accessory is the Altec Lansing portable speakers -- they fold up up the size of a small paperback.   I bring it in the office in the morning and home at night.  The only downside is that i-tunes is not the most accessible web site and hard to search.  Plus, if you use dial-up its hard to preview songs and takes forever to download (but that's dial-up's fault, not the i-pod's).

Amazon swears it was a mistake. I was so humiliated when the person called me to tell me they already registered the ipod, downloaded songs and then noticed a ladies name on it.  I gave it to a man.  Personalized items should not be returned and accepted by a company.  After several emails I was only credited $20.  I paid $255 in total and all I get back is $20!! Not to mention they sent a replacement which is not what I wanted, WITHOUT telling me first.  The person doesn't want to download everything again.  Now I'm stuck with returning the item.  I'm considering never ordering from amazon again!

<Title>Beware, the ipod mini is addictive!
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, before you even consider purchasing an ipod mini, check that you have all the required components! If you want to enjoy a superior quality music player, expect to put in a bit of work, by ensuring your computer is properly equipped!  When you first bring your ipod home, it seems daunting to set up. Before i got the ipod, i didn't even know what a USB port was. I just found a hole on my computer, and figured that must be it! I definitely don't advise this though! So if a technically challenged 16 year old can figure it out, I'm certain everybody can! The novelty and excitement of owning an ipod mini can certainly cloud your judgement, I've encountered a few problems, but it's gorgeous appearance and cool features always seem to outweigh it's flaws!  I  think it is overpriced, but I love that it comes with basically everything you need to get started- it includes power adapter, 2 cables, itunes software CD.     Surprisingly, the itunes program is a pleasure to use, and you can have a whole CD transferred to your itunes library in a matter of minutes. Once you put a CD into your computer, itunes automatically converts the songs into AAC audio files (superior in quality compared to mp3's). Plug your ipod into either a USB port or firewire port with one of the included cables, and the songs will begin to transfer. In my opinion, the sound quality is just as good as listening to the actual CD. I hardly listen to the radio anymore, because I have the handy option of listening to my favourite songs instead! The menu is easy to navigate, songs can be organised into various categories, games are included, a backlight and alarm is offered.....all in all, a beautiful little product.

<Content>Apple has proved once again that people will buy things if they come in pretty colors!!  Like their successful original imacs, which came in a plethora of colors and sold through the roof, the ipod mini is doing the same.  Let's put it this way; you'll buy the ipod mini if you're trying to make a fashion statement and show hip you are, but aren't really serious about music.  No serious music fan would be satisfied with a device that only holds 1000 songs, when they could buy the 20GB ipod for only $50 more, and have 4000 more songs!!!  Do they still teach economics in school?

<Title>Oh Mini iPod Hums
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a little embarassing to admit given that I am a 1)  guitar player 2) an Apple computer devoteee for over 20 years 3)  a programmer  4) have over 500 CDs and 5) am generally a technogeek who spends on average 6 hours a day in front of a computer - but I had completely ignored iTunes and iPod and all that stuff. My car has a CD player and I had always listened to CDs that I wanted on the way to and from work.  And I have a pretty decent 6.1 surround system at home for watching my rock and roll DVDs et al.  So when my wife gave me a sliver mini-iPod for my birthday, along with an FM transmitter so that I could charge it and play it in the car, I smiled and said thank you and was less than thrilled.  But then I looked at iTunes and thought, "Wow, this is a pretty cool program."  I liked the playlist idea and started encoding my CDs and making playlists. 7.8 Gigs later (only about 1/4 of my CD collection) I am ecstatic.  I like Rock and Roll.  I hate the radio.  I remember when DJs played what they wanted, and made segues and miniconcerts and albums that sounded great.  Nowadays, it seems like there are on the order of 3 or 4 "approved" songs for each artist.  Like the Rolling Stones?  Well, you can hear "Can't always get what you want", or "Satisfaction" or "Miss You", but you'll never hear "Sweet Virginia" or ""Fingerprint Files".  Themes?  Forget about it.  Like live music?  Forget about it.  Radio is dead.  Then came iPod.  Oh Joy.  I make playlists of  genres and moods, or artists or, hell, anything I want. Copying these (and the associated songs) to the 3.7 GB iPod hard disk is quick and easy, and automatic.  Want to use your iPod to transfer huge libraries from computer to computer?  No problem.  Apple's software won't let you because of possible copyright infringement issues, but plenty of third party software lets you do it quickly and easily.  I can also keep my calendar on the iPod and download MapQuest directions and Swedish cookie recipes.  Yes, you can use the iPod alone.  The earplugs that come with it are OK, but I don't use them. I had a set of Sennenheiser noise cancelling headphones and the iPod drives them just fine and the sound is outstanding.  I also hook the iPod up to my home sound system for parties.  Totally outstanding.  I have been using the high level headphone out (got to keep the iPod volume at about half or so for best results) but things are fine.   I have a minidock upstairs that would probably be better (it has a low level line out) but I don't want to buy another and it needs a computer.  I never have any problem with power. Between my Monster FM car adapter (which charges) and my minidock, the thing never runs out.  I estimate that I would get at least 6 hours between recharges using my Sennenheisers and that's fine with me.  I've used it at home and in the car and at work for over a month and never had a single glitch.  I started encoding with Apple's AAC at the default 128 kpbs and although I could not hear the difference with any headphones, I could when I connected it to my home system.  So I upped it to 192 kbps and now cannot hear the difference (at least with rock and roll and my old, guitar-damaged ears).  So, yahoo.  What a totally  cool thing.  It's a hobby in and of itself.  Great software, great hardware and tons of fun.  Highly recommended.  Addendum February 4, 2005  I have been reading about a minority of folks who have had trouble, usually repeatedly, with various iPods.   The repeated trouble is a clue that points towards user error.   The iPod is a hard disk drive - relative to other hard disks it is very hardy and durable but if you throw it around, bang it against hard objects while running, let it freeze outside in your car etc., I am pretty sure that it will malfunction. Think about hitting your desktop with a hammer.  Meanwhile, with a bit of common sense care, I expect mine to last for quite a while.  Also, the battery complaint is a strange piece of fiction.  If you look on the internet, you will readily find a number of replacement batteries (should the need arise) at less than $40.

<Title>Not that great
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I loaded about 5 cds on to it and after about the 5th song of every album, the songs started to skip. I know it wasn't the cd's because they play perfectly on my disc-man.  I also had a very hard time figuring out how to get songs loaded on to it.  Lastly, why would they make the battery so hard to replace. When the battery's life runs out, what do you do?  For the price, I wasn't very satisfied. I think this device is extremely over-priced actually. I wouldn't recommend it for all the flaws that are present.

<Title>iPod Mini Rocks!
<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>About everyone who's lived in the U.S. for the past few years has heard of the iPod. Its gained a reputation for being sleek, beautiful and functional all at the same time. It is the definition of style and creativity. The iPod has a worldwide fanbase of nearly millions of people, and is the most sought after gadget of our time.  With the iPod Mini, Apple obviously takes a step in a different direction. Instead of having a mammoth hard drive like its older siblings, the Mini has a smaller hard drive (4 GB), but is a lot smaller and comes in 5 colors. One would think that with such a small hard drive (compared to the other iPods) that you wouldn't be able to hold very many songs. But, not to worry, the Mini has a lot of room to keep you rockin' for hours. (It can hold about 1000 songs, which is incredible for a device of this size)  But of course, one of the main appealing points of the iPod Mini is its design. Its very small and compact (2 inches wide, 4 inches tall), and is very light. The case is anodized aluminium that resists stains and scratches. (I dropped this thing from about 3 feet off the ground accidently, and there were no scratches on it at all. Not even on the screen) And, you can choose between Green, Blue, Silver, Pink and Gold.  You may be looking at some of the Mini's Competitors, such as the Rio Carbon or Dell Pocket DJ. While these devices may offer a little more storage at the same price, they cannot play iTunes AAC files. AAC is a higher quality music format than MP3 or WMA, and only iPods can play it. iTunes is also the best music download service; it offers hundreds of thousands of songs fo download, and offers prepaid cards for those of us without credit cards. There are also no monthly fees to pay, and the prices for albums are a lot cheaper than regular store prices.  My only complains about this wonderful device are that while stylish and comfortable, the included ear buds are prone to falling out when you run for extended periods of time. Also, when you install the iPod software, you are required to enter your Mini's serial number, which is printed in very small font on the back of the Mini. Other than that, this device is absolutely perfect.  So, if you're looking to revolutionize your digital music experience, buy the iPod Mini. Its small and compact, and the sound quality is incredible. Definitely a must buy.

<Title>Great Device but a few errors
<Date>Sat Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved the ipod MINI for christmas. Only it was pink. It was working great for a couple of hours and then i started having problems. After i would use it for a long period of time it wouldn't come on for like 2 days. My sister and i took it back to exchange it and i got the silver one.   This one seems to be working really well. Here's some tips for interested buyers:  1) Be sure to buy prepaid itunes cards they are so easy to use!  2) Make sure you're computer is compatible with this item  3) Be ready to buy insurance! (i had to)  Overall the Ipod mini is really a great item! But battery charging can be tiring. What i do is just before bed charge it so that way i don't have to waste the daytime. The ipod is so cool and the features are nice too. I actually got 13 free songs from itunes.com!  Buy it!  Love, Spursfan

<Title>For those who have a smaller music collection
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Everyone knows that a 20 GB iPod is fity bucks more and that you get 5 times the amount of space. The reason? The iPod Mini was for people who don't have a ton of music! I'm looking at my iTunes screen now and I've got 1.48 GB of mp3's now all encoded at 192 kbps! Also, the iPod Mini does resist scatches a whole lot better than all regular iPod's. If you have over 4 GB of music, pay the extra fifty bucks, if you don't mind your iPod getting all scratched. If you have a smaller music collection, or would rather have your iPod not get scratched, save the  fifty bucks for some new CD's and buy an iPod Mini.

<Title>Appreciating & enjoying music like never before
<Date>Mon Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini has literally changed my everyday life. Music is a prominent component in my everday existence now, and I enjoy and appreciate it like I never have before. Being able to conveniently carry such a massive collection of your hand-picked favorite songs is a convenience and pleasure I can't even put into words. Hate household chores? Try it with your iPod. Hate jogging or walking for excersize? Try it with iPod. Trouble relaxing enough to fall asleep? Try it with iPod. Anywhere, anytime, only your favorite music. Sick of radio commercials and only liking half the songs? Thank heaven for iPod. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, this little treasure has changed my life. I have never loved music so much.

<Title>Hard to Use Hi-Tech Gadget
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a reasonably tech-savy guy, but at home I like my life simple and my gadgets easy to use and the Ipod Mini is neither of these.  To be fair, I'm 47 years old and this was my big introduction into mp3 players, and maybe I'll stick to CD's like my father sticks to cassette tapes.  I also use a Windows PC, which I understand doesn't work as well.  But with that said ...  Right off the bat, the installation is a pain.  You have to install several different applications that require numerous pluggings and un-pluggings of the Ipod.  At one point I was instructed to unplug the Ipod from the USB port and plug it into the power adapter, something about a firmware reboot, but what the heck, it should be able to get power from the USB, right?  Even the serial number is challenging for those of us over 40 ... you have to copy it from the back of the Ipod and it's there in low contrast 0.2 point font.    I knew I was in trouble when I took the protective plastic sicky off the Ipod and printed on it was a long list of reminders about special multi-button-hold-for-a-while commands to do obscure things like turn it on and turn it off.  Basically the device has only one button and you just massage it in about 60 different ways to attempt to coax it into doing what you want it to do.  But it doesn't really care what you want to do.  After you finally get the software installed and the Ipod plugged into your computer for the 13th time, it proceeds to take a tour around your hard drive, locate every obscure piece of junk song that happens to be there, and start downloading it to the Ipod.  I had no idea that stuff was there, don't really know where it is, other than it's now on my new Mini and I can't get it off.  I tried deleting the songs, but the Mini woke up and downloaded it all again.  That's OK, when I tried downloading a CD that I owned, it took me 15 minutes to figure out that the file/import... command does something entirely different than the "import" button and the one that I wanted took forever to accomplish.  Does anyone with a real job have time to download their music collection onto a computer?  It took me a while to figure out how to get that one button to adjust the volume, and then once I did I discovered that every time my finger came anywhere near the button the volume keeps changing.  So ... I think it's "cool", but I don't like it.  I'm going to download a couple songs that I'll use for jogging and such, but you have to really want to futz with it to take advantage of this thing.

<Title>Nice...but I should have gotten the larger versions
<Date>Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With each generation of the ipod getting better and better, this one was no exception.  Unlike the 20 and 40 GB versions this ipod will only satisfy some of your music needs.  4GB is still a large amount, but you will notice that you will be in the tough spot of having to decide which Dave Matthews album will have to be left out to get a little John Mayer representation on there.  For me it is very hard to decide between my favorite albums so the larger size may have been a better deal for me.  The upside to this version of the ipod compared to the 20 and 40 GB's is the battery life.  The larger versions eat up battery life considerably quicker than this small compact version.  From some of the other reviews I have noticed something about compression of the mp3 file makes the difference in battery life, meaning you could get well above what the larger versions get.  I will have to play around with that and see what happens.   Having one for myself, I am planning on getting one for my father, and I'm sure this will by far be the best birthday present he has yet to receive.  Sadly I had not the funds to purchase another device, so after my brother receieved one for a very small amount of effort via the website [...]  If you are really interested in this device but don't have the money or are not willing the spend such and exorbant amount, [...] and soon enough both yourself and my father will be basking in the joy of a free ipod!  Cheers!

<Title>The best little MP3 player around!
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having used multiple iPods over the past couple of years I finally bought the iPod mini for my wife.  The size of the mini is fantastic.  It fits perfectly into the palm of your hand and the ease of use is amazing.  The scroll wheel combined with the simple user interface is what makes the iPod so easy to use.  Also, iTunes and the iTunes Music Store make organzing and purchasing your music a snap.  Apple owns the MP# player market, and deservedly so...all other mfr's are trying to come up with the iPod killer...a tough challenge considering how the iPod is perfectly tied to iTunes and ITMS.  iPod is the best gadget one can own!

<Content>Received a Mini for X-mas.  Love it.  Enough storage for practical use, well built, sturdy, intuitive controls and menu commands & the perfect size for carrying in a jacket pocket. The "HOLD" button is a great idea to keep from accidentally changing the menu settings (volume, play/pause, skip, etc). Even the earphones are great with a wide dynamic range.  Only faults I've found so far are in the stated battery life and in the control wheel sensitivity.  Do not believe the hype about "..up to 8 hrs."  So far, the most I've been able to get on a full charge is 4 hrs. Perhaps without using the 5 sec backlight delay, the duration might be longer.  The control wheel pad is very sensitive and I often found myself accidentally scrolling past my intended menu selection.  Still, it is a product worth getting.  Personally, it's the best gift I've received in years!

It worked on windows XP, which i have, i installed the software, put a few cds onto itunes. I took my ipod off the computer AAAAND It didnt have any songs on it. I have tried loads of times to put the music on, but none have worked. It says it would work faster if i had a "hi-speed" usb port. What exactly is that supposed to mean. I have a fairly new computer, but it dosent appear to have a firewire or another usb port. There are 2 usb ports but one is used for internet. I really dont know what to do.

<Content>Everything about the IPOD mini is easy and great.  I had no problem setting it up and downloading my CD collection, and I am not a technology wiz.  For most people, the 4 GB mini has plenty of storage space.  I've downloaded over 12 hours of music, and have a lot of memory left.  The sound and the software is great.  Its easy to create playlists and to access all of your music.  The only downside is that I haven't been able to download other music that I had previously downloaded online.  Itunes supposedly converts music downloaded from other sites, but I haven't been able to do that.  Otherwise, I'm totally happy with my new IPOD mini.  I have previously purchased several other MP3 players, and returned all of them.  The IPOD mini is a great product.  Also, you can use the money you save by buying the Mini instead of the 20 gig alternative to purchase a superior pair of headphones.  Earbuds never worked for me.  Buy the Mini, get great headphones, and enjoy!

<Title>A must have for music fans with a decent library of songs
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my silver apple ipod mini since christmas and i have over 780 songs uploaded on it so far. This is a very slick and very handy mp3 player. The scroll wheel in my mind is almost revolutionary in how simple it is to navigate with. It is so simple to transfer music onto your ipod all you do is plug it in to your usb port and itunes automatically transfers the songs straight onto it. My biggest and ONLY gripe withthe ipod mini is the battery life. Simply put the battery life completely sucks. Unless you are willing to run your battery COMPLETELY down until it is barely running you will get about 5 hours max out of a normal battery charge 3 1/2 or 4 if you are using the backlight at all. The backlight seriously sucks up the battery extremely!!! Iwill have to get a car adapter for it to charge with if i am on any road trip, but the thing is a little cigarrete lighter charger for your ipod mini will cost you over 40.00!!! Kind of expensive hardware after you just got done laying down almost 300 bucks for the mini. But like i said the battery is my only gripe and this is def the coolest christmas present i have gotten in a long time!!

<Title>A near perfect MP3 player with a few minor flaws
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently perchased the ipod mini silver from BestBuy a week or two ago, and I loved it. Unfortunately I dropped a heavy charger on the screen and it cracked, so, just my luck I guess. But my dad bought me another one and sold the cracked one on ebay. I got my new one tonight, and it works pretty much the same, except I'm VERY careful with it now. I guess it's not really that the ipod is, well, flimsy, because it's really actually quite durable. Just dont drop anything on the screen, because it IS glass and the LCD will just flow together. It's my fault, but yeah, now to get on with my review, about the actual product.  I bought the ipod for the same general reason that everyone bought it. It's sexy, slim, and I certainly dont need any more than 4 GB of space. I've heard that it's actually 3.7 GB, but none of the less it'll still take a whikle to fill up that space. Right now I have about 900 MB, so yeah. Anyway the ipod mini is sturdy, perfectly designed, and beautiful, so no cons on the easthetics. My few minor nitpicks are the durability of the screen, and the clickwheel. I told you about the screen, how it can easily be broken. So be sure to get yourself a nice case to protect your investment. And the clickwheel is a bit unreliable at times too. Dont get me wrong, it's amazing technology, but I've had friends say that their clickwheel popped out or broke off or something... so be gentle with that too. But the rest is sound, minis are equipped with an anodized aluminium case that resists stains and scratches.. or so apple claims. I've seen them get scratched, but meh. Anyway, the interface/menus are really great, nothing to poke there, Apple's award winning menus and navigation are perfect, and all at the touch of your thumb. And the backlit LCD display isn't a horrid bright blue or green like so many earlier electronics, it has a beautiful extremely BRIGHT backlight that's a very pretty light blue color, very clear, very easy on the eyes, and very very bright. You can like use ipods to signal in airplanes.  And now for the software aspect. I have windows XP and it actually works pretty well. Itunes is a pretty good music program with very few flaws. The nitpicks I have are these: It's a little slow, and I have a decently fast computer, 1.8 ghz, and the reaction time for clicking on some things is a little prelonged, but that's just me being nurotic. Another downside is when you buy songs off the itunes built in music store, they're in a format called MPEG4, which is apparently some new kind of file that only plays on iPods. Windows Media player wont play them, my other RCA MP3 player wont play them, and they're protected so you can't convert them (to my knowledge) so Apple kinda screwed us windows users there. But I guess we can just use iTunes and our ipods to play music for the rest of our lives, so who cares. Plus, these new file types do sound great.. I only wish they would just let us download universal MP3 files. Oh and you dont have to have a credit card to download music. I just went up to Target and bought a 15 dollar itunes card, it let's you download 15 bucks worth of songs, however what is actually kindof misleading about these though is that you THINK that you're gonna get 15 songs, but you dont. They actually charge tax on their songs, so by the time you buy 13 or 14 songs, you're done. You'd have like 45 cents left or something. Not a big problem, but that is a bit tricky. Napster sells 11 dollar cards and you can get exactly 11 songs on theirs.   Anyway, onto the longterm issues. If you're going to buy an ipod, make sure that you're getting a warranty on it, because it really sucks to pay 250 bucks, have it break, and thats the end. Also word has it that the ipod battery gives up after a year or two, and you have to send it in and have it fixed for 100 bucks. So see if you can get a battery warranty protection plan also. That's what I got the first time, unfortunately, Bestbuy only replaces your battery, they dont give a rats ass about cracked screens. Be very wise when buying these, think about it.  And that's about it, except for one thing. A lot of people are liking this but there's one thing pushing them away, the price. And you're right, it is quite a bit overpriced. Most of what your paying for is the Apple brand. That's why the new Dell pocket DJ is a lot cheaper and of a lot better value. The Dell Pocket DJ is the same size, and same basic look as the apple ipod mini. It costs 50 bucks cheaper and it has 5 GB, not 4. So there you go. You can buy into the Apple craze, like I did, or you can go with the dell Jukebox, and be a bit smarter. The only reason I liked this one more is because I like how it looks more, because I'm just an aesthetics person. But you make the choice for you, style or storage.  Hope this helps!

<Title>iPod mini---Like a ton of CDs in 3.6 ounces of beauty.
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am 14 years old and I got a pink iPod mini for Christmas! The pink is lovely--at times it has a lilac tone to it. The sound quality is great, iTunes was very easy to set up and use (for me anyways). Opening the beatiful little box was like an out-of-body experience for me! (Turns out my poor mom had been hiding this away since November 16---she had to endure weeks and weeks of whining, andeven more before that!)The iPod mini was very easy to set up right out of the very attractively designed box! My iPod only froze up once on me and that was very easy to remedy. Just make sure to charge often! After going through my entire 12-song library a few times in a day I find it necessary to charge either sporadically throughout the day or at night. I have added some items to my iPod collection to enhance my music experience. I will share them with you:  1. Apple iPod earbuds with rubberized tips--the best thing I could have done. The included earbuds just didn't work for me. These cost me $40, but they are worth it as they never tangle thanks to the ingenious spool-storage system of their carrying case and they have two sets of replacement tips.   2. Handstands brand "iPak"s--I got a 2 pack--one case for my accessories, the other for my iPod. There is an insert to keep the mini secure in its case. The cases are identical but one is clearly marked "accessories". For me, the easiest way to keep my iPod and its accessories all in one place, safe, and portable.  3. iTunes prepaid music card--I have one for $15. It is so easy to use one of these to "feed" your iPod--just type in the code on iTunes in the designated "Prepaid Cards" section in the music store, and you are ready to go. You can pick one up and preload it most everywhere iPods are sold.  4. Handstands "iGrip"--I set my iPod on this while it charges. The iGrip is a little rubberized white pad designed to grip onto any hard surface. The front of it grips onto your iPod, preventing "slippage".   And for those who say "cough up an extra $50 for 4000 more songs", well, I don't think I even know 1000 songs let alone 5000! Well, to each his or her own. Make the choice you think is best. If you are an occasional music listener, like me, who thinks "I sure would like to hear this song" once in a while, the Mini may be for you. If you are really into music and have a hugeC D collection and can name your favorite songs off the tips of your fingers, maybe a 20GB or 40GB regular iPod would be best for you. I prefer the mini for its colors and smaller, attractive case, although the iPod itself is nice looking. I can't tell you much about the mechanics of my iPod, and I thought it would be helpful to share my little tips. I hope you find my review helpful! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY IPOD, PARTICULARLY THE MINI!  If you don't have one, go out and buy one right away!!!

<Content>My 11 year old nephew calls me and says he got an ipod for christmas and asked since i am an apple certified technition to help him with the setup and pop on some songs, he has a pc and i have never tried it on that platform, all i say is like anything else read the manual install the software first and your golden, after setting his at home i started to listen to the sound quality the included headphones are okay but as soon as i changed to my sony headphones i was hooked. went out and bought one for myself. i have been through 10 different mp3 players hands down this is the best. do yourself a favor save up for this its worth every penny. do not try different players they do not match up to the ipod mini in any way.

<Title>IPODS ARE THE GREATEST THING EVER
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>OMG I just got this Ipod a week ago for x-mas and I absolutly love it. Everything is wonderful about this Ipod. It has so many wonderful features and makes things so easy. I borrowed all my friends cd's and dowloaded there songs, and now I will never have to spend another dime on over priced cd's. It's wonderful!!! I highly suggest you get one, but there is one thing that you need to know that I didn't know, you MUST have windows xp or Windows 2000 or you can not do ANYTHING with your Ipod. Other then that I would HIGHLY suggest this product! Nothing but smiles.

<Title>Not so cool
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased a Creative MP3 player in the summer but decided to buy an Ipod because of its range of features and cool factor.  The Ipod's MENU button never worked and without the MENU button you can't navigate through the system.  I followed the manual explicitly and reset the Ipod countless times to no avail.  After reading many users describe the same problem on the Ipod discussion board I opted for a full refund rather than a replacement: Amazon's refund policy and procedures are excellent.  For now I'll stick with the Creative MP3, which works well.  The Ipod is hip, but only if it works.  Happy New Year!

<Content>I got the iPod Mini as a gift for Christmas.  It was the most frustrating Christmas.  I tried for two days to get the iPod working, gave up, sent it back to my relatives.  Anybody interested in knowing the iPod, please try this. In Google.com, type the following phrase (along with quotation marks): 	"ipod s--ks" Also, fill in the missing letters.  Believe what you read in those reviews.  I had the same trouble.

<Content>This product is GREAT.  It is easy to use (the click wheel makes it so easy to adjust the volume or change songs) and includes games that you can play at the same time as you are listening to your music.  The iTunes software includes almost every song you would want to download.  It is also very easy to transfer songs to your iPod mini.  Literally, you plug the iPod in and it transfers your songs in a matter of seconds.  The iPod mini is gorgeous (I have a green one) and very easy to use.

<Title>GREAT product!
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Yes, I've seen the reviews saying the mini isn't worth it when you consider "price per Gig", but who will REALLY store that much music on their MP3 player?  Certainly not me.  The iPod Mini is a great product - very well designed, easy to use (especially with iTunes), and compact.  The main reason I went with a mini vs. the full size iPod was size - much easier to strap this one on using the optional armband and then hit the gym or the beach.  Another great product from Apple!

<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After buying a 256mb IRiver [...] and quickly realizing that It wouldn't satisfy my need for more than 50 songs, I returned it for a 1.5 [...] and again realizing that the interface was awful I couldn't even read the screen it was so light that I had to put it right up to my nose to see the [...]! Not to mention that both of these products are made very cheap, plastic and they don't feel like they would last a 12 inch drop. So once again I returned it and just borke down and got a blue IPod Mini. WOW what a difference the interface is awesome, and the wheel control is out of this world, with a 4 gig hard drive for only [...] more than the 256mb IRiver and only [...] bucks more than that piece of [...] RIO why would anyone buy anything else IPods rock they are heavy duty and made rock solid you can tell its a very well made product! The interface is awesome it automatically organizes you music by artist, song, genere, and you can even make playlist! You can upload .txt files and it has a clock, calender, and more man this thing is in a league all it's own, now I know why the price hasn't come down yet! The only pit falls I can fortell is the built in battery, how much will it cost me to replace it? Note that the crapy RIO had a built in battery as well. Also the IPod's software isn't the easiest to navigate and you can only use it on one computer, and there is no Windows interface usage that means you just can't drag a song to the IPod to load it you have to use the software, but that's really minor compared to the awesome quality of this product and even more so when you start to compare it's competition! What Competition!!! Get a [...] IPod!!!

<Title>For those who don't need the storage
<Date>Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini works exactly as its larger capacity cousins, the 20GB and 40GB models, do.  With it sensitive click wheel, navigation through the music is effortless and intuitive.  Downloading from iTunes is automatic upon plugging it in, although the user can manually select tunes, especially useful if your music library exceeds the memory capacity of the iPod.  The iPod tutorial CD explains many of the features not discussed in the instruction book.   The iPod mini does have its differences, most obviously its size and memory.  It is about half as thick as the 20 GB model, with a much smaller face.  Although not as tiny as many conventional MP3 players, it slips easily into a pocket.  The case is brushed colored metal, which hides fingerprints and scratches much better than the shiny backed iPod.  It comes packed with the same ear bugs, Fire Wire and USB 2.0 cables, and home charger as the larger models do.  Users will need either Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later OR Windows XP OR Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4.  Your computer needs either a high-powered USB 2.0 port or a six-prong Fire Wire port.  (PC users can purchase a card to upgrade to the correct USB version.)  Computers need to run at 500 MHZ or faster.  ITunes is the only music software that works with the iPod, although music can be transferred to the program using CD's, either professionally or home burned.  The biggest drawback to the iPod mini is its small memory capacity, only 4 GB versus the 20 GB of the next higher priced model.  If you are considering buying a mini, you should decide whether the cool colors and tiny size are worth the limited memory.    The iPod technology is first-rate, with great sound, a multitude of features, and smooth integration with iTunes software.  Whether you buy this mini version or one of the larger ones, you won't regret it.

<Content>...i agree with some other reviewers about the colour. i got a pink mini iPod today for christmas but (don't get me wrong this is like its only fault) the colour shown in pictures on the apple website and amazon is totally NOT what it really looks like. its kind of a darkish lilac colour, which is really cute but not what i expected. i love everything about my iPod mini (especially the music quiz - it ROCKS!). i've got 474 songs on it already! a perfect christmas present! :)   UPDATED: my mini was working just fine then one day i plugged it into my computer to add some new songs to it and it keeps telling me "no iPod connected" and won't update it. has this happened to anyone else??? what can i do?  UPDATED AGAIN: we rang the apple hotline and they were very helpful (even if it took hours to actually get through to a person not a machine) and told me all i needed to do was reset my mini!

I have only a few minor complaints. The headphones provided are aggravating and the foam covers fall off easily. Another issue is the slightly confusing setup of iTunes. Other than that it is operating wonderfully. The design is beautiful, the sound quality is A+ and I am really excited to use it in the future. You get what what you pay for, plus some.

<Content>THis mini ipod was great! i am 10 and i am obssessed with it. It comes with a software device that is very practical. I am acutally listening to it right now. And it is so clear it sounds like a sterio in the room. The only suggestion i make is that You should get other headfones: A- They fall out quickly. 2- They break quickly. i got this mini ipod for christmas and everyone found it amazing. The green one is the best. it holds 1000 songs. and everyone says it feezes, and it never did. My brother who is 13   had it for 1 year (since last christmas) and it has never frozen. I love it. i also comes with itunes which is awsome!! U can download stuff from that or u can put in a cd and press import. The mini Ipod Is also much better coz i can bring it around like to school or on vacation. They also have games and my favorite. it gives u multiple choices and it plays a song and u have to check on which one it is. The song never shakes. Also, it doesn't take much time to download it from itunes to the mini ipod. I got it with a clip so i can clip it to my pants when i'm walking around the house. What is amazing is that it never scratches and u only need one small plug to attach to the computer. It is the best thing i'v ever had, And my older brother uses it alot. I hope this helped u

<Content>I have one of these, and it is one of the best things on the planet. Loading a CD to your itunes library is quick and easy. setting it up can be a little frustrating, but it's worth it once you get it going. The sound quality is awesome. And it's easy to organize your music any way you want. You can do it by songs, albums, artists or genre.And loading a CD from your library is really fast. For people with about 50 CD's they like, they should get the 20 GB iPod instead. But this is a great choice for people who don't have all that much music.

<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am 15 and recently recieved a pink iPod mini for Christmas. I read the other reviews and I have not encountered any of the problems described. I have read too many reviews complaining of the lack of memory on the iPod mini, but I don't forsee it as being a problem. My question is, why do you have to carry every song you've ever liked on your iPod? Back when I just had a CD player, I didn't carry every CD I'd ever bought with me! My taste in music changes and I always get bored with the same old songs, so isn't it better to continually change the songs based on your intrest, rather then have 20 or 40GB full of songs you hardly ever listen to? Sounds stupid to me, but for all the other people, go knock yourself out and spend an extra $50 or $100.

<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first Apple experience and what a disaster. The IPOD itself is very nice, but to use it you need a windows installation and from what I have learned so far, if you have a laptop, you're up a creek.  Apple has not support/warranty to speak of so you are on your own.  Blue screen of death, spontaneous reboot,  probably another $50 for a firewire card that might fix things, and no idea , no FAQ, no nothing at apple to help.  This is like dealing with Microsoft.

<Title>Why The Negativity On The Ipod???
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received my ipod for Christmas. Like many, I was overjoyed, I couldn't wait to open the package and see the little player waiting for me to add countless songs onto it. I had been reading several reviews with many "displeased" people, none-the-less, I was excited to finally have one.   The first thing I did as soon as I opened it was read the manual. Honestly, the manual was not very user-friendly. I found it very vague and ended up figuring out a lot of the things on my own. That is one of the main reasons for a four star rating.  I then hooked it up to charge for about an hour until it had fully charges.   Then, I took the USB connecter and hooked it up to the computer. I then inserted the provided itunes software and began installation. Probably one of the greatest improvements was that once it "found" my ipod on the computer, it automatically connected with apple and formatted my ipod with the latest software updates to ensure none of the listed problems: freezing, crackling sounds, etc, would happen on my ipod. After updates I disconnected my ipod from the computer and set it aside.   Once the software was installed, this is where the frustration set in. My songs were loaded and by clicking the checked boxes I was able to pick which songs would transfer to my ipod when I connected it to the computer once again.   I finally had chosen a few songs. I then highlighted them all using shift and control and clicking the ones I had chosen then I right clicked and converted the files to AAC format. The reason I did this was because this file format is the best format for the ipod and provides, in my opinion, the best sound for the ipod. After about 5 minutes all of the songs had been converted. I then closed out of the program, and hooked my ipod up. Once my ipod was hooked up, the itunes software re-started immediately and updated my ipod with all selected songs that had a check in the box column. Within 3-4 minutes all songs had been transferred to my ipod.   The above paragraph sounded easy, but it took about 5 attempts before I was actually successful.   There is, however, yet another downfall to this program. If you have windows XP, you have multiple log-in options. If another user is logged on when you are also logged on, the itunes software will not update to your ipod. I have tried several options in the "edit-preferences" section of itunes, but have been unsuccessful at updating my ipod while another user is logged on.   Now, in addressing other issues such as battery life; personally, the battery life is fine with me. I would however suggest that one of the first, and best things you can do for your ipod, is let it charge for about an hour or until the ipod says that it is fully charged. This ensures optimum battery power. I have gone about 7 1/2 hours with my ipod as well as backlight on, before the battery is drained.   Also, the ear buds provided with the ipod are "ok". The sound in them is great, I have not really messed with the optional EQ settings that come with the ipod, but the normal sound is in itself good quality. The only problem I have is getting them to stay in my ear, thus I end up using my inner-ear headphones majority of the time, which provide the same quality of sound.     Beside the few downfalls:  * Vague Instruction Books * Complicated, at times, software * Incompatibility with windows XP when multiple users are logged on * Loose headphones  The ipod is overall a great piece of software. But, as with any software there will be glitches, and soon something new and better will inevitably roll around, but at the moment this is in my opinion, one of the best mp3 players on the market. Sure, you are buying largely into a name, and into a "fad", but you won't regret it. Even my friend, who is anti-apple all-the-way, had little to hardly any bad things to say about the ipod.

<Title>There are better things out there
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If your looking for a good deal, check out the Creative Zen Xtra before you purchase this! You can get a 40Gb Zen Xtra for the same price as this 4GB iPod. You get 10X more space, plus much better sound quality than this. The iPod doesn't allow you to use it on more than one computer, so if you have a work computer and a home computer, you can't use it on both to transfer your songs. The Creative can be used on many computers without a problem.   If the battery breaks on your iPod, you have to send it away to get it repaired because you can't remove it. With the Zen you can take out the battery and replace it with a new one. This way you don't have to wait a long time to get your iPod back from being fixed. Also, you get more sound options with the Zen Xtra, including EAX which allows you to change the type of sound. You can make it sound like your in a stadium, concert hall, living room, cathedral, etc. If you have EAX for your computer, you know what I'm talking about. The headphones are also very weak on the iPod. My friend purchased this and the headphones broke in a week. The Zen Xtra's are better quality than Apples headphones. If you want really good headphones though, buy a pair of Sony's that go around your head and not into your ears like both MP3 players come with. I personally find ear phones uncomfortable, and strongly suggest a pair of Sony's.   The iPod may be a good piece of equipment if you have a few songs you want to listen to, but just sit and think to yourself. Do I want to spend the same amount of money for 10X less space, and less sound quality just to have a the Apple name in my pocket and be at greater risked to have it stolen? I think not. Check out the Zen before you make your purchase. I guarantee you'll be glad you did.

<Title>Not bad! If you like to spend more than it's worth...
<Date>Fri Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Not bad but don't get suckered into the hype. These iPod are extremely commercialized. What they fail to mention is when the batteries for these "wonderful" iPods have completely lost their charge you have to send it back to MAC to have the battery replaced. The batteries are meant to last about as long as a rechargeable cordless phone. 1-3 years max. Than it's off to MAC for a battery replacement fee and shipping charges. So do try to estimate how much you are willing to spend.   Software issues: try not to speed through your MP3 collection like you would when pressing the button too fast on a CD player. The iPod will lock and you're stuck performing an "unfreeze command" that I'm sure is listed with other reviews. (Press & Hold both MENU and PLAY till the iPod resets).   By the way, I don't recommend the remote unless you're interested in purchasing that same remote every 3-6 months, since that's how long it takes to break down.  My advise: All technologies improves. I'd say to wait it out and soon a better, less bugged version comes out. Or just enjoy spending your money on this one and enjoy it while it lasts! And of course, wear it like an accessory to show you have wealth.   Personal question: Why'd I buy it??  Answer: It was a gift, that I greatly appreciate and will continue to love!! I'll just have to invest in it from time to time.

<Title>The Mini iPod Rocks!
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>To start off with; I am an avid runner and have gone through my share of walkman's, MP3 Players, etc. The Ipod is lightweight to run marathon distances without being bothersome, but packs a lot of features and music. I prefer the 4 Gb model because in working out I have more than enough songs to choose, also, in iTunes you can download as many songs as you want and just check or uncheck what you want downloaded on the iPod. The added expense and weight of the 20 or 40Gb model wasn't worth it for me personally. The strength of the iPod is the iTunes software that comes with it. It is very flexible, allowing you to create 'smartlist' that automatically sorts and updates according to your desires/tastes (it also has bundled CD burning software with it). Also, iTunes pushes software updates to you, so you never have old software that won't work with your computer and MP3 (as with Real Tunes/Samsung MP3 players). I've had other MP3 players that I found too difficult/bulky to use, not very user friendly, or propriety formats that won't work with any other platform (Sony, Samsung, Rio, etc.). The downsides are the battery (8 hours on a full charge, have to replace in 12-18 months @ $100), it's not as well priced as it probably could be, and only has a handful of colors to choose from (I have the green, my wife has the blue). But to play devils advocate, Apple products are more expensive generally, and usually worth the extra $; additionally, for the amount of use and pleasure I get out of my mini, I will gladly pay the $100 to replace the battery after a year. Ask any other iPod user what they think...without a doubt, it has drastically changed the way I listen to music, and I'm now a diehard fan. I'm now considering other Apple products because I'm so happy.

<Content>I got my ipod early for christmas, and it has been great ever since. There was one problem setting it up and it was a real pain in the butt, but finally it worked. The battery life is ok, but get it charged for four hours first, then use it. you don't really use the calendar or games, except for the music quiz, which is awesome. the ipod is amazing

<Title>Buy the mini or spend more $ for the photo IPod
<Date>Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the mini it as a gift for my 12 year old daughter - she likes the cute size and the color.  The mini is "mini,"  it is very light and so easy to use.  I was worried I wouldn't know how to download the songs.  On ITunes it is automatic, literally, to transfer music downloads just by plugging it in.  It's almost too easy.  Of course, you are going to want to fill it up with songs so that can become pretty expensive at $1 per song because it's so easy and fun to buy them and have them.   As for the ourchase of the larger Ipod you do feel like it's worth a few more dollars to get so much more space but how much do you really need and are likely to ever use?  If you are going to spend thousands of dollars over time on songs then you are just going to delete the old songs and fill with the Ipod with new ones. You are not going to go scroll through thousands of songs to find the ones you want to listen to regularly enough.   I can't imagine that we'll ever have enough songs to even fill up the mini.   The problems with the Ipod, probably mini or not , is ease of scratching the metal case and the little touch buttons on the wheel are either too sensitive or not sensitive enough to use.  You must really buy a good case which will run about $35.00. I got one from Iskin. The Ipod should come with a case, that's just wrong for Apple not to include one.  The battery life is short, about 6-8 hours, amd that's in the brand new battery.  That's pretty short in the scheme of things, less than one full day, so you're always recharging.       Right after I bought this mini Ipod I realized the new Ipod  that holds photos was out.  I think the choice of which Ipod should should be between the mini and the photo Ipod.  It would be really hard to need the 20GB or 40GB Ipod for songs but the photos is something you could use and need the space for, you also may want to hold tons of photos.     The investment is really in the $$ you will spend after the initial purchase of the empty Ipod.  I would definitely have regrets about not getting the photo Ipod if I was buying for an adult but at over $100 more for the photo one, I wouldn't spend that money for a teen.  As far as music players go, I can't imagine a better player for looks and ease of use.  But you don't need more space than for the mini and the teeny size is sooo neat.    (...)

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my pink ipod mini about a week ago as sort of a pre-Christmas present.  Anyway I love it.  With the itunes cards which target also sells it is really easy to download music.  I would like to suggest that anyone who does get a ipod mini should get an ipod dock, not a mini ipod dock.  The mini ipod's are not plastic on the outside like the regular ipods.  The ipod mini's have a brushed metal outer case and if you use the ipod mini with the ipod mini dock, your beautiful new ipod will get all scratched up on the front.  I hope this helps anyone thinking of buying one of the ipods or mini ipods.

<Content>These mini iPods seem pretty expensive for their approx. $250 price tag especially when you know that you can buy one with 15 GB more space for only $50 more. But here's a reason why their so popular! They may have less space but they are also MUCH SMALLER. Lighter and even more portable. I appreciate that for snowboarding. Plus, the offer below actually works, I got mine for free... I even saw it on the news! They get their iPods from amazon... :)  [...] Enjoy your iPod!

<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>At first I was all, "Woo Hoo" but after 3 days my Ipod froze and never came back so I exchanged it at Best Buy for another one. 2 hours later, it turned off and never turned back on so I exchanged it for ANOTHER one and then this one had battery failure.  Yes, it may be cute, but if you're gonna put up that kind of money, get the 20 gig. After I got my full refund and a month later on my birthday I bought the 20 gig and I LOVE it! I can fit 20 times more songs and it's reliable! And a month later @ Best Buy I oddly saw 4 ipods on markdown out of box. (I swear to God those are all mine)

<Title>Think about capacity before you buy this vs Regular iPod
<Date>Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The silver iPod mini was my first foray into the iPod craze. Part of it was to see what all the hype was about and I was not disappointed. It is one of those rare devices that is not only very functional but also generates a huge emotional attachment.    I was surprised at the envious looks I was getting, some people even obviously pointed and commented at it.   I LOVE the feel of the clickwheel.  I did not understand what that was from descriptions until I actually used it so I will try and explain it. When you slide your finger over the round touch wheel it allows you to adjust volume, scroll or do whatever the function you are on.  All it takes is a light touch and it can be done in any direction up/down, round and round etc. It is also speed sensitive, meaning it accelerates your scroll the faster you slide your finger. The clickwheel makes it possible to control most important functions without even looking at the unit. This feature alone puts the iPod mini and regular iPod (4th generation) in a different league from it's competitors.   I never had any technical problems using it, and I enjoyed how well everything worked seemlessly together even though I am using iTunes on Windows.   Now for the only negative. 4GB memory. At first I though this would be more than I could possibly want.  However, once I started using iTunes I quickly decided to import all my CDs into it and dump my CD changer.  Then I also found out that to get true original CD quality I needed to use the lossless encoding which makes each song about 30MB on average or about 6-8 times larger than the default encoding. There is a noticeable difference in sound quality if you import songs at the smaller sizes. On top of that I started to use the mini iPod to transfer files like a mini hard disk.  The end result was I had to buy a 40GB iPod and gave the mini to my daughter. I miss the small size and cool look of the mini though.

<Title>iPod mini beats competition
<Date>Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought my iPod mini (silver) a few weeks ago. I have known about other players, such as the Creative Zen Micro, the Dell pocket DJ's, and the Archos Gmini. The Creative Zens and the Archos Gminis have been known for their hard drive crashes and incompatibility with many music stores. Even though they may seem to offer a better deal, the cheap casings of those products already reveal that the product you are getting isn't worth the money. The Dell pocket DJ is a very respectable product, with just two complaints. It doesn't support the MPEG-4 AAC format, which is one of the more advanced music formats, and is also what iTunes sells its music in. The pocket DJ's interface is also very cluttered, unlike the click wheel interface of the iPod mini, and iPod 4G/HP iPod/iPod photo/U2 iPod.   The iPod mini has a very impressive case, anodized aluminum with no seams, anywhere. It is also very hard to scratch, unlike my 4G 20GB iPod, whose shiny back is not so shiny anymore. The iPod mini is also more durable than the competitors, as well as the standard iPods, it it's many variations. The iPod mini, though it doesn't look too much smaller than the regular 20GB iPods, is almost only half the weight. However, if you are determined to store all of the CD's you have in an uncompressed format, you should still go with the regular 20GB or 40GB iPods.

<Title>Best MP3 player
<Date>Thu Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I won a mini Ipod when it first came out months ago (first quarter 2004). I didn't care for it too much because I didn't listen to music really.  I saw the mini Ipod only to be another one of my latest gadgets.  No one really had it back then, and I certainly did not believe it would become as popular as it is now.  Months later it is the top christmas item, and it has good reason to be.  Each day, it becomes more and more of a commodity to me.  I use it always, listening to music that I hardly ever did before, and its highly fashionable, a great product.  You  know everything about the iPod mini, the reviews, pros/cons and specs. already tell everything.   Some people apparently are complaining about that it freezes or that the hype draws from it.  First of all, the freezing is common in all Minis, so don't try to switch it out.  They all do it.  Plus its not even a problem, it doesn't ruin your songs or HD.  Its happened several times to me now.  Also, the more hype it gets, the more I realize how lucky I am to have one.  There's nothing wrong with everyone having the "same thing," if the same thing, the same MP3 player, is the best MP3 player.

Not so where the purchase is passed-through to Circuit City -- some time after you order you get e-mail that says the product is not available.

<Title>great for mac, just ok for windows
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have researched MP3 players alot this year because I'm getting one very soon, I have witnessed all of the mentioned products hands on. The ipod is built by apple. It is made for a mac computer. And it is really the best thing you can get if you are a mac user. However if you have a windows computer and windows media players there are other better mp3 players for cheaper. The Creative Zen is a great product for around $215. But the major plus is that it plays WMA (windows media audio files)which take ups half of the space that the ipod files do. This advantage applies to many other mp3 players too. Also if you want to put any songs on your ipod you MUST go though itunes. This is annoying and just extra complicated software you have to put on your computer. The ipod mini is also a weaker product if you are a mac user. It, like the regular ipod, does not play WMA files. A great alternative is the new Zen Micro from creative. It is about the same size being a little shorten and a little deeper. It plays WMAs and has a built in radio and digital tuner. It comes in more variety of brighter colors such as lime green and orange plus both light and dark blue. It is the same price as the ipod mini but a better choice unless you own a mac. Most people aren't educated about mp3 players so they automatically think the ipod is the best. This is because it is advertised the most and therefore bought by the most people.  If you are a windows user I recommend these product before the ipod:  1-Creative Zen- Great value for same amount of memory and more songs, also nice touch bar instead of wheel 2-IRiver- Bigger than most but a very high quality player 3-Dell DJ-Cheapest if you buy it from dell but not as nice looking of as nice to use 4-Ipod- Nicest control (scroll wheel which is just great!) and design, also the popular choice by most people who haven't researched mp3 players  If looking for a mini mp3 player:  1-Zen Micro-Nice bright colors, with capability of playing wma and has a built in radio also an extra gig of storage 2-Rio Carbon-Smallest sleekest design just lacking the controll of a touch bar or wheel also cheaper than the other two quality players in this area 3-Ipod Mini-Same price as Zen micro with 4GB instead of 5, nice if you like metallic colors, pretty design and scroll wheel again this isn't my favorite because i think going through itunes to get my music uploaded is a hassle

<Title>darn sexy but...
<Date>Sat Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I will keep this review short, as they are 300 behind it. I just go t this iPod mini, and I just want to tell my experience. So I was very excited when I received it, it's really slim and neatly designed. I hooked it up to my laptop, and it worked fine to get it to work with itune, and it was easy to install.  But then I could not get it to work with my other computer. It is annoying, cause my music is split in between the two computers, and I cannot get it all onto the iPod. Maybe I'm just a klutz, but I haven't solved this problem yet.   Anyhow, I got a few mp3's onto the thing, and right then, as I have had the device for less than 2 hours, the menu button on the click wheel froze. I could click down the menus using the select button, but I could not go back up. Once I ended up with a menu with nowhere to go, I was caught in a blind alley. You can imagine how disappointed I was. I tried to reset the device, I tried to reformat it using the iPod program, and nothing worked. I was going to send it back to apple when I ran into a message board that explained that many people had the same problem.   It turns out that pressing the click wheel while putting the device on and off hold (the function that locks the click wheel so that your keys in your pocket don't change the track inadvertently) recalibrates it to a value that pretty much disables it. So I did put my iPod mini on and off hold, and MIRACLE! it seems to work again.  Anyhow, it is a darn silly user interface problem, and it almost ruined my iPod experience. (oh, and the other thing is for those who don't like to read user's manual: don't look for the power cord from the device to the charger, it is the firewire cable. Not quite obvious...)  Otherwise, it is a great little thing. I am so happy, it is one of the best Christmas gift I've had.

<Title>My excitement about this product wore off quick
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After very frustrating issues with several Sony products recently, I decided that everything Sony makes is crap. That included my MP3 player, which until then I had been reasonably happy with. But I was mad and decided I was done with Sony, so I started doing some research on the iPod mini. After reading some of the reviews and was extremely excited to go pick one up. Unfortunately once the initial fascination wore off, I had to admit I was pretty disappointed.  The only place I use MP3 players is at the gym. I can see that this product would be much better for someone who used it for more every day activities, but it just wasn't right for me.  1) I really have no need to keep 1000 songs loaded at once. It takes way too long to scroll through all of the albums and find something I'm in the mood to listen to...then once that is over I get to do the search all over again. Plus you can't really do this without putting everything down and looking at the iPod. Not very convenient for me on exercise equipment. I know that I can create playlists, but that's still more work than I'm used to on an MP3 player. I prefer the smaller capacity...just load 8-10 CDs that I like that month and swap them out when I'm ready for something new.  2) The battery life is totally unacceptable to me. I use my Sony at the gym 3-4 times a week, and I think I charge the battery once a month or less. After taking the iPod to the gym just twice, it was already down by half.  3) Everyone really seems to love the scroll wheel, but to be honest it annoyed me. When I'm doing cardio at the gym I'm rarely standing very still...and trying to adjust the volume via the scroll wheel while I'm exercising is a pain, it's just too sensitive. I'd much rather just have a button to push.  4) I was not impressed with the sound quality at all. I'm sure if I wanted to invest even more money in it and buy better headphones it would improve, but $250 is already quite a bit. I hate the equilizer settings...there's hardly any bass (when I pick the 'bass-enhancer' it just sounds distorted). I want to be able to set the bass & treble where I want them...none of the presets cut it for me.  5) The additional features on the iPod were of no use to me at all. I don't need games, a calendar, or phonebook at the gym. Like I said, this product would be better suited to someone who uses it for more applications. I have an excellent Palm pilot to keep info like that on, so I'm not going to spend the time duplicating it on the iPod. Plus I didn't see any options in iTunes to enter this kind of stuff...so I assume you have to do it all on the iPod itself. No thanks.  I returned my mini to the Apple Store after using it at the gym just twice. There were a few features that I liked, but that did not make it worth the money to me. Much as I hate to admit it, my Sony player is a lot better than I realized.

<Title>WMA issue
<Date>Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am delighted overall with the ipod, though I think the earbuds could be improved.  What I want to address is the issue of WMA compatibility. Since I use a Mac, this issue is not that important to me, but I see it raised in many reviews, insofar as it applies to windows users. The apple site advertises WMA conversion on windows (to either AAC or MP3). In other words, for windows machines, itunes permits you to import WMA files, converting them either to Apple's proprietary format or to the more universally used MP3 format. I don't understand why there are so many statements that the ipod is "WMA incompatible". Is it that the WMA files do not physically reside on the ipod? Or is it that the extra step of conversion is inconvenient?  One thing that may be an issue is that the WMA files must be "unprotected". Apparently WM Player by default rips files from a CD into "protected" format and you have to change this default setting in WMP before the songs can be imported. This means 2 steps: 1) a one time change of your WMP settings 2) dragging your WMA files into itunes to convert them.  Perhaps someone might address this in a more factual way than I am capable of. It seems to me that the ipod can readily utilize WMA files, but that there is a convenience factor--is the overall usability of other mp3 players sufficiently superior to the itunes/ipod interface that the steps outlined above are burdensome?

<Content>This is the best Christmas present I could have bought for myself. It arrived in 3 days. I had purchased the armband and in-ear headphones.  It was easy to set-up and iTunes is very user friendly. Synching up songs went well, even though I don't have USB 2.0 the speed to me is acceptable.  The only minor thing is I didn't like the earphones that come with it. When I was working out they would often fall out. The sound seemed a bit tinny as well. Buy the in-ear buds and you'll be set. I jog, lift weights at use it at the gym with no problems or skipping.  It is so small it fits in the palm of your hand. No worries about tangled headphone cords and fits easily into my gym bag.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Too many glitches....Not worth buying
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am a serious business, management audiobooks listener. Over last two years, I must have heard around 70 books. Keeping track of cassettes, CDs was a big hasstle until I discovered that audible.com offers a lot of MP3 format. So through their online promotion, I purchased I-POD mini gold from Amazon. I  run Windows XP on my computer. I quickly subscribed to Audible.com's Wall Street Journal and started using i-pod on my way to  office. and here starts my misery:  The software of I-Pod from the day one gives a lot of problem.  System hangs or I-tunes responds with a lag of 30 seconds. It just tests your patience. Sometimes i-tunes doesn't kick off automatically or sometimes it opens yet does not recognizes I-Pod. So every day at 7A.M. I spend 10 minutes to half an hour struggling to download my WSJ News capsule. Great promist but very poor delivery!!  And the worst was when I called support number of I-Pod, the lady in India said that I will have to pay $50 for the support. She said only first call is free and all subsequent calls will be charged??? What kind of service is this.  I spend $180 on audible subscriptions and $250 on I-pod only to get nothing..Very bad experience  My recommendation: Don't fall into  the hype. Let Apple and Microsoft resolve their issues. Buy some smaller 128/256MB MP3 player and don't make your life complicated in the name of listening I-POD.  Rajit  Parashar

I like the iPod Mini because it has a compact design which I could take to work or for a jog easily. I wish though this would hold more songs. It only hold 1,000 songs while Dell Jukebox holds about 2,500 songs. I wish I got the Apple iPod Photo because it can hold up to 15,000 songs (60 Gigabytes) and it has a color screen and of course can hold your family photos.

<Content>iPod mini is the hottest gadget of the year, the best mp3 player around. There is absolutely no competition for the ipod's, no other player is even half as good as ipod.   Pro's, 1. Small size (smaller than most cell phones like Motorola Razr V3) 2. Extremely well desgined (let's hope Apple makes a cell phone and PDA in near future) 3. Very intuitive interface (award winning touch wheel and minimal buttons) 4. 4GB hard drive (enough space for about 800 mp3 songs) 5. Available in many colors (hopefully Apple will come up with Nokia style faceplates for future mini's) 6. iTunes is one of the best music software around (rate songs, keep playcount, sync with the ipod) 7. Excellent screen for such small size 8. Comes with everything in the box to get you up & running 9. Tons of innovation accessories in the market (from Bose speakers to colorful socks!) 10. Everything about the ipod has been designed to perfection   Con's, 1. The battery is internal with no replacements possible in future 2. Battery life is a concern, its need to charged quite often. 3. Price is still too high   Its simply fabulous and I am running out of superlatives to describe it. Thanks Apple for the iPod Mini!

If you are looking for big capacity or cheap price, there will be many others more suitable for you.  ****charge it fully, 4+ hrs, before use. otherwise a lot of problems will occur and you will be in gadget hell****  the good: 1. light and small, travel friendly. 2. a perfect balance of capacity and price. why buy 20GB when you will never use that much? that would be like buying 10 pairs of shoes when you will only wear one. ok, a lot of you do that, ladies. 3. the headset is high quality, that's not true for most other mp3 players. 4. superb usability in hardware and software. 5. can hold your word documents and can hold your vacation photos if you get one of those belkin brdige thing.  the bad: 1. MUST BE FULLY CHARGD FIRST. you have been warned, TWICE. 2. not all that sturdy, it is made of hard drive, not flash memory, so it's easily broken if you drop it a few times. Handle with care. i.e. don't take it to workout. 3. less individuality since 1/2 of the population buy this, at least that's what I read in the magazine. 4. locks up when some users, I'm not familiar with that, but it seems that it happens to a few of them, but it's self-repairable.  Got it when checking price on WhoSave, also a good list of superior products: http://www.whosave.com/indexEC.jsp?page=audio  I recommend it to you if you enjoy the better things in life and capable of taking care of delicate objects. have fun

<Title>This Is The MP3 Player For You!

<Content>The ipod mini has just come out this past summer and has rocked the charts. Now, I think you would know the ipod. It is too expensive for just a little, little bit more than the ipod mini. The Ipod mini is a nice, little 4GB MP3 player that plays up to 1,000 songs. Its really compact, smaller than most cell phones. That is awesome! But wait....theres more! You can use the nice, easy click wheel to easily scroll. It includes a firewire cable for unbelievable downloading, or you can just use a USB cable (firewire is better;you'll know it;if you buy it). You can even play games, have a "portable" alarm, and have your own personal phone book and calendar. Check out apple.com/ipodmini for more information! This is the ultimate MP3 player. This is a really true gift to give. So buy the ipod mini. Its really awesome.

<Title>THE BEST
<Date>Thu Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As a kid this is the best thing I've ever had.  I love it!  you can play games, personly my favorite game is the music quiz.  They play a short clip of a song and you have to guess what song it is.  Now I won't even buy cd's any more because you can download songs of the internet legally!  You can also write notes, and have and adress book type of thing.  I just got it a couple of weeks ago so I am still exploring it.  I tell ya, IT IS THE BEST.  Anyway why would you want to carry a huge cd player & a cd case?  It won't even fit in your pocket.  When the ipod can.
