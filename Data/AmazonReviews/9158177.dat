<Title>Good but could use some work

<Content>This is a good product for extremely amateur singer. Great for the car though so long as you music isn't too loud (alot of feedback if it is). At home I couldn't find a long enough cord to get away from the speakers so I wouldn't get any feedback so I bought an extension cable from Wal-Mart and that solved the problem. If you use the FM modulator you have to be pretty close to the stereo and that picks up some feedback. Also, the mic picks up alot of breathing noises so I put some foam from some cheap headphones over it secured with a rubber band. You think at the price it would have something over the mic to stop excessive noise. All-in-all though its a fun product and with some tweeking you can have alot of fun.  
<Overall>4

<Content>i ordered this product thinking it would be a blast for a party i was hosting. good thing i checked it out right away or i would have been embarassed at my party.  griffin tech. great idea, bad technology.  i think they need to take it of shelfs for a while, put some more time into it, then rerelease it and hopefully then it will function properly.
