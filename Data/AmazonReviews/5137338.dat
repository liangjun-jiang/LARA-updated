<Title>Creative Zen 8 GB is the bomb!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting for the device that could keep me from having to buy an I-Pod. This is the device. The only thing the I-Pod has it beat on is memory (and I imagine that will change as new models come out).  It plays more files, has as good if not better video playback and I don't have to use I-Tunes to deal with my product.

<Title>hmmm...pretty good
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far I really like this product. It has plenty of space for all the music that you actually listen to and still have space left over instead of paying a hundred more to carry around music you never listen to. I think it has good features, though i dont use them. The interface is simple but it seems to be a little slow scrolling through the menu. this really isnt that bad cuz its like a .1 second delay. disregard that bc its no big issue and will not dtract from the products quality. The materials are good. The buttons feel a little cheap but not bad overall. Overall awesome mp3 player. The software that comes with it is very annoying and stupid. Just use a different program to transfer and there are no problems.

<Title>Other than freezing up, a great player
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the dimensions, screen display, and sound. The recording function works very well, too. The only problem I have is that the screen occasionally goes black and the player freezes. It stops responding to anything and I have to let the battery drain. Once it's drained and I recharge it, it seems fine. I can't find a reason or pattern for the freezing. So far, it's happened 3 times in a month (once after I unplugged it from the charger, once when I tried to play a song I'd listened to already and once when I tried to turn it off). I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with the iPod just for the stability.

<Title>Sound Quality is Superb
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first player I've ever owned for more than a month.  I know some people look for good video playback on players (which this one has), but my focus was sound quality.  And I'm amazed at how this player produces such an incredible sound, even with the packaged earphones.  I'm convinced that this is the player to keep for the next few years.

<Title>Was the perfect anniversary present for four days...
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>**Update: decided to take advantage of the GREAT Amazon return policy and got a new one overnight.  Has worked fine for a week.  Also purchased the clear case (good) and the AC power adapter (an absolute must).  Features, screen size and quality, and control scheme all rate very high. **   I agree with pretty much all of the features and benefits mentioned by other reviewers and let me add my annoyance at the short USB cable - apparently they assume everyone has a USB hub on thier desk these days.  Wife loved it for her anniversary present (I bought this as a delivery vehicle for an edited version of our wedding video) and was enjoying having her country music collection for her commute...for four days.  I gave it to her on Friday, on Tuesday it died. Won't power on, no charging light shows when plugged into the USB cable, nothing.  Tried all the reset operations recommended on the Creative website, no joy.  Called Creative support and after going through giving them all their requested information as well as telling them all the things I'd tried, my cell phone dropped the call.  But guess what - as soon as I hit the redial button, I got the "we've gone home" message (just after 6pm Oklahoma time).  So, I don't know yet what to say about the product reliability or the helpfulness of thier support staff - I'm hoping for the best, since feature/function-wise this was the pick of the crop and my wife really liked it.  I'll update this when I have a resolution.

<Title>Why people buy Ipods?.
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a mp3 player user since 1998, when you had to assemble your mp3 playerusing PC parts, then I bought the first Rio player, the first creative, the first archos, the first Ipod.   This is the best deal ever in a mp3 player.  The sound is outstanding betas the Ipod 10 to 1.  The use is so easy and flexible adaptable to what you really need.  I adujsted the menu to show only the functions I use. The browsing of artist, album using the letter at the right of screen is exactly what I need.  I  am creating a library of SD cards with my favourite music ( just as I did 20 years ago with cassettes) , so I can selct which 4 GB of musci I will use additional to the 8 GB of the player.  So far, because of my SD cards library, the virtual capacity of my ZEN is 36 GB, soon I expect I will have my complete colletion of mp3 in SD cards, classified as I want.   The quelaity and color of the videos and pictures is the best in the market, but the screen is too small to me.

<Title>creative zen review
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i bought the creative zen 8GB mp3 player recently. i love the fm radio feature. the stations come in surprisingly clear most of the time. the battery lasts a pretty good amount also. good sound quality. i really like the earbuds that came with it. very small and light. holds about 1600 songs if there aren't any videos/pictures on it. but has room for additional memory card if wanted. i also like that it is compatible with napster. very convenient. but you have to sync up to the computer every couple of days to update. (small drawback) the only thing that i don't like too much about this product is the fact it sometimes turns off unexpectedly and for no reason. it doeasn't happen all that often but it's still irritating. overall, though, i think this was a very good buy. i would definately recommend this little guy.

<Title>Very Good player
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had read reviews about problems with battery life and freezing, but I also read very good reviews so I was scared if the player would be bad or good. But after it came, I charged it for 4 hours before first my first use. It was automatically a hit for me. Very good player. pro- sound quality!, design, screen, interface, size, sd card, battery has been above 90 for the last two days of use ( not continuous!)  con-back light turns off only after hold, cant add to playlist, but you can make them.  PS. other people said it froze on them, I have the same firmware. It only froze once, my fault, when I was installing the software AND adding songs when I abruptly disconnected the player.

<Title>Splendid Machine
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen is a splendid machine for people who are not technology literate. I loaded my own songs, made my playlists and had a great time doing so. I did all this without having to ask for the help of my children. I was so proud of myself and this product is a great addition to my walking treks daily.

<Title>Good Sound - carry a paper clip. 
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My new Creative Zen (8gb) sounds great with other earphones. Updating the firmware was quite easy to do - download the program from the Creative site, attach the Zen to the computer via the USB cable and run the program. Easy. Adding music was quite easy - I used Windows Explorer. Then I tried using the SD card to play music. I was able to do so. However, I accessed the menu system while playing an MP3 from the SD card. The system locked up requiring me to find a paper clip to stick in the reset hole. Now I am leery of using the SD card unless I have with me an object to push the reset button. Locking up the player during my first 5 minutes of use is not a good sign.

<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Good software to organize downloads and convert itunes downloaded recordings into MP3 and into the unit, in one step.  Decent microphone recorder.  Great picture quality.   Excellent price probably twice the bang for the buck vs apple players in my opinion.

<Title>Few flaws, many pros
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>IMPORTANT NOTES FIRST:  YES, it is iTunes-compatible, and YES it is compatible with Yahoo! Jukebox, BUT ONLY THOSE TRACKS THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED AS "BURNABLE". In other words, you will not be able to transfer your Subscription or Stream tracks to this device, which is only fair (for that, you have to have Yahoo! Music Unlimited To-Go, which is an invite-based service and thus uncommon). Needless to say, you can import tracks from any CD quickly and painlessly, and/or copy any wmv/mp3/mp4 or whatever that you already have on your hard drive: the device is browsable with Windows and all you need to do is copy/paste to the right folder.  Now for the review.   THE GOOD:  ++ Compatible with an amazing variety of file formats, without conversion, unlike iPods. Whatever is not compatible the software will convert for you if at all possible. This is a HUGE plus for the computer-illiterate.  ++ Great sound quality, a bare minimum requirement for a music player.  ++ Sleek looks, IMO superior to the trite iPod-like, spin-wheel design. It certainly got more looks and comments than the iPod I had previously. Also, it's more pleasant to hold in your hand: small but not too tiny, and very sturdy/solid (which, if you'll handle it 8-10 hours a day like I do, is a huge plus).  ++ The included software is fantastic. It's fast, reliable (never froze), and lets you manage files and create playlists quickly and painlessly. Basically, anything you can do with the player's built-in software you can do with ZEN Media Explorer from your computer. So, go for it.  ++ Many complained about the interface, but I actually like it very much. The built-in software is easy to understand and utilize. The buttons are a tad tricky, but all you need to do is play around with them for ten minutes before you're able to find them blindly by just sticking your hand in your pocket (something you certainly cannot do with iPods, whose interface is more visually-driven).   THE SO-SO:  ++/-- The SD expansion slot is both a pain and a pleasure. Yes, you can basically make this a 16Gb with an SDHC card for a few bucks--but it's true that only SOME content will run off of it, and that while you are playing content from the SD card you cannot navigate the built-in flash memory. So, caveat emptor... but if you know what you're getting there's no reason to complain. How many times do you really browse your music while you're already listening to something else anyway?   THE BAD:  -- Perplexed about battery life info: "25 hours of continuous listening"? I don't think so. More like 10-12, which is on par with similar devices.  -- The shortest USB cable ever bundled. Buy a cheapo extension from Monoprice right away, unless you already own a USB hub. Otherwise, your player will lie on the floor or, worse, hang by the cable while it's being charged and sync'ed, neither of which is good.  -- The joystick buttons make a slightly annoying clicking sound, not when pressed but when released. However, this does not happen on my friend's ZEN, so maybe I got a "bad" unit?  -- AWFUL packaging! What were they thinking? Not only is it one of those impossible-to-open blister packs, but if you use scissors it's relatively easy to harm the contents... not the player, thankfully, which is in full sight, but the manuals and CD and bundled cables. So be careful.   OTHER THOUGHTS:  ** BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR! Apply it immediately. The screen will collect dust (and thus scratches) within hours, like any LCD. ** BUY A CASE OR SKIN! Piano-black finish is attracted to fingerprints like flies to s__t. ** 8Gb is perfect for the serious music listener with varied taste. Buffs and pros want to go for 16Gb. Occasional listeners will do well with 4Gb. Media moguls, of course, need not apply: that's what the Vision is for.   Overall, one of the best entry-level portable music players on the market. The price tag may well be the deal-breaker here: it is cheaper than any other brand music player, and it does the same things AND, in my opinion, more and better. Support by Creative is also famously good, so I see no reason not to buy a ZEN.
