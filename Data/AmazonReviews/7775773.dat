<Title>Upgrade from Micro Zen
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say this, no subscription service Apple, no dice.  I want a choice and ITunes does not cut it.  I really don't care how "popular" and "cool" it is to have an Ipod.  I owned one and after using subscription music services I won't go back.  I have used my Zen Micro with Napster and Yahoo Music Service, both are excellent.    Decided to upgrade to the new Vision:M and I must say Creative has done a wonderful job.  The user interface is improved, mostly due to a larger color screen.  All 4 buttons are now real buttons, not a touch pad.  They also added Forward and Reverse buttons on the side of the scroll bar.  Addition of accessory port on the bottom is a huge plus, even though there are not many devices yet.  Battery life is very much improved, watched 2 hour video and listened to 3 hours of WMA protected files and still had half the battery life.    Software could be improved, Creative needs an all in one solution.  I had to use third party programs to download album art and convert video for the player.    Video looked great.  On the down side, dongle required for USB and charger.  There should be more accessories available in a few more months and I would like to see better cable options for video and audio output.

<Title>Great Player, A good choice.
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>  I would first off love to say that I respect apple and the ipods are great. But, when a better product comes along lose the fanboyish attitude and open your eyes. THough its all based on opinion. Anyway the Zen vision:m is an amazing player. Its got a beautiful screen and amazing video quality. The navigation system is quite interesting and takes a couple of days to master. Its touch pad is sensitive making scrolling easy. ALso in my opinion its a sleek player. The smooth black with the white backplate is elegant. Also, the blue lit buttons add to the effect. The earbuds were comfortable and the audio quality and the amount of sound impresses me. It is bigger than a 60g ipod but I have become used to the feel of 3rd generation ipods and this one feels comfortable in my hand. The software was basic enough and I found it easy to use. Also what I like about this player is the ability to set backrounds. I don't know if the ipod does it but this is one of those little features that I have come to love.   A note to those who like to make the ipod and non-ipod arguments like its life and death. Calm down creative has been making jukebox ipods before apple and ironiclly holds the patent for the touch technology for the two. Also there mp3 players generally recieve positive reveiws. Its all opinion, this is a place to review not to bash things.

<Title>Wonderful except for the touch pad
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having done about 20 hours of Internet research and then going to a vairety of electronic stores, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision M (Black) because of its features and sound clarity. This is my first MP3/Multimedia device, and I am amazed with how easy it is to "rip" CD's and video. I strongly recommend this one for beginners because its variety of  features, including using it as a "flash drive".  The video playback is as good as any newer computer monitor or the handheld TVs which have recently come on the market. It is much better than the Portable Play Station.  However, and here is why I gave it 4 stars, the touch pad and button controls are extremely hard to get used to. The first thing a new user needs to do is change the sensitivity from "high" to "low". This is no easy feat because the instruction booklet, at least the English version that I got here in Tokyo, does not do a good job at all of explaining how to use the pad. It was very annoying and frustrating to learn that to go from the vertical menus to the horizontal menus that I did not need to tap the pad, just glide my finger over to the left or right. Even now, I have not figured out how to use the keyboard to input my name into the owner information.  Honestly, Creative could have come up with a much better designed touch pad and button system. If this were a first generation MP3, or if touch pads were a new item, this one's problems would be acceptable; however, since this is not a first generation concept, what were they thinking?   I asked a few friends and family members to try it out and they said they would not purchase it until the touch pad is improved.  For me, and I am the principle user, I hope that I will get used to it and figure out how to use it. In the meantime, I'll just do without using the keyboard.  Of course, I must learn how to navigate between menus.    The touch pad aside, the battery life, the picture and sound quality, the voice recorder, the FM radio, the organizer, and the really easy way to load music and video make this a pretty good product.

<Content>I just bought one for my brother in France. It is really cool! Smart screen and amazing video quality. But some concern comes to the adapter. As Amazon's description says, 'Power Adapter with 2 interchangable plugs'. But there is only one US plug in my box. I thought there should be another EU plug. Have I missed sth or I got this missing-part box from amazon unluckily? Feel free to contact me kangtong61@gmail.com

<Title>The Amazing Mp3/Video player 
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an amazing gadget. After waiting for more than a month, (I just got it today) I couldn't believe how innovative this toy is. Indeed great things come to those who wait. 262K Screen, beautiful if you see it for yourself. You can view photos while listening to your music, which has great sound quality. And the customizable wallpaper is an awesome extra. Support to multiple video format is fantastic. And I won't get stuck to using iTunes.  I just had to adjust on how to handle the touchpad, quite annoying at first but you can adjust to it pretty quickly. This is not even available in our country yet, and Ipods are abundant here but the only reason they are selling better is due to the good marketing strategy of Apple. Well, I'm a smart buyer and I won't buy to marketing alone. Overall, regardless of the minor issues, this is a great buy. Try it. Ipod is great too, but this one's greater!

<Title>Great player but set touchpad sensitivity to low
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This a great player.  Buyers might be put off by the touchpad the Zen uses because its so unwieldy to use at first but just know its the same technology laptops use with their touchpads except this one is shaped like an oval that's up on its end.  But as another review mentioned, one of the first things you should do is change the sensitivity of the touchpad to 'low'.  A touchpad on **normal** sensitivity setting is great for navigating a big laptop screen but for the Zen's relatively tiny screen (great screen btw) you'll be all over the place.  But trust me once you buy this player, one of the first things you should do is to set the sensitivity of the touchpad to low.  Everything I've tried with this mp3 player is great, good interface, fast, long battery life, the Zen is just very well designed.  Although the interface/buttons on the player are good, there is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the buttons do but with some practice and consulting the user manual (which is kind of meh in my opinion), it can be mastered in a few hours.  BTW, don't get the Toshiba Gigabeat mp3 player.  Its a total piece of crap compared to this.  I bought the Gigabeat, found out it **couldn't** play mp3's compressed at 64kbs, 44khz (even though the product description AND the user manual says it can).  I'm returning that POS.  But the silver lining is that I would have never discovered the Zen if I hadn't tried out the sorry Gigabeat.

<Title>I love this MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research before I ended up buying the creative zen vision m.  After my research it came between the iaudio and the zen vision m. I didn't even consider the ipod video since these two players had better video quality play back then the ipod video.  They also had more features and more formats when it came to video.   I ended up getting the zen vision m because for 30 bucks more I thought it was great having the extras.  The audio is great, and video playback is great.  What I love the most about it is that I can click and drag my video files into my zen vision m not having to convert it first.  The only thing is that I wish battery would last longer.  I've read reviews that made the zen vision m seem really big, but in all honesty it is bigger than the ipod video but it can easily fit in your pocket.

<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is an excellent player.  I prefer Windows Media Player to iTunes, so I'm glad there is an alternative to Apple.  The Creative software that comes with the player is very good for those people not in love with Windows Media Player.  The sound and video is of the best quality I've seen in any player.  The controls and usability are of the greatest design. I highly recommend the Zen Vision:M

<Title>Same as iPod, but more versatile
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a 60GB Ipod video for x-mas, and almost opened it, until I read that this was coming down the pike. After a bit of inverstigating, I realized, that I would be spending a lot of time converting video to have it run on the Ipod, but that wouldn't be the case with the Vision:M.  To get video from my Tivo to my Vision:M is a breeze. Only 1 very quick conversion is needed using DirectShow Dump (about 2-3 minutes per 1/2 hour of video) to strip the Tivo code and leave a plain MPEG-2 file that can be viewed on the device.  The screen is phenomenal. It's why I got this instead of the original Zen Vision (I wanted the bigger screen, but heard lots of bad things about the Zen Vision's screen).  Album art works pretty well, but not great.  The headphones, I thought, were pretty darn good, but I upgraded anyway b/c I had the $$$ available.  It's does everything I wanted/needed a device like this to do. I have a few complaints though:  - THERE ARE NO ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THIS THING!!!! - 30GB goes quickly with 192kbps MP3 files, and video and pictures. - some videos build audio sync problem as time progresses, but this is easily corrected with a quick Pause/Play. - it scratches just as easily as the Ipod, so do yourself a favor and order an Invisible Shield at the same time. - the little adapter is a bit of a pain as I'm probably going to have to order at least one more to be my "travel adapter".

<Title>Wish I'd bought a video Ipod
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Vision:M is a decent little player - except for the "little" part.  30GB for a video/mp3 unit is not enough, especially when the Video IPOD offers 60GB - 2x the drive space - for $50 more.  After loading my average size song collection of 15GB, my Vision M has only enough room for about 2 - 3 hours of MPEG-2 (TIVO) video.     Creative would have been better off leaving out the seldom used FM and digital dictation functionality, and putting a properly sized hard drive to serve the core MP3/Video purpose.

<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Allright, I don't normally review things I buy, but I think the purchase of a good music player is important to everyone's mental health so I'll consider this my good deed to the world for the day...BUY THIS THING!  Everybody is looking for different things in their mp3 players.  Here is my situation - I decided to switch from minidisc to mp3 because I have a huge music collection and I wanted to be able to take it all with me wherever I go.  I was one button click away from buying a 30 gb ipod when I saw this online and researched it.  I have had it for a couple weeks now.  I'll make it simple since there are lots of reviews on here already:  -the most important things to me are sound quality, battery life and overall quality, which is why I chose this over ipod.  I tried out some ipods and the Creative killed the ipod in all of those things.  I bought some decent headphones and the sound quality on this thing is INCREDIBLE, I am a musician and my life has now been blessed with new listening experiences daily.  The battery life is great and I have watched full videos and music and photos (I put 10,000 of my digital photos on it as well as 22 gigs of music).  The overall quality is great, it feels well built and the screen is simply amazing. I haven't encountered much scratching at all but who cares about that outside of the screen?  Just cover the screen with a little screen protecter you can buy anywhere and you are fine.   I am also easily putting podcasts on here and you can use any podcasting service if you link it to the zencast software that comes with it!  The downfalls I have encountered have to do with the occasional difficulty I have tranferring everything the right way from one place.  I am able to get EVERYTHING and every video and song format I want on the player (including Quicktime files) but sometimes I have to try the different softwares that come with the player...there isn't one central place to do everything.  I am going to try to do everything from Windows Media Player now cuz I hear that's the way to go. In general, it just takes some patience to figure out the software and controls.  I continue to laugh at all the ipod owners jumping on here and smearing the Creative Vision, but I have to admit that if I had dropped all that cash and got sucked into Apple's trap, I would be pretty angry myself after seeing this come out.  With this player I have full freedom and consider it an extension of all the files on my computer and subscription services, rather than only what I can pull through itunes.  I have no problem with the size and I take it skiing with me.   The bottom line is it's a sweet player, great quality, with the player's positives much outweighing its negatives.   It has so many little details and options, making it that much more fun than what ipod has to offer.

<Title>Spiffy gadget
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was actually waiting for the pink one to be released, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, so I went with the black one. It didn't disappoint me at all. The video quality is really quite astounding. I was worried that movie subtitles would be hard to read, but that isn't the case at all. The sound quality is pretty good, though I don't know how everyone else rates it--some are satisfied, others seek something better. Since I'm not really looking for super crystal-clear audio--as long as it doesn't sound crackly or like it came from the bottom of a well, it's all fine by me.  I don't know why some people have issues with its thickness and like to compare it to the thinner iPod, but it's a nice and light little thing, in my opinion. I've tinkered with some Creative players before and always found the touchpad a bit fiddly, but it's really all right once you get used to it.   I've also checked out the reviews and saw that some people have had issues with the software. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased, but I had no problems with transferring data or media to my player, and I can even transfer my stuff without installing the software.   And yes, to corroborate earlier reviews, I have also had some problems with the earphones, since they don't stay in my ear very well. I'm not sure however if this problem applies to everyone. The shiny surface also tends to scratch easily (I kept my player in the included pouch and it still got some scratches), so it would be really cool if something like the iSkin were developed for the Zen Vision:M.  Overall, this is a pretty nice gadget, guaranteed to keep you entertained for a long time as well as turn some heads.  Edit: Ah, it seems I was lucky to have bought this player early on, since I got it with the included AC adapter. I've been using this player pretty consistently and I must say I STILL don't have major problems with it, apart from a fairly slow start-up, and for some reason, the clock sometimes resets to a different time, so I have to adjust it all over again. Also, it froze on me once, and that was around four months ago. And that's about all the wrong I've found with it after six months of use.

<Title>This thing is fantastic.  It's not hype.
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, so I've had this thing for a month now.  I've got the hang of it and I'm impressed.  Here's the deal...  I looked for about 2 weeks researching every possible mp3 player out there.  I looked at Ipod, I looked at Creative products, Philips, ect.  I decided on the Creative Zen: M.  I'm not sorry.  I'm in Iraq and since I'm not home I can't speak for the way Ipods act back home.  But I can say that almost EVERYONE over here has an Ipod due to having absolutely nothing to do on down time.  The sand is just eating these Ipods up.  EVERYONE's Ipod freezes up, they have to clear them out, or they just stay frozen.  I've heard (just a rumor) Ipods' customer service on the phone is 49.95.  I just didn't have the scratch to risk having them refer me to their website for almost 50 bucks.  I read all the reviews and here's what i get: Ipod vs. Zen pros and cons the thing is the pros of Ipods are rediculous More stylish, more popular, the wheel thing, itunes (not a pro in my book), wow, allow me to catch my breath. Is this all? Zen pros 14 hr battery life, 10 hrs voice recording (very nice for putting comments or stories on cd's), awesome music management software (not exclusive to one format), (if style is an issue) 5 colors to choose from, video playback is awesome (also a pantload of formats for compatibilities sake), theinvisibleshield.com offers a film that's just unreal to protect the screen (Ipod too) I say dodge the Ipod like the plague(sp?) because people are just not happy with them.  If you think I'm biased that's ok, but Ipod owners told me not to get one. Buy one, the product speaks for itself.  Creative's track record is pretty good too.  They've owned the CES show for a while now with Best In Show products.  Zen: M was this year's, and for good reason. Peace.

<Title>Hands down the best
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all [i] was sucked into buying an ipod (the fourth generation click wheel) and loved it. I used limewire for a while(it was illegal though), but when i got a new computer i decided to stop and use iTunes. Well to say the least iTunes has a TON of songs, but i hated the fact that there was other music stores that didnt charge .99 cents a download. So that was the major facor into me deciding to switch to a new mp3 player. Basically all the kids in my school have an ipod video or an ipod mini, so you know i kind of wanted to be different. So i did some research and stumbled upon this CNET thing on the best new mp3 player and the vision M was there. Now the first thing that came to my mind was the fact that it looked similar to an iPod, but after i did my research I realized that it was far from it. The PROS: Best screen quality for videos- has something like 265,000 colours while the ipod has 64,000. Also you can change between 6 different backgrounds, which is a small but yet cool feature.  Long Battery Life- I used to charge my iPod every night but with the Zen I only charge for two and a half hours every two or three days, which is great if I forget to charge it one night i dont really have to worry about "Is it going to die on me" factor. By the way its amazing because you can plug it in for around 45 minutes to charge and its halfway full when you pull it out. 2-2 1/2 hours to charge fully.  Controls- I peronally love the layout of the buttons and ill exlplain them to you too. The one on the upper left with the arrow touching the dot is your "short cut" button. What that means is you can set it to on your setting and set it to bring you to a certain page in you player ( I set it to "Artists") so that when you are listening to a song and dont want to go back you just press that button and BAM you are there. The button underneath it is the back button which is just to go back. The button on the top right is the Play/Pause button, and the one on the bottom right is the small menue type button. You can use this to delete a track from you player(+)at any time. The controls are pretty basic to get used to, I picked them up in around ten to fifteen minutes. By the way on the long touchpad button there is to little small buttons to the left and right that is the Forward and Back buttons used to cycle through songs.  Navigation- When you are in any of the sub folders for music you can hit the side button next to your touch pad and access a small side bar that has all of the letter in the alphabet. You just scroll down with the touchpad while it brings you the beginning section that starts with that letter. Which save you all the time of scrolling through thousands of songs.  Video- I used windows media player to transfer music videos onto there and it transfered in about 10 seconds for a 3 minute video.   Programs- I use Window Media Player to transfer songs, which is basically like a more advanced version of iTunes, and its pretty easy to get used to.  Sound- Better than the iPods in my opinion. I played the exact same copy of a song on my ipod and on my zen at the same time with a different headphone in each ear (the song opened wiht a slow but loud drumming) and the zen beat it by a mile. To describe the sound its  basically like your watching T.V in a way its sort of all around you and right next to you.  Size- I don't see why everybody is complaing about the size. its basically about the size of the 40g 4G ipod. It feels comfortable in your hand. The front is pretty scratch worthy, but not too bad. I ordered an invisible shield from www.shieldzone.com and i could rub a coin all over it and just wipe it off and it looks brand new. The best part is you dont need to worry about the back getting scratched up because its like a sand blasted back. On the back the zen logo is indented with a ripple effect which adds some nice touch. Here is a website that shows a comparison to the ipod video (but if youve ever held an ipod video in your hand they feel somewhat uncomfortable, the zen feels sturdy but light) (...)  THE CONS- Album art- O.K i have strived to get the album art onto the Zen but to me its literally impossible. Its not like itunes where you can just copy and paste a picture from amazon if you dont have it. I went to creatives online support and followed the instructions, which include, deleting a hidden folder on you zen, saving the picture, resizing it, import it, open it and choose the cover style. Its just crazy for creative to do everything practically perfect and screw up on a small thing like album art  Customer Support: Not really part of the zen but I called the technical support (for the album art)and i had to wait on the phone for 45 minutes, which is far from reasonable for a technical support (all the while listening to some sort of Japanese techno) and when the guy answers he reads me the thing from the website and says hes not to familiar with the vision M. So i called again (another 45 minutes) and the lady sends me a software up date for the wrong player. So i call back again (40 minutes) and now im really mad, and that lady puts me on hold and talks to her supervisors about how to do it and just redirects me to the online website which didnt even help me in the first place. So you get the picture on why the technical support stinks.  Forgot to add i subscribed to Rhapsody for 15 dollars a month and now have unlimited downloads ande everything so that made this purchase all the more worth while. All in all the Zen is a great produc, and in my opinion kills the iPod video. BY THE WAY IF YOU DONT HAVE WINDOWS XP DONT BUY THE VISION M BECAUSE IT WONT WORK ON ANYTHING ELSE. Just wanted to let you guys know how much I love this little gadget

<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a techie geek, and I rush out to buy the latest gadgets.   Here are my observations about the Zen Vision:M  30GB  Positive +  It probably IS better than the video iPod overall.  It has twice the video battery rating, and it supports many more video and song formats than the ipod.  Also, it is Windows SurePlay compatible, so just about any online mp3 store's files will work on this thing.    +  it supports many video types including my home mpeg2 and avi videos from my home movies.  +  EXCELLENT customer support at Creative.  I had a couple technical questions and they were very attentative and gave individual care.   (I dont have experience with Apple's service)  +  Years from now, youll be glad you have this device, vs an ipod..  because once you buy an iPod and iTunes files...  youre STUCK using an iPod for the rest of your life to play those files.   Stay away from proprietary products if at all possible...  so those thousands of music files you have from Itunes, will ONLY play on Ipods...  youre locked in.  Negative -  I'm dissapointed there arent ANY accessories out for this thing yet, besides the basics like charger, battery, a/v cables.  I would like to see some of the cool accessories the iPod has.  -  it's a little pricey and costs MORE than a Video iPod.  For the extra money, they shoudl throw in the a/v cable to connect the Zen to y a tv or home stereo.  -  As far as useage, the only frustrating thing about the Zen is the scroll button....  its way to sensitive, even on the lowest setting...   it gets easier with practice, but I still occasionally hit the wrong button or select the wrong song, because of the scrolling feature.  Overall, its a good product and I have no regrets.

<Title>Good Grief
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this device is amazing. Before buying, I read dozens of reviews from users and tech sites and tested out friends ipod videos. And still, when I got my hands on the Zen Visoin M, I was amazed at the picture quality, radio performance, ease of use, sound quality, album art display...good grief....it is just an amazing product. Yes, there are minor annoyances (such as black version collects fingerprints like crazy), but overall it is well worth your money. 95% of you will be super satisfied with this product. I sure am.

<Title>Why this rocks the ipod...
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Man. Where to start. Reasons why the zen rocks the ipod. 1)the color screen is simply AMAZING. 2)all high quality movies gotten off bittorrent are 90%  divx and xvid. meaning you dont have to go through the  demeaning process of converting videos. 3)And for the ipod, if you do convert your videos, they are restricted (quality wise) to the point that apple forces you to buy their videos off itunes to avoid stabbing yourself. 4)Battery life. Conpared to the Original Zen PMC (12 hours of video life!) the zen sucks. But against its current opponent, the ipod, the zen wins by 2 hours. Thats one more movie/4 more episodes of family guy. 5)The shortcut button is an excellent idea.  P.S. Sadly the only reason people find the ipod as a excellent mp3 player is that apple advertises the hell out of it. The ipod is actually a good mp3 player, it just isn't excellent like all of apple's herd of sheep think it is...

<Title>Why Would You Buy An iPod???
<Date>Sat Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Simply put, this is the PERFECT device for users of music subscription services like Napster to Go and Yahoo Music Ulimited.  For subscription support alone, this device is the hands-down winner versus the iPod.  At less than $10/month, you have access to over 1M tracks, versus $0.99/song with iTunes.  Game Over!

<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck. While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file. I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file. Apple is up front about their capacity. For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer). Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive. Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M. Take your pick.       to clear that up  it holds 15000 128kb WMA files, which are evedently half the quality of mp3, but i can tell no difference.

<Title>BETTER Than IPOD by far
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for "less" because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision. It also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the  integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows.  ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Content>Had the player for a few weeks and love it.  You cannot beat the clear videos.  I bought mines in Baby Blue and get stopped everywhere with people asking me questions.  The only complaint I have is the album pictures, but I keep it in my pocket while listening to music so it's not a major problem.  Don't fall with the majority (IPOD), be an original and get something that's worth the money.

<Title>Better than I thought
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recently bought this player and i have to admit it is much better than i thought it would be. I know it's lame to compare everything to Ipod but since it is the most popular player i will compare it to Ipod. Sound - way better than ipod (Creative have more experience with sound than Apple do) . Battery - lasts twice as long as Ipod (this is why it's thicker than Ipod). Screen - resolution is four times higher than on ipod 5G. Video Formats - supports Divx and Xvid  among others, unlike Ipod where Apple force you to use their stupid mpeg4 format. Interface - same. Navigation - once you get used to the touchpad, it's fine In my opinion these are the most important things to compare. i also noticed that the price for this player has just dropped down to $300.00. GREAT PLAYER!!!!!

<Title>Nice, solid player
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:   --Great capacity and media abilities --Stable environment --Good controls (takes a little while to get used to but very flexible once you do) --Easy software as well as many software options (not limited to iTunes) --Reasonable battery life (8+ hrs. just playing music) --Very crips, clear display --Excellent sound and flexible audio controls --Shortcut button is customizeable Cons:   --Screen scratches and smudges easily --Lack of accessories --Proprietary charger/USB interface (also meaning you can't charge in the car until they make such an accessory)  I use my Vision:M daily in an industrial environment and have even dropped it twice, but it did not even stop playing.  I purchased a "Marware SportSuit Sleeve" (says it will fit all iPods including new 3G iPods but easily fits the Vision:M) and it is a great case for those who will use thier player in a variety of conditions as it has padded sides and plastic inserts for impact protection, repels water, and has a removeable belt clip.  The only downer to the SportSuit is the headphone jack location, but the flap closure is flexible and can easily be secured by going around that once your headphones are plugged in.  All in all I am very pleased with my Vision:M and highly recommend it.

<Title>Truly amazed!
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Vision:M for about 2 weeks now and I can't get enough of it.  The first time I turned it on, it had a crisp, colorful, and bright screen.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how bright the screen was at only 50% brightness.  So far, I have 2 complete movies, 4 episodes of my favorite show, hundreds of songs on it and I'm not even close to filling up the disk space.  I use my Vision:M at the gym almost daily and it's kind of fun seeing people next to me on the treadmill look over and their eyes widen a bit when they realize I'm watching a movie.  Sound quality is more than you can ask for with its customizable EQ.  Battery life is great.  Like I said, I watch movies on it frequently and so far, I've watched 2 full movies without having to recharge it.  Only thing that can bum me out (but not much) is that it already went down in price.  I bought it for $329, and now it's at $299.    As time goes by, more accessories will be available.  I'm sure of it.  Accessories I plan to buy as they become available:   -A/V cable (to connect and view media on TV)   -iRiver fm transmitter (heard good reviews on Amazon.com) Accessories that I've purchased already:   -Boxwave Flexiskin case (silicone case that fits well)   -Boxwave screen protector (doesn't completely cover the front and sides, but combined with the Flexiskin, does its job well)  All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this product.  iPod who?

<Title>Another reason to want the Creative Vision: M
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is awesome! Sure it's bigger than an Ipod, but in this case, Bigger IS better...  There's even more reason to love this thing, the price.  I usually buy from Amazon.com, but found a promotional code from another source and was able to purchase this for $249, no tax, free delivery! For that price, there is NOTHING out there which can touch it.  The only recommendation I have is to pair this thing with a some Sennheiser PX100 headphones. You don't know what you are missing until you do...  Get this thing while it's in stock. Many places don't have it on hand!  PS - Do yourself a favor and download Total Video Converter ver 2.52. Free for 15 days of use and it converts EVERY format, including flash and shockwave video (GoogleVideo & YouTube) into ANY format you want, including Ipod! You will be thanking me!!!  PSS - http://home.comcast.net/~othastar/Music.html = TONS of music videos already converted to MP4. ENJOY!!!

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great looks, great sound, great software. It can take any video file you try to put it, even if you have to convert it with the included software, unlike the other big named mp3/video player. I have seen the ipod video and was shocked when i saw the menus. No images, no color, no nothing, just simple text with the options. Zen Vision:M at that aspect is 10000x better looking with it's wallpapers, decorated menus etc (for those that say the ipod is much better looking than the Zen). I'm very glad i bought this one, unfortunately it was only available in black, which is where it comes it's biggest problem. The Scratches!! i can say i couldn't be more careful with it, and yet its all scretched up. No big deal if you're looking at it turned on, because you can't notice them with all the beautiful colors of the screen. it's when it's off that you can see it. The other negative point (and i really can only find 2) is that against the sun, you can't see the screen very well. maybe i should tinger with the brightness level, since it's at 50% as it came from factory.   Overall it's one hell of a good player (music/photos/video). Every friend that i showed it to, was amazed with the quality of the screen and the movies.

<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent product and great alternative to Ipod. Ipod's are "horrible" for licensing. The Creative product works great with all media except Apple's, of course. Great menu and controls. Fantastic playback ability and picture quality (brightness, contrast etc.) Took a little while getting used to the slide bar, but much better control that the ZEN touch, my previous media player. Battery life is pretty much what they report. Accessories are starting to catch up as well. The screen scratches easily, but I hear this is the case for all players. The case included with the device is on the cheap side...looks like something a 13 year old Dungeons and Dragons player would carry around.  Biggest shortcoming is the inability to check file sizes in a Windows explorer type window. I've used up 28GB and can't figure out what's takin the space without wiping out and recopying the device.

<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zen Vision: M in order to replace a Sony PSP which I was only using for music.  I was going to get an iPod until I saw that the Zen Vision:M had received the Best in Show award for the Consumer Electronics Show.  Not knowing enough about technology to rate the specs myself I relied on that rating.   Overall I am happy with it.  What I like the best is that the Zen Vision does not inhabit your computer like iPod.  I don't have any unintended software popping up because the Zen software was installed.  Loading music , pictures and videos is simple enough and it's easy to control which files do and don't get loaded.  With my daughter's iPod, MP3s get loeaded automatically which they don't want.   The only thing I'm not as happy with is the control pad.  It's not as intuitive and user friendly as iPods.  Once you get use to it, it's easy enough but I still like iPod's control touch better. Overall, B+.

<Title>In a Zen-Like Place
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen on 2/9/06 and have been extremely pleased thus far.  I would give it 5 of 5 stars, except that I have not had it long enough to truly test its durability.  If I haven't broken it in a year, I will concede the last star ;)  Good: + Works flawlessly with subscription services.  Unlimited downloads for $15 per month beats other pay-per-song services hands down.   + Easy software interface, easy to rip, store, move, and create play lists from your media. + It seems very durable (I've dropped it once).  + Software interface structure is fairly configurable.   + I've downloaded photos but no videos yet.  Visual quality is pretty good given the size of the screen.   + Excellent sound quality from the audio mini-jack.   + Sounds fabulous in my truck - I hooked it directly into my head unit by buying an IP Bus cable (for my deck) and an RCA to mini-jack cable.  The result is awesome static free listening.  Bad: + Software is included, but very average compared to others. + When ripping CD's, you cannot play the tune to hear if it's one you really want, so you have to keep another "media" player open. + Music is not sortable by anything other than artist, which is clunky - however, you can use Media Player to rip and synch. + The included ear bud headphones are awful, although maybe it's just my ears - be prepared to buy your own.   + The touchpad slider is a royal pain to operate - after a month, I still haven't mastered it.  + It comes with a "flannel-like" pouch that will protect it, but is not conducive to easy use.   + At date of purchase, Amazon did not carry a compatible case.  None of the "mall-type" electronics stores carried anything to fit it either, but I was able to find one via an Internet search for about $30.   + The owner's manual is pretty weak (very basic), but after a few hours, I had most of the features figured out.     In all, I am very happy I went this route and would recommend the product to anyone who is looking for this type of player.

<Title>My honest opinion...
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't worry, I'm not a nine year old who just got this and just thinks it's awesome. I'm almost 13 and know more about computers than most adults. Music is my life, I love it. And I wanted the best mp3/video player out there. I didn't really want an iPod; I heard the battery isn't that great and it felt really wide and too think in my hand. Anyways, everything about this mp3 player is great. It looks pretty ugly in the picture, but looks better in person. The screen is great, I love watching movies on it. It is kinda bulky, but I don't mind much, especially while I'm watching Law & Order. The only reason why I'd ever get an iPod is to download all of the Law & Order episodes easily. My pictures look great and the music is awesome. I use Napster, and it's all quite easy to use. I've even been able to put album art on it using Windows Media Player. For the tech geek, this is a must-have. The only thing I don't like is how easily it gets scratched. It's horrible. But you can't notice them while you're watching something. Hopefully, ZENcast will start soon, then I'd be set.

<Title>Best Mp3 Player! Video Ipod Killer
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best Mp3 player on the Market!  Yes it does look similiar to the video ipod and a little thick but its got WAY more feature than the Ipod.  Do you really think they designed, developed, and put this into production all since the launch of the 5G iPod.   Clearly they have been working on this for quite some time and I doubt all you Apple fanboys will give Creative the credit of being, well, creative enough to steal Apples design before it was released.  -- The screen is just awesome, Ipods screen looks Washed out and its only 65k colors compared to the Creative Zen Vision M 256k colors. Thats a Big Difference!  -- Its only .3inch thick. Its not that thick, its an average DAP thickness - the iPod is just anorexic, almost too thin to be comofortable/natural/ergonomic.   -- The battery life is definitely better than the ipod. 4hrs compared to 1.5hrs in a video ipod! One of the reasons why its a little thick.    -- Well Lets look at this the video ipod 30GB is $299 but do you get an FM tuner? Voice Recorder? Power adapter charger (not the USB cable charger)? Pouch?  -- If you add all that, it will be more than $399 and the Creative Zen Vision M comes with all that.   -- The creative definitely does not feel like cheap plastic, Its really well built and Solid!  -- Lets compare the video features Creative video playback easily handles MPEG, DivX, XviD, WMV9, and Motion-JPEG. Ipod is limited to Quicktime and Mp4  -- Supports Tivo To GO! Ohh Yea!  --Light-up Buttons  -- Organizer syncs with outlook > Calendar, Contact, Task list On the Go!

<Title>Best mp3/Video Player Out There!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'll keep this short and just explain what i like and don't like about the Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB mp3 and video player.  what i like: ~~it has great color display, more than the video ipod. ~~video quality looks excellent, even with small subtitles, you can see everything perfectly. ~~i like the fact that it actually plays mp3s, and not the proprietary formats that ipod converts to. (important because you can use your zen vision:m as a flash drive for importing and exporting videos, pictures, and mp3/wma) ~~IT PLAYS DIVX!!! i watch a lot of anime and other TV shows, so it was very important that it plays divx formats (avi), and it does.  and it also plays windows media video (wmv).  where the video ipod requires you to convert these formats to mp4 or quicktime movie files (they suck!). ~~and for any other audio formats or video formats it doesn't support, the software it comes with allows you to convert it into a playable format, such as converting audio to mp3 or video into wmv formats to be playable on your player. ~~battery life on the zen vision:m is great.  roughly 2.5 hrs of video and 14 hrs of audio. ~~has the fm tuner, voice recorder on it, and displays still pictures.  not much to say about those features, other than the zen vision:m does a good job with it.  what i don't like: ~~some picture displays are pixelated. ~~the wheel on the ipod is a lot better for searching through music and video files. ~~a little bulkier than the video ipod. ~~organizing playlists and searching through files can be somewhat troublesome, but not really a big issue. ~~lack of accessories available for purchase for the zen vision:m, but not directly related to the playability of the zen vision:m.  ...so that's it.  my quick review of the Creative Zen Vision:M mp3/video player.  and my recommendation: GET IT!!!  you won't regret it, i know i haven't.  as you can see from my review, the pros far outweigh the cons, and it's just an overall excellent player.  well, i hope this has been helpful.  and good luck with your Zen Vision:M player purchase.

<Title>Not a massacre, but gives the Video iPod its 1st loss (albeit split decision)
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this device a couple weeks ago and have been very happy with it.  I have not yet exhausted the battery, with moderate to heavy use from full charge.  The video quality is VERY good - at 2.5 inches, you'd be hard pressed to find anything better.  The breadth of formats available for video is spectacular.  If you try to pop something on it that is not compatible, it will attempt to auto convert.  Here's where the first chink in the armour is found - conversion takes FOREVER!  Not that conversion is a simple process, but it does take significantly longer than external conversion applications.  This is price we pay for convenience I suppose.  Audio quality is very good, I would suggest that you purchase a decent pair of headphones to replace the buds included in the package - they are no more than sufficient.  Accessories are not redily available yet, but they are out there for the diligent searchers.  I have not used the microphone functionality, and I doubt I ever will; so I have no comment to make to its viability.  The controls consist of a touch pad style scroll pad, with left-right momentary contact buttons, and four other buttons.  There is a great feature here that you don't find elsewhere - one user customizable button which you can set to any function available from menus.  If you want to Randomize All Tracks at the push of a finger, set it to that feature.  If you need to see videos right now, you can set that too.  The tactile buttons are very responsive and feel solid - a lot more useful than the kludgy pressure sensitive ones on prior Creative players.  The software for adding and removing files is pretty good - iTunes is better, but it's not a runaway.  The one thing that almost was enough to shave off the fifth star - there's a dongle to recharge/transfer/connect to external vid.  I hate dongles.  No dock, just a little dongle that I am sure I will lose.  I can get over it, but it does not make me giddy with delight either.  Using this device for heavy bouncing activities - running/jogging - may be less than spectacular.  It's a hard drive, not solid state.  I lift weights, bike, and treadmill/stairstep machine with it, mostly without incident, but running might leave you underwhelmed (have not really even tried, but occasional bumps lag it.)  That's what you get for this capacity, so I don't fault it for that.  Overall: GREAT device, highly recommended if you don't have to walk lock-step with the prevailing iPod masterdom.  Pros: Beautiful video display.  Sexy blue on black backlighting. MANY video codecs supported!  Very good battery life.  Good button response.    Cons: Dongle!  Lag time when changing menus can get frustrating when you want to grab something specific while shuffling all. Slow vid conversion.

<Title>Better than Ipod!! and cost less
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's see..., you can get the Ipod for about $10 "less"(?) because it doesn't come w/ the AC adaptor($40),the integrated FM radio($30+),a pouch and other stuff included with the Creative Zen Vision that you don't get w/ the Ipod, actually I believe the Ipod only comes with a usb cable. The Creative Zen Vision also supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use. The quality and feel of the Creative Zen Video are better, not cheap, it is sturdy. You can record directly from the integrated FM radio. 32 station presets let you switch stations whenever you want. You can also select from a myriad of online music stores - Napster To Go, Yahoo! Music Unlimited, Rhapsody To Go, and many more. With PlaysForSure support, you will always be able to play any digital music you purchase. You can even download your favorite TV shows. ZEN VISION:M supports many video formats, such as DivX4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 and Motion-JPEG, which simply means more choice and less restrictions on the types of video formats you can use.  Ipods are for people that get things because everyone has them, not because they do quality research. The battery last longer on the creative and it is replaceable, on the Ipod after 18 month you have to send it back to them and have it replaced and pay over $150. If you want an excellent quality product, go with this one. They had started to come down on price (I got my for $289 here)(the white and the pink are $280ea. today) and you don't have to spend money on extra stuff already included. Do research, Creative had been around for many years and they had won many awards for their MP3 quality products, Including this one.

<Title>DOA products from Creative, buyer beware
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for a present today, purchased from another website, and it came to me dead. I get a blank screen and none of the buttons work. I get a charge on the battery, and I'm able to get to the recovery screen, but none of the recovery methods work. Looking at Creative's discussion forum, it looks like a good percentage of others are experiencing the same problem. What's bothersome is that it's an official Creative forum on the product, but Creative does nothing to address the problem at all. If you're feeling lucky, go ahead and make the purchase.

<Title>Zen Vision M Black
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this product. I was wanting to get an ipod a long time ago but never had the money, then the ipod with color came out and I began saving money. Not to long after the ipod video came out. I was not sure what to do, get the ipod video or wait for apple to stir up something even greater. So I waited and waited for a few months. I was at Amazon about to buy the ipod when I saw the Zen vision m. I read loads of reviews on it. After reading reviews it was easy to decide that the Zen vision m was the way to go. It is way better then the ipod. It has longer battery life, better screen with more colors, supports a huge amount of video and audio formats, has a built in radio and voice recorder. It can even record radio. I have has it for about a month now, and I love very thing about it except a few things. I strongly recommend getting new headphones ASAP. The headphones it comes with are pure garbage. They do not block out any noise at all. When I sat in a hallway full of people, it was almost impossible to hear the music even at full blast, plus you are hurting your hearing. Another bad thing about it is that the front of the device scratches very easily. Within about 5 minutes of handling it I got a few scratches. It also smudges very easily, and when I tried to wipe it with a t shirt it got rid of the smudges but it added more scratches. I strongly recommend getting a case or an invisible shield for it. You can get one here http://www.shieldzone.com/ Besides that the product is amazing. You can use it as a hard rive. When you put it into hard rive mode, and you plug it into a pc, the pc recognizes it as a USB mass storage device, and not as an mp3 player. I think that is very cool and useful. The screen is much brighter then the ipod. It is not as easy to use as an ipod at first but with about 10 minutes of messing around with it you will be a master. The voice recorder is very good also. I use it sometimes to record lectures at school. The quality is very good. the only down side about the voice recorder is that when you play it back there is a continuous humming sound which is caused by the hard rive in the player spinning at high rpm's. The mic is very sensitive and catches that sound, however it does not bothersome and the lecture can still be heard just fine. The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because it is prone to scratching and smudging. I don't quiet understand why a $330 device scratches so easily.  I tried to include the most aspects about the product as possible, and I hope I was helpful in making your decision of whether to buy it or not.

<Title>Anyone for a lemon?
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product with high hopes after having had a 5GB Zen Micro for a while and loving it, until the contact point for the earphones became loose.  I wanted a bigger MP3 anyway, and the early reviews for the Zen Vision:M seemed so positive.  And for some reason, I was leery of having an IPod on my Windows PC.  But now I am sorry I every bought this.  First, it took about 5 weeks for Amazon to finally ship it to me.  This was frustrating.  Then, when I finally received it at the end of February, I eagerly loaded it up with music.  That went quickly and seemed to be fine.  But when I tried to play it, the touch pad controls would not work.  I could only get Album of the Day to play.  I contacted Creative by phone, and I must say they were helpful (I give them 3 stars for service).  The tech person agreed that the product was defective and instructed me to mail it back to them for fixing or replacement.  I was somewhat dismayed to learn that it was likely I would get a refurbished (like new, he said) replacement.  In any case, I spent $12 with UPS to send it to Creative and, to their credit, I received it back within 14 days.  I again loaded it up with music -- although I found that my Dell MusicMatch Jukebox software worked better for this purpose than Creative's software.  After a few false starts trying to get the touch pad to work, I finally got the hang of it and I was happily up and running.  I really like the screen, btw.  It's large, colorful, and easy to read in even low lighting or bouncing on the subway.  All went well for a day and a half.  Then, on my way home from work the other night, the player just locked up on me.  Refused to jump to the next song; the touch pad would not respond; and I couldn't shut it down with the on/off switch.  It just glowed eerily inside my purse.  When I got home I took a pin, inserted it in the reset hole at the bottom, and, again to its credit, it "rebuilt" and once again was working.  I've yet to try it again and will on the way home tonight.  Bottom line is that the player looks good, has a nice hefty, quality feel to it, and sounds great.  But the electronics don't seem to be of the quality I expect, not for that price. I will see how it goes before I insist on another replacement.

<Title>Not up to mark
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A lot has been written about this player. However, I find the materials used sub-par and of poor quality. The screen and front face scratch so easily that within 10 days, the player already looks like 2 year old. I have a three year old Dell pocket pc which my kids use all the time to play chess and solitaire. After three years, its screen is much better than Zen's screen after 10 days. I always carry in the supplied pouch and even use it in the pouch still there are so many scratches.   Creative sells this player for $329.99 ( at least this is what I paid). Does this kind of price justify such poor materials? No. Looks like Creative is keeping all the money while putting nothing into product quality. Had it not been for Amazon's poor return policy (in case you haven't noticed, Amazon now refunds only 80% or less on opened products), I would have returned this player.  There are other problems also. I subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited service. If I create a playlist in Yahoo music engine, I can sync the player and can see this playlist fine. Now if I need to transfer any other video/music to this player using Windows Media Player, I have to put that file in sync list and sync the player. This erases the playlist created by Yahoo music engine.  The outlook sync requires installation of Creative software. As per company policy (which is almost universal in all companies), I cannot install any personal software on the office PC. There goes the outlook sync.    Albun art does not show up correctly for some songs though it displays correctly on Windows Media Player. I tried the fix given on the Creative support site but it does not work.   No support for synchronized lyrics and DVD closed captions.  Do not waste your money on this one.

<Title>Amazing mp3 player!
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've only had this thing for a week but I can't help myself from writing a review right now.  I am still awed by the crystal clear resolution of the screen and the smooth playback of videos.  I've always liked Creative's sound and the Zen doesn't disappoint.  The player is easy to navigate as well; though there are many menus to go through, that just shows that the player gives you many options to work with.  I'll never buy ipods because sound (must have custom equalizers, boo Apple), screen quality and battery life are most important to me in an mp3 player, and the Zen Vision: M beats the Ipod Video in all aspects.  Not to mention the Vision includes an FM tuner and a microphone recorder as well.    As for the complaints about the player scratching easily, don't worry too much about it.  All I did was slap two Belkin PDA screen protectors over the entire face of the player right away, and so far I have had no problems with scratches.  You can hardly tell there's anything over the screen either. I bought the screen protectors as a pack of 10 at a dollar store a long time ago. They work great for all my mp3 players.    I've had the muvo2, ipod mini, the zen micro, and the iaudio X5, but the Zen Vision:M is the best buy at the $250 I paid for it.  This player exceeded my expectations.  And if it lasts for more than a year, I'll be completely satisfied with my purchase.

<Title>Buy it, but get a case before you touch it.
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>FOR: memory; multi-functional (radio); battery life; uses MS media player and you don't need to load any of the provided Creative software.  5 stars for the device  AGAINST: Butter is more scratch resistant; lack of case with the product (comes with some silly little sock thing); lack of accessories available; Software that comes with it is poor and overly complicated (but you don't have to use it). 2 stars because of the lack of accessories, even direct from creative there is a poor selection  I'm giving 4 stars overall because I believe the device itself should carry more weighting than accessories.  If you choose to buy this product, buy a case and a protective film for the screen, as soon as you take it out of the box, put the film on the screen and put it in the case.  The screen scratches extremely easily. The screen is very soft and even cleaning it with a soft lens cloth instantly scratched the heck out of it.  This is my first MP3 video player, I'm frugal so never want to buy anything twice and try to get things that are ahead of the technology so they last longer.  Hence I stayed open minded and I researched MP3 players for many months before committing to buy this one.    I travel internationally a lot by air and wanted something small enough not to be burdensome and at the same time multifunctional to reduce the amount of other unwanted gadgets, this has video, music, talking books, pictures, radio, clock, organizer, contacts.  Also I wanted enough memory that I did not have to keep changing data before/after each trip.  The better battery life for video also helped me in my choice of the Creative Zen Vision MP3 30GB player.    If you want a multifunctional device as I did, I recommend you buy the creative Zen, it is a very good player.  The issue I have with it is the lack of accessories.  Creative, please provide a decent case, and use a harder more scratch resistant material. Amazon, if you are going to stock this product please give me a decent range of accessories to choose from.

<Title>An Amazing Video/MP3 Player****
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've bought 2 of these babies. One for myself and one for my best friend's birthday.  It is one incredible player!!!  I love it.  It is so easy to rip your CD's to this player with the Creative software that comes with it.  It also plays Video with amazingly clear resolution.  Even at the lowest Video transfer the picture is still incredibly clear.  The only negative thing I could say about this player is that it does scratch easily.  I purchased the Applesauce Polish and Refiner and it cleans up the scratches very well.  I would definitely purchase a third party case to keep it in to avoid the scratches.  Creative needs to sell more accessories for their line of MP3 players.  They are missing the boat on that issue.  All in all I'm extremely happy with this player and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Video/MP3 player.  It also has a built in FM Radio Tuner, which works extremly well as well as Voice Recording and Photo Slideshow feature.  It is simply AMAZING!!!!!

<Title>Creative Zen Vision: M 
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am overall very impressed with the Zen vision M.  I like the user interface and overall performance.  I love the built in radio and voice recorder.  I would choose the Zen Vision M over the Ipod any day.  But I will be fair with this review.  Here are the problems I have run into.  The screen scratches easily and the leather cases are not yet sold in the USA.  I just used a stick-on screen protector for a palm pilot (Clear packing tape will also work.)  I had to cut the tape to fit but it has worked great.  If you push too many buttons too fast when it is thinking (Like loading a movie or fast forwarding etc.) It sometimes freezes up.  Not a problem though.  Just use a paperclip click the reset button at the bottom.    Only tech geeks will find this next one as a problem.  Computer system requirements say windows XP SP1.  But there are no drivers for SP1. I had to upgrade to SP2.  For any NON-tech person reading this don't worry, windows automatic updates probably fixed that for you months ago.

<Title>Best Media Player I have ever owned!
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was torn between getting an iPod video and a Cowon iAudio X5. The iPod had superior video, but the iAudio played numerous formats. The iPod also required the use of iTunes. Then my answer came. The Creative Zen Vision:M. It actually has a higher resolution than the  iPod video. The device converts almost any video or audio to a format supported by the Zen as long as your PC has the codec installed (Quicktime to Windows Media for example).  I owned two previous non-video iPods and had a hard time adjusting to the Zen's control scheme. The menu system, after learning it is very intuitive and the best I have seen. The menu's are stylish and can be skinned.   USE: I took this with me on a trip with the military. I was able   watch videos on my flights without any problems with my eyes. As for sound, the audio sounds as good as, if not better than, the iPods without the EQ on. Turning it on makes it even better. The battery life is amazing as well. I was able to go 5 days on all commutes listening to music and only spent half the battery.  The only drawback to the player is that it does not support podcasts that use Apple's native video format. It must convert the files first on the PC during transfer. This can take, at times, hours. Creative really needs to add native player support for that format in an update.

Also the battery life is 2 times more durable then the ipod video.  Con: They should sell Bigger capacity of Zen. ( 60 or 80GB for my videos).

<Title>I'm addicted...some advice for novices
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a late-comer to the the whole MP3 thing.  I've been putting off buying one for a variety of reasons (cheapness, techno-phobia, my CD Walkman never broke) but my tax return came in, and what else am I going to do with $300?    I've never owned an iPod, but many of my friends do and have, and I was hesitant to get one based on their problems with it (notably, as everyone else has said, battery power).  So, I got this one and I'm quite pleased with it.    The Zen comes with everything you need to use it (e.g. a charger, headphones, etc).  I bought new headphones because I hate ear buds, but the ones included had decent sound quality (typically, "freebie" headphones are awful).  Other than that, the only other investment I made was protective film for the screen ($15 for 12 sheets).  If you want to get a cover for the whole thing, buy one on line.  I tried at least 4 local stores (big chains) and NO ONE carries accessories for Zens.    The screen has pretty amazing resolution for a 2 1/2 inch screen.  I haven't watched any videos on it yet, aside from the sample ones that are loaded on the player when you get it.  Maybe I'm easily impressed.  But the picture is sharp and clear and the colors are vibrant.  I'm currently in my 13th hour (literally) of ripping my CD collection onto my Zen and I've only used 4 GB of memory.  Each CD takes just a few minutes, even less if you already have them saved on your computer (you can drag and drop them from your My Music file).    The only complaint I have has to do with the software that comes with it.  After about every 10th CD, it had some sort of error (again, I have no idea what kind of error as I'm lucky to have gotten this far).  It's not a big problem, because it takes about 3 seconds to get around it, but it's kind of annoying.  The player itself couldn't be easier to operate.  So far, no problems (knock on wood).  UPDATE!!! The Bad News: Okay, so five days after I got my Zen, after 36 hours burning my entire CD collection onto it, it died.  Yeah.  Fried.  Everything gone.  Heartbroken, I called Creative.  I didn't have to wait for someone to pick up, and I received instant, helpful and friendly assistance.  Unfortunately, I had to send it back and was told it would be 10-15 business days before I would get another one (or mine if they could fix it).    The Good News: After only 6 business days, I have my new Zen.  So, that's awesome, except that I now have to reburn everything (TIP:  burn your CDs to your computer, if you have the space, and then copy them to your Zen...it's a good idea in case this happens).  Creative's customer service was great.

<Title>A superb portable entertainment device
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only drawback with this player is its sensitive navigation key. Should have followed some of the Samsung mobile phone navigation key instead. Everything else it has a superb audio quality especially if you pair it with the senheisser PX100 headphone. I was able to transfer all my 800 songs without any hitch. Transferred most of my home videos and digital camera photos without any problem at all. If it can't handle the bit rate, it has an automatic conversion program. It can also be used as an effective contact manager with seamless integration with outlook using its media explorer software. Also have tried to transfer some dvd movies such as family guy and the eagles farewell concert, again using decrypter and autogkt software, it was a piece of cake. My son didn't notice any glitches in the video quality. You can also create easily your own slideshows by just drag and drop method. I am very happy with this device and I just wish that the built in battery would last a number of years. It is also practical to buy the wired remote so you can skip songs, adjust the volume and change to FM radio while the screen is locked thus saving you battery life.

<Title>Living with my 6 Hr old Zen Vision M!!
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1) Amazing...just one word to describe the screen... Video resolution is dependant on what video quality u throw at it...  2) Battery charges up fast...i charged for 15 mins...and used it for 3 hrs...(playing videos and songs)  3) I donno what is all the talk abt the navigation...it is VERY easy to use.  4) I havent had issues with installing the software...installation was easy...and importantly transferring files is just like transferring to any USB flash drive. Its that easy.  5) Way too many features to even compare with an ipod...                 *****FIVE STARS*****

<Title>Truly an amazing gadget!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Zen M for about 2 months now so I think I have a good feel for what it's pros and cons are. Here you go:  Pros: Beautiful and Bright Screen (displays thousands of more colors than the Ipod video by the way). Even at 50% brightness (which is default setting out of the box) it looks bright!  Ability to Customize most of the features. This includes being able to set your own photos for the wallpaper, custom equilizer, custom brightnes setting, custom shortcut button, organization of folders(audio, photo, video folders)...etc.  Great Sound! This isn't a surprise because Creative develops sound hardware/software like soundcards.   Good User Interface: The thumb scroller interface takes a few days to get used to, then it's pretty user friendly. You can customize the sensitivity of it too.  Ability to play lots of different video files like Divx and Mpg4. This was a big selling point for me. The screen is perfect for watching cartoons and anime on.   Good Size. I'm refering to it's physical size. It's actually the perfect size and feels great in your hand. Still pocketable and still feels rock solid and not fragile.   Displays Album cover art! I had trouble with this function in the beginning only because in order to get it to display the album art correctly, you need to rip the Cd album with a program that automatically downloads album info including art. One program that does this is Windows Media Player.   --For the techies that don't want to re-rip everything to get the album art to display, just download a small jpeg image of the album cover that is about 150 by 150 pixels, rename it folder.jpg, make it a hidden file and place it in the folder of the correct album. When you move it to your player it will ask you whether you want to move it to the photo folder, make sure you select "no" and leave it where it is.  Cons: There isn't a lot about this player that is negative. But one aspect which is really annoying is that to charge it or plug it to the computer you have to use this tiny seperate adapter that comes in the box. It's the white adapter/attachment that looks like a dock connector. What the heck were they thinking! I have to carry the separate item everywhere I go just in case I need to charge it or upload music. It sucks man! Why the heck didn't they just build all of the ports into the player itself!! Also, they should've included the video output cable instead of selling it separately! Or at least made it use a standard video cable! Also, the battery is not removable... at least not meant to be.   These are the only reasons why I gave this player 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise I would have given 5 out of 5! All in All this player really rocks and is worth every penny! ... and is a much better buy then the "other" competition out there.   Hope this is helpful to you guys. If it is, please give me a vote.

<Title>Movies to go!
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far I have 300+ CDs, 1800 MP3s, 3 full-length movies, and my entire picture collection on this thing, and I still have PLENTY of room left.  For those of you who want to rip your DVDs to one of these, I would suggest downloading DVDFab Decrypter and Auto Gordian Knot.  With these two (free) programs and a little trial and error, I have been able to copy any DVD in my collection to the Zen Vision M.  I wasn't able to get the Vision M to load movies that were ripped at the default settings of AutoGK (which is about 1.2 gig), but if you save them at about 355 meg (the 1/2 CD option), they will load just fine, with acceptable video quality and above-average sound.  I hope this helps some of you who want to watch movies on your Vision M.  It took me a while to find the right software to do the job, but now that I have it I couldn't be happier.  You'll just have to buy one of these things to see how amazing they really are.

<Title>Best Player Available Today
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you own this player, join the best fansite available for it: epizenter.net. The features packed into the Vision:M is better than any other player you will see today. Forget ipods, they can not even compare with this player. Ipods have a subpar screen that is only capable of getting 65,000 colors, the Vision:M has one with 262,144 colors! Not to mention the video playback and sound quality blows away ipods. Plus you can do tv out at much higher resolutions. Add the Best looking GUI, extra features like FM radio, Voice recording, etc..all for the same price as an ipod and you'll see why this player one Best in Show at the most popular Consumer Electronics show. Get one now you won't regret it.

<Title>Beautiful
<Date>Fri Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband is in the military and we live in Okinawa, Japan. We don't get a lot of the US TV shows here, so my reason for purchasing the player was to download shows to the player and then connect the player to our TV and watch! To do this you HAVE to order the Zen Vision: M Video Cable. I received the Vision M yesterday, and have since downloaded and watched 2 TV shows-it works great!   After I had first received the package and charged the player, I tried to look thru the menu on the Vision M. I got stuck in a song and couldn't figure out how to get out. The navigation system is horrible-the touchpad is too sensitive. My player froze up and I had to reset it within the first 30 minutes of use. After I reset it, the player didn't go to the main menu, but was still at the song I got stuck in the first place. After several hours I finally got to the main menu. After I connected to the computer and downloaded the shows, it took another 30 min to get to the right screen to view the shows-I was so mad I wanted to send the player back. Once I was able to get to the right screen and connect to the TV, it played beautiful on the screen. I am much happier since it is doing exactly what I bought it for, and it is doing it well. I am just going to allow myself the extra time to navigate to the correct screen every time I watch a TV show.  I read so many reviews about scratches that I ordered a protective shield from shieldzone.com. It hadn't arrived yet and I was so anxious to use the player that I left it in the plastic casing that it was shipped in, and it has worked out great (just for use at my home). The plastic casing has an opening at the top so you can power the player on, and an opening at the bottom so you can attach the piece that allows you to charge and hook up to the computer. You can also use the touchpad thru this casing. I haven't been very gentle with it at all, and still no scratches. I will leave it in the casing until the one I ordered arrives.  I do like the player now and do not regret that I bought it, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the touchpad and navigation.  I usually download avi files, but some shows I'm just finding in mp4 format (ipod) which the video converter won't handle. Does anyone know what software or codec I can download to convert to a file I can play on this machine? If so, please let me know!!!!! ** ** This is an update, after spending a few hours on the net, I found a zen message board epizenter.net that suggested you convert mp4 to compatible formats with software called Super-it's free, I just converted an mp4 to an avi file and now it plays on the vision m. You can download the Super software at erightsoft.com

<Title>So much better than the IPod.
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All of my friends who have mp3 players have Ipods except for one who followed in my footsteps.  This has a radio, microphone, longer battery life, more compatible formats for music and movies, and more.  Does the Ipod have that included?  Nope.  I have the pink one which I bought the second week of March and I love my mp3 player.  I wish it had a removable battery though like the smaller Creative mp3 players.  I also wish it was pink all the way around and a little smaller like the Ipod.  Like the Ipod though, the screen scratches easily so just be careful with it or buy a protective cover thing.  I'm listening to my Zen Vision:M now and decided to stop buy and leave a little review.  I do alot of research before I spend money on something electronic or such and I know I got the better product.  I researched Dell, Sony, Ipod, Creative, you name it.  Even my cousin who used to be an Ipod fanatic and has an Ipod studied my player with his and was like "Yeah, I'm gonna switch and get one of those.  They are better than the Ipods."  I was way impressed and proud of him, lol.  That is all.

<Title>5 Stars+dongle=4
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just the dongle kept it from getting 5 stars. To be fair this is probably how creative managed to beat the Ipod's battery life and still maintain a similar size. But the dongle is needed for charginging, syncing, using the optional AV cable or any other accessory. So if I want to use the optional car charger I have to bring the dongle.I have the ac charger by my night stand, but I have to get the dongle from the usb cable on my computer and visa versa. I'm planning on ordering the video out cable, buts thats yet another place to bring the friggin' dongle.    But let's not be so negative. There are 4 other stars.    It's played every avi file I've loaded on it. The fact it doesn't have to come from the itunes store or some other proprietary format is a huge plus. If you know how to go about creating and obtaining your own content this is definitely the right choice. I record shows with a huappauge pvr-150 card, which means my shows are free.(if you don't count the 100$ capture card,you can find others for 40$ and up) If you plan on doing the same you won't be able to play your mpeg files. Despite what creative says you can't play mpeg unless you use a very low poor quality bit rate. However I record with sage tv which automatically converts recordings to Divx at night. I suspect and hope creative will improve mpeg playback in future firmware. I wouldn't use Creative's converter. Too darn slow. "SUPER" is a great little free program. It converts to and from just about anything. For 20 bucks Divx sells a fool proof dragndrop converter.    Music playback sounds great. Has EQ settings preprogramed, and custom. The included earphones seem fine.(I'm not an audiophile) A tip here, when playing music switch it to lock, this way the screen goes blank and improves battery life. No support for Audible books yet, but Creative says it's coming. It does support drm. I wouldn't know as I only by CDs and rip them to mp3. They have somthing called Zencast, a podcast client, it does make navigating podcasts easier, but I still prefer IpodderLemon.    At first I thought the scroll pad and interface would drive me nuts. But after a day our so I got the feel for it. The interface is also quite customizable, allowing you to add or delete menu items, and change wall papers. There is also a custom shortcut button which is really handy.   Battery life does't  come close to my "AA" lyra that I was used to, but it does seem to match Creative's claims. It will be better when i get the car charger(friggin' dongle!) I've never had it go dead yet.     The picture quality is superb. The size is very watchable. People have written they wouldn't watch a 2 hour movie on it but I have. My wife loves it(she has no idea how much it cost,thank God) Now she can watch LifeTime while in bed and I actually am there happily watching Underworld. It does have feature wich lets you stretch 16:9 to full screen to make watching easier on the eyes but if thats a problem for you I would recomend cropping the original.     No accessories accept through Creative right now, but that will change.(There selling a gazillion of these) But definitely get some screen protectors. I don't know if it scratches easily but don't want to find out.    So if you can survive without Itunes, live with that extra .25" thickness(oh please people), and deal with the fact it's rectangular like an Ipod(The chief complaints of the ipod users in these reviews) I would highly reccomend the Vision M. (friggin dongle:)       Update 4/28/06: Creative is now selling the dongle for 9.99. So for me that lessens the impact of the dongle in my review. I'm ordering an exrtra dongle to make life easier. I continue to be impressed with how cool it is to carry around my favorite shows.

<Title>excellent device
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my ZVM for a couple of months now.  It's awesome.  I bought it from amazon for $[...]with free shipping so they seem to have bumped the price up a bit ($[...], which is still less than MSRP).  My girlfriend has the 30GB Ipod, so i've gotten to do a good side by side comparison.  It's a pretty even match once you consider all the pros/cons (check out Mario C.'s review).  I think i actually prefer the vertical scroll (e.g. rapid scroll by touching the bottom/top edges instead of 40 swirls around an ipod scroll wheel).  The included software's a bit lame right now.  A few improvements could make it good though (nudge, nudge Creative).  For now, just use "auto playlists" in Windows Media Player 10 for syncing (works fine).  The front scratches easily (so does the Ipod), so get one of these first thing:  [...]  My biggest complaint is the lack of decent accessories.  I'm sure that'll come with time and popularity, but i'm ready now for some decent options for protective cases.  I'm also ready for some deals to be made so that we can easily buy movie/tv-episode downloads for the non-ipod crowd.  Overall, a great product.

<Title>Great quality and ease of use
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is my first MP3 player and I am delighted with it. Despite its hefty price, all I can say is: it's worth it. I researched a lot before choosing it and do not regret my selection -- the reason I am writing this review is to hopefully help out other MP3 player neophytes who may be as confused and overwhelmed as I was with all the new info and the apparently infinite choice of models. Sound quality is stupendous, navigation between functions is intuitive (I barely skimmed the manual), the screen has great quality, the player's software works well (and you can always resort to Windows Media Player if you prefer). I have no problems with the navigation buttons despite knowing of other users' issues with their sensitivity. I love it that I can use a portion of the 30 GB hard disk as an external drive, sparing me the extra expense of a pen drive. The only "but" I have, after a few weeks, is that the earbuds' foam capping keeps coming off. It is true that there are few accessories available for the model, but hopefully this will change as it becomes more popular. But then, I've no plans to spend another $289 on gizmos for the Vision:M anyway.

<Title>I returned the Ipod 5G for this
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I put 40 dvds on this thing, rip my cds and create play lists all within a few hours. the usb 2 just blows away the ipod slow connection it's not even funny.  The only thing the ipods got for it is the easy controls but very short on features.  One thing I really like is the porn files/ videos that I dont want my kids to see, just hide it and lock it. And the short cut button is just so great to have, need more buttons like this. Ipods need to learn how to do that.  When the lights is out on the Ipod, you cannot see any thing, not this Zen, it's dim but u can still make out the screen. Those are the things that I have not seen anyone mention. Anyway, these things are selling like hot cakes, look for it at 6 diffent stores before I found the last one at bestbuy...it's so good I bought some stocks for CREAF too, at 52 weeks low.  Already made enough to pay for itself.

I just want you people out there to know that if you want to get this item through Amazon, it will take a long time. I like Amazon.com and usually get my item by the time promised. I guess this item is going to be out of stock for a while. Do not put your hopes on the promised 1-2 weeks on the add. It will take far longer than that. I'm still waiting for mine. Hope this helps all of you who plan on getting on through amazon. Again, amazon.com is great, but this item will be out of stock for a while and they will not update their add to show that.

<Content>I can't believe that the world hasn't caught on to this device yet. It blows the iPod away on all fronts: - The best user interfact imaginable. Simple, quick, intuitive. - Battery lasts forever - Screen is awesome - The overall feel of the thing- it's hard to describe how good it is. - FM radio - It opens in windows using a simple Exlporer window- what could be easier? This may sound like a paid ad- (I don't even like Creative Labs that much). But the product is truly worthy of all this and more. Finally someone beat Apple at its iPod game, with an open-arcitechture product, but no ones knows about it yet.

<Title>Fresh out the box
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just received by Creative Zen 30GB today (I'm very excited).  I just unpacked the unit and it looks very sleek (I purchased the black one). It's a little bit taller than my palm.  The first thing I had to do was upgrade my QuickTime as versions 7.01 and 7.02 interfere with the Zen.  That upgrade on line was easy enough.  Next, I plugged in the until to charge it up.  It has to charge for 2 hours.  During this process I had to power it up and down.  During that I was able to see a very crisp and clean screen.  I'm looking forward to watching videos.  I purchased this product mainly to watch videos while working out, on the train, etc.  Anyway, installation was a breeze--popped in the setup disk and it walked me through the entire install without a problem.  The unit comes with a felt bag to store the unit--for the price, it would have been nicer to receive a more protective cover.  I think if I drop it in this bag, the unit will suffer damage. So, the first thing I must do is go out and purchase a better cover for the unit.  I should have ordered it when I ordered the unit.  WARNING-I thought this was interesting (and scary) on the second page of the instructions it states "THE CORDS INCLUDED WITH THIS PRODUCT MAY CONTAIN CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. Wash hands after handling"--what the heck is that!!!  California is wacky, but I decided I was going to wash my hands anyway--I don't know if this is common to all electronics, but I don't understand why they would use accessories that require this disclosure...Anyway, you now know before you buy that this is in there.  Back to the install.  The directions say that versions 7.01 and 7.02 of Quicktime will halt your Creative installation, but version 7.03 has fixed this problem.  I could only download 7.04 at apple.com, and it appears that my creative installation halted.  However, I x'd out of it and it asked me if I wanted to reboot in order for my computer to accept changes.  I did that and it seems to be working.  I have my unit plugged into the USB (docked) and I am attempting to copy a video from my external hardrive to the unit.  The directions are a bit skimpy on how to do this.  However, I dragged and dropped the file and hit the conversion button.  It walked me through the conversion, which was pretty simple. I keep getting a busy message requiring me to hit the swich button.  If you get it, just hit it and it will continue with the transfer.  My first transfer of 1.12 gb was pretty quick (only a couple of minutes).  My second download, about the same size, (in "good quality"--you have a choice--the better quality probably taking a bit longer) was done in around 2 minutes--not bad for a full movie.   OKAY--I undocked the unit and hit menu button, found videos and saw that my transferred movies were there--AWESOME AND EASY. My headphones are in and they are comfortable plug ins (with little cushions on the outside--unlike my ipod).  I turned on my movie (Chronicles of Riddick--I know, not the best, but some good special effects to test the unit).  The picture is crisp, clear and excellent...I'm loving it.  The sound is awesome, a bit too loud, but I haven't found the volume button.  So, in less than a 1/2 hour I'm up and running watching movies on my Creative Zen.  I am totally digging it.  I will continue to test the unit and learn how to fully utilize it, but for now--this is a five star for me (I am so excited about being able to copy my movies to this unit!!!!)

<Title>Don't Hesitate...
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me admit right off the bat that I don't like anything Apple makes and my brief experience with the iPod click-wheel only reinforced that feeling.  The Creative Zen Vision M has it all! One of the best things about this device is that you don't have to install ANY of the Creative software that comes with it! If you have Windows XP, just plug it into a USB port and browse to it through My Computer.  You can use Windows Media Player to sync media files or simply drag and drop media and photos using the standard Windows interface.  The adjustment/learning curve for the controls on this device is pretty easy and I am comfortable using it.  There is still one button (upper left) that I may have to consult the manual on because when pressed, I get a result that I was not expecting.  In addition to playing Windows Media files, this bad boy plays my TiVo files without any special conversion necessary.  I just transfer the TiVo files from my TiVo to my PC, then use Windows Media Player to sync my TiVo files to my Creative Zen Vision M.  The FM radio tuner/recording feature is nice, but I admit that I am probably not going to get much use out of that, except during football season.  This is a wonderful device and I am highly impressed.

<Title>At $300 you want to get it right... Zen gets the job done.
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I work in technology and have tons of digital music, DVR television shows and DVDs. I wanted something that could hold all of this so I could easily move content from my different Media Center PCs and have good tunes and shows to enjoy while I'm on the road. Despite all I know about technology I still almost went with the iPod. They're marketing people are brilliant! I am very glad I didn't do that now. With the Creative I don't have to worry about converting anything. I already have so much music on my Windows Media Centers and copying those over to the Zen was a breeze. The included software even converts video for you if in the wrong format. It's truely plug and play and works great!  300 bones isn't a small purchase for me so I am thrilled to be so happy with this product. Feature rich and the sound is great! I would recommend this as the very best alternative to the iPod. If you are running a Windows based PC this is the product for you.  Now, after a gushingly positive sales pitch for a company I don't work for, I should point out where I see room for improvement. After only a couple of days I have found that the screen scratches fairly easy so you may want to leave the film on it or get something to protect it. I also found it odd that it doesn't support the format in which Microsoft records shows. These must first be converted (the software does handle this nicely though). The interface isn't quite as intuitive as I would have liked, but is very easy to learn.  I am still amazed that they packed 30 gigs into something this size! I hope that this review helps you with your decision. After doing the research this is what I got and I am happy that I did.

<Title>Buyer beware - major hardware problems
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Those considering buying this unit should check out the official Creative forums first. It appears a large number of people are receiving units which are either DOA (Dead on Arrival) or die shortly thereafter. I personally have gone through three dead units from 3 different vendors, all with the same symptoms. Too bad, this would otherwise be a great unit.

<Title>Great Features!
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before purchasing the Vision, I had a look at the reviews I found online and they played a large part in going with it over the IPOD 30 GB.  I thought the features offered were right up my alley including the FM radio, microphone/radio recording capability, access to MSN Outlook email/calendar features.  I must say after opening it and trying it out, it didn't fail to impress!  I tried out the microphone to record and found it to be of good quality, the video was sharp enough on the little screen (and my friends were impressed by the video highlights I had of Ronaldinho), and the FM radio was able to pick up most of the channels I liked.  Last but not least, the sound quality is just superb - it is after all Creative Labs and thats their forte but its still impressive!  There are a few things that could be improved on.  It would be nice if I could select a whole genre of music or album or artist but Vision forces you to select the actual song and add it to the currently playing list.   The FM radio forces you to use the AutoSelect to find all the channels in range but it would help if there was an option to allow the user to select/scroll to a particular channel even if the signal is not so strong.  Also, it is somewhat more bulky than the IPOD 30 GB so it might be tiresome to go running with - and you have to buy an accessory with a belt clip or armband/wristband.    But hey, these are all minor things and I have probably missed the easy way to get around it - overall a worthy buy!

<Title>My best MP3 player yet. A winner!
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Elegant, small and fun, the Zen Vision:M does many things well. Perhaps its user interface is not as intuitive as the Ipod, but the sound is outstanding. This is especially evident in playing opera recordings, and the M will please those very particular music types who favor accuracy over sheer volume (although this one can crank up too, so protect your ears!) I have also used Archos products (no tech support) and the Sony Network Walkman (quite good with terrific battery power, now discontinued) but my fourth Creative player (2 jukeboxes and an earlier Zen) is the best ever with a superb screen that can be used on the go by middle-aged music lovers without perpetually rummaging for those reading glasses. The button layout is not as obvious as one would like, but after a few hours, I'm getting with the program, and loving it. Be the first on your block to buy the green one!

<Content>i know that this will be the prototype for the next generation of mp3 players.  the creative zen vision: m is versitile, useful, and amazing for all the reasons everyone else has said.  the most surprizing thing to me is the screen quality.  the images are so translucent and lucid that it's easy to be amazed by the video and picture display. it's a great interactive lil gadget that's sure to delight me for hours upon hours. i've been trying to drain the battery and it lasts way beyond what creative states.  also, putting the mp3 player on hold turns off the screen!  sound quality: 9/10 video quality: 10/10 video battery: 9/10 audio battery: 10/10 revolutionariness: 10/10 overall: 9.9/10

<Title>Worst customer service
<Date>Mon Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen Touch 20 GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a Christmas present. It worked fine until the screen developed a big black spot right in the middle of it. It looks like it's burned. I called technical support (405-742-6622) and had to wait for about 20 minutes before someone finally answered. This clown told me I had to pay them $10 for tech support. I told him I just wanted an RMA# so I could return it, I didn't need to go through any nonsense. He told me my 1 year warranty wasn't going to cover replacing a defective screen and that I had to return it with $25 and that the repair department would probably charge me $100 to replace it. These guys suck! This is a $200 MP3 player that's going to cost $100 to fix a defective part.

<Title>Amazing...
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My last playerr, an Archos jukebox, bit the dust after only a few months and now they tell me they already don't make parts for it, so I decided to look for a new one from a better company. This one has exceeded my expectations!  Sound quality- OMG! Sounds like 3D. Crisp, clear, good volume. BIG improvement over the Archos, and I had thought the Archos was good, but this one blows it away.  Ease of Use- The software, despite what others have said, is really simple. I was able to copy all the music from my hard drive into the Creative Zen in 180 seconds (1 second per song), and then I copied 16 gigabytes of music from my old Archos into the Zen in about 15 minutes. For ripping new CDs, you just put the disc in, click rip, and it goes right into the Zen.  The only tricky thing is that the controls are REALLY sensitive. But they all make sense, and you really don't need to look at the book to figure them out. But the book is really clear and simple.  Battery life- I dont know yet, since I just got the player yesterday.  Size- a deck of cards in size and weight, almost exactly!  I highly recommend this player. Although, I do not know how durable it is, again since i just got it yesterday.

<Title>former iPod owner says: Blows iPod away!!
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a two-year owner of an iPod, i got absolutely sick and tired of my mp3 player becoming increasingly incompatible with just about everything.  The more time that passed, the more times i lost everything on the iPod and the more i found myself shaking my head.  i bought the zen vision:m about a week ago, and i have been amazed by it since it's been in my possession.  i like to refer to it as an iPod without the bull****. i think the fact that people complain about its size, its menu interface and its reliability is a complete joke.    I find the size to be just right for this device, very comparable to the 20 GB iPod i have owned for the last few years.  it's a solid piece of equipment (scratches easy, don't even mess around just buy a case for it. there are plenty now.)  The menu interface is quite reminiscent of the ipod's (which is a good thing), with a few excellent updates. it has a feature while browsing the media library that enables you to scroll to a specific letter rather than scroll through everything...very handy for large libraries. the touchpad that for some reason people are complaining about in their reviews has given me no trouble. it's not a click wheel...so what? get over it folks.  it functions almost exactly the same, except it has a rapid scroll function which comes in handy.  it has three sensitivity settings, so there is really no reason to complain about its sensitivity.  also a clutch addition is the shortcut button. randomize all songs? one touch.  whatever you want. one touch. great stuff.  the screen itself is just what it advertises. it's awesome. i find it playing back videos at exactly the quality they should be, colors are right on. no fuzziness or lines in the video. i haven't had a compatibility problem yet, something all you iPod clowns (i can say that because i have been one myself) can't say.   good luck getting a DivX video onto your ipod without going to nerdcentral.com to figure it out, and then you're still going to have a decreased quality video. apple is shooting itself in the foot by purposely not making their great product compatible. the zen vision:m is compatible with just about every music service there is...iPods don't have a chance with anything besides itunes.  not to mention the zen is compatible with just about every media file you could want to put on your mp3 player.  the one complaint i have with it is that you can't play the files directly off the player when it's plugged in. however, this is on the other hand an extremely smart security measure they have taken because it prevents your files from being mistakenly deleted, which is something that EVERY iPod owner goes through at least once. it sucks, and this prevents it. i still wish i could play them through winamp though...  IF YOU WANT AN MP3 PLAYER, STOP WHAT YOURE DOING AND BUY THIS ONE NOW. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. meanwhile, i'm going to start an anti-apple movement... see ya.

<Title>Creative Products:  Buyer Beware!!
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After several attempts to own a functional MP3 player from Creative, I gave up. It should not be this hard; iPod, here I come. My first Creative Player broke within three months of opening the box. I returned it (a small but manageable hassle). I received an entirely new one about two weeks later, no charge. Two months later, had power management issues with the new one; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware. OK, fine. Three months later, the thing completely crashes -- no music, no connectivity to my PC, nothing but a permanent splash screen. I tried the restore mode, but none of the restore functions were working. The thing was dead dead dead.  I called Creative to see what they could do. For $25, they could tell me what I already knew: it wasn't working and needed to be fixed. Then, they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it. All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year (read: still within warranty) since I had received it. Great customer service, eh?  Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company. Don't buy a Creative Product.

I don't have mine either and it's not Amazon or Academic Superstore's fault. You can't even get them on the Creative website. It's gone....everywhere.

<Title>Very nice, but...........
<Date>Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my 16 yr. old daughter and she loves it. It's a little tricky setting up but you should expect this from such a high tech. product. All I can say is be patient.   Many of her friends own ipod's but when they saw this they ALL said they would rather have one of these. The sound quality is better along with the picture quality. Plus, they liked other features the Zen Vision has that the ipod doesn't have. The biggest complaint about the ipod from her friends (and their parents) was the cost and hassle to replace the battery.  My only gripe, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, Is with CREATIVE for not coming up with their own line of screen protectors and silicone cases to protect their very high priced product. They couldn't figure this out? Come on, the name of the company is CREATIVE, isn't it?  We are forced to buy overpriced accessories that cost too much and don't do the job.   It's still not too late CREATIVE.

<Title>Most Frustrating MP3 Player for money !
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>How come there are no 'Zero' Stars for Review ??.   If you are buying MP3 player for first time, Don't start with this. This is most frustrating player you will ever buy for money. Menu's are so frustrating and buttons are sooooo sensitive, My blood pressure went hign trying to figure out how to get to the main menu. I have spent over 6 hours on this and read so called 'User Manual' 3 times, but this is worst pain I ever had with any electronic item.    Worst product I ever bought in my life.  I am not sure if these reviews are Genuine but I heard similar experince from a friend of mine. I was told that I should stick with Ipod Instead..  Manual is very very poorly written as it assumes that you owned many MP3 players before. What's wrong with Creative ?.  Keep Away, I would recommend you go to some store and try this out before buying from Amazon and you will Thank me for this..  I am returning this ASAP, if Amazon does not take it back, I will give to my 2 year kid to play with it finally to avoid the headache !.

<Content>I previously bought a creative zen micro from amazon and i absolutley love it.  I cant get enough of it.  I listen to it every possible minute i can.  Ive had this for about a year and a half, and i saw that creative came out with the vision m.  I did hours of research on it.  I compared it to the IPod video, and decided that the vision m was the mp3 video player for me. My dad has an IPod video and he loves it, but recently the hard drive crashed on him. I ordered the vision m in white because the black really shows finger prints and scratches.  I ordered this product on March 28 and today is April 28.  Amazon still hasnt shipped this product, and I payed extra for express shipping.  I am getting extremely impatient, but from what i hear "good things are worth waiting for"

<Title>Awsome media player!
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Without restating all the technical issues, this player is wonderful.  The video, which I didn't intend to use, is sharp and simple to load using the included software or WMP10.  Screen bright and battery life strong.  Works great as a storage device.  But most important, it is easy to use, and sounds great as an audio player.  My wife has, and loves her iPod, but I did not want to be tied to the Apple software, and this supports more formats.  Could have better headphones, but replacements are available.  I haven't discovered the optimal file format and bit-rate for this, yet.  I use 128kbps and my entire music collection and several long videos fit with room to spare.  Would have preferred a flash memory player, but the capacity is not there.  Not a lot of accessories, yet, but I use a Samsonite camera case with a small external pocket for the dongle and headset.  Also, I purchased the invisible shield at shieldzone.com and this protectes the screen and body beautifully.  This is my favorite new toy!

<Title>Amazing Player--Best in Class
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to tell you, I did my research on this one and even had some bad experiences with other players before being completely satisfied with this little versatile player Creative came out with.   It's got amazing audio fidelity (which is helped by providing earbuds that aren't worthless) and a immpeccable visual display to boot.  I bought an iRiver and had to return it due to bad crashing problems, so I went with this and couldn't be happier (listening to it right now!).   The only issue I've had is that Windows wouldn't recognize it until I downloaded a patch from the internet, but I think this is due to the fact that I run service pack 1.    Pros: Sound quality.  Very clear Visual quality.  Little pixelation, incredibly clear Album art shown with song Syncs with Microsoft Outlook (great if you live by to-do lists) Picture viewing (zoom and rotation functions) Flexibility with software (use with WMP, or two of their very nice little programs) Good battery life, short charge time  Cons: No manual volume control (scroll bar works Vertical scroll bar (it's OK, but hard to get used to) The "pouch" they give you.  BUY A CASE (and never take it out) Odd controls--a bit hard to get used to the shortcut buttons Gaps between tracks (I can't figure out how to fix this--the iRiver had a feature that would, but this doesn't seem to  Basically, the good seriously outweighs the bad.  I highly recommend buying this over the iRiver and especailly the iPod.  If you have the connectivity problems I did, search on tech forums for a patch and that should fix it right up.  Good Luck!

I am guessing the reason is so the could fit everything inside the player. I am happy with this so far. The product was also not in stock.

<Title>Good partner with a Media Center PC
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got one a month ago.  If you are one of the many people who have a new media center PC and you are recording TV on it (you have plugged your cable into it, etc.), this is a good device in that you can easily sync it with the MCPC and put your recorded TV shows on the player.  You can't do that with the iPod device, which is incompatible with Media Center.  Then to get music you can just rip your CDs or use a Windows oriented digital music service like Rhapsody or Yahoo or whatever....  The device is handy, it's cute, the sound and video are good.    Basically, if you have a Media Center PC, this is clearly a better choice for you than the iPod.

<Title>The real shipping only takes one day; so don't be frustrated, it will arrive soon!
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>More than one month after ordering, Zen arrived yesterday. It doesn't disappoint me even though I was a little bit worried about its thickness. The size is perfect, the weight is perfect and the FEEL is perfect! The white Zen is very good looking!  I transferred all audio/video files I was having access to immediately to Zen. All audio files were taken without a problem, so were most videos. Several video files were, as the Zen told me, out of its playing capability but can be converted with a couple of clicks -- the converting time is a little bit long maybe because I picked the "best-quality-longest-time" mode and I was notoriously impatient, :). The image quality is amazing! So colorful and fine-grained. The sound is awesome too. FM works nicely - I'm listening to it right now after having watched all the videos on Zen.  The battery charging is fast, less than 2 hours for a full charge. It's still running with more than 60% left after about 2 hour of video playing, 3 hour of mp3 and more than one hour of radio in addition to half an hour of recording and countless menu operations.  The microphone gave me some hard time, though I think it will be better after I get more used to its buttons and touch pad.   I only installed the simplest media explorer. Maybe that's the reason I can't drag and drop files between two Zen folders, even though dragging and dropping between Zen and computer are smooth.  The acompanying pouch is cute, however I still want to buy an armband pouch. Then I can enjoy the music whenever I want, even on a treadmill.  Two more little nice things to say about Zen: -The blue screensaver LED can work as an illumilator in the dark, tiny but better than nothing, eh? -The screen can be used as a mirror once the screen saver is on.  All in all, I'm very happy with my Zen.

<Title>Great Peice of Equipment
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M is a great peice of hardware.  After purchasing it and rushing to open the box (and oohing and aaahing for a while) I pluged it in to begin the initial charge. Then I turned it on... First thing you notice, the screen is beautiful. I can't reiterate that enough, it is unbelievable how clear and vibrant the screen is.  I sync'ed a few CD's to it, and listened, the sound quality is superb. The headphones they give you are not-so-great, but thats become an unwelcome precedent in mp3 players.  Next I tried to sync some TV shows to it... I had a little trouble with this. If you are expecting that this is gonna be a flawless video sync, think again. Your video may and probably will need a lengthy conversion process. However, once they are on there, they are incredible. You'd think watching shows on the 2 inch screen would be ridiculous, but the quality makes it a very enjoyable experience.  The playforsure software is great too, just plug it into any computer with WMP10 and you can synce music/vidoes/pictures.   If there is one thing Creative did right, it was custimization. My background is currently an ominous picture of Emperor Palpatine. Different colors (both the external and the display) and many other things.   All in all, it is worth my money. It wasnt painless, but nothing is. If you don't like Ipods, get this.

I'm not a tech person at all, but the organizational features all seem pretty intuitive to me.  I've had no problems importing my music and pictures, making playlists, changing menu option, etc.  And my husband, who is a tech person, was blown away by the color quality on the screen while watching an episode of South Park.  I'm not a sound snob, but I think the quality is really good.  Only thing that is hard to get used to is the sensitivity of the controls...but there is a menu option to fix that too! LOVE IT!!!!

Why don't they provide an adapter?) or you need to charge thro the USB port of your computer. ** For iPod, they say, when the battery dies, you have to spend another 100 plus bucks to get new battery installed.  ** Vision M: works as a true USB Flash drive with upto 10GB plus capacity. By 'true USB', I mean, you don't need to have Zen Vision drivers installed on target computer. You just click few buttons on it and then connect it any computer the way you would connect a Flash drive. Then drag and drop your files. (I am using this to create an additional back up of my important files!)  ** You have a nice FM tuner built in so I don't have to worry about paying too much for songs.  ** There are multiple ways to move media/files to Vision M. Being Windows user, it is pretty intuitive to work with Vision M  ** I think Vision M is little bulkier but I think that is the right size that fits well in your hand. The control buttons are also comfortable to work with.  ** This is also going to hold all of our digital photos and some family videos. This, and iPod Video both, can be hooked up to any TV to share your pictures and vidoes to any friend, family or relative when you are visiting.  Problems?  * It is difficult to get choices while buying accessories for Vision M. * You must have Windows XP *****SP1****** or higher otherwise it just does not work with your computer.  The last but not the least, why I let him buy Vision M- is to encourage competition. I don't want Apple to sleep like a monopoly (It seems to me that they are turning into it, otherwise why wouldn't they include an AC adapter with iPod Video! It would not cost them more than $2 per piece! There is no point for making iPod users pay 15 plus dollars for it for buying it separately!!)  In short, this is a preety good hand-held media player.

<Title>Unfortunate Shipping.... Phenomenal Device!!!
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes yes yes they shouldn't be selling them before they can stock them, however IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!!!! SO WHY GIVE THE PRODUCT A BAD RATING WHEN THIS ISN'T A PLACE TO REVIEW THE SHIPPING!!!!!!!!  It's unfortunate that idiots come on here and write a review NOT on the PRODUCT but just to complain about slow shipping!  I ordered mine on April 8th and it didn't ship until May 3rd, it arrived on the 5th.  I was excited I got an InvisibleShield fullbody cover for mine!  HIGHLY recommended, it's literally invisible and only takes maybe 10 minutes max to perfectly get it on the player, when it dries it's never going to let your expensive investment get a scratch on it!  but that's off topic, this mp3 player ROCKS!!!!  I have about 16gb of music on my computer and I put about 10 gbs onto my Vision:M it couldn't have been easier!!!  I must admit I haven't figured out how to get zencast videos to transfer onto it, and I had to update my Codecs and Quicktime to convert videos onto the little thing.  DonnieDarko in DivX format took about 20minutes to convert and transfer onto the Player.  the screen is beautiful!!!  you can easily click your way through your library and strike up a playlist (Much like you would on your computer in windows media player)  and save that playlist if you feel the need to do so.  A beautiful feature I LOVE LOVE LOVE is you can take a picture from your PICS Folder and if you'd like to you can APPLY IT AS YOUR WALLPAPER!!  That's a great little creature feature that I love, Jimi Hendrix is hanging out on my screen at the moment.  The battery lasts a long time, with all my fidgeting and playing around for the day I'm sure I'll only get 10 hours out of it, but if I was on a long roadtrip (I.E. put the player on shuffle and on hold so the screen is completely black) I'm sure you can easily get 15 hours out of it.  I do recommend getting New headphones I have a pair of SPRKPLG Ear Plugs from Koss, they're cheap($20) and they almost completely shut out outside noises.  I've also set up my Radio tuner, it scanned and created presets and you can label each radio station too if you feel like it.  The equalizer is a godsend too! In normal it was still too bass happy for me I like my mids and highs so I put it on vocal, or jazz both are a good setting for rock or jazz etc, the bass boost would be more for the Rap crowd, not my taste but to each their own.  Lets seee, yeah it's pretty simple click and drag from MY MUSIC to the creative zen Music folder, quick transfers! lightning fast, faster than my MPIO and Sandisk FlashDrives!  I must admit when I add afew folders to a playlist at a time it takes a little pause to complete, and when watching a movie it pauses for up to 10 seconds before it plays again.  That is a little bothersome but patience is a virtue and if you're watching a movie you'll probably be watching it all the way through anyways.  It feels solid in my hand, it's thicker than the Ipod which I actually like, I don't feel like I'm going to break it.  beautiful design and hopefully when Creative reorganizes their priorities in the next quarter, they'll supply more stores and online stores, with more than enough Vision:Ms they could KILL IPOD if they just get on the right track with Distribution!!!!  Thanks for reading and remember, if you're patient you won't mind the wait, it's really a trip playing with this thing!  I'm in love with it!

<Title>Dude this is a great player
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have just got this player and I will say right now that is awesome. It is able to pretty much everthing that an I-Pod can except for games.  If you dont mind not having games, then this player is twice as good as its sister player the I-Pod. The main object that sets it apart is the fact that it has a built in FM radio and microphone. The recording quality is amazing. The screen is the same size as I-Pod's but it is clearer. another great function is the way you dont have to use I-Tunes. It uses windows and any MP3 formated song. Video playback is awsome. compatible formats such as: WMV9, MPEG1/2/3/4-SP, Motion JPEG, DivX and Xvid. The battery life for video is about 2x lnger than that of the I-Pod. Photo campatiable also and able to compose slide shows. With an Audio/Video out cable (comes with most new DVD players) you can easily plug the player right in to your TV. Simple and easy to use and not to mention $50 less than the 30gb I-Pod video it is a great player that can hold all of you media.   Amazon.com seems to be the cheepest place to find one at about $250.

<Title>NICE!
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Around x-mas time i wanted an MP3 player, a good one, i did a little reasearch and found the Toshiba gigabeat, it was great and sound quality improved after awhile, it was a little flimsy, but over it was great, until the headphone port broke after 4 months, i proptley bought it to Bad(best)Buy and replaced it with the video iPod, thought i try, i was not happy with it at all, it had crappy sound quality, and i didnt like iTunes.  That same day i found the Creative Zen Vision:M and loved it. did a little resarch no immediate problems.  Bought it yesterday and synced everything to it, videos and all.  no problems except i accedentally unplugged it  while it was syncing and it caused it to freeze alot but i reinstalled it and everything works great. Sound quality is da best, screen is also da best, FM radio with great reception, Voice recorder is also great if ur into that kinda stuff, u can password protect ur (dirty) videos to keep from snoopers, and i love it and its muy better than igay.

<Title>Creative Zen Vision:M
<Date>Thu May 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since most of the reviews of this product are either a) out-of-date or b) really more of a review of amazon's shipping techniques, I felt it necessary to write a cohesive, up-to-date review of this product.  Summary:  The Creative Zen Vision:M is a multi-award-winning mp3 player for good reason. CNet, one of the market's leading reviewers, gave this the award for Best In Show in the Mp3 and Portable Video Category, as well as the Best of CES and Editor's Choice award, all for 2006. The Apple iPod Video was one of the other products reviewed. Overall, the Creative Zen Vision:M is a better product than anything else on the market. And while it did cost more than the iPod originally, the price has come down to equal, giving you few reasons not to buy it.  The Interface:  The interface of the Vision:M is extremely ergonomic and easy to use. The touchpad's sensitivity is easily adjusted and comfortable to navigate through any menu. Holding down on the top or bottom of the touchpad will activate fast scrolling and smaller movements are controlled by running your finger up and down. Selections are made by tapping the touchpad. In addition, the Vision:M has six buttons: One for play/pause, a next/previous arrow on either side of the touchpad, a menu button, a back button, and a customizable shortcut button. In addition, all the menus are fully customizable so you can maximize your own browsing preferences.  The Performance:  The Vision:M's screen is incredible. With six times as many colors as the iPod, the difference is easily visible. I compared the same video clip on my Vision:M to my friend's iPod and could easily tell which screen was better. In addition, the battery life when playing video is up to four times that of the iPod, meaning you can watch feature-length films without charging, and still have enough battery life for hours of music. To test it, I charged the battery fully and then watched The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Extended Edition with the maximum brightness settings. When the movie was done, I listened to an hour and a half of music before the player ultimately died on me. The sound quality is also supurb - something you can expect from a company that specializes in digital audio equipment (chances are the sound card in your computer was made by Creative).  The Features:  In addition to the features offered by the iPod Video, the Vision:M offers a radio am/fm tuner and a radio/voice recorder. While these may not sound that useful, I've used them more than I thought I would, especially the voice recorder. Another incredible feature the Vision:M offers over the iPod is complete compatibility and integration with Windows. You can transfer songs, tags, and album art from your Windows Media Player library as well as sync a calendar with Outlook to carry with you. It also comes bundled with its own software for transferring files. Unlike the iPod, the Vision:M offers support for a large library of filetypes - where the iPod only supports its own formats and has to reformat your files to make them compatible, the Vision:M rarely (if ever) has to do so - even Xvid/DivX formats will play! Unfortunately for you Mac users, Creative has yet to release a set of drivers for Mac OS, but reports say they're currently developing them.  The Quick Review:  Pros: Ample battery life Clear, bright, colorful display Customizable menus Ergonomic interface Comes in five colors Excellent sound quality Same price as iPod  Cons: Slightly thicker than the iPod Not Mac compatible Only comes in 30GB - iPod offers a 60GB model Few accessories (can find more on eBay, ship from overseas)  The Bottom Line: The iPod comes with a huge culture identification behind it that the Vision:M just doesn't have, so if you're looking to be a part of that culture regardless of the quality of the product, there's no reason not to buy the iPod. It's still a good product. Also if you're looking for a massive library of accessories, the Vision:M isn't for you. But if what you're looking for is a high quality, affordable media player that won't let you down and will consistently outperform the competition, the Vision:M is your best choice.

<Title>great value mp3 player
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is my 2nd mp3 player from creative. THe first was a zen xtra 30gb which I spilt milk over and that was that. I was torn between this and the Ipod video but the radio and voice recorder along with the battery life for video sealed the deal, not to mention the lack of a charger with the IPod?? I also like to use this device to stream svis to my TV, I can download movies on the PC and then watch on the TV, you will need a cable for this, my old one from my Sony camcorder did the job nicely. The touchpad takes a little getting used to but it's easy enough and the software is simple and responsive. It's a perfect size, I would not want anything smaller to be honest. The only thing I don't like is to dim the screen ( to save batteries ) you have to lock the device which is a pain cos then you have to unlock again to skip a song and then lock it once again. Apart from this minor issue, I recommend this highly and it appears to be much better value than the Ipod when you take into account all the extra features.

<Title>Amazing MP3 player
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of debating between the iPod and the Creative Vision: M before deciding on the Creative.  With the prices now equal, I think there's really no reason not to go with the Creative.  The player is gorgeous, feels solid, doesn't have the stupid scratchable chrome to worry about, it has a very intuitive and simple to use interface, the sound quality is amazing, and what comes in the box is way better than the iPod (better headphones, a wall charger, good documentation).  I think the only thing you give up is the ability to sync with iTunes.  If you don't care about this, then it's a no-brainer, go with the Creative.  I'm very happy with my player, an alternative for those who don't want to say baaaa when Steve Jobs touts the next big thing.

<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was going to title this review "Amazing MP3 player", but I realized that this is much more than that.  This product blows my mind with how good it is.  First off, the sound quality is amazing.  It has a custom EQ, which is something I love, and the earbuds it comes with take a bit of getting used to, as in how to put them in, but once you do, you will be amazed at how great everything sounds.  Secondly, the screen.  It is absolutely gorgeous, and shows amazing color.  Watching videos is terrific because of how good everything looks.  It's nice and bright, and is very slick when it fades to darkness.  When you put the Vision M on hold, the screen actually turns off to conserve battery life, which is great.  Speaking of the battery life, it's great.  I don't see why anyone could pass this product up, it's amazing.  If you're not interested in the iPod, pick this one up.

<Title>Thank you Vision M (The Destroyer) **UPDATED**
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'am one of those who seek the best product in its category even if i have to pay more. The ZEN VISION M is one of those best products in the MP3 field. when i first decided to buy an mp3 player, first of all like everybody and without thinking and comparing i bought the ipod nano. i was looking for a small mp3 player with a descent storage and of course it must be good looking. After, having the nano for two months, i got so bored. the nano can't hold anything else except music and photos that must be seen on 1.5 inch screen therefore you will need a loop if you want to view your pictures. i sold the nano to one of my friends and i got the san disk sansa e260, excuse me san disk but that thing is suck. tha material from which that thing was made can't compete with other mp3 player in the market. the e260 gives you that very cheap look although it costs me 220 USD. i returned tha sansa back to best buy and i decided to spend a little bit more and get something with a video (fully equipped) and a big screen. i started comparing between the 2 most rivals in the market, the ipod video and the ZEN Vision M. finally, i decided to buy the VISION M for the reasons below:  1-the vision M is equipped with an FM tuner with a perfect reception for 70% of the channels.  2-the vision M is equipped with an FM recorder so you can record your favorite radio show, song or game and listen to it later.  3-the vision M is equipped with an excellent voice recorder. i made a test for the voice recorder in Best Buy, i recorded my voice talking in the middle of a crowd and WOW i can still hear my voice clearly  4-the 2.5 inch LCD(high definition)screen is very clear and sharp that you can see your pictures very vivid plus, you have a zoom in feature. so i don't need a loop anymore!  5-the player is customizable. you can change the defalut backgrounds with any picture uploaded on your player. Plus, the player comes equipped with 6 different backgrounds and fonts.  6-the Vision M is not scratches and fingerprints magnet like the ipods.  7-the included software is very easy to use. i got used to itunes and when i used the software included i found it pretty much similar and i dealt with it like if i have been using it long time ago.  8-the player comes with a wall charger!! thank you so much creative for giving the player's buyer his rights. the ipod video doesn't come with a wall charger, you have to buy it seperately for around 30 USD, ipods are charged with the included USB cable which is ridiculous because i remember one time i was in a hotel and i couldn't listen to my ipod because the thing ran out of battery and i had no access to computers.  9-sound quality is pretty much the same, but the included speakers with the creative are prettier than the ipod.  10-the accessories for the Vision M started to show up in stores, DLO company made till now 2 different cases for it. plus, many different cases that you can find online especially on Amazon.com.  11-the Vision M has better battery life, lasts 1 - 1.5 hours more than the ipod video when playing videos and more hours when you play music  12-The vision M has one of the best features that ever came in an mp3 player before..you can search for your song alphabetically. plus, you can click on the vertical touch pad and a keyboard will apears on which type the name of your song using the touch pad and the player will look it up for you whereever this song exists. Isn't that excellen?   Conclusion: the vision M offers you all the Ipod Video features plus the list above. for the same price. you pay 300 USD for both!!!! the Vision M from my opinion worth every penny sipmly because if you want to buy some accessories for the Ipod video to make it with the same features equipped in the Vision M you will have to spend at least 120 USD over the initial 300 USD to add the fm tuner and the voice recorder and you will never have zoom feature or customizable player.  Some Remarks: -they say that the itunes is one of the pros of the ipods, i don't know why, this software can be downloaded for free even if you don't have an ipod!!! -they say that the accessories is on of the pros of the ipods, i don't know who's going to buy all these cases and speakers offered in the market by everybody? -they say that the ipods are easier to use. Feel this one and try it anywhere and you will find very easy to use and even easier. i hope that my review can be helpful. thank you creative for making such an excellent product and saving the customers from this bad monopoly called iPods...  P.S: I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT "I'AM ALMOST SOMETHING" THAT THE BACK AND THE FRONT OF THE SAN DISK SANSA E200 LOOK GREAT,I AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE AND THE DESIGN OF THE THING IT SELF LOOKS PRETTY BUT THE MATERIALS THAT THAT THING WAS MADE OF SEEM TO BE VERYYY CHEAP, THE SCROLL WHEEL MADE SOME CRACKY NOISES WHEN USING IT IN SWITCHING BETWEEN MENUS AND ALSO IT WASN'T SMOOTH AT ALL. THE BACK OF THE SANSA IS MADE OF LIQUID METAL WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO RESIST SCRATCHES WHICH I LIKE, BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT THIS BACK AND THE WHOLE PLAYER GIVES YOU THAT FEELING THAT THE PLAYER IS CHEAP AND CERY CHEAP BUT OF COURSE I AGREE THAT THE SANSA E200 HAS MUCH BETTER VALUE THAT IPOD NANO..  Regarding the accessories i placed an order for an awesome silicone case from DLO.com and i received it yesterday.. the case fits my vision M perfectly and i got the case on time wih no hassles.

<Title>Wonderful player, looks great
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Setting up and charging the player was a breeze.  The included software is quite manageable, but I actually prefer using the plugins that Real has for their player to transfer files to the Zen.  Its nice to have an option of software to transfer files to the player. The touch wheel takes a second to get used to, especially the "tap" feature that functions like an "enter" key when you want to access a file.  But an Ipod "wheel" takes time to get used to as well, and  I believe that the interfaces are comparable.  file access seems to take up to 2 or 3 seconds, possibly longer if its searching for video files. For someone interested in an alternative to the omnipresent Ipod, this is a great item.  You can also blow people away buy playing your videos on this very vibrant screen.  I've shown just the demos to people and they are amazed, watching a show on this tiny screen is not all that tough on the eyes because the picture is quite clear.  Transfering video files is equally simple as transfering songs, something I understand the Ipod isn't as adept at. Personally, i still derive a little satisfaction from  having an enjoyable player that doesn't look like everyone else's.  I love telling people what it is, and showing them how it looks and "handles".  A real treat for those looking to buck trends.

<Title>I'm almost fifteen...
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPods are Rip-offs   The iPod's not the only music player you can get, It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met. If they just knew what the other players had in store for them, They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.  The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites, But why not get a better player with more gigabytes? Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices, Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.  The Sandisk Sansa E100 has many, many things, An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings. Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not! The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.  The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal, It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal. Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player, For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.      There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space, It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place. FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy, The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.  The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video, Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow. The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter, The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.  So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time, The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime. They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool", Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.   Facts  1.	Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player. 2.	The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference).       Just don't get the iPod Video...this is so much better it's not even funny  P.S. By the way, that "galaz something" guy is incorrect about the Sandisk Sansa E200 series. The front of the unit is more scratch proof than this, and the back of it is an amwsome metal that is stronger than steel! I like how you say that the Zen Vision: M is better than the iPod Video, but the E200 looks very cool, and is a much better value than the Nano. I so so so so so so so hate the Nano.

<Title>Where's the bass? Then I realised...
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had one of these for nearly a week. The first night I was slightly disappointed with the bottom end on my audio tracks. But I persisted, tried different earphones, listened to the same tracks on different devices, and it suddenly dawned on me... I had the bass problem not the Zen Vision M. I was used to hearing boom - with the Vision M I actually hear bass, and the clarity, and sound imagery is exceptional.  My advice is to give this player a chance to retrain your ears. Couple it with a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 5 Pro's for a truely wonderful listening experience.

<Title>Zen vs. iPod
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched both the 30G Zen Vision M and the 30G iPod. It came down to the replaceable battery for the iPod or the 10X better graphics for the Zen. The fact that you can get FM radio and the fact that you can get it in other colors (wasn't Apple about colors once?) helped too. I spoke with a lot of people whom had old iPods and said the batteries are still going strong. I figure in 5 years I'll be buying something new anyway, and if the battery does die, you can still always plug it in! Really nice graphics. Really fun toy!

<Title>Simply the best
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i did a lot of research on Mp3 players, becaues i didnt want to just throw 400 dollars away on just anything.  Most people are in the whole Ipod craze, and i knew that there had to be something better on the market.  Well, i found it with the creative 30 gig, it's simply the best.  Not only does it have 30 gigs, and holds 15,000 songs, the screen is crystal clear.  It also has many helpful appications such as calender, contacts, and syncs up with outlook.  You can change your background to any picture you want, making your mp3 player customized for you.  I really didnt know what to expect when i got home, ripped the thing open, and begain to install the software.  Is it going to be fast? Easy? Its was both, not only did it find every piece of music and video on my comp (about 10 gigs) it was on the creative in about 10 min, also converting video files.  This is my first time writting a review, but felt i just had to say that creative whips the dog $^@# out of the ipod.  (my buddies says the same, and he had the 60 gig ipod) so ha, to the followers of the ipod, and i welcome the leaders of the creative!!

<Title>Making the choice.
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While the Vision: M and the iPod Video (5G) both have their strengths, neither is the perfect mp3 player.  A quick rundown: The Vision: M has a better interface, better file handling, and a more vibrant screen.  The iPod is slightly slimmer, and perhaps more stylish, and has more accessories and a wider viewing angle from the top.  The screen on the Vision: M is better looking.  Put the iPod and the Vision: M side-by-side with an identical image and it is instanlty clear that the Vision: M is brighter and more vibrant.  The minor downside is that if you angle the screen down or up a little too far, the colors either white-out or invert.  This means that you have to tilt the player just right for optimal viewing.  The iPod colors aren't as rich, but the wider viewing angle doesn't require any particular tilt to see the screen.  Your hand will get tired from constant positioning if you watch a movie on the Vision: M, but your eyes will be a lot happier with the images they are seeing.  As far as storage space is concerned, both units are exactly the same.  Battery life is similar between the two and you won't notice a difference.   Along with storage space and battery life, something else to consider is the user interface.  Apple's player controls are easy to use and very responsive.  The Vision M: has a touchpad, which is also very responsive and easy to use. The 4 buttons surrounding it require some force to depress.  Hopefully the buttons loosen up a bit with use; otherwise, you'll gripe every time you strain to press them.  Despite the good hardware controls, the software interface of the iPod is lacking.  The breadth and depth of the functionality and options available in the Vision: M are better.  Things like themes, folders, navigation options, shuffle options, etc. that are not available in the Ipod stand out on the Vision: M.  As an example, there is no bookmark function for iPod audio unless a file is a specially created "audio book".  If you have a few long audio files (e.g. recorded lectures, etc.) that you want to pause in the middle and then return to later, you're out of luck.  The Vision: M does have a bookmark feature so you can do just that.  On the downside, neither of them will let you bookmark a movie.  Nor will either of them let you bookmark a song within the context of a playlist, a nice feature if you listen to a long playlist, stop in the middle to do something else, and then want to return later to the same song within the playlist.  Apple's iTunes software is awful because if you plug someone else's iPod into your computer you are likely to wipe out all the songs on their iPod.  Once your files go onto the iPod, its almost impossible to get them back out (it is possible to get around this with third party software, but it is a far from perfect solution).  The Vision: M, on the other hand, not only lets you easily transfer files back and forth, but also lets you organize them any way you want in folders on the player.  Since many people have built up a music collection over the years in their own unique folder structures, being able to keep them intact on the player is important.  The iPod is too restrictive since it requires very specific audio and video formats to work with the player.  With the Vision: M, there is no need to spend time jumping through file format hoops.  Finally, the bundled USB adapter of the Vision M: requires a cable and a second adapter to connect.  This means you will tote two things around with you to connect to a computer when all you really need is one.  The iPod has only one cable.  On the other hand, the bundled adapter on the Vision: M allows you to plug into a wall socket to charge.  The iPod requires a completely different adapter to plug into the wall.  It doesn't even come with the player; you have to pay extra.  In the end, there is no clear winner.  If you like style, small size, and choice of accessories, perhaps you'll be happier with the iPod.  If you like control over your files and rich screen color (with a little positioning), perhaps the Vision: M is better.

<Title>I'm done with the Zen Vision M
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen Vision M in early March and received it on March 22nd.  I really enjoyed it...until it stopped working two weeks later.  I sent it back to Creative and they sent me a new one.  I really enjoyed that one...until it stopped working a month later.  In both cases, the unit simply froze up and I was unable to turn it on.  Resetting it didn't work either.  The second one got SO hot while charging that it was honestly too hot to hold.  I really wanted to like the Zen Vision M as I like a lot of the features, especially the FM tuner.  However, after having two fail on me in two months, I am returning it to Amazon and exchanging it for an iPod.  In their email response to me, Amazon noted that the problems with the Zen Vision M "are more widespread" than they anticipated so they are not offering replacements but are instead offerering me a full refund.  The Creative customer service team is very slow in responding to issues.  I must commend Amazon for their quick customer service and by doing the right thing by granting me a full refund.

<Title>I LOVE this device
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got the Creative Zen Vision for my b-day. I have to say that I was holding my breathe when it came to believing everything it is suppose to do. I went beyong my expectations. I love the sound quality. Some people have complained about the earphones, but unless they're actually losing their hearing, they are great. The sound is crisp and clear. And the video. Oh My GGGGAAAAWWWWDDD!!! I swear the videos are clearer and brighter and crispier looking than even on my notebook that I've had for just over a year. I LOVE IT and can't wait to play around with the other features.  As for the sensitivity issue, I figured out that if you make the touch pad to "High" sensetivity, it becomes easier to scroll down. I highly and fully recommend this over the iPod.

With reset button stuck on black logo screen.  Cannot switch off.  Unsure what to do next, probably will be returning to amazon and try to obtain a non-defective unit.

<Title>120 days of shear bliss ! 
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this device since February and it is great. Everything it promises and more. I was an MP3 neophyte and studied and looked around before blindly plunking money down on an Ipod. I think we all know from experience that best selling isn't always the case. I stumbled on a review of the Zen Vision M from the CES electronics show and my decision was made.   The video quality is great. I hadn't anticipated using it much but I am now using the video feature everyday, downloading episodes of "Lost" from ABC's website, then watching them at lunch.   The MP3 player is great. I am using it daily at work where I get miserable radio reception. I download the Don and Mike show each day and listen to it the next day at work. Works like a top for any podcast or video cast as well as most any type of music file (Real, MP3, WMA, etc.)   Creative makes great sound cards for your PC, why not a great MP3 player.    The interface will take about a day to get used to but in a very short time you will be flying through the menus.   I haven't used the Outlook Calendar or memos feature yet.   I have used the partitioning capability to allow my MP3 player to also serve as my USB thumb drive.   I haven't had to test the battery life much. With the included wall charger/adapter, you can keep it powered on all day and not rely solely on USB charging/connection (which it also supports.)   The radio gets great reception.   The recording capability is a nice bonus. It has saved me a great deal of time in staff meetings - being able to capture important conversations and retrieve them easily later is quite nifty.   Scanning the Web, there is ample online support for most any issue you might have.  With four months of daily use under my belt, I haven't had any issues.   Summary, if you need a nice high quality MP3 player and don't have to have an Apple Ipod; if you are able to accept high quality over popularity, I would highly recommend the purchase.

<Title>i-Pod Killer
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Creative Zen for about 4 days and I'm loving it!!! The battery is amazing lasting as long as they say on the box. You can extend the battery life if you're listening to music by "locking" the player. It'll turn off your screen, but still play your music. You can make a slideshow and add music to it! The software included makes it all extremely easy to do. Also you don't have to worry if you don't have iTunes cause the Creative accepts Windows Media Player! You can delete pictures right off the Zen without having to hook it up to a PC. You can create playlists without being hooked up to a PC. This thing is amazing!!! I have several friends with iPods jealous of my Zen!! If you're looking for a MP3 player that plays video and does slideshows here it is!!! Now I haven't used the video feature because I've only had it for a couple of days, but I have a co-worker that says the image is better on the Zen over an iPod. There you have it! The Creative Zen is amazing!

<Title>Much better than my Ipod
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I originally bought an iPod video 30gb. For all MP3s not acquired through i-Tunes, it cuts off the last 15 seconds of sound. After working with Apple support, the only option I found was to edit all my files and add 15 seconds of silence at the end. Not a very practical solution. I returned it and bought the Zen M30. Wow, what a difference.  I love the interface. Instead of being limited to i-Tunes, Creative as given multiple options. I love the fact that I can use explorer to copy directly to the player. I can also use the software included with the M30.   There are multiple options for acquiring music. This player can use Yahoo Music, Napster or PlayforSure. Since I already use Rhapsody, I download the music I want and use the explorer plug in to transfer music. Making playlists is much easier on the M30 as well. The software is very user friendly and the learning curve is short. Without ready any directions, I was able to master it in about 5 minutes.  The bottom line is that I am glad the iPod didn't work out. This is a much better player and gives all the freedom to the user to choose what services to are best for downloading music and videos. I give 5 Stars to the Zen M30.

<Title>Positives far outway the negatives...
<Date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>!!! The screen...awesome.  Just awesome clarity and color.  Photos pop off the screen and nicely encoded movies look great.  Sound quality is quite good.  I like the fact that there's a radio and you can make one selection and have it go through and automatically program the stations that come in strong.  Great if you travel a lot. Voice recorder is a cool option too.  Most movie formats can be played on the player without any conversions.  I'd like to be able to arrange the folders in the player. For some reason, the computer software just won't let you cut and paste inside the player. Once they're uploaded...that's it. Unless you want to delete them, reorganize them on the computer and then reupload them to the player.  The Vision:M is ID3 driven, so it doesn't matter how they are arranged as far as folders and how the player sees them, but it would be nice for other purposes to be able to arrange them if I wanted or needed.  !! The touch sensitive pad is just ok.  It's often hit or miss, sometimes jumping over where you want to go and other times not quite making it.  I might of preferred buttons in place of their touch pad.   The DJ mode seems odd/lacking.  Random play all is the only useful option.  Though "Album of the day", "most popular", and "rarely heard" are interesting, I doubt I'll ever use anything but random.   Now, I realize this point may be asking for a bit much, but it would be a cool option if there would be some way to keep files from being included in the random play. Possibly by putting a code in the ID tag that would keep them out of random.  I have 2 gigs of trance on my player, so every 4th song ends up being trance when I do a random play all. Also, if you have audio book mp3's, you usually wouldn't want these popping up and playing during random.  !!! Sometimes it seems to freeze up for a bit. Especially when looking at pictures.  Then it will all of a sudden "kick-in" and process all of your "touches" which leaves you sometimes far from where you wanted to be.  Maybe some of these are minor squabbles.  But some just leave me scratching my head.  If you can deal with what to me are annoyances...You've got yourself a new player. If Creative did some software revamping and took care of the freeze ups, the Vision:M would get 5 stars out of me.

<Title>You can keep your iPod
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my Zen Vision: M today and have been fiddling with it all day. As my first MP3 player I decided to halt on getting the iPod (like everyone else in the world it seems) and decided to do some research instead on more encompassing players. I wanted one with quality, versatility, a good design and competitive features & price. . . not hype for my money. It paid off. I was incredibly impressed by customer reviews on product comparisons for the Zen Vision (which were better than those given for the iPod) and decided to order it. This player has everything I would ever need. The sound and picture/video quality is outstanding. There is a clip on the Creative site which is exactly the picture/sound quality you get when you turn it on and play it. Brightness can also be adjusted more than how it originally arrives to you which impressed me because it was already great when I initially turned it on. Custom and preset equalizer settings are also a plus. You do forget that you are looking at a mini screen and I can't wait to start downloading movies, clips to take around with me. The Zen also has a strong bass that is a must hear.   I ordered the pink one and it was actually smaller than what I was expecting to receive, which is even better for me. I bought the silicon jacket, which although nice is a bit slippery when you first use it, I almost dropped mine as soon as I put it on while I was talking to someone and had it in my hands. I also purchased the arm/wrist band for exercising or walking about.  The only drawback I can give the Zen Vision is maneuvering through the menus with the touchpad. The touchpad is incredibly sensitive which can be both good and bad. It's a bit slick and quick but that too can be adjusted somewhat. It does take some time to get use to it. Menus aren't intuitive as probably the iPod but if you are a tech savvy person it isn't much of a hinderance but a bit of patience is needed. I am thrilled that the software that comes with it is easy to use and that the player itself is compatible with Napster to Go, I literally drag and drop my songs and go. Transfering other media onto the player is also a breeze.   Overall, I am happy with my player and I am glad that I wasn't hit with the iPod bug and from the looks of it will never get near one thanks to Creative. If you are someone that feels that the iPod cannot be beat I would suggest taking a look at this player. If iPod is the standard for you this would in all likelihood be a strong close competitor but truly a first place all in one player for me.

<Content>I bought this mp3 player after several researches.  I bought it on May 20, 2006 and immediately fell in love with it. It has everythings  that Ipod has and more. One of the nicest thing about this player is FM radio, it has auto scan and sound is great.  It has higher screen resolution than Ipod and the video is also outstanding.  I had downloaded several videos and movies and they have dvd quality outputs.  I would recommend this player to anyone who is looking to buy one. The one downside on purchasing this player is accessory, not too many choice available.

<Content>Have only owning creative labs mp3 players my whole life, I can tell you that this is a great company that values you. Creative labs has been great to me, and i couldn't turn my back on them. This lead me to buy a Zen VisionM over an apple video. The sound quailty is the best on the market, and with more clours to choose from, you can be differnt. The video is crystal clear, and is very bright(can be adjusted). The Vision has better sound quailty, more colours in its display, and differnt color options. Apple only has tons of third party support, but how many accesories can one have? Get the vision.

<Title>Easy to Use
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have really enjoyed my Creative vision so far.  I have only had for little less then a week, but already I think it is great.  The main reason that I chose the Creative Zen Vision instead of the iPod was because I can use any music service and I am not tied to the iTunes.  The rip software that is provided with the Zen is so easy to use (and I am not a tech person at all); I ripped all my cd's (600+ songs) in a matter of a few hours and the synch process was very easy.  I had no desire to throw it out the window and I have had this urge with every other mp3 player I have owned.  The other great feature is that it has an fm tuner; which is helpful if you want to listen to the radio at the gym or somewhere.  The screen resolution and sound quality are great as well.  If found the touch pad very easy to use, although I have no experience with the iPod for comparison.

<Title>Finally, the perfect mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I started with a Creative Jukebox many years ago.  I have tried many brands, including iPod.  This is the best yet.  I tried a new 60gb Video iPod.  Returned it, as I was very disappointed.  The hardware was ok, but the software for video stank, and the support and help files for video stank.  iPod is geared for iTunes...in other words, buy their stuff only.  There are the "podcasts", which want to make you think they are unique to iPods...and they are not.  They are RSS feeds, available all over the net.  NPR has great stuff with RSS feeds.  Pros of the Creative Vision M:  Excellent sound Great battery life Great screen...I can see it without my glasses! Excellent design Excellent user interface Good accessory availability from Creative store or eBay Good size and feel Nice "docking" feature...maybe amps or docking stations available soon? Has wide connector like iPod, but uses adapter that plugs into Vision, then you plug in supplied ac adaptor, common miniusb connector, or a plug that enables you to output stereo sound and video (unlike iPod, which does not have that feature). Better video than iPod. RSS feeds can be used (zencasts or podcasts). Firmware upgrade gives you audiobook support from Audible.com. A long list of pros.  Cons: Built in battery....not user replacable. Short warranty...1 year parts, only 90 days labor.  You can go to zencast.com and get software to put RSS feeds into your Zen.  I love this device.  People are brainwashed into thinking that the iPod is the original hard drive mp3 player and the best.  It is neither.  Recommended highly.

<Content>I saw the Vision: M in a store and thought it rocked. I've looked at about 10 MP3s, and this has many more features than most other ones. I didn't buy it right away because the salesperson wasn't helpful. I'm not very technically savvy yet (this would be my first MP3) and can't find the answers to my questions anywhere. I want to know if I can download from iTunes to the Vision: M, and if I can "copy" songlists from my friend's iPod. Also, would I be able to download from NPR or  old Seinfeld episodes?

<Title>I'm free, finally free! Anybody want a used iPod?
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've run the gamut of MP3 players; Muvos, Cowon and finally iPods (Nano and Video). After struggling with iTunes and the crazy things it does to my music collection (like for instance I can't play 90% of my library on my laptop now because its not "authorized"!) I finally decided I was ready to take charge of my own MP3s!  Somebody in a very helpful review mentioned that this was the MP3 player to get if you want to have control over your collection and they were so right.  So here are the wonderful things I can do with the Vision M that I can't do with my iPod:  1) Musicmatch, I finally get to use my beloved musicmatch which I abandoned when I couldn't get it to work with my iPods. 2) Volume levelling... doesn't everybody else notice they have to reach for their iPod on every other song to adjust the blaring or whisper quiet volume?   3) Delete, edit, create playlists; how wonderful that I don't have to remember what I want to do to my playlist til I get home and hook my iPod up to iTunes... I can just make the adjustment on the spot now! I must have died and gone to heaven. 4) Listen to music while recharging 5) Watch my videos in bold crisp beautiful color, I didn't realize how clunky videos looked on the iPod til I saw them on the Vision M. 6) Wonderful bass boost, with the Vision the sound is so much fuller and deeper than the slightly shiny sounding iPod. 7) No more converting to iPod format, many videos will copy over with no conversion at all.  Nowhere near as difficult to get videos onto the Vision M. 8) No more iTunes purchases, now I can buy my music anywhere and still be able to use it on my Vision M. Especially Rhapsody which is my favorite way to buy tracks... after I've listened to them for a while and really decided I like them. 9) Shuffle within a playlist (as far as I can tell the shuffle on iPod will only work on its entire music collection!).  Now I'm not saying this baby is perfect, but its such an improvement from the iPod/iTunes world that I just had to give it 5 stars.  So to be fair, things that are not so hot about the Vision M:  1) Hard to buy accessories in stores. 2) Whats with this weird adaptor/dock thing that you have to plug in the bottom to charge it or connect USB?  It would be so much nicer to just plug the cables directly into the Vision M. 3) I am finding that this isn't easily used as a backup drive, the iPod was really nice in that regard.  I don't really understand why they make it so difficult... you have to format it and then it is hard to find the place to put your data, kind of silly! Maybe I will keep the iPod just for backups, I don't know. 4) Lacks the iPod Wow factor, but then my iPods have lived in their cases for 10 months so they aren't exactly making people drool since nobody can see them anyway!  I'm thinking Wow factor is fun but overrated...   In conclusion, I am a convert and will be using this for all my music needs once the case and skin comes in the mail ;)  This baby is geek heaven and us control freaks love it too!  Fashionistas may want to stick with the iPods...

<Content>I have over 200 CD on my computer that are in the WMA "Lossless" format.  After several emails and finally a long distance call to Creative I find out that they do not support this format and can not help.  They said that "maybe" if I gat a Codec from Microsoft that would help, but they could not tell me which one to get.  The only reason to buy this product is b/c it is MS compliant and in theory should work better with XP and other applications.  However, I have learned it is no more compliant then IPOD.  Since this player is not fully MS compliant like they stated I am taking it back and going with the smaller and more ergonomic IPOD.  Bottom line buy the IPOD it smaller and better!

<Title>My Creative Zen Vision: M is with me at all times.
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra 40GB for about 3 years and still use it for music programming at my office, but my Vision: M is with me most of the time.  I use it in the car, in the office, at the house, and it sits in my suit pocket when I am in Court, just in case I should get a few minutes to finish watching a movie.    The battery life is adequate for day to day use.  The Zen Vision: M comes with an AC charger that is much faster than USB charging.  In practice, you will not run out of battery life during a day of heavy use unless you are watching movies.    The sound quality is remarkable.  I have found myself re-ripping my music to higher bitrates as you can easily detect compression artifacts.  Although the enclosed headphones are OK as earbuds go, you really need some nice headphones, such as noise canceling or in the ear noise isolating earphones in order to get the full effect of the audio quality.  Like the iPod they need to start including some better earphones, even if it increases the cost.  You will need screen protection film or a case with a clear window to protect the screen from scratches.  The player is suprisingly tough as I have accidently dropped it onto concrete or onto wooden floors on numerous occasions without any damage.  I once dropped it down a staircase where it landed with a hard thud on the corner, and it didn't do anything to the player.

<Title>Surprise... High quality recordings!!!!
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got this little wonder, and immediately tested the voice recorder.  As a classical musician, this feature was high on my list for what I wanted in an MP3 player (for recording practice sessions as well as concerts).  Needless to say, I played a few minutes worth of live piano music, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality of the recording was comparable to that of my MD recorder, with which I use a high grade microphone.  Who would've guessed!  This test, however, was at close range... I'm not sure what the recording would be like in a concert hall.   I do not regret my decision to go with the Creative Zen over the Ipod... the Zen actually looks a lot better in person than I thought.  And while it is about a third inch thicker than the Ipod, it is still quite small, and why does that little bit matter anyway?  You're getting this thing to listen to music, not fuss over a few millimeters.  Oh, and the screen is awesome, as the others have said.  Overall sound quality is wonderful.  Controls are easy to use.  There is one soft key for which you can assign the function ... this I really like!  You actually get to decide what is more important to you as the individual!  The only thing I would quibble with is the inability to edit tracks and playlists on the device itself.  But maybe after I spend a bit more time with it, I could figure that out, too.  So far, this has been a really good buy....

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I stopped in my local Best Buy store and inquired a bunch about EVERY different hard drive based MP3 player that they had.  The good reason to get an iPod was for very smooth synching with computer to iPod.  Phillips because it was a little cheaper than the ipod with the same features, except can't play video.  But they did point out the Creative Zen Vision: M because it had the same features as the iPod: video, pictures, etc.  But it also has a built in FM tuner for the same price as the iPod.  Plus when i tried it out, the software is very easy to use and quite fast.  Definately look into this!

<Title>The Winning MP3player - Hands down!
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Regardless of the color you pick, the ZVM is the winning MP3 player hands down.  CNet has already confirmed this with the 2006 best player award. The one aspect that really makes the ZVM stand out from the rest is the video quality and size ratio. By size ratio, I mean the usuable screen area is almost as wide as the player itself making for an incredible image size. I haven't seen any iPod come quite this close yet.  Also what stands out with the ZVM is it's array of features including FM.  Many snicker at the FM, however the option is there whenever the mood hits.  Try listening to FM with an iPod. I would therefore compare this unit with other players in the industry more marketable like Toshiba's Gigabeat and the rest, but clearly not any Apple products.  It IS like comparing Apples and Peaches and all Apples compared have ended up a tad bit sour when matched to the ZVM.  The font choice and clarity of the ZVM will astound you only adding to the incredible video aspect.  It is a pleasure to see as well as operate.  Now about the most important issue...audio.  Compared to most players, it is about the same I must admit however syncs flawlessly with the incredible software provided.  I was a bit disappointed however with the performance of many Musicmatch downloads since there is a hit and miss issue with MM downloads as I have pointed out extensively on the Web in other areas.  This is not believed to be a ZVM issue therefore I will not discredit it for now. The fact it is MS compliant makes it all the more marketable with Windows and other Windows and non iTunes applications (which is about 90% of them).  The only cons I have with this player is the high gloss black panel (on black models only) which scratches easily.  Although this is the most talked about con, it still is better than any iPod black panel. A little protection will however solve the problem. Another negative aspect is the built-in battery.  What is wrong with every manufacturer out there? Don't they realize the user craves for replaceability?  Apple loves to ignore the masses themselves, so give Creative some credit..at least their Micro model and the Vision model deviate from this. The last con is the sync adapter.  It's intuitive, however not practical. It is not case-friendly (except for the Creative cases), its also bad for those with poor memories and lose things.  If you lose the adapter, and don't have the dock, you're stuck! Any adaptor required to replace jacks and ports which should be standard just makes no sense to me.  It's like sticking an adapter in a wall so you can install an outlet. Creative was perhaps a way bit too creative designing this, but definately not practible.  So if this may bother you, it's definately something to think about. Despite these cons, the pros outweigh this product so much that I have no choice but to give it five stars.

<Title>what a downer
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this thinking it would be a much better alternative to the ipod, because i hate itunes...boy was i wrong.  After the first week i recieve the vision:M it froze up and i couldnt turn it on at all, the same problem many have had.  Well, I returned it to amazon for an exchange, and i got the new one.  It worked at first, but the the problems started again.  It freezes quite frequently, and skips, even though an mp3 player isn't supposed to skip.  Well, i've had enough of this bull, im returning my second vision:M and getting a video ipod.  The people that gave this 5 stars seriously dont know a thing about this product...yes it appears much better than an ipod at first, but it give you hell in the end.  Take it from me, just save yourself the trouble and buy something else.

<Title>Creative Zen
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've have my Creative Zen for two weeks now and I love it. I bought it as a present for myself. The one thing I liked over all about it from the beginning was the fact that I didn't have to pay extra to put music on my Mp3 player, like you have to do with an iPod. This is pretty much plug and play and excepts all music files.  So far, I have a little over 1000 songs on there. With features that alowe all music shuffle, or you can select songs by playlists, genera, artist, or album (much like any standard player).   You can store Photos on it, but I have only put one photo on to test it. It lets you take a photo and set it as your wallpaper, but you need to pick a dark photo since you can't change the text color from White. It does show the photos nice and you can zoom in, since 2.5 inch screen is small already.  Video is okay, but I wouldn't really use it unless I had nothing else to use. 2.5 inch makes everything hard to see but it's big enough to atleast enjoy it if you do use it. I had some trouble trying to get it to play a couple of files, but just re-uploading them fixed it.  The FM tuner is cool and I would use that. If you want to listen to a sports game or something like that, it's very handy. Presets up to 30 stations and you can delete others and set new ones. But, if you have your music, can't say how much you will use it then. It's a nice feature, but might never get used.  The battery life is decent. I wish is was longer, but if you just hit play and lock it, it makes the batter last longer. It takes 2 hours to charge, and if you use the ac adaptor, you can chaged it a play it at the same time.  Unlocked Play= 5-7 hours Locked Play= 10+ Hours Video= max of 3 hours if your lucky. Photos= Can't see anyone spending 9 hours looking at photos but it's good for that too.  I didn't use the head phones it came with. They didn't fit my ears and I like my sound blocking one better. If you like the in the ear kind, it comes with them.   It comes with all the cords and software you'll need, except for the video cords, but it has an ac cord for charging in the wall. The nice carrying case doubles as a screen cleaner, but I left the screen protecter it came with on. I don't wanna damage the screen so be carefull. It will scratch easly.  Over all, the price of 30$ then the iPod auctally pays off in the end. You have good battery life and decent video playing ability. The FM tuner is good and so is viewing photos. It comes with the power cords and a nice carrying case.  Note* I rather enjoy mine and I've never liked the iPod to begin with. Do some of your own research and read many reviews before you spend $300+ on something like this.

<Content>The small difference in price is nothing compared to what you get for it.  In addition to including a charger, adapter and cord, the music management software included here is wonderful.  Moving media from computer to handheld is a real breeze.  And the record feature is also extremely useful.  Only quibble:  the record level and quality are fixed.  In a loud environment, the recordings are quickly overwhelmed and overloaded to the point of distortion.  Great value!

<Title>A teenager's review
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>wow, looking at the Creative Zen Vision: M makes me so anxious for it's arival via UPS.  I used to own a Creative Zen Touch and it worked great.  It was a very reliable MP3 player; It never skipped, nice sound, and has a very simple design that works great.  The reason why I'm getting the Vision M is because It's a HUGE upgrade from the Touch.    1.) Color!!! I love color screens, and that's one of the Touch's big downfalls.  2.) Video!!!!! can anyone say "sweeeeeeeeet"? I know video is the new thing in MP3 players, but where can a kid easily get 300 dolars to see it in the works?   3.) Voice Recorder!! this is a nifty feature that I don't see in the Ipod unless you buy yet another accesory for it. On the CVM (Creative Vision M), it's built in and I've heard the playback sounds great!!  4.) FM radio!!!! this is also a nifty feature that I don't see in the Ipod unless you bue yet another accesory for it. On the CVM, there's a built in radio. :D  5.) #3+#4= Record live radio!!!!!! whoa, that's pretty sweet. If you here something you really want on the radio like a song or a segment of news, just choose the record feature and It's yours forever. Great feature!!!  6.) Great Software!!! Since I owned a Creative Zen Touch, I have some of Creative's software. It works sooooo much better than Itunes ever will. No importing your songs every week, comes with a converter, and It doesn't screw up your song list.  The software is very easy to comprehend. kudos to Creative Labs for trying to reach out to the user.   All in all, there are so many reasons why buying a Creative Vision: M is a good idea, but ultimately it's up to you. Almost half the people in my school have Ipods of some sort and complain that is quickly go's out of style, breaks down, or is too much of a hassle to work with. I'm not trying to put Apple down, but people should know what the truth is. Ipods were the "OMG, got to get it" item, but I feel that Creative Labs are going to be the dominent company in the near future. Happy shopping!

<Title>Creative zen vision: m
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased this device, and I was very impressed. It has a number of this that make it better than an ipod, longer battery life, better colors for watching video, extra features such as fm tuner, or microphone. It was also very easy to load and unload music and videos. However just today after having this product for 2 weeks, it froze, and now refuses to work. Although I respect Creative's product and will most likely try to replace my vision:m I would hope that in the future problems like mine would not occur. I hope that my problem is simply an anomally and not something that is likely to any one else's Creative Zen Vision: M.

<Title>I like it better than that pod thingy
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one of those pod thingies.  It's very nice.  But it is very difficult to operate where I use these things most... while driving.  You must also utilize Itunes to manage your music.  I have thousands of music and audiobooks.  It is no fun to go through all of these and select one at a time to decide which go to the device and which do not.  That said, the pod does let me play by composer.  I do enjoy all kinds of music but I am a real classical junkie.  So this is a pretty nice option.  So on to the Creative unit.  The first thing that I checked for was the availability of batteries for the device.  My Ipod must have the battery replaced by the factory.  I will never purchase one again for this single reason.  The Creative folks have one.  It is pricey but I don't plan on replacing the batteries all that often.  Files can be transferred in various ways.  You can use a couple of applications that come with the unit or just drag files over through your Windows Explorer.  I really like this feature.  While I won't be using the device for video, I do like to carry pictures around of my family and the telescopes that I make.  It's a snap to put any files that you want on the device. And the color display is very bright and easy to see.  I didn't expect that I'd be using the device for this.  I just wanted lots of space for mp3 files.  But it turned out to be something that I will indeed use.  Contacts?  Wha?  This is cool! This is another unexpected delight.  I could never copy my contacts to my pod.  This was simple folks.  And all my contact information complete with phone numbers and addresses are right at hand.  I can fit about 4800 "songs" on the unit.  I rip at 192kb/sec so my files are a bit larger than normal.  And classical music often plays longer than your normal 3 to 4 minute pop song.  This is fine for me.  I would have purchased a 40Gb unit had Circuit City one for sale.  There are two things you should be aware of before you lay down your cash:  1)If you are a classical junkie, you'll not be able to sort your files by composer.  This is really painful.  What I had to do was create playlists for my favorite composers. A utility that comes with the utility allows you to resort your files into folders according to a couple of choices you make. This is a nice feature.  I reorganized my folders according to genre. I really would like to sort files on the fly by composer.  Creative... are you listening?  2) I purchased the unit at Circuit City.  I drove 90 miles round trip to get there and back.  When I returned home, I could not navigate the menus on the device.  I took the unit back the next day and showed the geekie squawed that it did not work. They agreed and sent me home with a new unit.  After I got home, I discovered the new unit would not navigate the menues either.  I'm a techie and I've never been so embarrassed...but I'll lay the blame squarely on the documentation.  The manual says that you need to tap the pad to select menu items.  To me tap, means tap.  I tap my mousepad on my computer and it works.  On the Creative, you have to put significant force and almost hit it.. okay a very sharp tap.  Once I figured it out, I got into the system and found an option to be more sensitive. It is definitely not as sensitive as the pod; it requires more force, which I definitely like. Now I have something that I like.  I purchased the little button extension and can use it in the car at night.  One other minor nit is that there are a left and right button available.  Forward and reverse?  Next and previous?  They sometimes work on things but not where you would expect. So just experiment and take notes.  I just took my Zen on a road trip. It ran great.  I played music all week (charging from a 12vdc adaptor) and it was great.  Get this one.  It's worth it.  Michelle

The Zen Vision is incredible, the screen is so bright, navigation is easy, but could be better, and it plays ALL video not just MP4 (conversion sucks, asks anyone who has to render video)...it has a contact list, calendar, battery life is ground, the sound is wonderful...my only criticism is that you need to throw the Creative headphones in the garbage and get some Shure's, Grado, or Koss PortaPros (at $50, the best headphones for the price in teh world)...  in short - easy to use, easy to navigate, great features, great price, looks good, amazing screen...

<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This creative is awesome, i completely destroys the Ipod, i know from past uses of an ipod. However ,although this item is good i have two downsides to this product. 1. The size of the mp3 is a little outrageous. 2. The reset button on the bottom is a pain, you have to you use a little pin to get it. Otherwise this is an awesome player, all my friends go crazy over it it when they see it. It is a definite buy if your looking for something better than an ipod. Also the music quality is awesome, i havent heard a single crack in th music, but for better quality you should get new earphones the ones the give are not that great sony has very good ones. but anyway also the video quality blows the Ipod video out of the water, it actually feels like you are in the movie theater (kind of). It is a must of your thinkning about buying an Mp3 with video and music capabilities.

<Content>I would recommend the creative player over the IPod.  I found it very user friendly.  It works very well with windows media player, and even allows you to connect to other computers without clearing your media (like the Ipod).  However there are some draw backs, it is very hard to find accessories in your local stores, because of the popularity of Apple.  Also, my player tends to freeze every once in a while.  I must run the battery down, and then it works fine after being recharged.

<Title>A poke in the eye for Apple
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Intro  In today's society the MP3 player has become embedded into our daily lives and there is no shortage in choices of MP3 players.  But why is it that so many companies produce great MP3 players while only one holds a majority of the market share?  Apple has dominated sales since its introduction of its iPod.  Apple is by no means the creator of the MP3 player, as many people are prone to think.  The reason why Apple has grabbed such a huge market share is that it created a trend with their stylish and sleek iPod and its no-brainer graphical user interface (which Apple "borrowed" from Creative, hence the subsequent lawsuit.)  Many companies have tried to create an MP3 player to give Apple a good poke in the eye and one company that might just be able to, is Creative.  With their launch of the Zen Vision: M, iPod fans were suddenly wooed away from their comfort zone because of all the extra features that the video iPod didn't have such as a FM tuner, a screen that displays 264,000 colors vs. the iPod's 65,000 colors, and the myriad file formats that it can play natively.  These features are well enough but are they enough to dethrone the iPod?  Let's look and see.  Design  There is no doubt that the iPod and the Zen Vision: M look spectacularly similar.  They share the exact same dimensions except for the thickness.  The Vision: M is the same thickness of the fourth generation iPod but looks obese next to the video iPod.  There is no doubt that the extra thickness is due to the Vision: M's larger battery and multitude of features.  The iPod is rated for 12 hrs of audio playback while the Vision: M is rated for 14 hrs of battery life and while the iPod is rated for a maximum of 2 hrs of video, the Vision: M is rated for an astonishing 4 hrs of video life.  So the extra cub of the Vision: M is justified.  After lugging the Vision: M around for a week, I did not find it to be uncomfortable to hold in the hand or heavy at all.  It slips comfortably into any pocket.    Creative chose to make the Vision: M in five different colors which include black, white, green, pink, and baby blue.  I opted for the black because it looked the sleekest and classiest.  There have been reports of the black version scratching easily so exercise caution.  The front of the player includes all of the controls, minus the power/hold button, which is located on the top.  The buttons include a play/pause, options, back, shortcut (which is a godsend because it can be customized to do whatever you want) and the FF and RW buttons are located at the edges of the touch pad.  Creative stuck with what it knows best and continues to use its vertical touch strip.  I actually prefer this over the iPod's click wheel but I have to admit it takes some getting used to.  The reason I prefer the touch strip is that you don't have to move your thumb to the center to press the "OK" button.  You can just tap where ever you are on the touch strip and it will respond.  It just a matter of personal preference.  There is a reset button on the bottom of the player but its ridiculously hard to reach and can only be pressed by a thin pointy object, preferably a bent paperclip.  I don't know what Creative was thinking when they put the reset button there because most people don't usually walk around with a pocket of paper clips.    One small issue that I do have with the design of the player is the small extension that is required to sync/charge/display in A/V out.  Though convenient in its own way, it is just another device to lose and to carry around.  Apple has handled this problem better by creating a wall charger that can be used with the sync cable, which means carrying around one less cable.  What irks me about Apple is that they do not include the wall charger with their players.  Creative took the initiative to include a wall charger in their package, which is always welcome.    Features  So the iPod wins in design but where the Vision: M wins is in the screen.  The difference in the amounts of colors that each player displays is breath-taking.  I played around with my cousin's iPod video and though that the screen was good but when I turned on my Vision: M, I was blown away.  The pictures and video positively pop out of the screen, though some pictures are over saturated.  It makes ordinary photos look brilliant and professional on its screen.  Both the iPod and Vision: M display in 320x240 but the Vision displays 640x480 on the television which translates to a crystal clear picture.  Files larger than 320x240 played on the Vision yields some aliasing but it is negligible.  This is applicable for photos too but the aliasing goes away when zoomed in.  One feature I thoroughly enjoyed was the ability to pick any picture and set it as a wallpaper.  The Vision even lets you change the brightness of the picture and add effects such as black and white and sepia to the photo before applying it as a wallpaper.  Pretty nifty.  One thing that irks me to no end is the fact that Creative does not bundle an A/V cable with their player.  I suppose some users will never use the A/V function but they did not have to create a whole different cable just for the Vision: M.  For $18.99, you can pick up the aforementioned cable.  I'll pass because I found that the A/V cable for my father's camcorder works OK.  Sure it only plays audio in mono but hey, it works and it's free.    Other features that may tempt potential iPod buyers include a FM tuner (with a cool reception bar and 32 programmable presets and it can record radio,) voice recording, and compatibility with subscription services, both audio (ie: Napster to go, Starz Vongo.)    One reason why the iPod is such a popular seller is because of the seamless integration with iTunes.  Everything is simplified into one program and opens the user to a world of content.  The iTunes store is simple and beautiful and has been the one defining choice among some users to choose an iPod.  Other MP3 players can not enjoy such seamless integration with a music program.  Or can they...?  With the recent release of Windows Media Player 11, users are now able to purchase DRMed music from MTV's URGE service.  Still in beta, Windows Media Player 11 and URGE are still slowly being improved so the "seamless" integration is not quite there yet but I've had to pleasure to try it out and I have to say it's on the road to taking on iTunes.  Purchasing tracks on URGE is simple because it only asks you for your credit card number once and you can purchase million of songs with a click.  One feature I really enjoy about URGE is way they organize their content in easy to access playlists and charts.  Some pages still will not show up properly in URGE but since they're still in beta, that's forgivable.  One thing I find strange is Microsoft's investment into their own music service after investing millions into URGE.  We'll wait and see how that pans out.    The software that is included in the installation CD is not as pleasurable to use as WMP11.  WMP11 adds simplicity with a lot of manual functions that are easily accessible to the user but the included software is just...blah.  It works and that's about as much as it can do.  It's simplified by the drag and drop method but there's no eye candy and seems very archaic.  WMP11 is the program to use with the Vision: M and all other MP3 players, excluding the iPod of course.  DivX, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV, and XviD formats are all supported by the Vision: M which means less time converting files and more time playing them.  For the files that aren't supported, WMP11 or Creative's own software converts the files into .avi.    A gripe that many people will have about owning a MP3 player other than an iPod is the lack of podcast integration.  Creative takes a stab at the podcasting scene with its ZenCast website and it's ZenCast Organizer.  It works but it's not as intuitive or pleasurable to use as iTunes.  The website especially needs work with the organization of its content because no one wants to flip through 15+ pages of podcasts to find the one they want.  The ZenCast website is a good idea because it does not isolate other players from using the site and subscribing to RSS feeds.    With all the talk of video playback, it is easy to forget what the Zen Vision: M was designed to do: play music.  It is in the DAP (digital audio player, ie: video iPod) class and not the PMP (portable media player, ie: Archos AV500.)  Audio play back is everything someone could ask for.  97dB signal to noise ratio ensures flawless sound and album art is displayed well, though a little aliased because of the smaller resolution.  The included headphones are decent for their price ($9.99) but they lack the bass and clarity of higher end headphones such as the Shures or Etymotics.  I recommend ditching the stock ear phones and purchasing some noise isolation or noise canceling headphones.  You won't regret it, especially if you take public transportation.  The Vision: M supports MP3, WMA, WAV, Janus, and now Audible with the latest firmware upgrade.  One function that I enjoy on Creative players is the DJ mode in which you can select "Album of the Day" which just chooses one album at random, "Random Play All," "Most Popular," and "Least Popular."  It's a nice function to have.    Performance  The Vision is rated at 14 hrs for audio and 4 hrs video but reports from consumers have found that they can surpass these times, which is very impressive indeed.  An improvement over previous Creative players is the startup time which takes about 10 seconds from a cold start but just 2-3 seconds when it's been booted up at least once every 4 hours.  Every 4 hours, the player slips out of "standby" mode and into a fully off mode to spare battery life.  Charging via USB takes a whopping 5-6 hrs but with the included wall charger, that time is slashed to 2-3 hrs.  I have yet to test out the battery life by myself but from normal use, I suspect I can reach the claimed battery life.    The user interface is easy to use and figure out without reading the manual.  This is a good thing because the text in the included manual is sparse, to say the least.  Creative could do with a little more text and pictures in their manuals because there are a lot of shortcuts and features that are not highlighted in the included documents.  I was a little intimidated when I first opened the box because there were 3 installation CDs included with the player.  One was for Creative's own software, one was for Yahoo's software and services, and the last was for the Plays4Sure software.  If I had no prior knowledge to Yahoo's and Plays4Sure software, I would have probably been very confused.    The FM tuner was a great little feature with better reception than I expected, due to the poor reception that I got from my Zen Micro which is now dead from a catastrophic hard drive failure.  In FM tuner mode, there is a little reception bar in the upper left hand corner which I found pretty useful.    Conclusion  It is hard to recommend one MP3 player over the other because each has their strengths and their faults.  The iPod wins in design and popularity while the Zen Vision: M wins in features and many like buying the "underdog" of the MP3 players.  With the release of WMP11, URGE, Starz Vongo, Napster to go, Rhapsody to go, etc., it seems that the underdog has a chance of staging a coup and overthrowing the iPod regime.

<Title>wall charger?
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my Zen Vision M today and from my my brief experience it appears to be a very nice unit. It is way too early to give an accurate review, but I want to know what is the deal with all the reviewers saying that one of the benefits of the Vision:M over Ipod is that it comes with its own wall charger?  Well, I can tell you that it doesn't! This disappointment is why I am giving it a 3-star rating.  I e-mailed Amazon.com and they responded by saying "we are sorry you were misled.....blah, blah, blah".  I called Creative Labs and the woman on the phone told me that the Vision:M has never included a wall charger!  What gives???  What am I missing here?  Can anyone let me know?

<Title>Lets face facts 
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dont own this mp3 but I have an Ipod video 30G.   People are saying that this sucks because its only 30g and the ipod offers the 60g.   Thats a lie...with this ceative zen:M you can compress your songs and make them WMA and it can hold as if it was a 60g.   If you have a song that last for like 4 min and is in the MP3 format, you may want to burn it in a CD and then save it on the WMA format on "windows media player" (Thats the easy way and the FREE way to do it.) and tranfer it to the creative and my friend you will have a 60g creative IPOD KILLER.   There are some programs to compress your songs and even your videos. I might be buying  this one but in BLK looks better.

<Title>I was looking forward to this
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Vision:M and in six hours have decided to return it. But let me start at the beginning. I had a Zen Xtra (60 GB) player that worked very well, so I decided to update and get a newer player with color/video etc.   After much research I got the Vision:M  to find out that after THREE years Creative had not updated Media Source or any of the software that came with the device. I HATE Media Source, it is the crappiest music organizer I have ever seen.   To make matters much, much worse, it doesn't work with iTunes. That isn't so bad, I thought, but when I tried to put my purchased tracks on the Vision:M, Media Source wouldn't even read that the files existed on my computer, let alone copy them over.   So, let me ask, what am I supposed to do with the 90+ tracks I have bought off of iTunes over the past few years? Um... burn them onto CDs, then re-rip them, which is a long pain-staking process? Or switch to Urge? Yeah, right.  I'm returning this faster than you can blink. I am so furious that no one has posted about this before, and I am sorely disappointed in Creative. I suppose if you are a new online music person, this could work for you, but if you have an extensive library all setup in iTunes, look elsewhere. And I hate to even suggest it, but get the crappy iPod instead.

<Title>AMAZING!!!
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just loved this mp3 player, a lot of my friends have video ipods and they just kept on saying that the zen vision is way cooler. -The battery last longer than the ipod video, thats why its a bit chubbier but is not that much -The zen vision includes a RESET button at the bottom and in case your mp3 freezes u just press it and you dont lose any of your music,not like the ipod that u press menu + play but u lose all of the data. -The audio quality is way better -The radio function gives it a special twist -It already comes with the wall charger!!! -U dont need any iTunes special software to insert music, you can use windows media player to add music to your mp3 -The only problems I have noticed is that the earphones actually dont fit your ears, so theyre constantly falling off, and the fact that is necessary to have the port with you cause u cant plug the mp3 directly to pc or electric connection, you have to plug it to the adapter first and then to mp3, but those arent really big reasons for not buying this product

<Title>Not a bad Ipod alternative
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My experience with this unit was bad from the very start. I tried to find it locally and the only color that was in stock was black. This is at two local stores. This may sound silly, but I have several minor issues with the black version. The front is black and the back is..white. Why? Not a big deal, but please, why can't they have the things all one color? Another negative about the black verison is that after a half hour of using it you get all these fingerprints all over it. Yes, they are easy to see too.  So I get my player home and open it up and am disgusted. The screen has these weird splotches all over it. Four on the sides of the unit's LCD screen and one very large circle shaped one in the middle! At first I thought it just had a small hard to see plastic cover on it that needed to be removed, but that wasn't the case.   I didn't even turn it on and took it back for a replacement. Guess what? Another defect! A tiny one on the top right. This time it looks like an air bubble caught in the built in screen protector. I let it pass and use it anyway.  Please note that i've only used this unit for one day and one day only. I read the manual and know how to use it perfectly, except for a few things.  I connected it and had no problems using the software. To me it seemed even easier to upload songs that it is with the Ipod. I took a DVD I own and made an mpg out of it and uploaded it to the unit. I was pretty amazed with the picture quality. The screen is very, very good. Way better than the ipods for sure. The movie I had was 2 hours and fast forwarding it is a painful process. It's sooooo slow. You can speed it up eventually a little bit but this just ruins it for me.  Mp3s sound just find and maybe even better than on the Ipod. The Ipods default screen when playing music is just plain dull and boring. At least they make everything look much nicer in this player. Probably would eat up more battery life though with all those extra graphics though.  Does this have a way to shuffle by genre of music? I didn't notice that. That's the one thing I didn't see if you could do or not.   Overall, I just feel the IPOD video is better when it comes to ease of use. I absolutely HATED the previous/next buttons on the Zen Vision: M. Then all the buttons are somewhat hard to press with one hand, especially when using this thing while driving and you can't pay much attention to it.  I took the black ones back and ordered the white version from Amazon instead. I'm not sure if I will keep it or not.   I might stick with my Ipod video. It works just fine, but I almost prefer the layout of my old 3rd gen Ipod over this one! I'm not a big fan of the click wheel I guess. The wheel also seems more sensitive than the old versions, making it much harder to select items from menus.  One reason I wanted to get the Zen Vision: M is that the music download services for that are much cheaper. Itunes can get expensive. I'd much rather buy a CD in a store for $2-$5 more than download it off Itunes. Unfortunately though some of my favorite music from Japan is only available on Itunes. The TV shows and music videos are also nice to have, but i'm sure that stuff is available on non-Itunes download services. At least I hope so.

<Title>Better Than The iPod
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't buy into the iPod hype.  This player is the real deal.  This player will amaze you.  The display is excellent, the colors are very well defined especially for having a 2.5" screen.  The interface is pretty easy to learn - just remember two tricks, holding the back button takes you to the main menu and you can hold down the shortcut button to assign it to the menu of your choice (I chose the Artist list).  Scrolling through music may take some getting used to with the touch pad but lengthy menus also give you the option of scrolling by letter which is great if you know exactly what you want to choose.  It supports a wide variety of video formats and if you use Creative's software to transfer them onto the player it will prompt you of all of the files that need to be converted and will let you convert them all at once (not many will need to be converted).  The conversion process takes a few minutes but is pretty efficient compared to other video conversions like Nero burning a video cd.  Perhaps the best thing about this player is not being an iPod it allows you your choice of music stores including Wal-Mart (88 cents each), Buy.com (some 79 cents), Napster, MusicMatch, allofmp3.com, the list goes on - you aren't stuck with iTunes.

<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It worked OK for a couple weeks and then it stopped being recognized by the computer which means you cannot load anymore songs.  After trying everything on the Creative FAQ about the problem on three different computers here at home, I gave up and returned this item.  From reading other blogs and reviews, this seems to be a recurring problem.  This unit also does not work with Napster.

<Title>forget the ipod.
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this product about a month ago, has been working flawlessly since.  No errors or malfunctions, beyond occasional freezes on certain videos (which would be expected with the wide range of video codecs out there -- fault of the file not the device).  The headphones that come with it work great, nice volume... And the video is probably my most favorite area of the player.  Being virtually unrestricted in what types of videos you put on the player (as opposed to the iPod) makes video transfers a lot easier, and the screen has bright, amazing colors.  Hooking it up to a TV is a sinch, and the player supports video resolutions higher than the screen itself so that when the signal is output NTSC to a tv (640x480) It looks crystal clear.  It's like having a mini portable dvd player with me.  Very good purchase, and for the price, i would highly suggest it.

<Title>Impressive!
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I felt guilty buying the Zen Vision M.  But now I'm nearly inseparatable with my new toy.  ZVM packs an impressive numbers of functions into a tight package. The sound is fantastic.  Out of all the players I tried at a local BestBuy and the ones my friends own, only iAudio has a slight edge over ZVM.  It also comes with audio bookmarking which I use a lot with audio books.  Many ways to play your music including an option to let your ZVM pick out "rarely played" music.  It's compatible with many music subscription services.   The 2.5" screen is gorgeous.  Photos look vibrant. I've loaded several feature length movies on it.  Dark scenes don't look so good on a small screen.  Otherwise, it does an amazing job with video playback.  Let alone  native support of many video formats.    FM reception is strong.  No problem filling 32 preset channels.  The voice and FM recording provides really decent quality as well.    The Creative software is fine.  I have had more problems with Window Media Player 10.  The software organizes and convert files with ease.    ZVM is 60% thicker than iPod.  It doesn't bother me at all since all the high capacity players won't sit securely in my pockets anyway.  I carry my ZVM around in a PdaDen leather case with shoulder strap.  That works just great for me.    I do wish one day Creative will do away the rediculous dongle and add an USB host for direct digital camera transfer.  The freezing problem mentioned by a lot of people...mine froze 3 times in a period of a month.  All the HD players freeze every now and then.  It hasn't bothered me as long as it doesn't happen more often.   If you decide to get one, I strongly recommend applying BestSkinEver or Invsible Shield to protect the scratch prone surface right out of the box and upgrading firmware as soon as possible.  You will be very happy with it.

<Title>Crushes the ipod but lacks accessories.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So ive owned the creative vision for about 4 months now. It really is a great mp3 player. It has the features that really command the market. But it sure could use more of an accessory line. Especially to compete with the ipod. They are beginning to release some but few and far between. Still waiting for a decent car charger. Also ive found a few bugs. New firmware disables fm radio recorder. Also now having some problems with the screen like flashing. Im having to send it in, hopefully its fixed quickly but after 90 days be prepared to pay for shipping and a $25 fix it fee. But as long as it wasn't you who broke it they,ll cover everything else for a year. Err.. Also the player will freeze very once in a while but easily fixed with reset button. Also keep in mind that that the vision m does not have a replacable battery. So this means it will eventually die and time for a new mp3 player. However the way technology works, by the time the battery is dead it will be out-dated anyway though. Good news though. Amazon Unbox. I love it. It works perfect with the player and it has a good selection of shows and movies. No music videos though. It has great battery life. I pretty much listen to my mp3 player all the time. In the car, at work, and at home. Usually I charge it each night but I have only ran out of battery once on it. AND I usually use it 7-10 hours a day. The screen is my only big concern but the warranty seems alright. Will update after repair. All i have to say is it is a great piece of technology that definately whoops the ipod. But be gentle with it. You will need some kind of screen protector and case immediatly. Don't get one without it. You'll be sorry when theres a scratch right down the middle of you screen. Still after everything this is still the best on the market. Its worth the money which was far more for me when it first came out.  Pros: Way more features for the same or less price of ipod. Works with subscription services. Good Battery life. Great LCD: Extremely clear. Recorder for voice and radio. Even does album art. Amazon Unbox  Cons: Extremely easy to scratch. Little bigger and heavier than ipod. Needs a program to purchase videos.  A few bugs in firmware. Fragile. Be nice to it and it will be nice to you. Lack of accessories. ( You can find some stuff on ebay though. Cheaper that way too.)

I have had the Zen "lock up" on me a few times, but it easily resets.  I also have a problem that the album cover art gets incorrectly displayed on some of the albums.  Not sure how to fix this.

<Title>No AC Adapter..poor video support.
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>  The version sent does not have the previously included AC adapter.  Some Call this the Zen Vision Lite version.   The support for various video files is less robust than many report.  If the video is above 2500 mbps total or beyond 320 by 240 (!!) then the software demands transcoding.  It is the slowest transcoder in existance...be prepared to wait hours and hours and hours for a movie.  It will therefore likely cost $$ to bring this up to speed.  First, a case to protect from scratches and a kickstand so you can see video on the screen.  Secondly, a wall adapter. About $60 more.  The internal battery is not removable.  500 charge cycles are the maximum for Li-Ion of this type.  The player is likely to be worthless in just over a year (since the charge capacity decreases over time).  That is a pretty expensive toy.  I am not impressed.

<Title>Two Key Features Make a Huge Difference
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I thought for a long time before deciding to buy this product over the iPod. The iPod, well, it's the standard to a lot of people. It looks great and I really like the interface. iTunes is a great setup and makes it very easy to find podcasts.  But iPod lacks two very important things that the Creative model has: Subscription compatibility and an FM tuner.  There are lots of great music subscription services out there. I currently subscribe to Napster and I also think Yahoo has a good set up. With the Zen Vision, I can sync up all the songs I have downloaded from either of these services as long as I am a subscriber. iPod is limited to songs you have either purchased individually, ripped from your own CD's or "otherwise acquired."  The FM tuner is important to me for one main reason: I plan to take this to the gym. Sometimes, something is on the gym TV that I would rather watch than a video I have sync'ed up with. The gym TV's have sound off, but you can tune in to the designated FM channels and get the sound. Before I bought this, I used the mediocre Sony Walkman Bean player because, at the time, it was one of the only ones at Best Buy that had an FM tuner included.  The Zen also has other features which, to be fair, I don't know if the iPod has or not. I'd be willing to bet iPod does, since I know it is also a solid product. I can reserve a part of it to transport data files. This means I don't have to buy another USB drive (which I have lost in the past), since I will be carrying my Zen player anyway. It can also sync to Outlook, so I can keep my meeting schedule with me no matter where I am and show up to work on time :)  I shouldn't forget to mention that the sound and video quality are also really good.  One of my main worries was the fact that there are fewer accessories available for the Zen. Well, this is not entirely true. I was able to find a good number of protectors for it, and it is compatible with a lot of the iPod speaker/docking stations out there. It still doesn't have the variety of what's available for iPod, but it's not lacking either.  Some downsides: I like the iPod controls better. Sometimes, the center glide pad doesn't seem to do what I want as reliably as the iPods I have tried. Also, it did not come with a wall plug (availabe as a seperate purchase).  But in the end, I had the choice between the two and the Zen Media Player won.

<Title>IPOD Who?
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player primarily for use with the Rhapsody online musc service which allows you to "rent" the music and transfer it to your mp3 player so long as you have a valid subscription.  I'm very happy with this device, though there are several things that you should consider before making a  purchase.  PROS -Works nicely with Rhapsody -Nice battery life - I haven't had to worry about running out of power  CONS -FM Tuner requires presetting - cannot manually tune a channel -I found audio book programs (such as from Nightingal Conant) had annoying pauses between tracks -As others have pointed out, this device requires a separate converter to connect to the charger or USB port -- a MAJOR WEAKNESS and perhaps the only thing that would make me decide not to re-purchase.  Overall I like the long battery life and the player also supports video which I've used several times and love (it's especially great on long airline flights).

<Title>Creative Zen M Vision Overal Nice MP3/Video Player
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey!  I finally caved in and searched for a nice mp3 player.  I really like the idea of placing most of your collection on one device and take it anywhere with complete access to it.  I originally just wanted it for music but then Ipod and Creative Zen came out with their video playback capability. I enjoy movie trailers, short clips, and pic online so the video capabiltiy is appealing for myslef.  So I had to debate to buy one or the other. If you just want music then video is not required.  I got the creative zen for the following reasons and compared it to the 30g Ipod video and mp3 player:      1.  Display screen seemed brighter to me.  I really like      color and this applealed to me. Also a little larger.  The Ipod picture was darker and faded looking.  2.  Supposedly could playback multiple video files like mp3, wma, dvix(sp?), xvid(sp?) ect.  3.  I liked the layout menu for songs and video. And I liked how in the background I could select one of my pics for the background even adjust the coloring on it just like how you do on your computer monitor for wallpaper.  I don't know if Ipod allows this, I tried to and don't remember being able to do it.   4.  I liked how I could save space by instead of using mp3 files use wma files when ripping discs. Less quality but I didn't notice a difference.  It says can take 15,000 wma songs based on I think about 2min songs or 7500 as mp3s.  That's not including video content though I believe.  I currently have about 4,000 tracks and about 30-40 short video clips on it and maybe just about 200 cds ripped into it with 14gb left in the player.  I still have another 100 cds to rip into it.  5.  Has FM radio that I can record songs to play back and even put it on my computer.  6.  Has a microphone.  I can record clips off my tv of music I like from soundtracks I can't get or sounds on tv I want to play back to listen to again and again. Sound from microphone probably b/c it is small and compact is not spectacular but pretty good for a small little gadget.  I can also record my self talking or playing my flute to play back or add onto the computer since the microphone is portable and I can position myself for the best acoustics necesary.  LOVE this for my flute playing.    DOWNSIDES to creative zen compared to Ipod: 1.  IPOD HAS EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!  From accesories to the gosh darn movie trailers I'm striving for. Very annoying.  I'm annoyed at apple b/c it looks as if along with PSP has gone to certain movie websites to promote the product by providing mv4 format trailer clips FREE.  It is not compatable with this player.  Also many movie trailers I find are in apple or seems apple at least its viewable on apple itunes is the file .mov which is not compatable.  So while the player can play multiple formats, it's not the most used formats.  Which is annoying.  Also even the formats it supposedly can sometimes its a larger file or seems higher resolution (I'm not computer person but had to be converted to view it) and sometimes not work.  HOWEVER:  There are various programs and some FREE ones that can help you convert the .mov and sometimes the dreaded ipod .mv4/mp4 file or any file for that matter to windows media player file wma which is compatable for the player.  Sometimes the quality isn't perfect.  I'll repeat the download and comes out ok usually.  Sometimes doesn't work right away (as you are using the programs to convert it) but try again and does.  It's just who wants to continue that all the time just to view it.  However I have dealt with it for the other features.  You can find many generic mp3 player accesories however finding cases are a problem.  I went to Kmart, walmart, target and all had mostly Ipod cases.  Target ONLY had Ipod cases.  THIS is the reason I didn't want Ipod it just bugs me.  But then I suffer not getting cool accesories.  However all the reasons I mentioned above for liking the creative zen outweighs how "cool it looks."  I was able to find a nice leather case for this specific player on amazon.  2.  There seems to be more of a delay once the player starts becoming full with media.  For ex not so much selecting album files, or artist files maybe it breaks it better but if I select all tracks takes a good 30-60 sec to accumulate it all so if you do that select a song don't like it and go back can get time consuming to the point I try not to do that.  It's doable just when I looked at ipod seemed you wip through everythign VERY fast. However I don't know how much media was on that Ipod I looked at.  3. Ipod is skinnier.  However it's still the size of a deck of cards and heavier but tolerable for the first highlights I liked.  4. The controls where cumbersome at first.  Has a little touch pad to move up and down that was EXTREMELY annoying at first (just like the laptops with no mouse just that little touch pad). But I did learn how to use it correctly.  I'd press lightly and to go up or down 1 or 2 songs go slowly but leave my thumb in place till I slected the song.  I used to tap it down then realease the thumb causeing it to skip the song and go up and down up and down so you just have to find out how to press it and it's actually not bad.  However, due to it's thickness and the positions of 4 buttons in a square pattern with the touch pad inbetween plus add a little case it can be cumbersome to manipulate it with one hand as you can with ipod.  It's totally doable but can get cumbersome.  I'm a klutz and almost dropped it b/c it was cumbersome so I usually need one hand to control it and one to support it or my hand cramps.  However while it's cool to do it in one hand still the radio, display, microphone outweigh it.    5.  I would have rather purchased creative zen with 60gb as Ipod has available however not available for this product.  I also hear Ipod will had microphone and radio at some point.  6.  It looks like you have to have windows to use this.  I could be wrong.  However I have windows so I use it without a problem. Some with ipod supposdely all you have to do is plug it into your computer and just piles your songs together for you without specific program.  This you do need a media player supposedly.  It comes with a program to rip discs and organizer to plug into your computer to add files hence probably why you need windows compatability.  I did like the organizer how I can connect it to my computer and add playlists that way or rename songs.  On the player itself too time consumming to search through all the songs and delay time to create a playlist there.  However only organized by artists and I like it organized by album.  Also cannot seem to rename the main heading a file is under.  I can rename the file but not the album once it's in the player and working with the program organizer.  7. This goes for all mp3 players, the FM radio transmitter to play in cars stink.  Does not have a good sound.  The only thing does work is one of those cd/mp3player tape converter things that you plug into a tape player press play and play the player.  On reg stereo system I hear a clicking from the cassette player and my car is a ford escape which has NO tape player or I'd use it.      SO:  I ultimatly chose creative zen m vision for it's display, microphone, radio, video capablity since I can convert almost any file for the most part to play in it usually (I don't know how well Ipod can).  I didn't notice a differece in sound with this and Ipod.  It's small enough to keep in my purse.  I love fooling with the display options and pics.  I love adding internet video media to the player and the colors it transmits.  I wish it was more user friendly as Ipod is such as going to a major motion pic webiste downloading the trailer bam get it in your player and watch it, more accesory options, easily transfer files to the player however creative zen can do all these functions and is more fun to fool around with for my tastes such as recording my flute anywhere without being stuck to my computer area which has no great acoustics.  I do wish it was a little faster however I do get impatient!  OVERALL I enjoy this player a lot. I have to work at it but there seems to be more to fool around with here.    HELPFUL HINTS:  One time this player did freeze on me. Had it a couple months and never did before but I think it was with the delay with the all track feature.  I displayed all the tracks, played a song then pressed back repeatedley (I'm clicker trigger happy) and it froze.  I read somewhere saying you have to replace the battery and maybe so on other models but NO you don't have to infact I don't think you can remove the battery which stinks b/c supposedly Ipod has a thing that they will replace the battery when it depletes in hopefuly years to come but creative zen doesn't.  Anyway there's a little hole with a reset button on the bottom player to the L.  Take a small paper clip and press it and it will reset from the time it froze and you won't loose any data prior to that.  Now if it froze as you added media it may not save the media you were transfering as it was interrupted.  Takes about 5min but it reboots and there are your files...whew I was petrifried when it froze and even if I got it to unfreeze I FREAKED I would loose my hours and hours of ripping time!!! But was saved.

<Title>I love my pink Zen!!
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is definitely the IPOD's rival! I do have the 60 GB IPOD, however it kept freezing up on me for a while, so I thought I would have to get it repaired. I'm in IRAQ, so I knew it would take forever to get it back...Anyhow, I was reading up on the CREATIVE Zen, and I saw that they had it in PINK, which IPOD doesn't have. Also, it has a longer battery life, which is great for me considering the situation I'm in, so I decided to try it. The video quality is great! Also, it doesn't need special software to be able to convert most video/movie files, unlike the IPOD, which you have to purchase at extra cost. The navigation button takes a little getting use to....All in all, I love it!

<Content>I got my Zen about 6 months ago and I have only had one problem with it. I had to reset it because it got stuck other then that I have had no problem. I would highly suggest a case for it. The one thing that I would like to see changed is the way that the unit is plugged in to be charged. You need a little adapter, its a little bit a pain. If you loose that then you will not be able to download or recharge. I have over 4,000 songs and I still have room for more.

<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Have spent some time now with the Vision M and I must say that I am completely satisfied with Creatives latest MP3/Video player.  The player synched up with my Windows media player music library in no time at all, and there were no problems with any of the tag information after being transferred to the player.  I found the player to be perfect at playing all the supported video media types, and the included video conversion software worked perfectly.  I also liked the software feature that allowed me to convert my picture file sizes on the fly, when coping them to the creative Zen player.

I put mine on low it's great you just have to have patience and learn it. It's so great i love it i bring it to work DON"T EVEN CARE what my boss says i blast it in my ears and do my job :-) Window Media Player 11 beta is the best to rip songs onto and the best dvd ripper to use would be MAGIC DVD RIPPER it's easy , fast , so great. I couldn't be more happier than anything with this player it's my new g.f LMAO !!! it's definately an ipod killer everybody ask is that an ipod i said mistake it for that again i'll beat you with an ipod cause this is way better.

<Title>Best Portable Video/MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched online for awhile and the Creative Vision M is the best video/mp3 player because its screen is superior and the Vision M can easily play (without further conversion/encoding) many video formats.   So after almost two months using my Vision M here's what I got to say:  In my experience, it plays just about any P2P video file I download (only two instances where I had to use the creative software to encode to a proper format). So far the most fun I have had with my Vision M is being able to transfer all the TV shows I download to my player in a matter of minutes -- then hook up the AV cable and I can watch them in great quality (every bit as good as the computer) from the comfort of my TV.  Of course, the Vision M is also a MP3 player and I have taken the time to transfer my entire music collection to my player. Using an FM transmitter, I can use the "random play all" mode to listen to nothing but my favorite songs when I'm driving. Sound quality is very nice too.  And then there is even more features - photos, FM radio, Microphone, Organizer, Removable Disk space and 30 GB of space!! This is a great player!! Is $300 a bit pricey? Yes. But if you can find a deal on it (my goal was $250 and I got extremely lucky and got it at $220 (USED)) - you won't be disappointed.  PLUS IF YOU DO GET ONE -- buy a "Best Skin Ever", "Invisible Shield", or a simple LCD Screen Cover to keep the player from getting any serious scratches (Although most of the time, unless I'm in harsh lighting I never noticed scratches on my player).

<Title>It really is an I-pod killer
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The creative Zen Vision M is by far better than the I-pod video. The Zen Vision M or ZVM for short supports more video formats such as AVI DivX(tm) 4 & 55, XviD5, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9, and Motion-JPEG. Also supports audio formats such as mp3, wav, and wma. The I-pod video doesn't even support wma audio format. The ZVM has 262,144 colors; the I-pod video only has 65,000-colors, that is 4x the color capacity than the I-pod. In other words, The ZVM is brighter and more colorful. The battery life of the I-pod video is only 2 hours of continuous video playback. The ZVM has 4 hours of continuous video playback. When you purchase the ZVM you get the full accessories such as Earphones, Sync Adapter, USB 2.0 cable, Travel Adapter to charge the ZVM via electrical outlet, Pouch, User's Guide, Installation CD (includes Creative MediaSource(tm) and Creative Media Explorer software, or you can use windows media player). When you purchase the I-pod video all you get is..... (Drum roll please) a whopping Earbud headphones, USB cable, Dock Adapter, and case. The ZVM also comes with FM turner, and voice recorder. If you want those features with the I-pod video you have to purchase each one separately. As far as the ZVM freezing, it is no longer an issue, they have fixed this via a firmware update. The ZVM is better, brighter, and more powerful than the I-pod. It really is an I-pod killer. You can even purchase a 2 yr warranty for parts and labor for $50

<Title>New Purchase
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased one of these from Best Buy and so far so good.  I have owned 2 Rio Carbons, and a Phillips HDD6330.  I also had the 30G IPOD for a few days.  This is by far the best one I've had.  The sound and EQ controls are great.  The software that comes with it is versatile.  The display screen is great, big with vibrant color.  It can take a boat load of music and photos, as well as video (MPEG 4 so far for me).  Even better and the reason's I chose it over IPOD, it has an FM Tuner, voice recorder, organizer and most of all, it was compatible with my WMA formatted music.  IPOD says that it is, but it has to convert each song - very slow process.  Cons: The touch controls, are pretty sensitive and take some getting used to, but you can even adjust the sensitivity levels on them.  Also, it doesn't come with an AC cord or a dock (sold separately).    Also, the replacement plan was $59.  I thought that was kind of lame.  All things considered though, Ounce for Ounce I think that it is the best MP3 that I've seen.

<Title>Kills The Ipod
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm 16 and just bought this mp3 player after shopping extremely carefully. I definitely did my homework on this one especially when I saw the prices of the players of higher capacity that would actually hold my music collection. Of course it came down to a battle between the Ipod and this nifty little contraption. So I looked up all the specs of each finding that the zen had many more extras to it like radio, being able to record the radio, a personal organizer, a mic and recorder that I can use to record lectures in school, and so on. So I finally decided to buy it and boy was I amazed.I had heard people talking about how much smaller the Ipod is compared to the Zen vision: m though now I have mine I have to disagree. The unit is thicker than the Ipod (which makes it perfect as I feel like an Ipod is ready to break in my hand when I hold it)but not nearly as wide or as tall. So if size is keeping you from buying this unit absolutely don't let it keep you from buying it. It's not very big at all. Also The Sound Quality is very good. The controls are easy enough to figure out even without the manual and the software that comes with the player is easy to use as well, though you can just use musicmatch or something along those lines. Overall I have to say this player definitely defeats the Ipod any day. The only problem I have is that since Ipods are so mainstream most of the accessories in stores are just for Ipods. As for me ordering the accesories off of the internet is fine. Also, the picture quality of the unit- Absolutely amazing. It's much better than the lcd screen on my camera, even my computer. It includes zoom, brightness and contrast controls, and you can convert the pictures into black and white, sepia, and two other neat settings. The video- amazing as well and the battery life is very good. If the vertical touchpad seems sensitive you can change even that in the settings. If you're looking to buy a zen vision: m I definitely advise you do so. If you're looking for it all, that's just what it does.

<Title>Awesome Tool!  Great Sound and Video...
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok first let me say I got this yesterday, I am a techno junkie and wanted something to watch Photoshop TV videos on.  I almost bought an IPOD but I love that this has an FM radio tuner in it. I did my research and ordered it. Now here is my review....  First let me say that I almost hated this at first.  You need to convert your MP4 (Apple) movies to wmv format.  I looked all over for freeware to do it, but ended up purchasing inexpensive software to do it.  Still, I could not watch my photoshop TV videos.  I had to again use the creative software to convert the already converted wmv videos into an wmv format that the Zen could read.  Phew!  Did you get all that.    On to DVDs.  I figured that it professes to be able to watch 120 hrs of movies, this was definitely for me.  What they don't tell you is that the movies have to be in avi format (camcorder movies) not DVDs(VOB format), so I needed to get software to do that also.  There is freeware for that, but still I have to rip the DVDs into wmv format and then again convert them into wmv format that the Zen can read.    BUT, and that is a big but......  I was NOT disappointed when I got all that work done.  The Zen is amazing.  I have an MP3 video player that can play wmv videos, but it is nothing like this.  The quality of the movies is stunning.  It is like watching HDTV, crystal clear and the sound is marvelous.  So for all the work I have to go through to get my videos over, I am sooooo glad I bought this instead of the IPOD.  Extremely pleased.    Please email me at hobbitskorner@hotmail.com if you would like to know what software I got to convert all this stuff.  I'd be happy to steer you in the right direction.  Now what comes in the box.  People who said there was no AC adapter DID NOT buy the Zen Vision M, because guess what, there is an adapter in the box.  I have mine plugged in right now!  I agree with those who said protect the screen.  I broke the screen on my other one, just a touch cracked the bottom of it.  Get some screen covers and cut them down to size.  Do not take the plastic off your Zen until you get them.    I gave this 4 stars because of the software headaches, but other than that, this is a marvelous piece of equipment!

<Title>Excellent Mobile mp3 player/radio
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have 3 Ipods,1Nano and 2mini's Apple makes a nice unit. But this Vision M is the cats meow. Before it even arrived I downloaded Windows Media Player 11 and started ripping my entire CD collection into its library at 256kbps (twice the bitrate of itunes mp4) I did about 3500 songs which made a file about 21 gigs in size. This includes album art. When the ZEN unit arrived I charged it via usb cable about 4 hours. There is not a wall charger in the package, Creative sells them for 29.99 on their website.Anyways after unit charged I upgraded the firmware to the latest version.Installed software, and went to the windows media player and pushed sync. It took 1.25 Hours to upload 21 gigabytes of music and cover art. That is extremely fast. The unit has played flawlessly the radio is as good as my cars pioneer (rode on motorcyle all over town and it NEVER lost reception even while in my coat pocket)This unit is Excellent and so far I havent found a downside to this purchase. I as always bought the 3 year extended warranty as this unit is advertised as having a 1 year warranty but only 90 days labor. I was screwed by Panasonic on a similar warranty where as after the 90 days they would send you a refurbished unit for 80% of the new units price. I dont know how Creative handles claims after 90 days and I dont intend to find out. But I think my Ipods are going to collect a little dust!

<Content>I have had this unit for two days now. I bought it for a road trip, and the first thing i did on the road trip was try to watch a movie and the player froze. It stayed froze and there was no way of turning it off except either, wait for the battery to run out, or push the reset button.  Since i was on a road trip the reset button wasnt an option and the battery didnt run out until we were done driving. The second time i used the M I was scrolling through menus and it froze for the second time in two days that i had it. I either got an extremelly faulty unit or this product needs major work. Get yourself an ipod, it costs the same amount, but at least you know your getting a product you can trust.

Graphics are great! Sound qualilty is EXCELLENT.  Amazon shipped this much faster than I expected, that was a bonus!  Bought a leather case and screen guard, a must to protect the screen from scratches.  Recorded a song off an FM preset station (sounds awesome).  Tons of options on this MP3.  Rips songs faster than I imagined.  Ripped songs from my CDs easily and directly to the ZEN (via USB port on PC and software provided with the Vision M) instead of uploading to the computer.  This saved me time and hard drive space on my PC.  Touch pad has tons of options/settings you can adjust to your preferences.

<Title>So much to like, so much to be annoyed...
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What a great MP3 player. What an annoying MP3 player.  The Zen Vision M is not a study in "Zen" but more of a study in "Yin and Yang".  > The aahhh so great: What a beautiful screen, outstanding sound quality, photo slideshows while you listen to music and the number of tweaks to the settings is almost endless. A clock, a calender, an organizer, FM radio, recorder, 0-60 in 5.6 seconds...just kidding about the last one.  > The "what were they thinking??!!": Then there is the touch pad which is enough to send me over the edge. I hold my breath with each use of it and I have the sensitivity set down. The interface software for PC and MP3 is completely lame. It organizes the music with folders on the PC but on the player it is by the music ID tags. Try to rectify this one folks. The case should have been all black, not an oreo with one side missing. And the case needs more solidity - it flexes when you squeeze it, which you will do when you are pushing the buttons next to the touch pad. I think just looking at it wrong will cause a scratch, too. The menu interface can be like a labyrinth sometimes, too. As in, "how do I get out of here?!" Am I done nagging? Yes, I think so. Because just like that special woman with flaws, you love her anyway because of her depth of personality. Not that I love an MP3 player, of course. I make this statement only for the purposes of drawing an analogy. Is this the iPod killer? Nope, I don't even want to go there because that device is flawed too. But the Vision M IS darn good and fun too! Live with it's flaws and partake of its pleasures. It is a study in contrasts.

I am still finding the controls confusing: bookmarking seem almost random in whether it "takes" or not.  I don't know how much this is me not absorbing directions or how much it is a problem with the touchpad.  But I will say, the controls are far from intuitive.

<Title>An awesome mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got the Zen today and its amazing. I was thinking about geting the 30GB iPod but I liked the features the Zen had over the iPod such as the built in FM tuner. The Zen also has a much better screen then the iPod. Over all I think the Zen is a better MP3 player.

<Title>Album Art
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think this is a great product, from the screen to functionality of controls, to sound of music and ability to personalize the player, only question I had was does anyone know how to save album art onto the player, the program I was using didn't do so and I don't want to re-rip all of my Cds again just to get the artwork on there, I read a prior post about saving a jpeg file, which I did but once I transferred onto the player it only appeared in the Photos section of the player, any help would be much appreciated  Thanks

<Title>Creative Zen Vision: M
<Date>Fri Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me begin by saying that this is the first MP3 player that I have ever owned.  Now, I have used a 60GB iPod Video for about a month before I purchased it, although it wasn't mine.  I must admit when I was actually in the process of forking over the money to pay for the ZVM, I felt like I was cheating on Apple.  I researched this device for about a week straight before I bought it over the iPod and honestly thought it was going to be one of the many electronic devices I purchased and returned because I was not satisfied.  Well, turns out I was sadly mistaken.  While both the iPod and ZVM have their pros and cons I must admit that MAN, I am lovin' this thing way more then I did the iPod.  I do agree with someone else that posted about the sensitivity issues, but over the past week I have gotten used to it and almost have it down perfectly.  I am 100% happy with my purchase and so far so good.  No battery explosions or melt downs, no freezing up (make sure you upgrade to the latest firmware as soon as you purchase as it fixed a lot of bugs).  My point is that although the iPod is a good device, the ZVM is proof that there are better out there and that the iPod is a little overhyped and albeit "trendy".

<Title>zen M 30 delivers as promised
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen M 30 works just as promised.  After only a few minutes I mastered the slide and button controls which I find easier to use than our iPod mini.  The bookmark function as well as the ability to see how much time is left greatly simplifies listening to recorded boooks. I do wish they had included a speed control function to allow me to listen to recorded books at a faster speed.  I also appreciate the ability to remove a file from the Zen M 30 directly with the 'remove' fundtion.  The battery life is greater than 10 hours as compared to the disappointing battery life of our mini iPod.  The wonderful crisp large screen works well in daylight and the Zen M 30 is what I now use as my mobile family picture album.

<Title>I good choice
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After buying an ipod and having it lock up on me several times within a week of recieving it, I decided to buy a Creative MP3 player because my friend had one and loved it.  I like that it takes very little time to charge the battery. Prior to this and the ipod, I had a Sony MP3 player for a little under a year, but I hated the program you had to use with it. With this player, you can use several programs, and but music from pretty much anywhere and play it.  Lastly, and this is perhaps one of my favorite things about it, you can make playlists in the player, you don't need to make one in your computer, then transfer it, although you can do that as well.  I've had this player probably a month or six weeks, and haven't had problems with it. I would definatly recommend it.

<Title>good mp3 player marred by horrible horrible control problems
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this from another site and it arrived today. My first reaction was "where is the AC adapter?" The first page of the manual shows you how to change out the international plugs, and several pages later, there is a diagram of how to plug it into the wall. However, nowhere on the box or the literature does it say that the adapter is sold separately. This is very sneaky on the part of Creative, in my opinion. I wondered for several minutes if my package had a missing part, since every electronic device I've ever purchased came with an AC adapter.   They only tell you to install the software (XP only) before trying to plug it onto the USB plug, and this is on a separate foldout guide. Sneaky indeed. It takes 6 hrs to charge by USB vs 3 for the AC ($30).  As far as design goes, I'll come out and say what Creative won't. This is a blatant knockoff of the iPod. The Zen is one of the **least ugly** mp3 players I've seen, so it played a factor in my purchase. It looks almost the same as the black U2 iPod if you were to see it head on. They're trying to capitalize on the shape and appearance of Apple's player, down to the 2-toned shell (Creative's is white and black instead of metal and white), the smooth plastic face, and scroll pad. The headphones resemble the iPod's "ball on a stick" look, except the Zen's is much bigger and more conspicuous. (I won't be using them in public due to embarassment).  The buttons are my biggest beef with the Zen and they have substantial dsign flaws. I've only had it for about 3 hours but the control mechanisms are already driving me crazy. They must've been designed by a mental patient because only the insane would make something this difficult to use. They are absolutely awful awful awful. Creative tried to copy the iPod's scroll wheel, and for legal reasons, can't completely knock it off, so they settled for a really badly executed midpoint.  In the middle of the Zen is a verticle thumb-sized touch sensitive pad that has only up and down motion awareness. If you try to slide your finger horizontally, it won't register. On either edge of the touch pad are arrow buttons but no up and down arrows.   Pushing on these buttons in most cases does nothing. Instead, it advances or repeats the song, if one is playing. Intuitively, pushing either of these buttons should advance the menu 1 level deeper, or go back up a level. e.g.  Photos > Pictures > Folders view  where pushing forward or backward would go up or down a submenu. But instead, tapping advances while pushing a button on the lower left side goes back (looks like upside down ENTER key).   The touchpad is extremely sensitive to taps, even at LOW sensitivity setting. The slightest touch or pause may be interpreted as a tap. Having to hit a separate BACK button off to the side is very annoying, especially when you see a left arrow on the edge of the touchpad (which does nothing)! Creative should've made the confirm click a spring loaded button to offer users tactile feedback and resistance, like a mouse button. Additionally, there is a MENU button, which has extra menu items that somehow couldn't be designed into the main menu scheme. Moving your finger along the pad while the clock is up makes clicky sounds but nothing happens on the screen.  The scroll wheel on the Apple is superbly designed and functions very well. The touchpad on the Zen is a hobbling midget with his legs broken and his crutches pawned off to buy food. It is simply aggravating to use and very prone to errors.  I bought this player because 1) I refuse to buy an iPod despite owning several Apple computers for work. I didn't want to be participate in yuppie chic like so many sheep 2) it offered native Divx and Xvid playback and that was the main reason for buyng this. I tested a movie on it (700 MB DIVX) and it ran great.   FM radio playback is also a feature, but you'll probably never use it. There are MANY MANY design flaws with this player which prevent this from being a great product. The features list is impressive and if you're willing to put up with the clumsy interface, this may be worth the tradeoff. I am still undecided.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I WANTED to be able to use Media Player for my MP3 player, as I had a smaller (1g) player that worked that way before I bought this one. I did not want to "relearn" to sync, etc. I just wanted to plug it in and get going. I did. And I found that with just a little use, this thing is about as self explanatory as Windows for someone with just a little bit of tech knowledge. The only downsides for me are...lack of detailed manual, difficulty in finding accessories(though if you browse online, there are a few more options) and the case is pretty sensitive to scratches(going back to how I wish it were easier to find a case). All in all..not sorry at all I bought this over IPOD....not even a little.

<Title>Nice Digital Player
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the first time I've ever bought anything like this.  My kids all have iPods, but I really just wanted something small on which I could store photos and carry them with me - in my pocketbook.  I picked the Zen because the screen was a little bigger than most.  The screen is nice and pretty clear but it's still not as big as I would like. However, the price of the Creative Zen Vision 30GB was more than I wanted to spend.  Even this one was kind of pricey.  I was able to easily download my photos and can do a quick slideshow.  I haven't learned about all the features, but I haven't spent that much time with it yet.    I can't comment on the music part except for the fact that it's very easy to download music.  It sounds just fine to me through my headphones - can't use those little earbuds.  I'd prefer to get speakers or something.    The organizer is ok - but don't expect it to be as useful as a Palm Pilot.    The touch controls can be a bit sensitive, but I'm guessing that will get better once I get used to it.  It's a nice looking little thing and quite suitable for me for now.  I can carry my photos, my music and address book all in one compact place.  I will probably give this one to my husband and get the Vision 30GB next - if it comes down in price.

<Title>ahhh the joys of my creative. 
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i abso-bally-lutely love this... it is marvy-brilliant. it takes awhile to get used to and to find out all the cool little features but once you've had it for a few weeks, it is totally worth it. my friends balk at the price. but when you get down to it, it is only about ten dollars per gig.  i bought the creative cuz i am adamantly against mac products. and i'm really glad... (do ipods have a reset button in case it freezes?? i don't think so!) and it has been worth every penny...   the only problems i have had with are   A) with the videos... where you can only have .AVI files and the converter either takes forever OR fails to convert the file... and  B) the wee bit that you need to plug into the bottom so you can charge or dock it. it's kinda annoying to have to carry that around with ya.   other than that is it fabulous and i whould change it for a second.

<Title>amazing...truly amazing
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ive been in the process of buying a mp3 player and spent countless hours researching the best of the best, trying to get the biggest bang for the buck...look no further..  The Creative Zen Vision: M has a 30GB hard drive thats able to store up to "15,000 songs", "120 hours of video", and "tens of thousands of photos".  It also has a FM radio (with the ability to record songs off the radio), a calender, contact list, and task menu (of which all can be synched with Microsoft Outlook).      I have to admit, im not a real big fan of the ipod..tis a product for the followers of the glorious (only people who want to seem cool buy it).  I, myself, love to be different (and still like to look good doing it) so when i saw this product, the features, the PRICE...i knew this was the perfect player...      I was skeptical at first, reading some of the other reviews...complaints about problems with freezing, minor things like- "the buttons are too hard to push", "ive only gotten 11-12 hours of music", and other such stupidity...  The Creative Zen Vision: M has a 4.5 rating on Amazon whereas the Ipods have only 4 stars...i mean, whats up with that?  If you look at reviews for this product you'll probably see some really dumb ones...like this one posted by an Ipod freak-       "Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod Video 60GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: bestfreeproducts.info/ipod-video"  What was that?!  The Ipod people are getting scared...lol..  Anyway, i got mine and have had it for a week and it works PERFECT!  No freezing, no glitches, perfect sound quality, the easiest, most user-friendly software EVER, a great scroll pad for selecting music!  Ok, now here's the real meat of this review:  The great things the Creative Zen Vision: M has- 1.  GREAT battery life 2.  A multitude of colors (262,144 vivid colors ), making images clearer and sharper 3.  30GB of memory...whats not to love about that? 4.  FM radio...a nice plus for those random moods 5.  FM radio recorder 6.  Can store videos and photos in addition to the music 7.  Can create playlists and slideshows using the awesome Creative Zen Mdeia Explorer 8.  Media can easily be dragged and dropped into player 9.  Can buy an AV cable to hook up to tv to play videos and slideshows 10.  Voice recorder 11.  Calender and such 12.  Scroll button (the controls in general) 13.  Price...Ipod-299.99              Creative Zen Vision: M- 268.99  Obvious  choice? 14.  Display (has a clock, time left panel, and the ability to change color themes to go with the background picture) 15.  Oh...duh, you can set your own background picture  Some bad things- 1.  Have to convert files in order for player to read them (but the Zen Media Explorer software that comes with it will ask if you would like to convert and will do it for you) 2.  Have to buy case and charger (if you want to charge from a wall outlet) charging from a wall outlet takes 2hours vs. the  6.5 hours it takes to charge by computer 3.  The black color of the player makes scratches more visible...get a CASE!  Ok, another important part...what the package from Amazon includes (some reviews are deceiving so id like to set them straight)-  1. Creative Zen Vision: M 2. Software 3. Adapter (for charging on computer and transferring files) 4. USB cable 5. Earphones 6. Pouch (it is what it is, a simple leather pouch...Best Buy sells a nice holder with belt clip on their website)  It DOES NOT come with the power adapter to charge by way of wall outlets...it DOES NOT come with AV cable  Hope that this review will be as helpful to you and clear as possible..the last thing you need when trying to make a investment involving a good sum of money is to have confusing reviews...

<Title>Great player; marginal video ripping software
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this unit (my third MP3/video player), but ripping videos from DVDs using the supplied software just doesn't work well. After several tries (unsuccessful) with Creative support, I bought a copy of Xilisoft DVD Ripper 4.0. It rips the DVDs easily, using intuitive controls, creating a format compatible with the unit. You can then easily transfer the ripped file to the unit, and voila, your music concert, movie, or whatever you want will be there for you to play while traveling, etc. I use my unit with Bose Quiet2 earphones on planes to avoid engine noise, passenger noise, etc., and to have something relaxing to watch. I use Jack the MP3 Ripper (a shareware program that is great and easy to use) to rip MP3s to install in the unit.

<Title>Happy with the Zen
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to have an iPod but I wanted something with video capabilities, something my iPod couldn't offer.  This player came pretty highly recommended and, as far as I could tell, moreso than iPod Video.  Having had the Zen for about a month now, I think it would be fair to say that I'm largely happy with it.  The scroll pad is maybe a bit *too* sensitive but I wouldn't say it's drastically better or worse than iPod's wheel.  In fact, I much prefer having the Zen's actual buttons but small things like this ultimately come down to individual preference.  It's something worth considering if you're a stickler for functionality like I am.  Speaking of functionality, my iPod used juice like nobody's business!  I could leave it sitting on my dresser for two days without powering it up and the battery would still be depleted (or very close to it).  The Zen, on the other hand, is off when it says it's off and -- as far as I can tell -- doesn't drain the battery when it's off.  Maybe my iPod just had a screwy battery or maybe the iPod batteries just suck.  Take your pick!  One area where my non-video iPod had the Zen beat, however, was in playing back m4a files.  The Zen doesn't seem to recognize them.  I don't have many songs in m4a so it's not a big deal or anything but if that's your preferred format, well, buyer beware!  I've had trouble getting the Zen to play back certain files.  Yes, it is true that it can play mpeg and avi video on theory, but in practice I find that the significantly older video files I have on my computer (roughly before 2003) are sometimes not supported by the Zen.  It's not a huge deal because I've yet to find a newer avi or mpeg file that it can't play.  In terms of video, connecting the Zen to your TV doubles the fun!  I bought a connector cable and have been catching my friends and family up on Veronica Mars.  Playback quality is just fine and it's really convenient to do it this way rather than burn a bunch of stupid SVCD's or DVD's that I'll only watch once or twice.  My biggest complaint about the Zen isn't really about the Zen per se, it concerns the software.  Quite frankly, this is the worst software I can possibly imagine for the player.  If you're used to iTunes, hang on to your seat because this gets pretty heavy.  iTunes allows you to sorta a playlist based on, for instance, artist, song, album, track sequence, rating, etc.  Really, you've got no shortage of options.  In general I was never all that impressed with iTunes but going from that to the Zen software is like going from a Porsche to a tricycle.  It would appear that the Zen software is actually open source so there's probably a nerd out there somewhere who's making a better version and I hope I find it.  But for right now, there's just no good way to use the Zen software.  I despise it and that's why I'm giving the Zen only a 4-star rating.  That should tell you something.  If the only thing I really don't like about the player is the software (a non-player issue), then you can rest assured that this is a quality product and well worth the money.  If Creative ever gets around to writing a better program, I'll have to revise this into a 5-star rating.

<Title>I like it.
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>More like 4.5 stars. Just the often reseting a little bothersome, not sure if its a corrupted file or the player is responsible for that. Just that complaint.  I like the random play mode, its pretty good. I like the option of listening to radio and being able to record. Like the option of portable video and being able to play it on an external player though you need the extra video extension to be able to play it externally. Zencast support seems to be good. Havent tried the firmware upgrade available on the zencast site. Quite easy to manage the playlists. I got the case made by DLO. Its got a good feel to it and comes with a belt clip and (gym) arm band too. The videos are crisp even through the DLO.  Its probably heavier than the video ipod, but at those weights I think I cant tell the difference. The portability figures a lot higher on priority list :). btw its cheaper on other competing sites.  Usability: I feel the interface could allow a few more customizations for the the other buttons, its not bad right now, just it could be better.  -> Maybe they could tinker with their firmware and do something about it. -> maybe allow changing the mp3 tags too. -> I wish they could do something about reading files (pdfs/text) on the Zen Vision M. Sometimes the volume just increases because my thumb slides over the pad, but I guess Im still trying to figure out how to do that a little better.  The Bad: It does seem to freeze quite often, 4-5 times a week. I get the feeling I need to carry a paper clip on me at all time. Not knowing when Ill have to reset it. One thing I noticed is that once it hangs the battery life seems to go down FASTER than normal, that cant be good if its true.

<Content>PLayer has worked well so far.  Battery life has been good.  Just to be clear, this player DOES NOT come with an AC Adapter.  First instruction in manual, "Connect your player to the AC Adapter..."  Apparently they use to provide this but decided they had to cut price to give the illusion of parity with other players.  The result is that you get to buy a $30 AC adapter (plus shipping of course!)  You can charge via the USB but that is 3 times as long.

<Content>After my COWON iAudio X5L 30 GB broke, I decided to go with something new for an MP3 player, and after sufficient research, I read that Creative Zen Vision:M was the best player on the market, even rated "best in show" by CNet.  However, after receiving the thing, despite it's beautiful display - the sound quality is HORRIBLE...even if you play with the Custom EQ the bass is lacking, if you turn bass boost on the sound gets distorted, and no special effects or surround sound options are available.  Do not buy this product...the beauty of it may be nice but is a superficial reason to purchase a player.  At the end of the day, you want the player to sound great and function well.  Go with the COWON iAudio X5L 30 GB, which has 35-hour battery and THE best sound quality of all the currently available MP3 players on the Net.

<Title>iPod or Zen Vison M: ? 30 days with Zen Vision M and Lovin' IT!
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey Everyone,  If you are reading this review you are probably about to purchase either the Apple Video iPod or the Creative Zen Vison M: or some other similar device.  For me it was between Apple 30-Gig Video iPod and the 30-gig Creative Zen Vision M.  I actually read a lot of the negative reviews for both devices.  There were more negative reviews for the Apple iPod, but there were also more total sales of the iPod verse the Creative Zen Vison.  Also, the iPod negative reviews contained negative reviews of the non-video versions.  This led me to consider that people that 1) Bought an expensive personal electronic device, and 2) Had problems using it, and 3) Didn't know what product review section they were in...might not be the most skilled at using the devices they are complaining about.  In simple terms, the user is the problem, not the device.  Therefore the negative reviews focusing on how a person can't use the device should not be a deterrent to you of purchasing the device.  Also, the Creative Zen Vision M: comes with a 1-year warrenty, so if the battery dies, or the screen dies, or the hardware fails within 12 months of purchase, you can get it repaired or replaced.  So, even if the particular unit you get does not work, or fails, that unit does not represent the whole of the quality of the product, just that particular unit.  I also believe that although not as delicate as an egg, these devices with minituare hard drives and thin glass displays are not hacky sacs.  If the outside of the box containing your shipped device is marked or dented in any way, it is possible that the device worked fine at the factory, but was damaged in shipping, and again, does not represent the whole of the quality of the product.  In simple terms, one defective or broken unit does not mean ALL the units are defective or broken.  I choose the Zen Vision over the Apple iPod for four main reasons: Screen Quality, FM Stero, Recording Ability and non-iTunes freedom.  Screen Quality:  The screen on the Zen Vision M is better than the Apple iPod.  I have a friend who has the video iPod and we played the same music video side by side and it was a no brainer.  Even my friend had to admit that the video looked better on the Zen Vision.  FM Stereo:  Want to listen to NPR or some other live news report on the iPod? Oh, you can't.  Recorder:  The recorder records stuff outside the device, AND can also record from the radio.  On the iPod, you can't record.  Non-iTunes Freedom:  Many people love iTunes and how seemlessly it works with iPods.  However, after doing iTunes for years I wanted my WinAmp back, and/or MediaMonkey, and/or, the freedom to try different software.  If you love iTunes, good for you.  It's like living in the world's best prison.  You don't even know you are trapped.  Update: Some non-iTunes software can now interface with iPods.  What about podcasts?  Can I get those on the Zen Vision?  Yep, they are called Zencasts.  I have not tried them out personally, but the option is available.  In the 30 days I have had the device I have put on 3000 mp3 files and 8 movies.  The movies are about 1-gig in size, 800meg to 1-gig.  I didn't think I would be using the movie playing aspect, but it turns out that it's way cool.  With the 2 and 4 year old children in the house I can't watch "The Matrix" when they are awake as I think it will give them nightmares.  AND I can't watch it when they are napping or sleeping as I want to watch it LOUD, as intended.  Now I can watch it with the volume loud before going to bed or at lunch or whenever.  Music play back is awesome, as good or better than the iPod.  I mention it in passing as it kind of goes without saying that the device is great at playing back stored music.  Lock-ups.  My particular unit has not "locked-up" on me, but I only have vanilla *.mp3 and *.avi files on the device.  It might be that people that were having lock-ups had non-standard files or corrupt files.  I only mention lock-ups as it was my biggest fear after reading many of the reviews that the device would continually lock-up.  I now believe that people that have multiple lock-ups may have corrupt files or are playing formats that are "supported" but may not be totally supported.  Like mp3 files are supported, but I only have constant bit rate or CBR mp3s.  I don't know how well the device does with Variable Bit Rate (VBR) mp3s.  So, in short, I've been using the Creative Zen Vision M: for 30 days and I am lovin' it!  Notes:  The Apple Video Cable that I got for my iBook works with the Creative Zen Vision M:.  So if already have that cable, save yourself $30.00.  The Creative Web Site has Forums where you can get help with using the Zen Vision.  One that really helped me enjoy the device even more was "Vision:M undocumented how to & tips thread"  Google it if ye doubt my word.  Found an old 4.5VDC car charger that works instead of 5.0VDC  Screen Protector - yes, use one.  One comes installed, leave it on and replace it as it wears.  Hope this review helps you out, God Bless and Good Luck.

<Content>Well I have to give it to creavtive they made nice player on the outside thought what ever OS they decided to use has a lot of problems several and I mean several have problems beside me. And here is how mine started.  I was looking at some pics I uploaded to it and found a nice rating system built in the zen that lets to make your favorites in a gouping by five stars. I get 6 or so rated and finally get to the last one I want to rate and it just stops responing. Now it was still showing the picture but nothing was working so I try to turn it off and nothing. So I go to the site and there is a reset button on the bottom an sliding the power sitch over while using this button makes a recovery screen come up.(like the F8 key for windows to safemode, thought this is a not so safemode) I first try the clean up asnd it just fails so I try the format and it gets finished quite fast and then I try a reboot. It just freezes and states there is a firmware problem. Reset again and now it will not even update the firmware or turn off. When I connect it to update it just sits there with no update at all the program is running in memory but nothing happens. I would advise it you want it just wait till all of the problems  are gone then buy this, just to expensive to have so many problems.

<Content>The sound is spectacular in the earbuds provided, sounds like surround sound. You can keep your iPods!! The picture on the screen is also superior to the iPod, and the program to load music into it is so easy, you don't need itunes (at a dollar a song) like the iPod. You can also load programs that you normally watch and that are saved on Tivo, also movies from the computer. I love my Zen, best purchase I've made.

<Title>Creative Zen Vision M - the right choice
<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros : Great Sound and Video quality, FM Tuner & recorder, voice recorder, lots of video codec support, WMA audio support, Smart volume option, easy upload/download,   Cons : A little bulky and thick, some audio codecs not supported, slow video conversion  Overall, I think this ZVM is definitely the best MP3 player with video right now in the market - it's price, too, is very reasonable for so many features, and adding/managing/converting audio/video/data files are very easy and user-friendly. Apple iPod has the better looks with slimmer body and shiny metal back, but ZVM beats it hands down with so many features - the one I love most is the Smart volume which can adjust the audio output based on the noise in the environment. Awesome player...

<Date>Sat Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player was a slight dissapointment. I had high hopes for this device, but was dissapointed. As far as music, the sound quality was great. I really did not like the touch pad style for navigating, as it is easy to skip past the songs that you want. There is a definite learning curve for this device. The worst part for me was the video. It is more trouble that what it is worth to convert your dvd's to the proper format, and then to watch them back. By the time I converted them down to the small files, the movies were too pixelated. Totally not worth the video. I sent it back. Now I have a 4GB Sandisk and I am happy.

<Title>player of choice
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I jumped on the MP3 player bandwagon 4 years ago and over the course of time have experimented with a number of different players. The Creative Zen Vision M is the first player I've purchased and kept that was not flash (solid state) based. I'm an active person who works in the sports and fitness industry and most of the high capacity players were either to big or unstable to get good use out of. The size and feel of this player is great considering how much media it will hold and it's also stable. I bike and work out with it all the time and have never heard it skip.   The one thing that attracted me most to this player was the wide variety of audio and video formats that it plays. There is free software out there to help you convert DVDs and CDs to a workable format that the player can handle. Lots of commercial DVD and CD players are now able to handle these very popular formats (Divx/mpeg4 and mp3). Converting to Divx and Mp3 is an easy, safe, and efficient way to copy, store, and view the ever growing media collection. In my opinion it's the only way to go and the Vision M is the player of choice to view it on the road. The display is bright and clear and the controls are adequate. The one thing I don't like about the display is that you must view it from a direct angle in order for it to be clear and bright.   I do not like the way Creative makes you organize your media in this player. It would be nice to have more control over the way media is structured. Your music needs to be well tagged because the player uses the tags to organize everything once in the player i.e. artist, album, genre. I would rather be able to copy music folders over and navigate thru them as they were on my computer. I like being able to see music organized based on id tags but I don't see why consumers can't have it both ways.   The battery life is great. I take it on my travels with flights as long as 12hrs with no problem. I'm usually listening to music. Video viewing takes up more battery life but you could easily sit thru 2 movies before the battery gives out. It would be nice if the battery was replaceable. Built in batteries make me nervous. Once the battery goes it's not really worth having it replaced.  The player has a small proprietary adapter that must be plugged into the bottom of it in order to connect the standard USB cable  or power adapter. This is a VERY annoying feature. It would be much better if you could plug the standard cables directly into the player. I hope this changes in the future. If I saw a comparable player that let me retain my music file structure and did not require the proprietary adapter I would probably go with it.  I like creative products but my loyalty is not etched in stone. When it comes to customer satisfaction they have some work to do namely making the use of their players more convenient. All in all I must say I am very pleased with this player. For what it does, I believe it to be the best on the market at this time.

<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little unit will not let you down.  A powerful 30 GB can hold what you need...pay a little extra than you would for its "cousins," you will be very pleased!  The sound quality is amazing.  Once you toy with the setup (initially it is a little difficult) and figure out all the bells and whistles you come to the conclusion that the Zen Vision M is a SUPERSTAR among the players!  Initially I had a bit of a time figuring out how to get the FM radio feature to work.  The biggest tip I can give you is make sure to TAP on the long white pad to get thru each menu.  That is the equivalent to "select."  The arrow keys will drive you nuts until you learn to TAP!!

<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking to replace my iRiver H340 for some time. With iPod taking over the market it was hard but I think I got the one I really like. The following are my reasons to buy this one: 1. I am listening to audio books so I needed support for bookmarks (ability to listen multiple books). This feature works just fine. 2. My music collection is a mix of MP3 and WMA - this player plays both formats flawlessly.  3. I was curious about Video playback - it works just great, especially on the external TV. Cons: These are really minor: 1. I would prefer to be able to use it for file storage without installing the software. 2. It should support file-name-based sorting and playing. 3. Bookmark feature should remember not only particular file but also the state of the player on the moment when bookmark is being  set. E.g. player should continue to play the same sequence of MP3 files starting from particular point in the list and position in the file.

<Title>Excellent all-around media player.
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no complaints about the player itself.  The depth and color of the screen is astonishing, the sound quality is clear and crisp, the volume actually goes loud enough, unlike other media players I've owned in the past.  The screen needs some sort of shield over it, but there are many available.  The FM tuner is great, reception is good even in strange locations.  The recorder works quite well, but for some reason there's a 10 minute limit to recordings.  Battery life is quite good, playing about 3.5 hours of video before a low battery warning starts to flash.  Don't worry, though, it will play for at least another 45 minutes before the battery actually dies.  This is rather strange, but I'm not complaining, as the message doesn't flash for that long.  I have, however, had problems with the conversion software.  Certain video files lose sound when converted with the included video conversoin tool, and it does not support .m4a music files.  Other than those issues, which are easily solved with other conversion resources, this is the media player I would (and do) heartily recommend to anyone considering the iPod video.  The video quality is vastly superior, and the vertical touchpad is much more useful and intuitive than the rotating click-wheel used in iPods.  The freezing problems have been fixed with the latest update of the firmware, and the inclusion of a programmable button (mine is set to random-play-all, which queues up all the music on the player on shuffle with the touch of a button) make this player a clear winner.

<Content>My husband bought this player for me as a birthday gift and it's the best!!!  Loading songs is a breeze, and windows media player even finds the album art for you. The color on the screen is incredible. Though the documentation is a bit skimppy, once you play around with it for a while it's easy to figure out and navigate through all the functions.  I just figured out how to load full lenght movies on it through another company's software (m2 convert for zen 29.99) and the movies look absolutely flawless. Pictures load very easily as well and the fm tuner, organizer, and removable storage are a nice touch.  My only complaint would be that it scratches very very very easily!!! I mean even cleaning the screen with a glasses cloth will cause several faint scratches to appear on the screen so get screen protectors and I recommend a silicon case sold right here on amazon.  Other than that it is perfect. Get this over the video ipod for sure you won't be disappointed!!!

<Title>Fantastic Device with all the Features I Wanted
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent a few weeks researching all the MP3 players on the market, reading many reviews and customer comments (Amazon, C-Net, etc.). I already own an iPod Shuffle and an older RCA Lyra, both for running, but wanted a larger capacity unit for listening to and watching `podcasts'. Though the Apple 30 GB iPod was very compelling, and I am a huge Apple Fan and dedicated iTunes user, I couldn't be happier with my Vision:M. It has met all my needs - the software is very easy to install, and easy to use. The unit is sturdy; I have traveled several times with it on business trips without any problems. With available software, I am able to convert any format audio or video to use on the unit. The FM tuner, voice recorder, and especially its ability to act as a hard drive to backup my laptop on the road are all added benefits at no additional cost, like with the iPod. My only complaint thus far is the `touchiness' of the pressure sensitive control and availability of after market accessories. I would strongly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a high capacity MP3 player.

<Title>Whatpod?
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Creative has designed and produced a truly amazing product that does an incredible job handling audio and video.  I was lucky enough to have recieved this as an anniversary gift two months ago. I am actually listening to a Beethoven symphony on my player as I write this review.  I listen to mp3s encoded at average bitrates of 192-320 kbps and am able to store an average of 4 to 5 thousand tracks.  This works out to about 300-400 complete cds.  I currently have 4058 tracks on 304 albums stored and still have 2.7 gigs of free memory.  I also have all of the album art for these albums plus many personal photos stored in the player.  For a normal human that is not as [...]about sound quality and encodes at 128-160 kbps, I imagine the number of tracks you could store on the player would easily rise to 5-6 thousand.  Now realistically, that is more music than one would need to be carrying around with them, but hey, ISN"T THAT COOL!!!  Sound quality is sparkling.  I'm an audiophile nutcase and have not had any complaints, but remember that you need a good set of earphones.  The player comes with a basic set but they just don't cut it in my opinion.  Check out the Creative Aurvana or other quality inner ear earphones.  I use the in ear headphones to travel and walk around with the unit.  I sometimes plug in my Sennheiser HD 600 over-the-ear headphones but find that the player lacks a little power to drive those.  A solution is a headphone volume booster that you can find at Radio Shack or elsewhere.  Video playback is amazing.  The screen size is generous and the colors and resolution are much better than I would've imagined from a portable player of this kind.  Some things to consider:  I'm not crazy about the user interface but found that I have adapted.  I turned down the sensitivity on the touchpad and found that this helped but it will take time for some to get comfortable with the interface.  GET A CASE!!!!!!!:  The unit (at least my black one) scratches easily.  I purchased the leather case with the kickstand and screen protector that is available from Amazon and have found that to be very good although I have to remove the player from the case to sync and charge as the cover prevents the unit from being plugged in securely.  Navigating is a little tricky with the case but the alternative of a marred and scratched unit is definity not preferable in my opinion.  Overall I am VERY happy and have started to rediscover my music collection.  I would recommend this player to anyone that wants to have an awesome gadget that stands out from the masses of IPODs out there.

<Title>Feelin' the Zen
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my Zen a few days ago. I love it. I had originally intended to purchase an iPod, but stumbled apon the Zen in the process. After reading comparision reviews from several sites, I decided on the Zen.  It has a fantastically clear LCD screen that makes its 2.5in screen seem much bigger. The slightly thicker size of the Zen is actually a "plus" for me, as it makes it less slippery and I worry less about crushing it. I find the set up and touch pad very easy to use and find that the files are organized very well. The sound quality is excellent (I use my own headphones). Uploading songs, pictures and video is extremely easy and quick. I also love that you can set a picture as your background, which is just neat. The only complaint I have is that the Zen did not come with a wall charger and, as the first step in the manual is to charge the player via the wall charger, I find it's absence ridiculous. You can, however, charge the player through your computer USB port. Overall, I love my Zen and would never choose anything else.

I've watched several tv shows on my vacation, using only a small fraction of the hard disk space. The only downside is that (for the -1 star) it's touchpad is quite difficult to navigate with. This is one area where Ipod is definitely much better.

<Content>Player offers more features than most on market: Music (in a number of formats), Video, Pictures, Radio, and Voice Recorder. I have not yet used the calander/address book function. WARNING: If you have not already found out, Creative does not include an ac/dc power adapter as of July 2006. While I thought I was getting a $30 price break on my Zen, it was really due to the abscence of the $30 adapter. Charging with a USB port reportedly takes up to twice as long as with a wall adapter. Also note that as of this time the Zen Vision:M does not work with Mac OS X -- no file transfer, no battery charge. Overall, good product!

<Title>Top-notch alternative to iPod
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you're an anti-iPoder like me, it's quite a relief to find an alternative brand that either beats or equals the iPod in nearly every way.  I've had it for about three weeks now and am incredibly satisfied.  I just wanted to echo the sentiments others have made in the comments.    Key points to consider, in comparison to an iPod:  - the Zen is sturdier and doesn't scratch easily (compared to the silver back of an iPod/the black iPod).  I accidentally dropped it on the floor and there's not a mark on it. Amazing.  Also, with the matte back and finish on the front, my player has absolutely no smudges.  - it's a little bigger, width-wise, than the iPod, but for me it helps me feel like I won't break it.  It's the perfect size and weight, I think.  - Everyone was right: the colors you get on screen are amazing. You really are going to get a better viewing experience on this one.  The touch pad takes getting used to, an included AC adapter would be nice (but the USB charger isn't bad, either), and you can't put mp4 videos on it (aka: any videos you get from iTunes, which def. sucks... but you can put any other video type on there), but if you don't mind those small things (and really it's a matter of preference), the Zen is fabulous.

I now officially love the player, but it was a rocky start. The first player I received from Amazon had a "firmware problem". Creative tech support was very accessible but obviously unsuccessful at solving the problem. Amazon was great, they exchanged it without any hassle, and even sent me a replacement by 2 day mail. So the second one arrives and it keeps freezing up-Creative diagnosed a "hardware" problem. The tech support person talked me into sending it to them for warrenty repair. After I sent it off, I had great doubts-shouldn't I just have demanded my money back and bought an I-Pod? But, I really wanted to buck the trend and I wanted an FM radio. It took almost 2 weeks, but I got a new Zen player back, and it worked from the moment I plugged it in. I had very carefully packed up all the parts in the original packaging, and got the player back in bubble wrap and styrofoam peanuts-and missing the ear buds. However, the sound is wonderful, both the radio and the albums I've loaded sound great, and after getting used to the controls, it's pretty easy to use. I'm using Grado headphones, and they are incredible, highly recommended. I have deducted a star for the rocky start, but now I do like the player. The Creative software is fine, and they also include 2 alternative systems for organizing the music. I haven't bothered.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second Creative Zen mp3 player, I had the Zen Xtra Jukebox 30gb player, and I liked it, though it was a bit big.  This is absolute perfection, I've had it for 3 months now and cannot find any faults with it.  My son has an Ipod that he loves, though he will come to look at mine every now and then. It was easy to transfer data from my old player to my new one even!

<Title>Player does not put me in ZEN mode
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this product in February 06 so I can pretty much state I been through the wars with this. This product might be great if you do not have a lot of music, but if you do. The player locks up to much for me, and customer service is no help after 60 days after purchase. The will charge you for technical support, more than 12 dollars. For the amount of money paid for this it should be a little more stable. You can not skip tracks too often with it(or locks up). You can only transfer 512 mbs to the player or you're MP3's get corrupted and then you have reformat you're player. Pretty much you can just turn it on and let it play or it will lock up on you. I would suggest you don't buy this player if you're looking for something, like I was to carry all your MP3's.   Simple put this player should have been better then it is. Save you're money buy a cheaper one and load you're MP3's and play lists as needed. Otherwise you will be annoyed by this and it will not be money well spent.

<Title>Pretty Much Awesome
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all this is my first iPod-like device, so take that for what it's worth.    Overall, I love this thing.  I use it to watch video and listen to mp3s while working out.  I'll start by listing my pet peeves, because I think that will be the most helpful approach for you, the potential buyer, to determine if you want one of these or not:  1) "Touchy" navigation - working your way through menus on this thing while you're on a treadmill or stair stepper can be quite challenging.  Most frustrating is trying to turn the volume up or down while you're running.  You do this by using the "vertical touchpad" in the middle, imagine trying to use the touchpad on your laptop while running and you'll get the idea.  2) Video codec hell - well, it's not quite hell, but you might have to do some work to get your videos on this thing if you got those videos off bittorrent.  Sometimes it thinks a video requires no conversion and transfers it, but then you can't actually play it on the device, sometimes it simply can't convert videos, sometimes you have to download a codec (but it won't tell you that, you just have to figure it out on your own).  Putting DVDs on it isn't too bad though, just do a websearch and you'll find some walkthroughs.  It does support Xvid and Divx so at least there is the possibility that you can watch some of your videos without conversion - a possibility that does not exist for several other portable video players.  3) Requires an annoying adaptor to connect it to USB or A/C.  I really don't understand this adaptor, you should be able to plug a USB A-to-B cord right into the device; anything else is simply retarded.  I've got USB A-to-B cables everywhere - at work, in my laptop bag, next to my desktop computer - but they're useless if I don't have this damn adaptor with me.    4) It's a bit heavy.    So those are my pet peeves.  I could list all the great things about the ZEN Vision:M, but that's what the enormous product description up above did already, so you don't need me to tell you that it has an excellent signal-to-noise ratio.  I highly recommend it in spite of these minor nuissances.  But if any of these annoyances is a deal-breaker for you, look elsewhere.  Or wait another 6 months for the next wave of products.

<Title>IPOD has met its match
<Date>Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With the release of the Zen Vision M, Ipod finally has met its match. I have had this for 2 months now and have been very impressed, I found when I was travelling I was viewing video's and photo's a lot and the AMAZING screen of the Vision M made this all the more enjoyable. I was very cloes to buying an Ipod but the superior battery life, screen and FM tuner swung me towards Zen.   There are some trade-offs however, Ipod had more accessories, better software, looks cooler, and can be used with PC's and Apple whereas the Zen can really only be used for PC's :(   Overall I am very impressed with the Vision M

<Date>Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player works very well. It has many features that I wanted and was for a good price.  The only problem I have with the player is that it supports mp4 in .avi but not in .mp4 file format. Thats not a big issue though. The software that comes with the player is not bad either though. If you plan on putting long video files on here and will be fast forwarding or rewinding it may take you awhile and i do have to reset the player about once a week usually less thoguh.

<Title>Not the perfect MP3 / jpeg / video player... but getting close
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a wholeheckofalot of research into my new mp3 player, I finally decided on this little beauty. First, I must declare that I have never owned an Ipod, so my evaluation between the two would be inaccurate. I can only report my opinions over my prior unit, a Megaview 566, which I thought was the 20gb bomb.   The downside - (1) I got the black, because it was the most masculine color. Black does scratch easy! Before even opening it up, order a $5 "best skin ever" product off of the internet. Easy to install (like a clear film, not just for the screen, but the entire front acryllic top. Very nice and very effective)  (2) the built in battery; C'mon creative! If it lasts 2 years, I won't have a problem with it.  The upside, and there are many - (1) Playlist creation. You can create and manage playlists at will on the computer. (2) Custom 5-band EQ setting; most manufacturers only give you preset EQs (3) Volume levelling on all tracks. A VERY welcome feature when your first track is recorded at a lower level, say Bad Company, then the next random track comes on, say Chris Brown or Nelly, and wham, you may have blown your speakers. This feature itself almost sold me on the purchase. (4) A undocumented treat - let's say you were listening to a list of songs, maybe 200 of your favorite hits, and you are at no 45 in the list, either random or in sequence. You shut of the unit in the middle of song 45 and leave the unit to do your chores. You come back, turn it on and magically...its right where you left off in the middle of song 45! No more going thru your playlist to pick up where you left off. It has a bookmark function for those longer, audio books, but I think that should only be used when you intentionally leave the playlist/track you are in when you turn it off, or to do something else like watch a video or play some photograph slideshows...which itself is pretty cool. Even add music to your slideshow...now thats just too much. Ok, I love mine.   So, after only owning it one week, I absolutely love this thing. Not only is it my mobile media source, I take it with me in the car, thru the aftermarket stereo input. I think this thing is fantastic. My next attempt, if it works, will put it way over the edge. The A/V cable that I had for my megaview (an all-in-one A/V from 2.5mm plug to RCA jacks - creative's cable is optional with this unit) may just integrate entirely into my aftermarket DVD player with the supplied accessory 'base'...if the Vision:M screen can be shown on the dash, I will be ecstatic.

<Title>Well worth it
<Date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little device has become my new best friend.  I did a lot of research and went back and forth before I decided the Zen player really has everything I want.  I've had it for 2 months now and have loaded about 500 songs, 100's of pictures and a few videos.  It has only frozen up on me once, and I do use it everyday.  The music playback is excellent, it's like hearing some of these songs for the first time as I now hear little things I hadn't before.  The video playback is fantastic, for such a small screen it really delivers beyond what I thought it would.  I bought the black as I just didn't like the other colors, but BUY A CASE BEFORE YOU TAKE IT WITH YOU.  Seriously this thing will scratch if you look at it wrong.  I bought a Kroos case and really like it.  Ok, 2 things I didn't like, One is it DOES NOT come with a wall charger and it takes a loooong time to charge it with my computer (a few hours) and Two, the battery life isn't really great which means after having with me at the office all day, I have to recharge it every night.  These, however are small issues.  I could't recommend this MP3 player any higher.  It's a good investment.

<Title>VERY IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT CREATIVE HDD PLAYERS
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>recently brought a Zen vision and when I got it home I was very happy with it. One of the reasons I got it was because I travel a lot in my job and I am often on a plane. On my first journey, the pilot turned off the seatbelts sign and told us we can now use approved portable electronic devises. When I tried to boot my Zen it would not boot so i thought it was damaged. When I was back on the ground I tried the player again and it was fine. very odd. This behavior was reproduced on my next 4 flights so I contacted creative and this was there response:  In regards to your issue with the player booting into recovery mode whenever you reach an altitude of 15,000ft. That is to be expected. The hard drive heads do not have enough air pressure to float. Sorry for any inconvience. All of our hard drive based players will have the same result. Our flash drive based players wont have this result they will work just fine in the air.   I hate to say this but if you ever want to use your MP3/PVP player at altitude, stick to an iPOD

<Content>The young techies suggested this over the Ipod so I bit.  First day downloading CD's was great, easy. Day 2...corrupted database, unable to load database or audio CD. Support is a Miami # so you pay per minute.  On hold 27 minutes only to be told my Zen created a microsoft database problem that they won't or can't help with.  Knew exactly what the problem was but wanted me to solve it by searching their discussion forums but still wanted me to buy the $59.99 1 year add'l tech support. To pay per minute and get no help...I don't think so.  Found the forum and all I had to do was do a microsoft update and problem solved.  Forget the tech support.  Other users actually alerted their techs who refuse to give you the answer even though their product created the problem.  I'm back to loving it but only because of you users who take the time to tell the rest of us how to solve Zen problems.  Thanks.  Forget techs and keep the forum discussions going.  We users CAN solve our own problems and save $59.99.

<Title>Better than I thought
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Vision M is better than I thought it would be. When I was looking for a new mp3 player. (Dropped the last one) I first thought about getting an ipod. But then after realizing how good my last one was I decided to get another Creative product. Good move! This one is as good, if not better. Just like the Creative Media Player you can watch videos and listen to music, only this one you can play a lot more video (120 hrs when compared to the 2 that I had with the Zen) and the picture is much crisper than before.   Now as far as the software goes, I haven't tried it. Why not? Because just like any other Creative MP3 player you don't need to load the softwear into your computer. Just plug it in and turn on your windows media player and follow the simple instructions. When I plugged mine in the first time the media player registered it and then asked me if I wanted to synch all my music/vids into my player. One click and 1 hr later I had filled my Zen Vision M. So for those of you with softwear problems, do yourself a favor. Remove the softwear from your computer. It's a lot eaiser to use the media player.   For those who use napster or limewire or any other music subscription service this thing works just as well. Just register and your done. And you don't need to pay extra for it either.   As far as accessories go the Zen Vision M has a lot more than The Zen Media player. I suggest you purchase some of them because they're awesome!! Especially the leather case which will protect your Zen Vision M alot better than the skin. It will even protect the screen.   Hopefully after reading this review you will purchase the Zen Vision M. It's worth the money!!

<Title>Poor Volume Control 
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Maybe I have a lemon, but I find the volume control on this unit to be absolutely aatrocious.  Sound...fine, video...fine, actually, everything is fine EXCEPT the volume control.  I have had the unit about 8 months now and had I known how difficult it is to control the volume, I would NEVER have bought this unit.  It seems remarkably stupid to make what is primarily an audio device and put such poor volume controls on it.  But maybe you won't find it as irritating as I do.

<Content>Even though it's a little more exspensive, and a little heavier and thicker than the Ipod, the zen vision m is a great deal better.  The screen is clearer, and brighter when playing movies.  The zen vision M works on any computer with out needing a specific program.  It can work like a portable hardrive on anyone's computer with out needing special software.  The battery lasts about 15 hours of music playing.  I think this mp3 player is definately the best on one the market.

<Title>Fantastic.
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I played around with my friend's 30gb Ipod and thought it was okay. But what turned me off is the restrictiveness of Itunes. I know now that there are programs to override that but I'm lazy. Also for as long as I can remember I've only heard good things about Creative players. So I decided to give the Creative Zen Vision:M a try.   I've had it for a few months now and I have to say that it is a great little device. The controls really are intuitive and if they aren't then I can't imagine that they'd take long for you to get used to. One problem is that when you're walking around and you want to raise or lower the volume you sometimes have to pull it out of your pocket to see what you're doing. A tiny tap of of touch sensitive will pull up another screen. Luckily it's only with the touch sensitive that this is the case(and when listening you'll only use the pad for volume). All other controls are great and it has a neat button to send you straight to random all play of your whole library or you can change the button to jump straight to several different uses.  The interface for adding to the player is very simple. You can either use the software that you're given to add to it, or you can do without.  Adding songs is easy and it groups them well as long as you make sure the tracks are labled properly. If you don't know how to do it you just right click a music file and select "properties" and then "summary." Then just label your track how you want it to appear on your player. You can also highlight all the songs in an album and repeat above steps to group label albums and artists. I suggest you check every album and song you put in your player or you'll end up with some "Unknown" in your library.  The display is AMAZING. No joke, way better than Ipod. Even Ipod fan friends of mine gave oohs and ahs when they saw it. Vibrant. Sharp. Beatiful. It also has a pretty large screen for a good viewing area. Some complain about any mp3 video device being to small to watch movies on, but I myself have zero problem watching an entire motion picture on it.  Creative says battery life is something like 14 hrs of audio and 4 hrs of video. I tested it and got more like 11 or twelve hours for audio and have yet to test video. But one thing to keep in mind, which I never thought about, is always WAY less due to tinkering and clicking around. When I'm bored I'll just skip around and listen to some of this and then some of that. Doing that absolutely drains the battery like crazy. Goes down to about 6 or seven hours is what I would guess. This is probably the case for all players, but it was something that disappointed me. Of course that isn't such a problem for video since you're not tinkering around, only watching. For car trips you might want to pick up a car charger.  My M didn't come with a wall charger and due to it not being an Ipod I was absolutely unable to find one specifically for it in a short notice. It also has some block on it that won't allow just any charger to work on it and it definitely won't allow any other USB charger but its own. I needed a wall charger for a three week trip I was taking so I scoured the net and saw that many claimed that PSP chargers work. I bought one and sure enough it worked like a charm. They're also cheaper than Creative's and you can buy them at Best Buy. Do yourself a favor before you go running everywhere trying to match up a generic charger: Just go buy a PSP Sony brand charger. Save yourself some frustration.  One downside is the sound. While when you can figure out settings to make a song sound AMAZING and DEEP, this might not be a good setting for a song by a different artist in a different genre. Doesn't make it sound bad, just not as it should. Luckily it's easy to navigate to the sound area that has several different EQ settings to choose from. This player also gets very loud. Louder than expected and louder than necessary and louder than is healthy for a person. You really won't listen to it at full blast - even when walking through a crowded college campus.  Another plus is you can use a portion of the device as a removable storage device.  I hate earbuds and that's what the M comes with. I have some small Sony ear-phones for walking around in and those 15 dollar Sony wrap-arounds that you find everywhere for other times. The sony street style phones are in no way top of the line; However, they're cheap, they sound pretty good, and they'll last you forever. I sleep with them every night and end up laying on them and rolling over them and smashing them, but they're flexible and last me about 6 months. I seriously mean every night of my life. Do yourself a favor and pick them up.   It also has FM radio which is a huge plus. It gets great reception. Better than the sony boombox in my room. Very crisp and clear and easy to make presets. Only negative there is that you can't listen to the radio and navigate the player at the same time. When you leave the radio screen the radio shuts off.  The microphone that records sound is actually really good. I tested it during class one day and it clearly picked up the teacher from a good 30 feet away. However, this feature is pretty much of no use to me.  Also for a cover I would suggest the Silicone Kroo Skin. You can get it here on Amazon [...]. So overall this is a great player with just a few flaws. Recap on flaws: Battery life is massively lowered when you're clicking around in the player while it's playing. Actually that's about the only major problem I have with it and would assume that this is inherent in all players.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you're looking for a heavy duty player. Remember: 30 gbs so only get this if you are seriously addicted to music and have a crudload of it to store on it and not just for something to listen to during workouts. Also look for a flash drive player if you're just looking for something small to get you through the day. This guy ends to feel slightly bulky when in your pocket.   So that's it. This review is massive and ridiculous and probably a bit late but here it is.

<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My whole family has ipods, and each of them have a problem with them.  So before i bought an mp3 i decided instead of the ipod, i should try the creative zen vision M.  I was so impressed with the quality of it.  It is so much easier to use then the ipod.  The video quality of the zen is better then the ipod, pretty much every single feature is better then the ipod.  But the zen also has extra features that the ipod doesnt have such as radio, voice recorder, calender, organizer, contact lists, and my favorite feature of the zen is the choice of background.  Right now i have a picture of Angelina Jolie on my background and all my friends with ipods are jealous.  I'm telling you right now, the IPOD will die soon, so stick or even try the Creative Zens, they are amazing.

<Content>*** This is not a review of the player but a comment on Amazon's review ***  What's up with the comment in your review:  qte: Amazon Unbox Integration To be truly successful, the Vision:M has to be more than a great media device, it has to integrate with Amazon Unbox   THIS IS SO MUCH BS AND SELF PROMOTION PROPAGANDA!  So if this, or any, device had the best sound quality, the best video quality, most memory, perfect ease of use and was truly the best invention since the wheel BUT didn't integrate with YOUR software then it would be doomed to failure and be rated as 'not a great media device'  I'm sorry but you need to REVIEW THE PRODUCT and not stick in your coy little self promoting BS.. or you need to just STFU!  I'm sorry, I like Amazon, but this comment on your reviews is so INAPPROPRIATE! Users, potential buyers, also known as Amazon CUSTOMERS want info about a device's quality. If you feel the need to comment on a device's ability, or lack thereof, to integrate easily with your other money making ventures then please feel free to do so. but DO NOT label a device based on it's ability to make you even more money!  Deeply disappointed in you guys!

<Title>Everyone else is smoking something
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is one of the most ill-conceived products I have ever seen. It is a huge leap backwards from the Zen Xtra jukebox of mine that just died.  First of all, the management software does not support Windows 2000 - still one of the most commonly used OS's.  I had to use Windows media player and Musicmatch jukebox to copy over my library, which took all night.    The main problem, however, is how tracks are sorted within albums and the selected list.  Even with track numbers in the tags, this player will display a 00 track number and ONLY sort tracks alphabetically.  If you want to listen to your tracks in the same order that they are on the CD, you have to MANUALLY prepend the track title with the track number in the ID tag.  For a 15 GB library (which I have), this is totally unacceptable, yet is what creative told me to do.  This may not be an issue for some users, but if you listen to classical music, which I do, it makes the player completely unusable.  Take Beethoven's 5th symphony - the names of the four movements are not necessarily in order alphabetically, so creative would basically force me to listen to the symphony in a messed up order.  I've long been a fan of creative, choosing my previous player from them over iPod, but I returned my Vision:M last night and got the equally priced 30 GB iPod.  Get the iPod.

<Title>Creative giveth and then taketh away
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I normally would have (and was considering doing so) reviewed the Vision:M and given it four or five stars... It's that nice of a machine!  Nicely machined, nicely crafted, excellent ergonomics.   But, I just updated my firmware on my Vision:M for compatibility with the docking station I bought from Creative, ostensibly designed for the Vision:M, who knew it would require the upgrade for firmware?!?   I started the firmware upgrade and was browsing the release notes for what this new firmware brought.  There were standard "improvements", but the  very last line, the very last note said: This firmware removes your ability to record FM!

<Title>It truley is a vision to see and have
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have ever owned. Even though this is my first I have seen many different ones through friends and different stores but never had a need to get one. Eventually as I started burning more cd's I started to see how having one would really help. It wipes out that choice of having to pick the best songs to burn on a cd for the car or have a select few. Now you can carry your whole music collection in the palm of yoru hand. This player is very touch sensitive but responds like clock work. Very easy to use and it now comes in 60 Gigs. The software that comes with it is actually easier to use than using windows media player 10 or others. I have video clips to music videos on it and the picture is crystal clear. It can also Play the radio, record sound, act as a daily planner/organizer, store documents, download online and more. It dosent come with a Dc power plug but you can charge through your Usb port in the meantime. These things will get better and more sophisticated over time im sure. Overall I think its a good alternetive to the Ipod if your looking for a good mp3 player with quality and quantity.   Get it!!

<Title>This MP3 player will delight and infuriate you
<Date>Thu Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's been 2 years since I bought an MP3 player from Creative's 'Zen' line, and with the huge advancements made over the span of this time, I decided that it was time for a new upgrade.  Naturally, after doing a bit of research, upgrading to the next series in line seemed the way to go (and so I did).    The Creative Vision: M, upon inspection when I recieved it, was a quantom leap ahead of its predecessor.  Its smaller, sleeker, more beatiful and functional.  The Vibrant 2.5' LCD dominate iPOD video's with its slightly-larger size and more vibrant/numerous color pallete.  As of this time, I didnt have any vidoes I wanted to transfer, but I was amazed at the "commercials" that Creative packed in with this MP3 player (just why Creative would decide to put in commercials advertising a product you've arleady bought is a complete mystery altogether).    Setting this player up and Sync'ing it with Windows Media player was a snap.  For those 'not-in-the-know', sync'ing your player to your computer basically means that your 'My Music' 'My Pictures' folders on your PC will be duplicated and put in your Zen Vision, and any future changes you make in your PC will be reflected in the Zen Vision whenever you sync up to it.  Of course, my only gripe about the sync'ing process is the time it takes do to it.  I would be more appreciative if Creative gave us a Firewire outlet because it would have made the transfer of data much quicker.    Now that I've got all the good stuff out of the way, you're probably wondering why I gave this MP3 3 stars instead of 5.  Well... its not so simple, but if you want to wittle down my biggest complaint about the Zen Vision: M its the user Interface.  It sucks.  Horrendously.  Creative tried to take what's good about the iPOD interface (the 'clicky' wheel) and simplify it even further.  The result is instead of having to twirl your fingers around the wheel, you simply move it in an up-down fashion, and when you want to make a selection slide your thumb to the left-or-right in the middle of the touch-sensitive area.    Right idea... wrong execution.  The Amazon review pointed out that this results in your accidently 'playing' songs when you want to simply navigate through menus, or vise-versa.  It happens far more often then they mention.  There's also a problem with the fireware where navigating 'down' didnt feel as smooth as navigating 'up'.  All these issues combine to make a world of headache for those trying to navigate through hundreds of songs that they've uploaded into their player.  I dont understand why Creative didnt just use a mouse-wheel scroller instead, because it would have been far less combersome (even though some would have considered it less 'elegent').  Screw that, give me functionability over 'elegeance' anyday of the week.    So really, if you can get over the aweful navigational touch-pad, then I whole-heartedly recommend this over an iPOD.  Its music quality, LCD are much better.  If you absolutely think you cannot (and you dont care that much about the stuff I mentioned above), and you can afford to wait a little longer, then buy the 80 gigabyte iPOD instead.  Yes, we all hate Steve Job's as much as the next guy, and as much as we'd like to see iPODs stanglehold of the market released, we can all admit that in part its because they actually test their products out on people for more then a week before its released.

<Title>Very Customizable Excellent Player
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In order to use this Creative Zen Vision M (Any color) MP3 Player. You Must have Windows XP (supports nothing eles), Windows media player 10 (doesn't support beta 11 & Wont work). Only a copy of windows XP Will reconize your Zen vision M player when you try to connect it by usb. It only has a Windows XP Driver (for reconizing zen vision m mp3 player hardware. As of today theres no way around this.   The arrival- (Package Items)  I receive this in a new smaller package which doesn't include the ac adaptor anymore like amazon.com and creative said.  Out of the Box (Picked a 'Black Vision M player)it has a 'Screen Protector' install on the high definition lcd screen. It came also with a 'USB Mini-B Cable Wire', a nice 'light brown white kinda looking Pouch', Very nice sounding 'Creative earbuds' (But if you have headphones thats a $10 vaule or more it sounds really excellent without using the equalizer settings). 'Sync Adaptor' that you connect from the bottom of the player that has 3 inputs: USB 2.0, DC IN 5V and AV out. A 'Installation CD' With a couple of Creative program that does everything you need (Recommend installing it in order to take 'Full advantage' of operating your player. And it comes with Windows Media Player 10.  Operating First Time - (To Do First!) So out of the box, you charge it using the usb and sync adaptor(6-7Hours Complete charge).  Don't bother turning it on, just plug in to charge (to pc or adaptor, which ever you have). It wasn't charge when I try to use it. You will have to charge it yourself (you can use the PSP 'playstation ac adaptor' to charge it, which is what i and alot others do directly into the DC IN 5V input of the sync adaptor) (2Hour Complete Charge). A battery icon will blink along with a lighten bolt on the lcd screen(top right of screen) and a blue light on top of the player will blink.   A Steady blue light (on top of player) and blue full battery bar on your screen will show that its done.  Now go and install the software. if you want to fully using everything in the player, install everything off cd (you can always uninstall the programs you wont use).  Using the player- (Must know)  The 4 lights around the scroll touch pad are buttons (use them! lol). It took me forever to notice i can press them. Top left shourtcut key,Top right play/pause, Bottom left Back, Bottom Right Options. Then two left and right arrounds backa nd fourth, Top Edge touch pad and down for going up and down or tap it and middle for selection or right arrow button.  So go and adjust the sensitive scroll pad to 'Low' under System-Player settings-Touch pad. It does take skills to navigate without messing up.  Last thing. Incase it freeze on you for what ever reason. Hold the off switch on top of the player left, while holding left insert a paper pin under the player to hit the reset button inside of the player, then release. This will bring you to the bios where you select rescan. don't format or eles you lose everything. Rescan and boot back up and booya your set.  I took the time to write this because none of this is in the manual I had to go to there (creative) support forums to ask alot of questions. I plan to buy the white zen too!

<Title>IMPORTANT: Read for a very recent update to the machine
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I go into the whole review, I'd like to mention that recently the RIAA has forced Creative to take out the feature to be able to record music from the radio. With justifiable reasons being that it embraces file sharing, leaked songs, and access to record copyrighted material. There are still plent of features in the machine that make it worthwhile, but it is important to note that if you have read other reviews before this one.  PROS: -Sleek, elegant finish - strong lines -Innovative design - not as sophisticated as the iPod, but very beautiful -BRIGHT, VIVID SCREEN - viewing angles are week, but very on par with the iPod -Fast transfer speed - Great -Oodles of file support - Pictures, Audio, Video, Supscription, it does it all pretty much -Customizable - menus are very customizable using images and colors of your choice -FM Tuner, Voice Record - integrated microphone -Great sound quality - on par with the iPod -Battery Life - on audio it's mediocre... I got about 12/13 hours from it. Video is actually pretty good, running close to 4 hours. I got two movies in before it died.  CONS: -Thicker than the iPod -Battery is no longer removable -Feels clunky -Scratches easily -Not as elegant as the iPod -FM Recording was taken away -Vertical scroll not appealing to some  BOTTOM LINE: Not an iPod killer, but great MP3 player none the less. If you are very anti-Apple or are looking for a Windows-based MP3 player, this is a great one. Drag and drop is nice, and is a strong rival of the iPod until the Zune hits the market next month!

<Title>A Nifty PVP That Puts the Hurt On The iPod - but with a new caveat - *READ*
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked this up earlier this summer after audtioning it from a friend. Great player, superb video display resolution, and tons of nifty features including customizable wallpaper backgrounds, a personal scheduler, and more. The accompanying software simplifies synching the player with your pc and transferring media files is a snap. There is also decent file support for a good number of video formats and an included FM tuner.  NOW - on that last note, I must detail a very recent development in regards to the FM Tuner feature of which I sincerely hope Creative reverses. In the past week, the latest firmware while adding a number of small improvements to the player, actually CRIPPLES a feature that was originally advertised with this player - the ability to record and save FM Radio broadcasts.  Now, I have never used this feature to date but in the past I worked in broadcasting and am something of a broadcasting enthusiast. One of the things I enjoy doing is sampling the local radio environments of different places I visit. Having this ability in the Zen Vision M is a nice plus. However, for reasons yet known and unclear, the latest firmware actually disables this function.  I find this highly suspect and am baffled. Why would this function be taken away when it was one of the advertising points of the product at purchase? IF this has ANYTHING to do with the meddling of the RIAA, allow me to emphasize that last I checked here in the United States, it is completely LEGAL  to make such recordings for home/personal usage. I noticed in the posting previous to mine that the poster mentioned this development also - seemingly mistaken that Creative was warranted in appeasing the RIAA's wishes.   Again, if this was the underlying motive, I will assert that it is MY RIGHT to make such recordings for personal use. And *NOT* the right of the RIAA nor Creative to take it away!   I noticed that Creative quickly withdrew the latest firmware of which I sincerely hope they re-release with the FM Recording function enabled. Even though I have yet to use this function, I have a number of trips up and coming of which I plan to employ the recording function for terrestial based radio. I WANT it intact Creative and I implore you to maintain it. If this serves as a capitulation to the greedy whims of such entities like the RIAA and ilk, I really WILL NOT buy from such a company in the future. And if this ever oppressive and tightening noose around the proverbial neck of the consumer continues to tighten in such a fashion, you can be assured I will ultimately do without.  I spent $300 on this product - Creative, I want what I paid for. leave the FM Recording function ALONE.   I will maintain the 4 star review on the sole grounds of the sheer quality and overall excellency of this product. But will revise it if Creative does not restore the FM Recording feature.

<Title>Great MP3 and PVP Player
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Creative Zen Vision M is a great player.  The software works excellent for me.  It will sync a song a second, so when i put on 1000 songs and went to the bathroom, boom it was done.    -The video is extremely amazing.  Crystal clear with great sound.  I did have some problems trying to sync avi files, some work and some don't.  It all worked out, just convert them to wmv9, has dvd quality, takes up some space, music video will be 25 mb, but its 30 gb, you got room to spare.  Although some videos try to come in widescreen on a 2.5 inch screen, which is annoying, you can click a button, fit to screen, problem solved.    -Navigating, the touch pad appears to be a hit and miss.  For me its a hit, i love it, just touch the bottom of the touch screen and fly through songs, easier than the ipod, no turning anything, don't even have to move your finger.  Volume control is made effortless with the touch screen, tap the top to go up a smidge or slide your finger to go up a lot, its awesome.   -Reason why I didn't give it 5 stars:  Size, when you first get it, it doesn't seem to bad, put it next to the ipod, its almost 3 times as deep.  So it doesn't seem very ellegant.  The buttons can be hard to press, so sometimes you can't use your pinky to press options, which requires lifting your other hand.  The black version, it gets so dirty, mine hasn't scratched, but i stick it in my pocket, and you see all the fuzzy's.  I have a protective sleeve with screen protector, still get fuzzies, but no scratches.  Make sure you get an ac charger, it will take an hour and a half to charge it fully compared to about 7 hours via usb.    - Bottom Line, fairly equal with the ipod, besides its size and the million features, better video with radio.  If you want something that can do everything the zen can, but be more elegant and slim, get The Gigabeat, or wait for the zune.  Overall, very good mp3 player.

<Content>I received Creative Zen Vision Black today. It's more beautiful than I thought. The sound is great and the movie and the picture are so clear. It's pity that I don't have AC adapter so I have to use USB to charge my Zen. It took a long time before I could use it at the first time. The FM tuner is very good. I can listen to FM clearly.

<Title>Better than an iPod.
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the Creative ZenVision:M 30 GB MP3 and Video Player.  I have not owned an iPod, but from using friend's, I think the Creative player is much nicer to operate, and I like the features better.  It's much easier to place media (pictures, videos, and music) onto the player exactly where you want it, and how you want it displayed on the player itself.  I do have to say, the only problem I had with it was when I tried ripping CDs that were enhanced- using the Media Explorer, it wouldn't rip the last track off of these CDs, but using the MediaSource Organizer does allow it to rip.  I had to learn that the hard way.

<Content>The Creative Zen Vision:M 30GB MP3 and Video Player is an awesome product at a very affordable price. Being at the same price as the 30 GB iPod (here @ Amazon) it's quite challenging for some to choose among the two. After giving it a lot of thought I decided to go for this product since it has more features and its flaws (when compared to the iPod) are negligible.  What's better in the iPod? - thinner - more accesories  What's better in Zen? - microphone - FM tuner (integrated) - Support for more formats (music and video) - Support for more softwares (you don't need to use a specific software like iTunes)   Considering all these, I decided to choose the Zen Vision:M over the iPod and I'm very glad I did. It's an awesome product and you all should try it out ;)

<Title>Great Video Player
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PRO: Great Screen Quality: I do not want to look at my friends ipods screen after using it for a few months. Compatibility: Plays almost all kind of videos out there. So time is not wasted converting videos such as in the case of ipod (Keep in mind converting 60 minute video takes about 40 mintues). So if you want to watch videos than do not buy apple ipod  Con: Random Hands and Reset Pin: The player sometimes hangs and then you will need a really thin pin to reset it. Once i was travelling by an aeroplane and the player hanged. I had to spend the whole journey without mp3 music as i did not have a pin with me. Next time creative give a reset button.

<Title>Overall a better product, but in the minority.
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There came a time when everyone I knew started buying mp3 players, namely iPods, and I grew tired of carrying all my CDs around when they'd all had these little handheld things.  I broke down and faced the prospect of spending hundreds of dollars for such a device.  But what to pick?  Most everyone has an iPod.  In fact, Apple's iPod has what, 75%-85% of the market share?  This is for a reason...it must be good.  They look nice, and everything's geared towards them because they've the majority of the marketshare.  Accessories are good--though at Apple's high prices--and iTunes is a great player that gives access to all kinds of downloads.  However, when a product has such a majority of the marketshare, any other products who want to compete must be better to make up for that minority.  That means that Creative had to make their Zen that much better, because it's not popular.  They worked hard and gave it several features iPods can't offer, such as a FM player that gives you 32 preset slots, and the option to record off of it.  It's got a voice recorder too, and you should be able to record 100 hours or so.  It's battery life is also longer by a few hours.  It works with more formats for music and video, and you don't need a certain program to load music (like how iPods need iTunes.)  I didn't know anyone who had a Zen, so I couldn't play around with it.  But, thinking that I could be a pioneer to others, I took the chance and went with this Creative Zen Vision:M.  I don't regret it, in fact, I love it.  It is a little thicker, but I find that it fits in my hand better.  And it is a better product, too...in fact, it won overall best at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show.  But had someone I knew had a Zen, I'm not sure I'd have gone with it, and here's why:  Everyone has an iPod, for the most part.  That means that it's easier to share music and videos and files in general.  iTunes is great for getting things on your iPod.  My brother has an iPod and purchased a season of our favorite TV show from iTunes so he could get the current episodes as they're released, not having to wait until the season's done.  He put them on his iPod and watches them all the time.  I cannot, because Zen's can't support iTunes files--the one format they can't.  It's for reasons like this that having a majority of the market comes in handy, and that's why an iPod is nice.  Still, over all I am happy that I have a Zen--it is a better product.  I hope that considering these angles will help future buyers, and that my experience can help someone select for themselves an mp3 player they can be happy with investing in.

<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Zen Vision M, which I purchased about three weeks ago.  It is beautiful and has most of the features I could ever want.  I would have liked a little more flexibility with modifying the menu system, and an optical output would be a nice addition.  However the product works very well.  New users beware, however, that Creative recently modified firmware so that anyone with firmware 1.5 (I believe) and above will be unable to record directly from the FM.  Even current users who update their firmware will lose this ability.  Creative has apparently caved in to the music industry.  I feel betrayed by this company.  Think twice about whether you want to support them with your money.

I am very happy with my choice, in some reviews  people were saying that it was not possible to record from the Radio, I was happy 2 find the IT IS  possible to record from the radio , the volume control is fairly sensitive but if u put the lock on when using your player it is not a problem, the only down side is not having a charger that can b plugged in the wall, but if you have a PSP charger then that will work 2! I havent had it long enough 2 have any complaints other then I hope that Creative labs will come out with more protective covers and will consider a charger that is not overpriced !

<Content>My husband has the iPod. I got the Creative Zen awhile back because he was experiencing so many limitations with his iPod. I am SO glad I got the Creative Zen.  What's better in the iPod?  - thinner, more elegant appearance - more cool accesories like covers, docks, cases, etc.  What's better in Zen?  - Voice Recorder's awesome! and microphone  - FM tuner  - Almost any format if music or video file, very FLEXIBLE!!!  - HUGE 30GB hard-drive can really be used as a flash drive!!! YES! - Transport files to and from work using it as a flash drive - You don't need to use iTunes - Don't need iTunes to download photos to my Creative Zen  I have need to carry around over 500 photos and update them frequently. I needed a device more for photos than music, but wanted music too.  Creative Zen does the job. And I have my favorite CD's loaded. Using my USB cable, I am able to bring files back and forth from work on it. Ah, if it only had Wi-Fi!   Wishlist: - I wish it had an easy organizer - I'd toss my Palm T/X. - I wish it had Wi-Fi - again, I wouldn't need the Palm T/X.  Creative Zen is the way to escape from the Apple iPod prison of iTunes. It's a little thicker than my husband's 30GB iPod, but it feels more comfortable in my hand.  iPod's navigator wheel is a little easier to use.   My husband has a Palm LifeDrive and is wishing the Creative Zen could replace its functions so he could toss it.

<Title>A grrreat alternative to the iPod!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must say, I bought myself a Zen because a friend of mine was getting one, and when I saw what it could I was sold. Imagine getting Radio, Video, Photos, Microphone and of course, your ENTIRE music library on this handy little device. It was a great buy. I read somewhere that someone said that his Zen was giving problems at in a plane high altitudes. Well I travelled from Trinidad to New York and it worked like a charm during my flight. Also, the battery life is pretty decent. However I wish that the adapter (for AC, USB and AV) was integrated into the Zen. Video and photo quality is great. Just remember to organise your music library properly before loading your songs onto the Zen. I didn't and now I have a bunch of Unknown songs, songs without artist etc. Make sure to get the AC adapter if your player doesn't come with one. It cuts recharging time down by about half. One thing that I would like to have seen is a Search feature on the player itself, where I can type in the name of a Title and have the Zen search for it. May be in time :-)  Oh! One more thing. My frend bought the black Zen. The case at the back was white. What's up with that? Why couldn't it be all black?? However...all in all, a good buy. No regrets!

When I tried logging on to the Website to find a customer service link. That didn't exist. So next time I will buy an IPOD from a store where I can get " customer service " if need be. I have several friends with IPODS and they are all happy with the functionality and if something goes wrong there is a big retailer ready to stand behind the product. When I purchased the Zen, I thought I was saving $50.00 I was actually throwing away $260.00 because it doesn't work and there isn't a contact person to help me fix or reconfigure the program to make the Zen work again. So I threw it in the garbage last week. This weekend I'm off to P.C.Richards to get an IPOD.

<Title>iDitched my iPod for a Zen, Best Decision Ever
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, the bad: the surface scratches easily, so I would recommend that you buy a screen protector (tip: instead of buying "custom" protector for $15-20 per one set, buy a generic set and cut it to match: $5 for three that produce about 6 sets). It comes standard with only a USB cable as a way to charge it. There are not as many accessories for it as there are for the iPod yet. That's it, I do not have any other negative comments on the Zen M.  Now, the good: a ton and I have owned it for more than three months. The screen is ten times better that any screen I have seen on an iPod or any other mp3 player(I have owned two myself). After watching your first movie on it, you will swear that the resolution specs listed are wrong: the quality is unbelievable and watching a movie is a breeze, don't be fooled by the size.  The file formats: one thing that Apple does not necessarily advertise is the fact that they use proprietary formats; and the fact that you may need third party software to get YOUR OWN songs out of the iPod. The Zen M? No problem, this thing plays almost anything you throw at it and you can move the files anywhere you want. Oh yeah, you can use it as a portable hard drive too and have all of your precious spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc. on it.   The sound quality is excellent, even though I would recommend upgrading the headphones if you are picky. I also tested it with my Bose noise cancelling home set and this thing surpassed all my expectations.  The Zen M comes with several different desktop themes from which you can choose. Any picture that you store on the device can also be set up as the wallpaper. You can also create slideshows, rotate photos, zoom in, etc. The menus can be rearranged in almost any way you want and you can even remove items that you don't use from your main menu items.  The battery life blew my mind. During one week, I used it every day at work (not for the full 8-9 hours, mind you), watched a movie during two lunch breaks, and had juice left on Friday evening.  In short, I love it.

<Title>Great alternative to iPod
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If want a quality mp3 and video player or you just don't want to be a slave to Apple and iTunes, the Creative Zen is for you. I tried an iPod, not only did it fail to live up to the word of mouth, it failed to work with my brand new HP computer. The Zen Vision M has it all - great functionality, great style, great sound and great extras. It even has a calendar to sync with Outlook. Add to that easy syncing with the included software or with MediaPlayer and a dozen different download stores. You can't go wrong with the Zen.

The software is excellent (conversion, track name update per internet plus manual editing, complements Windows Media Player, mp3, WAV, wma, etc.), the interface is easy to learn, Records conversion for many hours on one charge, FM Radio, calendar, video screen is crisp and bright.  It can be converted as a logical hard drive with Windows Explorer compatibility.  Why buy the iPod when you can get all this without Apple's iTunes proprietary restrictions?

<Title>Love it!!!
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Zen Vision:M for several months now. I was disappointed to see that Creative no longer sells the charging cord with the unit anymore. When I bought mine, it came with it. I guess it was their only way to lower the price. Which is not fare. I've really enjoyed my Zen. The picture is outstanding for a small screen. As for listening to music, as long as you have a quality set of headphones/earbuds, the sound is very good. There is an ajustable equalizer, which is cool. I wish the 60gb was out along with the 30gb one. You'd think 30gb would be plenty but movies take a lot of room. If I didn't already have the 30gb one, I'd buy the 60gb. One con that others have talked about is how easy the screen scratches. If you do get one, get a screen protector as soon as possible.

<Title>More Bang for your Buck
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nowadays all people see is the ipod. There are more options for a great mp3 player out there. Some are even better than the ipod(it may be hard to believe, I know). The Creative Zen Vision M is one of these.   First of all, you have all the things that the ipod doesn't have. A screen of 262 thousand colors, an FM radio, a microphone and radio recorder, customizable backgrounds, innovative buttons, a great navigation system and much much more. The only features that are missing that you may be bummed about are the games(even though they do suck). With all these extra features how can you not love the Creative Zen vision.  You may be thinking that because of the extra weight and width it will be too thick and heavy. I also thought this before I purchased it, but after using it for less than a day, your worries will be washed away. The extra weight makes it seem more protected and more durable. With a silicone case on(look up Kroo silicone cases) compared to those thick cases for the ipod, you will notice the difference, and you will like the Zen Vision M better. (I saw a bunch of people saying how they loved it even though it was thicker. I did not believe them, but after trying it out myself I knew it was true.   If you are a lover of Itunes, unlike myself, you may not like the Creative's music system. However, if you are open to anything other than Itunes, then you will like Creative's software a lot. It's a drag and drop method which I personally enjoy a lot and I think it is a lot easier than Itunes. Putting songs and movies on there is a snap, as easy or easier than Itunes.   After watching movies and seeing the gorgeous screen of the Zen Vision M, I knew that this piece of technology was better than the Ipod. Movies come in crisp and clear with perfect brightness and contrast. The sound of the movies and songs are excellent. You can even adjust the EQ settings to which you prefer. There several presets and you can even make your own custom settings. Creative once again proves that it's a great producer of good sound quality.   I recommend this mp3 player after more than two months of using it. Being both an Ipod and Zen owner, I have experienced the full quality of both. If you are into complete simplicity, then this might not be the right player for you. However, if you can handle something a little more complicated, better looking and sounding, and with software different from Itunes, then the Creative Zen Vision M is perfect for you.

<Title>Thrilled with my Zen Vision
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is a breath of fresh air compared to my previous MP3 player, the Samsung "Napster" YP-910. I felt justified in buying a new player when my Dell Inspiron laptop would not recognize my Samsung.  The first thing that struck me was the beautiful, colorful display.  After many months, the fun of using it has not worn off.  Although I didn't expect to store pictures and videos on it, I have found it a nice feature that I have been using. You can also store contacts and calendar data, and store other data files.   Since I've only had the one crummy player to compare to, I can tell potential buyers what features I enjoy now with the Zen vision that my old player did not offer:    - Allows deletion of unwanted songs/files from within the player (my old player required the Napster or WMP software to do this).  You can also give star ratings to songs on the player as they play.  - Works with a number of music programs, besides the software that shipped with it.  It works with Media Monkey, WMP, and Music Match in addition to the Creative software.  Unfortunately, each of these programs do certain things well, but none have all the features I like. Media Monkey is nice for sychronizing my music files over my home network with my two computers.  Music Match has a nice duplicate file finder.  Since by default, the song files are stored in separate folders by artist name, the Creative software, WMP and Media Monkey do not display a list of all songs in one screen, but Music Match does.  Fortunately, the player works flawlessly with all of these programs. It also works fine with the Napster software, which is important since I have a membership with Napster.  - It is possible to rip CDs directly to the player -- not possible with my old player.  - Best feature of all that my old player did not do:  It will play the entire library of songs randomly.  My old player would only play playlists, which were limited to 256 (?) songs.  Songs not in a playlist would never get played.  This was a big drag to me.  The random play of all songs is the only way I want to use any player, at least so far.  I'm so darn happy, I can't report any flaws with the Zen Vision, except the item I mentioned about the Creative software not showing all the player's songs in one screen, but only folders by artist. There's a bit of a learning curve with controls and menus, but now that I'm used to them, I can use the important ones (volume, advancing to next song) without looking at the player, which makes it fine for use while driving.  I think anyone would enjoy using the Zen Vision, but anyone having used the Samsung like I did will be absolutely thrilled.  Never tried an iPod, but my Napster membership eliminates the iPod as a choice.

<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very happy with my Creative Labs Zen Vision: M Player.  I had wanted an mp3 player for a while but wanted to make sure I had the right one for me.  I have had my player for going on 3 months now and love it.  Here are a few reasons why: 1. IT IS NOT AN IPOD (I didn't want to just jump on that wagon) 2. It has an FM tuner you can record from 3. It has a mic that I can take to class and record lectures with (I love it!) 4. I can search thru my music with ease (there is an alphabet on the right so you can easily scroll thru, unlike the Ipod) 4. The picture quality is great 5. I can use my own photos as background on the player 6. I don't have to use Itunes to organize my music 7. The scrolling pad is easier to use (you don't go around, it works like a mouse) 8. It was easy to install 9. It is easy to learn how to use it 10. Everyone asks what it is because it is eye-catching and sleek (most are used to seeing the Ipod, so it is a great change)  The only downfall I see is that there are limited stores which carry accessories for it (like a cover).  I would recommend getting one when you buy it (if you buy it on-line). That is all. Like I said--couldn't be happier!

<Title>such a great piece
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is extremely nice.  I never would have thought about watching video on such a small screen.  But I have been watching videos during my lunch breaks.  The screen is bright, colorful, and sharp.  Although a small screen I become focused on it that it doesn't matter the size.  And it supports alot of video formats.  Comes with some nice headphones.  Aside from all the preset equalizers I have have set my own and use the bass boost.  I rarely need to change these settings.  The smart volume is a nice feature too.  For the most part it prevents distortion.  You can still have it too loud with it, but without the smart volume on I feel the music becomes kinda crummy.  The software that came with it is something I've been looking for for sometime.  Not only is there software that will redo the mp3 tags but there is an organizer.  The organizer has relocated all my files to artist folders and then album folders.  I no longer have to search and move the files manually.  After that you can sync the player with WMP or drag and drop.  The drag and drop feature is handy as you can create new folders and add to them.  I have made a folder just for Drawn Together episodes and another for South Park.  This way I need not scroll through all the video on the player to find a South Park episode.  This is my radio.  Selecting random on 4000+ songs is excellent.  No more picking cds to listen to.  A plus to this is that it plays WMA which I feel have better sound quality when compared to a mp3 at the same bit-rate.  The only downside I found was the lack of a charger in the box.  But I got the GOMADIC wall and car chargers which plug directly into the player and not the block that needs to be attached.  Personally I would like to not need the block to charge, load files, or the a/v function if I ever use it.  My player did freeze once with a picture as wallpaper.  I returned to the black background and it hasn't had a problem since.  A dark background is best as text is white and cannot be changed.

<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I finally upgraded from my Archos 20 Recorder after 3 years of reliable use (it still works like a charm, but I wanted video). The ZEN:M is like taking a rocket to the future. I downloaded several shows to it and went about doing my daily work. The sound is awesome, even with the headphones it came with. It sounds even better with a pair of Shure e2c headphones. The scroll bar is super cool, the onscreen controls are pretty and intuitive. It syncs like a dream, plays almost all the video formats on the web (unlike IPOD). I highly recommend it, It's actually less than the video-ipod, has 10 times the features, plays 30 times more types of files, better screen, better battery life. Hey Sheep, quite believing the hype Apple is not better, it might be prettier on the outside, but we all know beauty is only skin deep.

<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zen vision M since August, and it's worth every penny.  After alot of research I decided on Creative Labs over Ipod.  Glad I did, the sound quality is amazing and after a few days of getting used to the key pad (very sensitive but you can used to it) I was downloading with ease.  This is my first MP3, and I am in awe of this machine.  I use it to walk everyday, it is very light and user friendly. A little bigger than an IPOD, great battery life, amazing clear, crisp screen.  As far as scratches and marks, I havent had a problem I bought a leather case for it and it protects it well.  I highly recommend this MP3, no regrets here.  The extra features are great as well.  Calendar, clock, voice recorder, fm radio, and portable photo album.  IPOD has some competition here.

<Title>Great alternitive to Apple
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you're looking for a different music player than the iPod, you really can't go wrong with the Vision.  It is $30 more and quite a bit more bulky, but I can easily get 12+ hours of music or about 4 hours of videos on 1 battery charge.  I've heard complaints of complete shutdowns, but after owning mine for 6 months I haven't seen anything that a reboot can't fix.  Of course you have the variety of colors and options(FM radio recording, voice recorder) and you can use more than one file format for your tunes.  Oh, and the whole "they copied Apple" comments you might get?  Apple just paid out $100 million for the patent to Creative's (the makers of this) MP3 interface. So if you want something different, with more gadgets and diversity than the iPod, consider this.

<Content>I don't know alot about these tech things, but I did an exhaustive review of reviews for the top-end MP4 players and it was between the 30gig iPOD and this.  This holds more songs because it accepts formats which iPODs don't (thanks, Apple) and buying music is so much cheaper because you can only get music for iPODs from iTunes (again, thanks, Apple).    After I changed the sensitivity of the finger pad, I had no trouble with using the control pad.    I'm so glad I got this one, vs the iPod.

<Title>It is ok, but I am not really happy with it
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1) Good things about it is that so far it plays all music files in any format and most of my video files. Not all video files but say 60-70% of .avi files are played. Probably some of my old files can have weird codecs that are not recognized so this is fine.  2) The screen is very bright and colorful.  3) The biggest annoyance here is the way music files are organized. This is really really horrible, at least for me. Files are not organized by folders. They organized ONLY by artists and albums.   This is annoying because if you would like to have three or more subfolders (e.g. coutnry -> bands -> albums) this is impossible.   Moreover, if you just put a folder with your files and the files do not have tags then you won't be able to see any information about these files on the screen of the player, not about the folders where the files are located. So without tags all files are seen as Untitled. Even if the file name is Prokofyev-Concerto1-Allegro.mp3;  Even if you do have tags but on some files it is Prokofyev and on others it is Prokofiev, they would be different folders on the player which is annoying;  Finally, you cannot say play a particular folder. You can only make it play a particular artist or a particular album. If you have a folder with mixed music you would have to create a playlist.... once again.

<Title>Reality...
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the Creative Zen Vision:M for about 6 months now.  I admit that when I received it in the mail and started using it I immediately fell in love.  It was much better than the Ipod to me (and still is) and it was so easy to use.  I primarily was using it as an audio player when I traveled and worked out at the gym and I had not one single problem with it.  So let's start with the good:    -The screen is bright and colorful and easy to view -The touchstrip control takes some getting used to, but it's much easier than other players on the market -The sound quality is excellent with various EQ settings including a Custom setting which many other players lack -Easy to transfer music whether you drag and drop or use the included Zen software -Great battery life  Lately I've been reading reviews all over the web praising this player and showering it with various accolades.  I've become convinced that the reason for this is reviewers only used it for a short amount of time and never had the opportunity to run into any problems.  The player has locked up on me a couple of times...forcing me to do a reset.  My data was retained, but I shouldn't have to worry about the player locking up when I want to use it.  The biggest issue, which I recently discovered, is a slowdown in playback.  I went to Creative's website and research the issue.  This is what I found:  "Audio quality of MP3 or other compressed files are primarily determined by its recorded bit rate, measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). The higher the number, the higher the audio quality, and the more space necessary for recording and storage.  If you experience any distortion with an MP3 player, please verify that the bit rate of your MP3 files. When the bit rate is too low (less than 64kbps), the audio quality will be low because of lack of audio data; when the bit rate is too high or it is beyond the supported range of an MP3 player, the playback will be dragging and slow.  To improve the audio quality, it is recommended that you encode these files again with an reasonable bit rate, for example, 128 kbps."  If I pay $200+ for an MP3 player, it should play my MP3s no matter what quality they are encoded at.  This is truly unacceptable.  I think it's also a matter of storage space.  When you start getting close to 30GB of data, the player has a much harder time processing the data properly.  The site doesn't indicate that however and it's just my theory.  If I had known in advance about this problem, I would have never bought the player.  I used to have all my MP3s at 128kbps...until I started noticing the difference in quality.  Now I don't have any MP3s at a quality less than 256kbps.  I used to have them at 320kbps, but had to bump it down to maximize space.  Other issues:  -Touchstrip is sensitive and you end up selecting menu items you didn't mean to.  The sensitivity can be adjusted, but it's still a pain -Startup tends to be slow when you have a large amount of data stored -Occasionally when a new track starts, you'll get an annoying buzz in playback.  Restarting the track will eliminate it, but it shouldn't happen in the first place -If the player has been off for a while, it will return you to the last selection when you turn it on again.  However when you try to go back one step, it takes you all the way back to the start screen as opposed to say an artist's folder.  More of annoyance than a problem.  All in all the Creative Zen Vision:M is a good player, but it's hampered by problems that an PVP should not have.  I can't imagine what kind of issues I would have if I were using it to watch videos. There is a new 60GB model (only available in Black right now), but it's thicker and costs more than other 60GB models.  I've been doing lots of research and plan on moving on to something better in the near future.  If you don't plan on storing lots of music, then this player may be right for you.  If you like taking all your available music with you, then I would choose something a bit more stable.

<Title>A little pricy, but it was worth it.
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.    I love being able to bring my cartoon/TV shows over to a friends house so we can watch them.  The storage size is nice for holding some of those shows on it.  The size of the player isn't that bad, though I fear somehow cracking the screen.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  The little LED light on the top is a bit annoying since I sometimes listen to music at night; it would have been nice if there was a way to turn it off.  It does a semi-decent job of being a flashlight(This was in a large transit tent).  The pouch that comes with it is useless(and doesn't even match the color) and including video cables would have been nice as well.

<Title>The ultimate mp3 player
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player 5 months ago and i can tell the diference between and ipod video and other portable video players. ADVICE: install the software before you connect the player to your pc and you'll avoid a lots of problems  Pros: hi screen resolution (260,000 colors vrs 64,000 colors from ipod video) awesome sound quality (has the creative seal) a custom image can be used as background support almost any video format without conversion (divx, avi, mpg, mpeg, wmv) except mov :( i like the touch pad and the menu (it could be a con for other peolple) radio and voice recorder schedule and calendar sync with microsoft outlook alarm clock  Cons: scrachts comes so easily the battery should last more is thicker than the ipod its kind of heavy it takes too much time to charge with the usb  and i think that's it, if i remember something else i'll update the review if you are looking for a good mp3 forget about ipod nd get this one you wont regret it.

<Title>I love this mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was my first Mp3 player I have ever boughten and I have not regretted buying it.  I should have gotten screen protectors for since the screen is a tad scratched up now but that was my fault so it's okay.  The reason why I chose this over the iPods was simply because I seriously HATE, HATE iTunes.  I tried iTunes a few times and I couldn't get the damn thing to work so I gave up on it and uninstalled the program.  Also too after looking at the Zune compared to the iPod at Wal-Mart I really loved the Zune's design a whole lot more.    I like the way how the Zune feels when holding it in my hand.  People have complained it was too bulky but I do not think so.  I think it's perfect.  All though I will admit the main controller on the player is still a bit sensative, even after setting the sensativity down to the lowest setting but I've gotten used to it.  I just lock my mp3 player when ever I'm listening to music so I don't accidently mess something up if I accidently hit one of the buttons.  When doing the research for Mp3 players and specifically comparing this to the iPod, I read very few complaints for the Creative Zen Vision: M player compared to any iPod.  The complaints from the iPods were ranging form loosing music when having to reboot it, to constantly freezing a lot, and alot of negative complaints regarding the program iTunes.  With the Creative Zen you can import Mp3 files at any bit rate, all though I don't recommend ripping the music below 192kbps or the music will sound liek crap.  Anyways as far as the Crative Zen goes I've accidently dropped this thing quite a few times since I've owned it the past 7 months and it's never broken on me.  I read complaints about the iPods breaking once people dropped them one time.  As I said too the player has locked up on me a few times since I've owned it but that was because I was clicking too fast and all I had to was reboot it and I've never lost my music.  That was another major complaint that people had with the iPods.  People reported that when their iPods froze they lost all the music and had to start all over.  You are also not restricted to just one format or one pgoram with the Zune like you are with the iPod.  With the Zune you can import Mp3, WAV, or Windows Media Player files.  You can also drag and drop your music into the player after you've docked it with your computer.  I've also read negative reviews about the sound quality for the iPods.  I can tell you that with the Zune the audio quality for this is simply awesome!  I would recommend turning the bass boost on and leaving the "smart sound off" so you can get the full quality while listening to your music.  I also would recommend letting your battery fully drain before recharging it when you first use it so that way you can get extra life with it.  I will also note that   So my final thoughts.  This Mp3 player is very awesome if you're looking for an Mp3 player I higly recommend this one.  I would recommend this to anyone over an iPod ANY TIME.

<Title>A bit bulky, but it's all good
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a journalist, I need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever I went. Now, with the Zen's microphone/recording feature, I'm able to use it to record my interviews, and it's easier to transcribe because of its clear, crisp recording quality.  You can also play .avi files, so unlike iPod users, there's no need to convert them in order to view them.   Many might find it a bit bulky compared to the new iPod, but with its added features, it's a small flaw that's easy to overlook.

<Title>Just Plain Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, i gota say this was the absolute best mp3 player in the world. Why, ill tell if you keep reading.  Everthing about this product is just plain slick. I mean you have total control over it from changing you wallpaper to your equilaizer!!!! The sound is amazing and the screeen, oh my gosh, it so freakin gorgoeus. Only two things troubled for me. It was kind of hard to make playists and it kinda scratches ( not mine, my cousin brothers). I was amazed by Creative for making this gift. Finally an mp3 player that beats the iPod. And it beat it down prttey nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   u may be tinkin that the bulkiness makes it heavier and less elegant. Let me tell you rite now it pretty much weighs the same as an ipod and it gives a sense of safety in yur hand. i relly like the controls with the options button relly helpin out and the bck button.    To end this, this is a great and marvelous choice over the ipod or any mp3 player so a full thumbs up to buy this!!!!! (by the way i think it is kinda cheaper!!!!)

<Title>Wow - buy one.
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.    After about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.    I needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it's better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.  When I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I'm looking forward to my next flight!

<Title>4 Serious Weaknesses - otherwise a decent product
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned my Ceative Zen for about 6 months.  I use it a lot.  All in all, it is a very decent MP3 player.   I also own an IRiver 20GB and Apple IPod Mini, so I have some competitor units to compare it to.  Here are the weaknesses of the Zen:  (1) - The multi-function touchpad is WAY too sensitive.  I've cranked the sensitivity setting to the minimum level, and the thing still thinks I'm tapping it when I am really "sliding" it to adjust the volume.  That immediately takes it away from the volume adjust function and swithces it to another control mode.  You then have to back out of the incorrectly selected mode and find your way back to volume adjust.  This problem with the touch pad is EXTREMELY frustrating.  (2) - The entire unit hangs (crashes) about once a week.  As another reviewer mentioned, you then have to reset it and wait 10-15 minutes for it to reload.  VERY ANNOYING  (3) - Believe it or not, Creative doesn't include an AC adapter/charger in the price they charge for the Zen.  You will have to purchase your AC adapter separately from the device.    (4) - In an effort to keep the Zen the same size as a standard IPod, they didn't build a USB port or charging jack into the device.  Instead they supply you with a "sync adapter" which you have to carry with you and plug into the bottom of the device to sync files or charge the device.  If you lose this adapter (the size of a matchbox), you'll be S.O.L.  Other than those 4 very disappointing (and sneaky) weaknesses, the device is "great".  Now that I have lived with the IRiver, Zen, and IPod models for a while, I have to say that the IPod still has the best interface and usability.

<Title>Firmware enables FM record - Thanks Creative!!!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is just an update to my last review.  The FM record capability is back!  I downloaded firmware which took it away and was very bummed out!  I guess enough people complained because Creative now has firmware that puts the FM record option back!  It's great.    The only other thing I wanted to update was the reason my player kept freezing.  It's not from having too much data on it.  It's because I had a neoprene cover on it and velcroed it too tight.  It kept a constant push on the buttons which confused the player.  I have since changed the cover to a silicone one and have not had the problems since.  Also, I wanted to warn those of you who get protective covers to be aware that the neoprene one scratched up my player and the reason I bought it was to prevent the scratches.  You live and learn.  The silicone one is very nice.    I am ecstatic that I now have the FM recording back and can now record shows.  I already gave a review for this MP3 before so I won't repeat myself.  Buy this MP3, you won't be disappointed in the least!!

<Title>Better than the IPOD
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have both and the Creative Zen Vision M is simply the Best. The sound quality (and I am very picky ), the battery life the video quality. battery life in the ipod really sucks. I have never had a problem with my creative and it even looks much better than the ipod, cooler I would say!!! The Touch pad is better than the wheel (searching a song is easier). You can find a son alphabetically and when for exmple you reach the top of letter A if you keep pressing the touch pad you skip directly to the letter Z (it does the same from Z to A). You can delete a song, or an album or an artist just by using one of the keys in the player.  All the features (find a song, description of the track, bookmark, etc) are a huge plus. It works fantastically with WM11 so you don't need the creative explorer. The FM radio is simply great and so is the record capability. I put so many videos in my Zen and God you can enjoy for example a Simpsons episode with all the sound enhancements. It also supports more video files extension than the ipod (only mp4). In some places you can get it for just 180 bucks (30Gb version). Just buy it!!! [...]

<Title>Excellent product!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I havent owned an mp3 player till I bought this model but I am one to very thoroughly investigate all options before I just in to something.  I am completely thrilled with this player.  It does everything as advertised and the battery life is really great.  My fiance has a different creative model and I really love the backlight feature that this one has that hers doesnt!  I dont have an apple ipod and never have but I am pretty sure I never will either because I love having more than one option for downloading music.  Believe me, this mp3 is well worth the money!  One thing to say on the downside, be prepared to buy different headphones, the ones included are large and hard and hurt the ears after only a short use.

<Title>Blows Apple Away!
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I work in the electronics field and have seen many MP-3 players in recent years. Hands down this is the best video / MP-3 player out to date. It's well built feels good in your hand and does just about anything you want it to. The videos play on a 42 inch tv as clear as they do on the player. I transfer videos from my pc onto it and then play them on my tv or bring them to friends and famlies homes to watch. It's like having a mini vcr with you. Sound quality is second to none. FM Tuner is just another plus that Apple doesn't have. Apple has always wanted to own a particular market, That's why they lost the PC fight in the 1980's. It seems they never learned there lesson. I never liked apple because of it's licensing of content that has to be loaded into it. We all download Music from different sources and with apple only it's I-Tunes music works. With other players including creatives any music on your pc can be loaded and played. Apple seems to want to place a noose on it's owners necks.  Bottom line this player not only looks as nice as the Ipod but performs better with no restrictions on what it plays.  No brainer, Creative Zen : M is the winner in my opinion.

<Content>Get one.  Today.  This thing is great.  So what if it is a little wider than the iPod, it has a better interface and does more not to mention it costs less.  Plus, it doesn't require you to purchase your music from Apple's online store one song at a time.  Get this and Sign up for Urge, then download 5 or 10GB worth of music for one low price.

<Title>Needs to get better quality players and software
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all this is by far one of the best formatted mp3 players out there.  This player will allow the average person to transfer and play music with ease.  The Creative Zen don't even make you use it's transfering software.  One of my favorite features is the ability to select different playback options for selected music folders without having to make a playlist this feature is priceless.  However, reliability for this and the lower 8GB microphoto is the absolute worst.  The player will crash on you... no.. not 1 or 2 years down the line but 1 to 2 months down the line.  I purchased the Creative 8GB Microphoto and right out the box I had software compatibility problems with the software that came with the player!  I didn't think much of it because the player was still functional and it work beautifully for about 2 months then it just died.  No disk clean-up, re-format or customer service tip worked...so I sent it back and because I loved the player so much I went and bought the Zen 30GB.  Bigger mistake this player right out the box had format problems I didn't even get to put one song on it before it crashed.  I tried to get the player to work by reformatting the disk and Blab, Blab, Blab but it was no use right out the box the player was useless.  In addition to the out of the box crash was the faulty charging of the non removable battery.  I charged the player for at least 28 straight hours only to get the one little red bar green to give you an idea of how far off there is probably 15 total bars... so after 28 hours of charging I still could not mustard up enough energy to turn on the player.  All of this occur after the crashing of the player but charging of the player was still slower then other players.  So if you have this player and don't have any problems with it consider yourself really lucky.  However if you are on the market don't waste your time, until Creative Labs start making more reliable players with software that is useful their entire line will always be availible for refurbished purchase.

We use it everyday, it has never crashed or givin us any problems. We watch videos on our TV all the time and there as clear as the zens screen. I have over 2,000 songs in my pc and loaded nearly the whole library into the zen without 1 glitch. Like others have mentioned. It doesn't matter where the music came from it loads and plays. Why pay for I-Tunes there are still many free music sites up and running.   We love it that's why we just bought another.  Sound Quality. 5 stars screen viewing. 5 stars quality / durability. 5 stars Battery life. 5 stars

<Title>Good Player, Good Price
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I hate iPods, I think they are evil, so when I decided to get an Mp3 player I spent about a month comparing all of the "other" brands. I ended up buying this Creative Zen, and I'm glad that I did. Ultimatley I would have liked to buy the Creative Zen Widescreen, but this one fit my budget better and still did what I needed.   So the low down, this product is good, and I suggest buying it over an iPod any day. It's a good size, the navigation is simple and user friendly, and the price is very reasonable. The only complaints that I have are that the included software can be confusing to use, and it has no SD/CF slot. An additional problem that I ran into is that there aren't many accessories for it, since everyone makes everything geared toward the iPod. I'm hard on my electronics, and I needed a hard case for it, and the only one I could find isn't the prettiest thing in the world.   I have noticed that every couple of weeks when I look for accessories there are more of them out there, so hopefully as people keep buying this product other companies will realize that iPod isn't the only Mp3 player out there.

<Title>Best handheld device for your money
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>SKIP IPOD if you are a PC user! The Zen Vision M is so much more PC compatible. Additionally, its cheaper, and much more customizable. Also the video quality is as good if not better than the Ipod. Plus you won't have to be like everyone else with an Ipod, you'll have your own thing going. I can't count the number of times people have gone "whoa! what is that device?" and then after I showed them the video quality and the customizable wallpaper and such they went "wow thats cool!"  and the Zen vision M is really easy to use even if you have all your songs on itunes, you can either encode them through windows media player or easily use the cd that came with the zen. Seriously consider the Zen before you go out and waste money on an ipod

<Content>After reviewing the Microsoft Zune and the IPOD, I went with the ZEN Vision. This has been one of the best gadgets I have ever owned! I can listen to the radio on this thing and play movies/tech videos encoded in divx (which neither of the others could do). The video on the device is amazing!  I wonder why anyone would go with an IPOD or a ZUNE instead of the ZEN! Oh and did I mention, it's about $70 cheaper than the others! Finding a good case for the ZEN has been a challenge though. A very happy ZEN customer!
