<Title>As they say, they don't make 'em like they used to.

<Content>I purchased the original iFP-100 series (iFP-190T) in October of 2003 as a gift, then a refresh version of iFP-795T in November of 2004 for myself.  I still have the iFP-795T and it still works, even after fair amount of abuse.  Its switching regulator occasionally acts up, so I decided to pick up a new one in case it dies, so I bought a T60 1GB version.  I spent less than 1/3 of what I spent to get the 795 in 2004, but in the end, I think I actually got 1/3 of the hardware, too.  Screen is terrible, and can't be read without the backlight on.  795's screen is not color (who cares!), but is higher resolution and readable without backlight.  795 has line-in, and recording quality can be controlled more finely, with Automatic Gain Control for voice recording as well.  I loved 795's voice recording with AGC.  Joystick control is worse than it is on 795, too, and it has never been its strong point either.  The new T60 came with the latest firmware (1.3), which hasn't been updated in a while, and yet appears to have a bug.  Rechargeable battery and Alkaline battery settings are reversed!  Overall, I'm saddened by the "progress."  I actually tried to see if I can still buy a new 700 series or 800 series, but couldn't find any.  I guess they had no choice in order to compete with iPod and what not, or didn't they?  To be fair, for the price, it does work as advertised, but then, I can't recommend it over any other low-priced units.

<Title>Expensive, hard to navigate menus
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The sound quality is great, but a bit of cosmetic plastic on the ear piece broke in the first week.  Still works, though.  The menu is very hard to use to navigate to the songs you want to hear.  It bounces around and makes selections you don't want.  It has a little joy stick that combines volume and directory navigation, which doesn't work very well.  My teenager got rid of this immediately and replaced it with a SanDisk with much more capacity, a bigger screen and better controls.  The shape of this thing is a little odd, too.

<Title>Big sound, small player... a little quirky, but wonderful to listen to
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sound quality is great! I like the bright color screen (which does shut off to conserve power, but all you have to do is touch any button to bring it back up). Battery life is pretty good, though not fantastic.  The navigation is a little different from other players, but I didn't mind it with my old iRiver and I don't mind it now--it seems to be a little more sensitive than the old iRivers, but it really isn't that bad (just takes a little getting used to... I actually prefer the joy stick to normal buttons now).  I haven't had the player for very long, so I can't comment on its durability, but my old iRiver (a iFP-100 something with only 64MB of space) stood up to a ton of abuse and still works, in fact. I also don't know about the quality of the the ear buds (I use my own--a $10 pair of Sony's).  I've tried many different brands of mp3 players since my old iRiver, but nothing has matched it. Overall, I love the player. The T60 is small, very light-weight, and has great sound quality.

<Title>Sounds great, sizes great but cursor can be better
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Amazing sound with possibilities to tweak even more, I use with other headphones. Its small, looks nice with color display, I like the screen saver and monitor of for save batterie that you can also turn off.  I just didn't like the cursor. sometimes it goes to places that I don't want, and sometimes it's not easy to come back.  My second iriver mp3 player. I'll probally buy the third. cheers
