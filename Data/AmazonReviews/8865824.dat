<Title>Great gadget
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my Pad. I don't understand why some are comparing this device to a laptop/desktop. Its like comparing a treo or blackberry to a pepper pad. My pepper allows me to easily sit outside/inside and do the things I need to do when NOT at my desktop. Its attractive, small, very portable and it works. The pad fills in a space that laptops and smartphones can't....more power than a PDA but bigger, less power than a Laptop/desktop but smaller. Oh and I also got my pad wet once...only to learn at that point that it is actually splash proof...phew. Try that with your dell :)

<Content>I wanted to love my Pepper Pad; but after two weeks of making excuses for its flaws, I returned it.   First the good: The size and weight are terrific. It's comfortable to hold, whether sitting on a sofa or lying in bed. The built in stand is well designed, allowing me to connect the pad to a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse at my desk. The user interface is clever and intuitive. There's no need to refer to the  manual to operate most of the applications. The browser is especially good, incorporating Mozilla's tab capabilities without cluttering the screen with too many menus and buttons. The synchronization with a desktop computer is a plus. I downloaded the Pepper Desktop software, surfed to my favorite sites and bookmarked them in the desktop application and then synced the desktop with the Pepper Pad. Transferring photos and music from the desktop to the Pad was also very easy.   Now the bad: Wi-fi performance is marginal. I have a 802.11g Linksys router that establishes excellent or very good connections with my laptop and desktops in all corners of my house. In some of the same locations, I couldn't connect the Pad. Even in spots where the connection with the Pad was strong, the auto-connect feature was flaky. Sometimes the Pad would say it was connected to the router, but then it would disconnect saying it could not get an IP address from the router. This happened even when I was in the same room with the router. To address this issue, I used the wi-fi config on the Pad to assign the Pad a fixed IP address. But every time I turned the pad off and restarted, it would revert to the dynamic IP setting and my fixed address was lost. I contacted customer support about this, was told I would get an email back, but I never heard from them.   The email application is disappointing. You can only have one POP or IMAP account. Many (if not most) people in Pepper's target audience have multiple email accounts -- one for home, another for work. I can't imagine why Pepper released the Pad with such a limited email application.   The screen size is decent, but it's not as sharp as I would have liked.  It's slow. Browser page load times were noticeably longer on the Pad, compared to all of the other computers on my network -- even when running the pad in the same room as the router.   The Pad has lots of little bugs. In the two weeks I had it, the Pad crashed and restarted four or five times for reasons I could not fathom. Twice, after being fully charged, the power meter continued to report that the battery was critically low (I had to reboot the Pad to get the correct power reading). Same with the wi-fi connection. Sometimes when connected, the "not connected" icon appeared. Again, rebooting solved that problem.   I purchased the Pad because I wanted a small, affordable Internet device that I could take from room to room and read in bed. At $850, the Pad seemed pricey to me, but the under-$1,000 Tablet PCs had gotten bad reviews, and the market had few other alternatives. There's been lots of buzz about other devices -- such as the $350 Nokia 770. But none had reached the market. When Pepper began to ship, it was the best option available. But as I struggled with Pepper's flaws, I found myself rationalizing the purchase and making excuses for the machine, rather than relishing it. "I can live with these flaws," I kept telling myself. "Because Pepper is the only game in town." But then I began to search for other options. The Nokia 770 has begun to ship and is getting good reviews. Advueu has improved its $950, 2.5-pound tablet PC. There are other options, and more on the way. Again, if Pepper was half the price, I might have stuck with it. But when it's more than twice as much as Nokia's Internet device and barely less than a Tablet PC that can do 10-times as much, it seems foolish to stick with a machine that I'm barely tolerating. I don't know if the Nokia and Advueu machines are the ones to buy. But I suspect the market will have plenty of options soon. Pepper needs to beef up its offering (and perhaps reduce its price) to compete.

<Content>neat little device.  didn't do what I needed it to do though (lock onto one webpage).  could have a little bit bigger of a screen.  good to keep in the kitchen or living room to look up fast facts.....not exactly "typing" friendly, good for people who do not do alot of email or computer work.  Good for the money.

<Title>The future of portable
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my pad 1 month ago. I thought before I got it that a laptop and a treo phone were all I would ever need. But then after owning the pad I am ready to chuck the treo for a small phone and my laptop well its too big for real portablitly around the house and town. Plus my laptop is way too fragile...cant tell you how many times I have hit a door with its. Once needed a new screen! The Pad has done way more for me then I ever expected it to and I would highly reccomend it to anyone looking for an all in one device that can change the way they comute and work. Currently I have got music on my pad and videos....that was a no brainer and works as one would expect. What it also does is allow me to control all my remote control devices around my house. Its simple setup allows me to have full tv control in my my three rooms that have entertainment systems in it. Not only does it control the devices, but I swear its respose time just flipping channels on cable is faster than the actual cable remote. I also used to use a logitech remote that I thought was the best ever until I realized my pads potential at this. One Large touchscreen gives me access to every button I need on one screen. I even got it to control my lighting in the house (I have infrared activated lighting by lighttroller in most rooms).  Plus my logitech did not allow me to surf the web while controling my tv and checking email and more.  The beuaty of the pad is that while doing the above mentioned, I can still of course check email and browse the web from anywhere. Not only that I have a pool and though it is too cold right now the pad is splash proof and a perfect tool for surfing next to water. I have tested this theory while my wife gives baths to my young infant son (better know as splash boy while bathing!). Also being a fervent hater of internet explorer I was excited to see that the pad utilizes the far superior firefox browser for surfing and with its large screen it is a REAL surfing experience unlike a treo (dont know why they even sell that thing with a web browser...they should call it a web let down).  The pad has some other features...my wife (sadly) likes to read ebooks....only sad cause she does it with MY pad :) The pad also allows me to write and store text files for use with microsft word later. Something I need to do for work. The keyboard on either side is very easy to get used to...it only took a day before I was typing as fast as I do with a regular keyboard (plus I hear you can buy a keyboard for it if you need one). The internet radio feature also works great...especially since the built in speakers actually sound better than the ones on my laptop and certainly my treo. Pepper also sends the device with some wonderful preset choices so you dont need to configure it to do this...it does it right outta the box.   Another feature that is great for me cause I work out of my home a lot is that I need to constantly be checking IM and email in order to stay intouch with the office and clients. The pad is by my side when in bed, I take it in the bathroom (yes yes I do)....and can even use it while I "pretend" to work and am at my neighbors house. The pad has a great chatting tool that is compatible with my aim account and allows me to instantly know when someone is contacting me...people actually think I have no life and am always by my computer...but the pad has only made it appear that way....and why not....isnt that what working from home is REALLY about?   The pads batteries last me all day and I love the fact that there is no boot up time. The pad turns on instantly like the treo...and unlike any laptop. My only complaint about the pad is how do I stop my wife from borrowing it? hah. Guess it might be time for a second Pad! oh well no device is perfect :)  Bottom line, try the pad and you wont be sorry. I am a computer guy and love it, but I also see it being great for someone who just needs simple computing capabilites and does not want to be burdened by virus/spyware prone pc's or complex setups. The pad was so simple a manual is toatlly not needed. Once you recieve it, it asks a few questions and off you go. It reads my cameras sd cards and hooks to my pc for syncing with my necessary stuff when I need to. Its the ultimate toy..now all I need is a new cell phone and I am set.  One other thing that I like....when I do travel with the pad....people stare...people ask...what is that? then I repeat what I just said above. Its cool factor is also a 10!

The item is lightweight and ultra portable. full marks here to it. BUT!! THATS ABOUT IT! BESIDES THAT THIS ITEM IS A PIECE OF CRAPPP.   THE KEYS ARE DAMN FRIGGIN HARD TO PRESS. PROCESSOR IS ULTRA-SLOW. I COULD MAKE A CUP OF CAPPUCCINO WHILE IT OPENED THE BROWSER. THE DARN THING KEPT OF HANGING EVERY 5-10 MINS. THE BATTERY LIFE IS LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER FULL CHARGE. I MUST HV RESTARTED IT A ZILLION TIMES IN 2 DAYS AND THEN GAVE UP. IT WOULD NOT PLAY ONLINE MUSIC COS THE COMPANY DID NOT ADD CODECS IN THE SOFTWARE. SOLD IT ON EBAY FOR 50 BUCKS LESS. THANK GOD DIDNT GIFT IT MY BRO OR WUD HV GOTTEN A A** KICKING OF A LIFETIME.

<Content>I liked the Pepperpad but it was not very sensitive to WiFi signals. Because of this, I returned the unit and am awaiting a refund. With the price of laptops dropping and having full compatibility with everything on the Web, I found the Pepperpad an expensive unit with little usefulness. The instant on and infrared remote features were in its favor but again, the weak WiFi capability caused me to say good bye to the Pepperpad.
