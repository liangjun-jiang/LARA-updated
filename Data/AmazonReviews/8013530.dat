<Title>the best mp3 player I've used.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third digital media player I've owned.  I had a Creative Zen Tough 40 gigs, and a Creative Zen Vision:M 30 gigs before this.  I loved them both dearly but they became unusable a few months after I bought them.  I was super disappointed with the customer service for Creative, so I decided to get a Zune.  I've never had much of an interest in an iPod.  It's not a "I want to be different from everybody" thing so much as Apple just isn't my aesthetic and I wanted all my software to be of the same company.  The packaging is a winner.  I never really thought much about the packaging for a product.  The box it came in was sturdy and attractive and I still have it after two months.  The updated software runs kind of slow but it's still faster than any of the Creative softwares I used.  It helps a lot to not run any other program while you're using it.  Syncing songs to the player takes about one second per song.  Super fast.  The Zune Marketplace is also a winner.  I purchased the Zune Pass and it's really thrilling to use.  All the music I want for 15 dollars a month is a winner.  DRM protection's kind of a drag, but I think it's worth it.  I don't know anything about iTunes so unfortunately I can't compare the two.  You can't put the downloaded songs on a CD or play them on anything else but the Zune software and the Zune, but that doesn't really affect me.    I really love the hardware.  The double shot effect is really neat!  The device feels really nice and substancial in my hand.  It's actually kind of small compared to the huge Zens I used to have.  I honestly don't understand how people say the Zune's too bulky.  There's not too much to say about the firmware.  It's really easy to use, and I like how the letters on the main menu are really big.  It's easy to read, even if you have a lighter background.  It's really nice though, to have the firmware update automatically, because with the Zen, you had to go to Creative's website and download it yourself and put it on the player yourself and the whole thing took about two hours.  It was crazy!  I've always been impressed with Microsoft's customer service.  A couple weeks ago none of the media would play and they walked me through everything and the person I talked to was super nice.  There are a few things that keep it from being completely perfect.  These are pretty minor details though for the most part.  The least minor thing is the quality of the video.  With my Creative Zen V:M, the video was absolutely superb, crisper than a TV.  It was so impressive, and I kind of miss it with the Zune.  I really really don't care about video though, so it doesn't matter much to me, but if video is important to you, consider the Zen.  Another big thing for me is you don't have the ability to turn the zune to the other side so the controls are on the left when viewing pictures and video.  I'm left handed and it's incredibly awkward to use my right hand to control it.  Also, a clock would be such a convenient addition.  Voice recording and the ability to use the device as an external hard drive would be nice too.  The ability to record FM radio like you can with the Zen would be super.  I don't care at all about accessories but that's a huge factor for some people.  There's a company called Vaja Cases that make really super nice custom leather cases for the Zune 30.  I'm not sure they make them for the 80, or the flash drive based devices.  You can find plastic cases at like Best Buy too.  There's an A/C adapter too but I heard that it kind of sucks.  I have a radio adapter that plugs into any headphone jack and I like to use it in the car and whatnot.  Overall though I totally recommend the Zune 30.  It's super sturdy, and the software and everything is awesome.  Definitely consider it if you're looking at hard drive based mp3 players.

<Title>Amazing, Better than Ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is very Good, Great Sound, and if you buy the premium headphones, you get great sound, plus noise cancelling, great for the gym, or traveling.  Definitely you must get the membership on zune marketplace, were for $15 bucks a month you can download EVERYTHING you want. Rather than Buying from Itunes.  Zune beats Apple in about one hundred ways.  Tip:  You get three accounts for one membership, so you might get 3 friends, and each will pay only $5, for unlimited downloads, podcasts, videos, etc.  Very Cheap!!

<Content>I've had this Zune for a while now before bothering to write a review, but it's definitely worth buying.  The new Zunes are out, and I can't attest to their functionality myself, but microsoft keeps coming up with better and better ideas.  This thing is easy to operate, syncs easily, and is more durable than anyone should probably need.  I've dropped it plenty of times, and it's still kickin'.

<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Content>I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.

<Title>Unlike many other reviewers, I actually own a Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many of the reviews here are from (and will most likely continue to be from) people who neither own a Zune nor have they ever touched a Zune.  A majority of the remaining reviews are commentary on the Zune vs. iPod battle without regard to a legitimate compare and contrast of the players themselves (possibly legitimate discussions, but discussions that shouldn't really be regarded as reviews).  My review is intended to be my first impression of my Zune along with a bit of compare and contrast as I make a switch (possibly permanent or maybe temporary) from an iPod to a Zune.  The Zune is a great player.  A large bright screen that presents a great user interface when navigating through your library or settings.  The screen is also beautiful for watching video and in particular works very well with pictures.  Despite it's slightly bulky look and large dimensions when next to other players in its class, the Zune feels just right in your hand.  Maybe a bit large to cram into a pocket, but seriously, it fits your hand like a glove.  Pre-release, many have knocked the brown, but it's a real nice color.  It has a subtle green accent that runs around the edge of the player and the contrast adds a lot of class to the player.  The software is not quite up to iTunes, or in reality maybe it's just that I'm used to iTunes.  The software is simply a better looking version of Windows Media Player (I guess that should be taken as a compliment to the Zune, because it really is a nice looking piece of software).  So, if you're comfortable with that you'll love this.  If you don't like Windows Media Player, you may not like this much more.  The wireless capabilities of the Zune has been a huge push from Microsoft.  This feature has been implemented quite well, but it will take some time for enough Zunes to be out the for the sharing to really take off.  Sound quality is no better, no worse than other players.  Overall the Zune is a welcome departure from the category leading player, the iPod, if for no reason other than it's something new in a category that has gotten a little repetitive over the last couple upgrade cycles from Apple.  The software though not as refined as iTunes, is a bit of a warmer looking alternative and it's UI differences may even grow on me enough to eventually like it more than the competition.  The player's menu navigation has every other player in the market beat.  Picture and video viewing is also at the top of the class.

<Title>Big screen and good design
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've tried out all the iPod competitors.  In general they have all disappointed me, but this is the first one that I really like.  The only downside is that it's not as thin as the iPod, but the iPod scratches so easily that it requires a case which adds extra thickness anyway.  (+) 3" screen is GREAT.   44% bigger than iPod video.  For the first time, showing a friend my travel pictures over coffee, etc. is an enjoyable experience.  You can even zoom into pictures to see details.  And now I can actually enjoy watching videos while sitting in a cafe.  My iPod video's screen is just too small.  I also like seeing the big album art while a song is playing.  (+) It plays ALL my songs and videos iPod won't play any WMV videos, AVI video, WMA songs, etc.  The Zune plays everything I have. iPod video doesn't.  (+) Landscape mode   When playing a video or watching movies, the Zune automatically switches to landscape orientation.  (+) Controls I really like the control layout.  Easier to adjust the volume than on the iPod.  When you switch to landscape mode, it's smart enough to automatically rotate the controls so that pressing "up" always scrolls up.  (+) No scratches. The case is made out of scratch-proof, matte finish material.  It looks and feels good.  My iPod video with it's high gloss finish looked great for the first month, now it's covered with scratches and looks like crap.  That's why everyone's obsessed with keeping their iPod's in a case-- which only adds cost and thickness and keeps you from seeing how shiny it is anyway.  (+) Music Sharing You can listen to your friend's music wirelessly.  And even take it with you for a few days. No need to plug into a computer.  You just stand in front of each other and transfer the music wirelessly.  (+) FM Radio. I didn't think I'd use it, but I do. Cool interface.  (+) Menu design makes sense.  Easy to use.  (-) Thickness The Zune is .58" thick.  The 30Gb iPod is .43" thick. Of course, you have to buy a case for your shiny, scratch-prone iPod and that will add more than the difference in thickness.  (-) Looks like a scroll wheel. It looks like the Zune has an iPod-like scroll wheel, even though that's not how it functions.  They should have done something to make it look different.  Now people will probably think they just copied the scroll wheel, even though they didn't.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As I write this review I am listening to some classic Hendrix tracks through my home-stereo via my brand new black Zune. I've had the product for a few hours now and I've been nothing but impressed. The zune software is very similar to WMP 11 and it was a breeze to set up. In fact, within 3 minutes I was syncing all of my exising MP3 and WMA tracks with the Zune and downloading brand new content from the Zune store for free with my 14 day trial pass. The interface is very user-friendly, and I prefer its look to the increasingly cumbersome interface of the itunes music store.   The Zune itself is just ridiculously cool. The screen is as nice as I've seen on a handheld device, and the interface took me all of 10 seconds to master. Everything about the product makes wonderful sense. The ability to use this with the zune subscription music service is a fantastic feature as I am an avid fan of all-you-can-download music.   So let's recap: Fast, easy, problem free installation of software.                 Ingenius user interface                 Beautiful LCD screen                  Zune store allows subscription downloads   I'm still undecided about sound quality, but so far I can't complain. I also can't comment on battery life because I've only had the zune for maybe four hours now. This product kills all other hard-drive based MP3 players in terms of over-all end-user experience. I've owned an iriver, ipod, and zen nano before and this is my favorite player thus far. I-Pod could compete with this only if they put a larger screen on gen. six ipods and allow subscription based downloads in itunes.   Okay, the wireless sharing feature will be a gimmick as far as i'm concerned because the chances of me meeting many people who also own a zune seem quite remote.. let's face it, not that many people are sporting 250 dollar MP3 players at my apartment complex or my college campus.

<Content>Got my Zune this morning and I like it a lot. Installation is very straight forward. The interface is intuitive and responsive. However I am going to return it because it does not support Unicode. My Chinese and Japanese song title becomes a bunch of squares. It also does not support any lossless format, not even WMA Lossless.

<Title>Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs.

<Title>Dear Santa...
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While holiday shopping this afternoon I got a chance to try out the new Zune.  The user interface is extremely easy to use - perhaps even more intuitive than the I-pod.  I'm not as enamored with the "wheel" motion of the I-pod player as some, so I was pleased to find the Zune's D-pad style controls responding as I would expect. Everything had that familiar feel - even for a first time user.    I liked how the menus went both deep and broad - I had the option to drill down into a specific category, but then I could also scroll across song options within that category.  I had a good sense of direction throughout the experience.  The music sounded good and crisp.  The video seemed fluid - I didn't notice any pixellation.  I liked the radio feature too - something I'm more likely to use than the alarm clock or calendar feature on the I-pod.  The addition of games would be nice - perhaps something to purchased off of the Zune Marketplace down the road.  I would have liked to see a Zune player without the wi-fi at a cheaper price point, but we'll just have to wait and see if the wi-fi music world that Microsoft is promoting really takes off.    All-in-all, a good player.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to have seen a AC or car adapter included in the package - you're looking at an additional $40 for the official Power Kit.    This one is going on my list to Santa (or in my case - Mrs. Claus).  And yes, I'll probably ask for the brown.

<Title>Do not buy first generation of Zune.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky.   OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play.   The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod.   13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless.   It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes.   In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.

<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item for my 14 yr old son as a birthday gift.  He really wanted one and I was happy that I could get last year's 30GB for so much less than the newest 8GB.  My son used it for about a week and the system crashed.  I called Microsoft and got nowhere on customer services.  After waiting about 3 weeks for a return box to show up, I contacted Amazon customer service and had it shipped out the next day.  Then a replacement arrived just a couple of days later and we were back in business. He absolutely loves it and I was impressed that it was so versatile.  He's got music, pictures and even episodes of his favorite television shows on it already.  I buy on Amazon all the time and the customer service is simple and incredible.  I would recommend this product and Amazon to anyone.

<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune 30G as a Christmas gift for my son. Of course, I had to load the software and upload about 100 CD's to it for him. All of this took about a day or so. I didn't have any of the trouble that I see some others have listed on their reviews.   In addition, I bought the PQ DVD to Zune converter ($29.95) online from their site (searched for it by name with Google), and uploaded about 2 seasons of his favorite TV show for him. That took about 6 hours. The screen is perfect for TV shows, but the widescreen movies don't look very good on it. I don't recommend trying to watch those. If you have full screen DVD's at home, those look fine when uploaded.   He used it for about 2 weeks (all day every day) before leaving it behind one day when he went to school. That's when I had the perfect opportunity to use it myself. I took it to work out and ended up watching TV shows through about a 2 hour workout! I loved it so much, I bought one for myself. My second son was so jealous of our new Zunes, that I ended up buying a 3rd as a gift for his 8th grade graduation. Now when they want me to hear their latest "favorite" music, they just wirelessly share it with me through the click of a couple buttons.   I'm a HUGE Zune fan! However, I recommend the following items for optimum enjoyment (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5):  Book - How to do everything with your Zune Software - PQ DVD to Zune Converter and Windows Vista Charger - I am buying a charger of some sort today because we can only charge the Zunes on our computers. I want to find some way to charge them in the car or just with a typical wall outlet. Battery life is really good on them though. (I only charge them about every 14 hours unless we watch a lot of video.)  Oh, one last thing, don't buy the Zune pass or anything like that until you actually start using the Zune. You may decide you don't really need it. I bought a $25 card to give my son with his Zune at Christmas because I thought he needed it to buy music online. So far, he's only bought a couple of songs. We have so many CD's that he just doesn't take the time to surf for extras.

Any way about the zune it's self it's decent. Like everyone else say's the software is horrendous. I absolutely hate it.  The only reason I got this is because my Creative Zen broke from me dropping it. And It was the cheapest at 99 bucks.  Also Check around for the new Zune's the 80 gigs one's on other sites are selling them for $249. So do shop around.  That's all

<Content>Poorly designed, poorly executed. Is too bulky, is riddled with bugs, and does not work near as well as my 30GB iPod. The wheel is not as easy as iPod's, the battery life is not as good as they state, you have to buy from their store (which is DEFINITELY no iTunes Store!) Overall, I was not impressed with this effort, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you bought it, take it back, quick! Let's just face it, this is yet another so-called "iPod Killer" that falls on it's face. Mr. Gates, give it up. Ande besides, who listens to the radio anymore? This product stinks, and is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

I picked it up, and I must say, The interface is extremely easy to use and well designed. Sure it uses proprietary computer software, but so does apple. The screen is a good deal larger than the vidio-ipod's, making up for the slight increase in size. The finish is a scratch resistant feeling rubberized plastic, much better than the ipods. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this device. This deffinatly will be a true contender for the ipod.

<Title>Looks awesome. Can't wait to get mine for Christmas.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I'd like to remind everyone who encouraged others to buy an ipod that this is the place to review a Zune. We all know what an iPod is and we all know that iPod and Zune are competing.   I went to go see the Zune today instore and I got a chance to play around with it a little. I read a lot of reviews beforehand and going to see it hands on was the last of my research to see if the Zune is really all that it's cracked up to be. Some reviews from different websites stated things such as:  "You can't view your now playing song"        -Yes you can. Whoever didn't notice this didn't take much time to figure it out.   "You can't shuffle the songs"        -As soon as you click on a catergory (songs, artists, etc.) the first option is to shuffle all.  "The album artwork looks bad"       -No, it really doesn't.   Overall, the Zune is very easy to control and a very nice mp3 player. The pictures and movies looked really good, the radio sounded good, songs sounded crisp and clear, features such as setting pictures to the backround, viewing movies in landscape, etc. are really nice..

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't listen to people who own iPods and write reviews like the previous ones to try and convince themselves that they got the better deal. The Zune is, like I said, very nice. It's extremely easy to use, the software is good, and battery life is good. I've been playing with it all day but had to stop so that I write this review to try to dispel the previous inaccurate and flat out dumb reviews. About the size: It's the same width, 0.3" taller, and 0.15" deeper. I'm ok with that seeing how as the screen on the Zune is 20% larger. The Zune has a built in FM tuner, the iPod does NOT. The Zune has wireless capabilities, the iPod does NOT. The ONLY thing the iPod has that I wish the Zune had is the scroll wheel. There aren't too many accessories out there for it yet, but once word gets around that it's a lot better than the iPod there will be a lot more and they'll be a lot easier to find. So don't listen to these bitter people who have recently spent the same amount on an inferior product.

<Title>Not even close
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked out the Zune today at Best Buy. I already have two ipods so was just wondering how the Zune compared. I tried to keep an open mind but this thing isn't even close to the refinement of the Ipod or other MP3 players. They had the black and brown Zune on display. Yikes, that brown is uuuuuugly.  The wheel and buttons felt cheap and the over all look seemed cheap. The only nice thing is the screen.   Size wise the Zune is too big in my opinion. It is the size of my original 5 Gig ipod that came out in 2001. The 30 gig ipod is so much thinner and feels more refined.   I can't speak for the music store but Itunes is so good I can't imagine it being any better.   While I was there nobody even noticed the Zune. No big MS marketing materials pointing people to the Zune. Just two lonely Zunes that didn't stand out at all to the other many MP3's, let alone the Ipod. In fact, one of the Zunes had an error on it and wouldn't turn on. It just kept flashing a battery icon as if the unit did not see the battery. MS has a way to go before people will even look at this thing. When I was there a lady came up and said the the Best Buy guy, I'm looking for a 30 gig MP3 for my son's bday and he wants and Ipod. The guy never even suggested the Zune and so she bought her Ipod and went on her way. I think this will be typical of this holiday season. Most consumers want an Ipod and that is about it. Some people will get it for the screen size but for me, I'd rather wait for the larger screen Ipods to come out.

<Title>What was I thinking!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I'm not very techy person, I like owning cool gadgets and admit to have spent a good chunk of money on them in my lifetime. So with all the hype around this Zune thing, I had to get one. Close to 300 bucks later, I have my gadget, sitting in my home office desk. But did I get any cool-factor joy for the price?   No sir. For starters, here's my quick findings:  Its huge. What sort of baggy-pants were part of the group testing this product? And you get the same 30G for that extra bulk - where's the progress? Screen seems less brighter/sharper than I expected, especially in unfavorable lighting. Center button looks like a circular scroll wheel but isn't - its a fake (just a cheap 4-corner version). Installation is slow and has a lot of steps with corny pictures of people I don't care about. I still don't understand why I can't use American dollars to buy songs, instead of these "points". Seems like its a ploy to make me spend more money, like casinos with the chips that don't feel like real money.  I could go on and on, but I don't think its worth the effort... I'm sure I'll find some glitches and more gripes over the next few days. Or maybe I'll just put it back in the wrapping and wait for a "re-gift" opportunity.

<Title>Redefine Refined.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Rarely do you see a product from Microsoft that isn't subject to a barrage of heavily (and I do mean _heavily_) biased reviews, comparing it to other products and services that typically doing whatever Microsoft's products do, only better.  Look at the so-called "credible" reviewers working for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Whatever happened to journalist standard of forming and supporting a credible and unbiased opinion?  Perhaps if you set the competition aside (or look at it on less subjective and comparative scale) you will be able to grasp a fair review of a product.  But may I say that even the Zune does not require this formality, for it is a capable, stable, and solid product in nearly every regard.  Having been looking forward to the November 14th release date for a while now, it was safe to say that I was overjoyed when the day finally came.  After getting up in the morning, eating a quick breakfast, showering, and heading off to my single class for the day, it finally hit me that today would be the day that I would experience the Zune first-hand.  Certainly the harsh words put out by the big-league review columnists couldn't be completely true, right?  Come 10 AM, and there I was standing at the local Circuit City, eager to finally get my hands on the product.  After corralling a service rep to fetch one from the display case, making the choice of Black for color, checking out, getting back in the car, driving home, and getting upstairs to my computer, the time that I had longed for finally came to fruition.  The first thing you'll get with Zune is the brown package.  The box itself is fairly small, and is opened by pulling the top off from the bottom.  Once open, you will be greeted with the phrase "Welcome to the Social," on the side of the inner box.  Open a the flip-out side panel, and you will see your Zune for the first time, nestled in an indentation in the packaging.  A brown cord allows you to dislodge the Zune from the packaging, and two more flip-out panels to the left and right of the Zune house the magnetic black ear buds, and the sync USB cable.  Another opening at the top houses a small instructional guide, software, and other papers, along with a carrying pouch.  Overall, the packaging is nice, and allows you to get to your product fairly quickly.  The instructions are very simple, and you won't have much of a problem figuring them out.  The carrying pouch, however, is too small and tight-fitting, and seems to be provided to prevent damage from scratches, rather than impacts.  Installing the software doesn't take too long, and after a restart, you are prompted to plug in the device.  You will be given the opportunity to name the device, and you will then be guided to setting up a Zunetag account.  I haven't yet set up any online service with the device yet, so I cannot comment on how well the Zune store functions.  The device will automatically synchronize your music the first time out, with the option of synchronizing your pictures and videos as well.  The process went fairly fast, and any additional syncs after the initial load are quick.  The Zune software itself seems to be derived heavily from Windows Media Player 11, as the album-based libraries and options dialog will suggest, and everything fits well and is laid out in a practical manner.  While some may be turned off by the fact that you can't just use Windows Media Player for adding music, it should be noted that you would require a new piece of software anyway if you want to upgrade your devices software when it is updated.  Once all of your media is loaded, it's on to the Zune itself.  Physically, the device is tall, as to accommodate its 3-inch QVGA display, and is semi-thick; no thicker than the size of a small-medium cell phone.  The device is finished in a rubbery matte finish that feels very sturdy and lays true on a flat surface.  The button layout and functionality is well designed, and the only problem you will have navigating the exceptionally streamlined and intuitive menu system is accidentally pressing the center button instead of up on the directional circle, as they are both finished smooth and shiny.  The portrait-based display is very efficient for displaying lists of albums, songs, or play lists, and the album-art centric Now Playing screen also features an thoughtful layout, showing you the pertinent information to your current song.  Video and picture playback forces the device into landscape mode, rotating the screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  This allows you to take full advantage of the large screen when viewing said media.  While the Wifi's state in the device is virtually crippled, it is reassuring to know that it may very well be taken advantage of in a more practical fashion through future software updates.  The sharing feature is nice in theory, but the limitations that are imposed even on non-copy protected music seems a bit excessive, especially for elusive tracks that won't be easily found on online music stores.  The FM Radio feature is a very nice addition, and the display of track and station information is incredibly nice and useful.  Reception won't be without occasional static, but overall it is very consistent and distortion-free.  While you cannot record live radio as you can with other players, the ability to view track information is a near-exclusive feature and is very valuable.  Overall, playback is smooth and uninterrupted by jostles and bumps, and the menu system is responsive and polished.  Audio quality is top-notch, with all levels of audio -   bass, midrange, and treble - reproduced accurately and crisply.  The unit allows for several equalizer presets, and each one has a unique sound to it.  The absence of a bass-boost feature may seem like a loss, but you'll be surprised by the amount of kick you receive by the default settings that you'll learn to not miss such a feature.  Video playback is also smooth, but while I haven't encountered a problem yet, you may be prone to skipping or momentary pauses due to excessive bumping or movement, since the device is not solid-state.  The device, while larger than other players on the market, holds a presentable, professional and refined look.  The physical integrity (yet curiously lightweight construction) of the case only bolsters the units longevity and standout power.  The semi-transparent case with a "double-shot" of color looks very cool in person, and the unit definitely stands out among the sea of white-colored devices.  It is also a magnet for popularity at the office, as one person tells another person, who tells two other people about your new Zune...and they all try to use the directional-pad as a touch pad for some reason...  My only gripes about the device come from the people who brush it aside under the veil of being a Microsoft product.  Microsoft isn't printed on the device for a good reason: it's unlike any other Microsoft product you will have ever used.  The intuitive interface is easy and fun to use, the synchronization is fast and seamless, and the product's longevity through software updates gives you reassurance that even though it is a first-generation product, you won't be sorry when they announce a software breakthrough.  I personally recommend the device for those seeking a competent, well-rounded media player.  The combination of easy-to-use software and superb playback is a major strong point of the device, and the Wifi feature, while limited now, will most definitely come into play in more useful ways in the near future.  The only shortcomings of the device are limited format support, and the need for separate software and drivers to make the unit work on a computer.  In the end, the product is a positive mark for Microsoft's Zune initiative, and if the goals of the product are anything like that of the Xbox, then we may have a product with some serious competitive power in a very short time.

<Title>I just got one!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off i want to start off by saying that i have owned a creative vision m mp3 player as well as numerous other ones, but none have compared to the zune that i just picked up. I like the fact that it doesn't get your fingerprints all over it like the creative or the ipod video does. Also downloading and transfering music and videos with the software are easier than any other program out there. Also you can subscribe to download as much music as you want without having to pay a dollar a song like itunes, thats a big plus for me. Add in all the accesories coming out for it, theres just no competition in my book.  To all those saying theres bugs and stuff are full of it. mine works great and looks awesome as well. Plus no ipod user can compete with this screen. Two thumbs up in my book!!!

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm no tech-genious and I'm not a MS fanboy either, but the Zune has been a good buy so far for me. Sure it's a little bigger than a fraking ipod, but it's not that noticeable. Another good thing is the screen. It's bright and crisp(from what I've seen so far). The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup. I can't compare it with iTunes, because I've never really worked with it. Overall it's a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good player.

<Content>microsoft is trying, but they still have a long way to go. the zune is noticeably thicker than the ipod and the 4 way control pad is a real step backwards from the ipod's touch wheel. i like the bigger screen, but not enough to suffer through the pain of a 1.0 software release. no thank you.  after criticizing apple for making a closed ecosystem, microsoft abandons it's own "plays for sure" partners and ditches the whole "choice" argument in hopes of making an end-to-end solution that doesn't suck.  keep trying, guys. i'll check back at version 2.0

<Title>Good but not GREAT!
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this primarily because it has a built in fm tuner. For some reason it seemed really galing to me that other brands had the nerve to  make us get an attachment to listen to the radio. That being said here goes the pro's and con's for me.  Pros-   Attractive- Some find it a bit bulky, but as someone who grew up carrying walkman cassette players or portable cd players, the size is not too much for me. I like the matte texture because it gives the player a soft look and makes scratches less likely.  Large Screen- The screen is very nice, I would not want to spend hours and hours watching it, but it is crisp and clear with great color.  30GB- This is plenty of space for me to keep all of my music and then some. I also find it handy for carrying images to show to friends and family members.   Headphones- For stock headphones, they are great. They almost never get tangles up on me and they are magnetized so you can stick the buds together.  CONS-  All of the cons, for me, are software related. I had no initial trouble with the software, it was not until the November upgrade that I started having all sorts of problems.   One is that the albums, album images, and artist don't match one another. I can be listening to NIN and an image of an ATB album will show but the album will be a third artist.  Another is that for a time I could not use the Zune software due to errors in installation. Then there was an error where the software was not recognizing my Zune.   My last con is that it does not support much of my music files, which are   WMA. I think their idea in that is trying to create a Monopoly in the way that Itunes has but it just does not make sense to me. If they are not beating IPOD in design(they aren't) then they should try by beating them by being more inclusive.   Overall I am glad I have my Zune, even with all its little quirks and irritations.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>Like the Zune, but not the program
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I personally found i like the Zune better than the previous mp3 player i had which was an ipod. However as for the program with my music library i cannot say the same. It is so difficult to use. Much less convenient and harder to sift through all my music. And as far as putting new music in, it is much more difficult. The titles of songs and artists get all scrambled. I love my itunes library, i just put a cd in and the names come in fine and if i want to change it i just edit it, the Zune program does not work this easily. It's quite a hassle to where i haven't even bothered putting new music on it.  So basically i wish i could have the Zune player with the itunes library setup/software. I do love the Zune itself, the color, thickness, sturdiness.  So if you are a person that either has all their music organized, no burned cd's with unknown or misc. artists or someone who doesn't mind disorganized music, then this might not be a bad choice for you.

<Title>WOW and Meh at the same time
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for $140 to sell off to someone else for $200 but while I connected it for him and showed him how to do things, I found out a lot of disturbing tidbits.  First, It can't even connect to a computer easily.  It gets the famous "ipod  errors" in which if you disconnect it without removing it safely from the PC it'll act funky for a while.  Though this is something I should have known previously (also not having a MSC connection type either), still...MS should have done a better job of making this more friendly for any and all computers.  It sucks that I can't use 30 GB's worth of space to store anything.  Another issue was turning it off.  The manual didn't really elaborate on that so I was extremely confused.  It seemed to be in a "stand by" mode instead of "off".    All of those pitfalls have sold me on NOT buying this product BUT there were definitely upsides to this device.  The screen is HUGE and vibrant.  The design is groovy and great.  Everything about the player and its features is great.  Only problems were connecting to PC's (just imagine a PC that has a non-commish account...how do you disconnect it then???),  no MSC mode to drag and drop  any files you want, and having to use software.

<Title>Love my Zune
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After using a Sony High Speed Net MD Walkman recorder (with mini disks) for a couple of years, it was time to update to a newer player. I now have a Zune 30 GB player and love it. For a female over 40 yrs of age it's so easy to use (I even got more helpful info and tips with the book "How to Do Everything with Your Zune" by Rick Broida). So far I have 1299 songs, 91 pictures & 47 movie videos on my device and still have over 7 GB free. The battery seems to last a long time, easily charges while hooked up to my laptop or a wall charger (faster charge time with the wall charger). The picture quality  so sharp and clear. There is even a built in FM tuner that have RBDS, meaning, some of the stations show the call letters, type of program & even the current song & or artist. The best thing is now I don't have to carry CDs in my car. My Zune plugs right into the car radio (made for MP players) and sounds wonderful. This unit has so much more features that I could write a book about it! My Zune was worth every cent!

<Title>Lots of problems
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had he chance to use one for a few hours now, and in that time I've still not gotten used to the lack of a real scroll wheel.  The unit really shows its weakness when compared directly hand to hand with the 30GB iPod...though that's not my iPod of choice.  It sucks that it doesn't work with the Windows Media Player, but requires yet an additional application to be installed.  I knew it was incompatible with iTunes and Microsoft's own Plays for Sure...so all other major stores and subscription services don't work with it, but not being integrated with Windows Media Player is just mind bogglingly lame.  The possible advantages over the iPod in theory weren't that was in reality.  I found none of my favorite radio stations where able to get any decent reception, and even those stations with reception had static when I moved with the unit.  Wireless has no purpose whatsoever other than letting someone else with Zune sample a song before buying...this of course requires finding someone with a Zune, negotiating the transfer, and then waiting for it to occur.  I'd prefer to let someone simply jack into my iPod, burn them a CD or point them to the iTunes Store.  Yes, the unit is ugly.  Get over it.  I don't care how it looks when it's in my pocket cranking out tunes.  One nice feature that I'd give it is that the display is mirror like enough to actually use as such when turned off.  This is like using the back of an iPod as a mirror.

<Title>Great Performance, But Lack of Support and other Problems Plague this "iPod Killer"
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I do not work for Microsoft, I do not work for Apple. This is a competely unbiased review, and I do actually own the product.  PROS: -Bright, vivid screen - A 3" Screen makes it the largest screen of a device this size. Can be viewed in portait or landscape, this very clear screen has good viewing angles and rivals very nicely with the iPod. -Great Sound - This is what REALLY matters right? -Design - With a durable rubberized surface, no fingerprints or scratches will be obvious, and feels safer to carry around in more rugged locations. Also, all three colors look really great. -Wi-Fi - Connect to fellow Zunesters to view what their listening to, share music, and all while not drastically reducing battery life. -Great Interface - The internal software interface of the Zune is great. It is actually built on the Windows Mobile CE OS, and the PC Software is built on the Windows Media Player 11 Software. Great performance and quick menus. -Plays Movies: H.264 (Quicktime/HD), MPEG-4, and WMV (native) -Plays Music: MP3, AAC, and WMA (native) -Views JPEGS  CONS: -Mediocre Battery - Music ranges from 10-13 hours, and video ranges from 2.5-3.5 hours. Very poor compared to the iPod. -3 Plays, 3 Days - Absolute bull. When you transfer a song, it only plays 3 times, or you only get 3 days (whatever comes first). That is not near long enough to enjoy a song. -LACK OF SUPPORT: DivX and Xvid don't play, Lossless music doesn't play, and only JPEGs are viewable. Everything else has to be converted in some form of the other. Previous subscription and protected music won't work on this device, and you are restricted to the Zune Marketplace for music. -Zune Marketplace - Although a great start, you can't buy movies on it yet, and you have to buy everything in points, which is a pain, because 79 points is $.99. -Wi-Fi restrictions - No wireless computer synching, transfering, or web browsing. -5 Click Wheel - Nothing innovative. Quite annoying actually; although responsive, it is nothing like the iPod. -Propietary USB - USB to USB-A(Mini USB) cords won't fly, you have to use what comes in the box to connect. It does charge relatively quickly though.  BOTTOM LINE: No, iPod killer, but a great step in the right direction. Microsoft's transition from Software to Hardware will continue to improve and this might be a tough competitor for the iPod this holiday season due to its large amount of hype. Unless you are really keen on getting the device, wait until the next generation. As an MP3 player, it is great; at the top of its class in sound, but still pails in comparison to the might iPod.

<Content>Firstly, our local Super Target is giving twenty five dollars gift certificate with each Zune. So, that should cover the taxes you pay. The offer is valid this week only.  Secondly, the screen looked brilliant and sharp. I don't care what the resolution is, it looked great to me.  Thirdly, the menu and the controls were very easy to use. I could use the whole functionality while I was playing with it in the shop for 15 minutes or so. (Well, I couldn't figure out how to preset FM stations.)  Finally, I didn't but it. I knew before that it doesn't have voice recording or FM recording function. So, 4 starts. I was interested in the device, even with the missing function, but it wasn't so attractive when I looked at it for me to buy it right then. I can wait to see the reviews of other people. My iAudio MP3 player that Zune might replace has VR function, that I do use once in a while. Also, could a real owner post if you can connect this device to any computer (without its own software) and be able to access the hard disk? Another reason, I didn't buy right then was that the white model wasn't on display. I would like to have a look at that before making my decision.  If I end up buying the device, I will update this posting.

<Title>I would give Zune a try; great sound and video
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is a great product.  Its standard Wifi separates itself from the pack.  Also, FM is standard unlike some of its competitors.  It does feel bigger then some other players out there (because it is!) but that shouldn't matter.  Most people put their players on their belt, in their pocket, etc.  The extra "girth" makes it feel a bit more solid.  Plus, the benefits of the bigger size (larger LCD screen for video) is worth it.  Pros  Exceptional sound.  The best I've listened to yet. Exceptional video quality.  The larger screen matters.  Trust me. Scratchless and fingerprintless body Wifi which, today, you can transfer songs to a friend Wifi, which, tomorrow, will hopefully bring more functionality Seamless integration with Xbox 360 Decent ear buds that fold up nicely Software and on-line store   Cons No bells and whistles  No equalizer (hopefully, this will change via a firmware upgrade) Songs you transfer to a friend can only be played 3 times/last 3 days No video downloads from website at launch (not a problem for me)

<Title>I PURCHASED MINE
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased mine yesterday from a local Bestbuy (Opening day) so far I really like this guy. There are a few things that Microsoft should change but the overall device is great. Here are my thoughts.   Positives -  - The screen is very clear... none like it - I purchased the Brown and love the look. - FM radio is very clear and picks up great - Video is sharp  - Menu on device is very easy to use and had great features like adding to quicklist.  - The texture of the device is really cool. It looks like it should last a really long time.    Negatives -  - Its rather big for a 30 gig but its still a good size. Its not too big and bulky.  - HATE! The PC software. The software that you us to move your songs over is HORRIBLE. It needs a ton of work. I am a Network Admin and know my computer software... and this one was complicated to figure out at first look. After playing with it for a hour I started to fugure out how to use it. I understand it now but still do not like the software. If you have a hard time using itunes, then you will have an even harder time using this sotware. This is the only downfall I have really found with this guy. The software automatically starts to sync ALL your music in youe "My Music" folder to your Zune. (I have 80 gigs of music that I do not want on there) Another big mistake with the software.  - It only comes with a USB connection and head phones.

<Title>It's a great product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got mine yesterday and I have to say that I am pretty impressed. I was surprised at how fluid the menus moved and how well it felt in the palm of my hand. The video quality is very nice, and I like the blue glow that the thick  transparent plastic cover has. I would have gotten an Ipod, but every time I tried a demo unit out I was afraid I was going to break it. No worries about that with the Zune, it feels nice and sturdy.  I see people complain about the thickness, but I don't see what the problem is. Overall I found the software to be pretty self explanatory. I think the people that are nit picking the Zune are probably Apple fan boys, do us all a favor and go back to your steamy Steve Jobs fantasies. Leave the real reviews to people that actually own the device.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a big fan of Microsoft and what it stands for but I dont know what were they thinking with this idea!!!!!!! I was gonna buy a MP3 player about six months ago but when I heard Microsoft is coming out with its own, I decided to wait..so yesterday I got this "Zune" and tried to put it in to my laptop..I have many friends who have ipods and i have closely seen and experimented on ipods of different generations at the stores myself...and also heard how easy is to use iTunes...so when I installed Zune Marketplace...I was surprised how complicated things were...you have to sign up for this...this...and that..I was so mad..I was like all I want is to pay 99cents and download a song!!!!! after 2 hrs of playing with it I've decided to return it and buy an Apple ipod...very disapointed in Microsoft..This product looks like it was hurried to put in to the market..to compete with an Apple...

<Content>Just when you think that technology surprises have all been used up, along comes the Big M with this bad boy.  Who could have envisioned a small, hard-drive based device that plays music and video on the go?!  Wow!  Just like when they invented the video game console, I can tell that Microsoft is really onto something here.  Plus, it comes in BROWN!!!  My advice - don't just buy this player, buy some Microsoft stock.  It is clear that the technology magic is just not gonna be stopped in Redmond anytime soon!

<Title>Terrible Product
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I tried this last night and it's horrible! The scroll wheel doesn't work as well as the iPod's. It's a cheap immitation. It's basically just 4-directional arrows underneath a wheel! The iPod blows this away. Also...the sharing feature is useless! Nobody else has one. Every time I turn it on there is nobody to share with. The social isn't so social afterall.  Now the major gripe...This thing is "chunky." It's ginormous! The iPod is so much more elegant.  In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.  I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod. I highly suggest if you are looking for an mp3 player that you sing another Zune and get the iPod as well. There just isn't a better player!

<Title>Wait For The Next Generation
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 2 iPods and now a Zune.  I have always refused to buy the first year/generation of any product.  First year/generation models are always buggy.  I broke that rule and bought the Zune.  I should have waited.  The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod.  The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well.  The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either.  The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market.  I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it.  They should have anyway.  I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod.  When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video.  Buyer beware.

I bought this to put movies on for trips.  I still have not figured out where to buy them.  I hoped to find them on Zune Marketplace but if they are on there I don't know where to look.

<Content>I purchased my Zune about a month ago, had no problems installing the software on my PC.  I am 60 years old and really enjoy using my Zune with the Shuffle All option, 'cause then I am not listening to one artist all the time.  Also, I really like the FM tuner.  I have the option to listen to the radio for even more music.  I bought the 30GB but I really think I could have gotten by with an 8GB.  The Zune 30GB is a bit big and a little heavier but I do like the big screen.

The sound is full, the color sharp and bright, and the software easy to use, though the initial update the Zune goes through when you first install the software is long with very little indication of its progression status.  Still I love it and getting new music on it is a snap.  Plus, the red color is cool!

<Title>zune in question
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have installed a little over 8 gigs of music and 2 gigs of podcast. I find that when music is installed the zune picks the genre(not happy) I have yet to find out how to change it myself if able. the player works well when playing audio quality wise.the exception is when "shuffle all" is used the zune will move to a new selection in the middle of a song and this has happened multiple times.   The ability to get podcast from online is great although very slow process. I have not found how to get podcasts from a cd or dvd to install into the zune under podcasts instead of music as zune likes to put it.       I do say at this point in fairness to zune I have not fully investigated cures to these issues however they would not be issues if the software for the zune was more user friendly and informative.

<Title>30 Gig Zune
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned both the Zune and Ipod. I ended up with a Zune after my hardly used Ipod stopped working...I had the Ipod for 2 years and barely used it so I was mad when it just stopped working one day. I ended up buying a Zune because I found a deal for a 30 gig for 130.00 and I'm so happy with the Zune. I love the radio feature, how easy it is to find a certain band, the picture function, and the syncing function. My only grip with the Zune is the software. Itunes was very easy to use and I have had a hard time with the marketplace and loading music...I've finally figure it out but I wish they would make it more friendly user...I recommend the Zune over ipod...

<Title>As good if not better than Ipod
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zune 30gb for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I caught it on sale for $149 at Amazon and at that price I knew it was a bargain.  But the features and performance are what have really impressed me.  The color screen looks fantastic.  The scratch resistant case is great and it looks handsome.  The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  The little animated effects when you do different things are a nice touch.  The software is significantly different than Itunes.  But, after 15 minutes of use, you get the hang of it and I actually like it just as much if not more than Itunes.  All in all, this is a great product.  Do not hesitate to buy this over an Ipod.

<Content>I like it.  Had a Sandisk 8gb which was pretty good but wanted more memory so which one: zune or ipod.  I chose the zune for the price. I'm very happy with it.  I can put everything on it. The only problem is with the software.  It locks up on occassion.  You would think Microsoft would be able to find an easier way to program your zune. With a little work, I have been able to do what I want it to do.   I like the player so much my son got one.  He is very happy with it. I would recommend it unless you are tech-illiterate.  The software my be too complicated for you.  For the price vs. ipod, I'll buy the zune everytime.

<Title>My first dedicated media player - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software from version 1.0 to 1.1 right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though :*( so no Rush Limbaugh for me unless I start recording it.  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos on up to 5 different XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so its explains the lack of indicators, but not tactile response.

<Title>Death by a Thousand Cuts
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With Apple having sold 60 million iPods in the last 5 years, it's no wonder Microsoft felt it was necessary to go head-to-head with the iPod. Unfortunately, Zune is largely a tentative, half-baked effort. Despite the vast marketing campaign, prospective buyers should realize several important points about the Zune that isn't readily apparent in the advertisements.  1) Zune does not work with music bought from other Microsoft-backed stores like Napster and MTV's Urge.   2) The Zune's screen is physically larger, but has exactly the same resolution as the iPod: 320x240 pixels. You don't see more of anything - everything is just blown up to a larger size which can result in a larger but fuzzier image.  3) A lot of reviews like to quote how the Zune's battery life is "comparable" to the iPod. Unfortunately for Zune, it's only comparable when you compare it to the 30 GB iPod, which is significantly smaller and lighter than the Zune. The Zune's 14 hours of music playback doesn't look so impressive when compared to the 80 GB iPod, which is still physically smaller and lighter than the Zune. The 80 GB iPod plays 20 hours of music on a full charge and 6 hours of video, vastly outlasting the Zune.   You could play the 80 GB iPod at work almost a full work day (minus lunch) and still have about the same battery life as a fully charged Zune.  4) The Zune doesn't contain a lot of extras that are standard fare on the iPod. There's no Contacts, no Calendar, no Alarm Clock, no Sleep Timer, no Games (Tetris, Texas Hold 'Em Poker, PacMan, etc), no Screen Lock to prevent others from accessing your iPod's information without knowing your combination.  5) Zune does not support Audible Audiobooks.  6) You cannot share videos with Zune, only music.  7) There is no bookmarking feature - Zune will not remember if you stopped playing a song in the middle. The iPod will resume playing songs or audiobooks (see #5) at the point you stopped them.  8) Zune cannot be used as a external hard disk. The iPod can be used as a portable hard drive, which is handy for storing Word documents or other data (even application installers).  9) Songs purchased in the Zune marketplace involves buying Microsoft "points" at the rate of 400 points for $5.00. Since songs cost 79 points (not $0.99 cents), if you buy 1 song, Microsoft gets to hold 321 points or $4.01 of your money in an interest-bearing account until you decide to use them. In effect, consumers are giving Microsoft thousands of interest-free micro loans.  And with songs costing 79 points (a prime number), it is practically impossible to buy songs in a way where you can use up all your points. The system is designed to ALWAYS result in left-over points, which is basically unredeemed cash that Microsoft can take to the bank. It's not enough for Microsoft to make money by actually selling you a song - they need to make money off the money you don't (i.e. can't) spend at the Zune store because they priced songs at such a uneven number like 79 points.  10) Microsoft is giving Universal Music a cut for every Zune sold, on the premise that owners of MP3 players have tons of stolen music that Universal will never get paid for. Basically, even if all your music comes legally purchased from the Zune music store or ripped from music CDs that you bought, you are basically agreeing to pay a "stolen music" tax to Universal.  Given all these compromises, does a Zune's wireless sharing really seem all that appealing to you? After all, in order to share songs, you need to find another Zune user. I suspect that event will occur only slightly more frequently than winning the lottery for quite a while, which basically makes the wireless feature worthless.  To put it another way, it might be cool to be the first person on the block with a telephone, but the excitement will die quickly when you realize there's no one to call.

<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had a chance to go through a Zune software install with a friend. OOOOOOOPS, he was running Vista. ZUNE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VISTA. Do not buy a Zune if you are running the Vista beta unless you have another PC or you must reinstall XP.  He had another PC with XP and loaded the Zune software on it. Install went OK after a couple of crashes, it appeared as if it had something to do with being a Guest. (Microsoft really should rethink the goofy pictures and Social references used in the install process.)  He moved some of his music over from the Vista machine to XP machine. OOOOOOPS, ZUNE ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH MUSIC HE PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THROUGH MICROSOFT PLAYSFORSURE FOR HIS HIS DELL DJ (That was a showstopper for him).  As far as the Zune player. MP3's he had ripped at 160mhz sounded fine. The volume control is not very linear though, tough to adjust it to the exact volume you want. The larger screen is nice but not as crisp as the iPod. They are the same resolution so that makes sense. The unit is a bit clunky compared to the iPod but overall it felt pretty sturdy. The software on the unit is nice. Easy to search and album art fills the screen.  FWIW - He is returning this Zune and will wait for Zune 2.

<Title>My first dedicated portable media player purchase - a review
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Zune Review  Firstly, I would like to say this is not a comparison to an IPOD. I haven't owned one, though I have played with several other brands of MP3 players.  Most of my media playback experience comes from using a PocketPC and 1gig memory card addons.  Packaging: I was concerned when I first pulled my brown Zune out of its VERY NICE packaging because I couldn't find a charger or much of anything else.  After a few hesitant moments, I found cool compartments in the package that contained headphones, a little brown soft-cloth baggy and a USB connection cord.  Install: I put the included CD in and it not only set up my drivers, registered and installed an interface/media player for the laptop, but also synced my stuff and upgraded the internal Zune software right away (claiming to give me more stable and faster network sharing).  It required that I have internet access naturally for this step, but that's cool with me.  Power: It has a lithium ion battery, which means long battery life without the 'memory' problems associated with earlier battery types. No charger!  The battery was showing only a partial charge right out of the box, but I happily found that it gathered its charge from the small trickle provided by the USB port.  Very nice, no more boxy power supplies!!!  Graphics: Wow. Big bright screen (compared to my Pocket PC).  Menus fade in and grow and slide around very much like those in Windows XP Media Center Edition. Synced pictures on it? Then you can use them for your background. Those get faded, resized, rotated, zoomed and all that other jazz for you depending on what you are doing.  Audio: I played with some ripped Mp3s and wma files I had on my laptop (they automatically synced to the Zune for me) and they sounded great with the provided ear buds (the ear buds are magnetically attracted to one another which prevents them from getting tangled up in your pocket). The bass response was VERY nice.  I haven't even bothered messing with the equalizer yet, but I saw it in there.  The FM radio has scanning and presets available for you, and you can set it to which ever continent you happen to be on. No AM though. Would it have hurt to put AM on it too? Why not?  Video: The included video clips are way crisp with no lag. They are vivid on the screen and the sync even grabbed all of my TaeKwonDo belt test videos and shrank them to be viewed on the Zune.  The Settings show that you can broadcast your videos to the XBOX 360s in your home (I don't even have one yet, but it's the thought that counts).  One video format I would like to have seen supported by Zune is the .dvr-ms format used by Windows Media Center.  I found a plug-in to convert that format to .wmv format which syncs automatically (even if conversions are needed) and plays fine with the Zune however.   Controls: I am not so certain I like the wheel control yet; there is no tactile feedback (meaning, no little bumps to tell you which portion of the wheel you happen to be pushing on in the event you aren't looking). Nothing on the wheel to indicate which way is scan, volume, select or what-not, but the documentation or push-to-test works well enough. I understood later as I was viewing videos in Landscape mode that the Up-Down-Left-Right was changeable, so it explains the lack of indicators, but not the lack of tactile response.  Overall: I am very pleased with my purchase. I chose the brown version because it matches (to some extent) the interior of my wood-grained Bimmer; and because to be `cool' one should be different.  When I hear all of the IPOD bigots saying the Zune sux `cause it ain't an IPOD, I wonder what ever happened to `Think Different'.

<Title>Zune  Vs  Zen  or iPod?
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my daughter a Zune for Christmas to replace her Micro Zen because she wanted something that played video. Now I really liked her Zen, but the Zune is 100% better. I brought it home and installed the software no problem and the Zune synced to her computer and transfered all her music automatically. The Zune sounds better than her Zen in my opinion, very crisp and clear. It is bigger but feels very good in hand. It's sturdy and feels solid. It feels like the kind of device, if jostled around in a book bag, purse, or accidentally dropped, that it would handle the abuse. (Her Zen already has a shaky connection where the earphones go so there is static if the device is moved around.) The controls are very easy to use and it seems to move effortlessly under my finger tips. The scroll layout is such a better design than the Zen. Now I don't own an iPod, but I have tried them out several times in the stores. I like the Zune's scroll better, because the iPod scroll goes too fast for me and I have to back track to get to a song or artist. Again the iPod seemed fragile to me compared to the Zune. The 3 inch screen is wonderful! It is bright and clear and the video playback is excellent...I love to watch it.  You can customize the background with any pictures that you download and watch a slide show while you listen to music. Now I feel she won't need the wireless feature for a while (I don't think a lot of her friends will have Zunes, they all have iPods), but that is not why I bought the Zune.  I cannot comment on the Zune Marketplace for purchasing songs. The Zune will now go back in the box until Christmas. The Software is uninstalled from her computer.

<Title>Wait for next gen or buy an iPod
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've used an iPod and Sony MP3 players for as long as they existed. My first impressions with the Zune:  I hated Sony for cornering me into using their own crappy software and compression, I guess you get that too with the Zune. The interface and software (iTunes) on the iPod is way more polished. iTMS offers incomparable music purchase experience.   Sound quality is better on the iPod (and even better if you invest in decent ear buds.)   The fact that the battery doesn't run that long on a Zune is a big turn off, I need it to run during my commute, and this is not lasting as long as the iPod 5G.   Screen is bigger on the Zune but same resolution so who cares because the video quality (compression) is what makes a difference and I don't want my videos to take more space!   The HD size is 30GB so there is no choice of 80GB model?   And what's up with the brown model? Yuk!  Wireless is useless: sharing DRM protected songs with other Zunes withing 3 feet is a meh for me. I can't use wireless to sync with my PC, why?   DRM on the Zune is also a big turn off. Play4sure incompatible with new software? What's up with that?   With the iPod, I download songs from iTMS and burn them to CDs. It removes the DRM and I don't get stock with Apple if I don't have to (think long term investment.) I can't do that with the Zune. Microsoft by releasing a  DRM that breaks compatibility with previous DRM already showed that we can't rely on them for supporting anything in the future.   End of line: Wait for a better model or get an iPod from Christmas.

<Title>First: Own the device. Second: Realize that the iPod is not incredible. Third: Neither is the Zune, but it is definately good.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the player yesterday, and so far I have only been happy with it. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the DRM issues and because I would've liked a little more battery life. That said, both of those issues don't bother me much at all, and I have been able to work around both of them. Also, no player is perfect.   The player itself is well designed. The interface is well constructed and easy to navigate. So easy in fact that they don't include a manual with the player, and that won't impede your using it. I haven't worked much with the zune software, though from what I have done it seems well designed. The whole marketplace issues don't really matter to me because I buy actual cd's, but for those who live in cyberspace, I can see where complaints come from.  For all of the criticisms against the body design, I have this to say. You are all comparing the zune to a device that is thin, fragile, fingerprints to an abscene degree, and has a nasty habit of crashing on its loyal customers. Apple has marketed the iPod brilliantly and have done a fairly good job designing a player, and as we have seen they develope quite the loyal fanbase. They are not perfect. And neither is the zune.  It's not tiny, but then again calling it huge is a relative term. It's the size of a normal mp3 player from a few years ago, and no one complained then, and I'm not complaining now. It sounds good, and these are the only earbud headphones I have decided to use, and I like to think I care about teh quality of my music. It's comfortable to hold and use. That's the bottom line.  My advice: consider this player if you are on the market for an mp3 player. Go to a store and try a floor model for yourself. Form your own opinion and realize that it is my opinion, not yours, that the player is well designed and has potential.  Also, both Gates and Jobs are full of themselves. In concept I like apple. In practice I admit I use microsoft. Neither should be preached about or have a blind fanbase.

<Title>Finally, something better than an iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The brown Zune looks great and works great too! The software is excellent (makes it easy to pull down album art), the interface on the device is great, and I just got finished watching Garden State on my Zune after converting it to WMV from my purchased DVD (you will need extra, although free, software to do this).   Don't believe all the negative buzz about this product. As a person who has owned three iPods (1G, 3G, and 1G nano), this thing is superior (and FAR less scratchable).   I called Zune tech support to get some help, and I talked to a real person within two minutes. They were actually friendly and helpful, unlike Apple.

<Content>Don't waste your time with this product. It isn't that the device is bad, it's actually pretty good, but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update. To show you how bad this software is, Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems!!! Instead of developing the web site, maybe they should should've made a better effort on the software. If you don't mind headaches, wasted hours, and never getting the program to work correctly, then by all means buy this. Otherwise I suggest the iPod. The higher price is worth it.

<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this and the instructions SAY NOTHING about draining the device completely before you try to charge it. I had to call tech support to find this out. You have to do this in order to get it to charge...  then after it doesnt respond (try pressing play after an hour and if nothing happens) charge it on your USB... within about 5-10 minutes you will see the zune logo pop on the screen and start downloading the firmware. I hated this whole draining part.. but I love the product! 5 stars!

<Content>I hate iTunes, so i choose to avoid iPods.  This is the best MP3 player i've had so far.  Much better than previous units from Creative Labs that kept malfunctioning...  Pros:  Very easy to use, fantastic looking screen/menues/navigation, even the software is pretty intuitive.  Compatible with xbox 360 which is kind of neat.  Lots of space.  Cons: battery life kinda sucks, i usually have to charge it at the end of every day so it's good to go for tomorrow.

Kind of wish I had paid extra to get the 2nd generation 80GB because it is not as bulky. But I am very satisfied with the 30GB Zune(1st Gen). I like the screen. Big and colorful. The software is easy to understand and the battery last a long time.

There is no documentation whatsoever to help you learn how to use this; you have to depend solely on online forums all over the internet.  The software is confusing, and I'm fairly tech-savvy.  The Zune is just trying to be too many things to too many people and is failing miserably at all of them.  I received it as a gift; I feel bad that I don't like it but it is AWFUL!

<Title>Great Portable Media Player!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my black Zune today and have been very happy with it so far. I did not have an MP3 Player before and the only "portable" devices I used for music & video were my Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC, thus I never bought any music online and did not have to worry about any previous Windows Media DRM protected files not playing on the player.  I do understand why a lot of iPod/Creative/Sandisk/iRiver/Archos owners may want to defend their products by trying to point out flaws in Zune. That's fine, but for someone in the market for an MP3 player for the first time, the Zune is a great product with the hardware (Wi-Fi) to provide extensibility in the future via firmware updates. The menus and song listings are very well organized and easy-to-navigate resembling Windows Media Center Edition.  All in all I've had great experiences with it so far and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for an MP3/Video Player.

<Content>This is a great product. I just love it. I bought mine on the 14th Nov and have been playing with it. I was able to load the software without any problem and the Zune software on the device is really cool. In my opinion its at par with iPod if not better.  The big screen really does make a difference. But small thing like the ability to personalize it with one's own pic is really good. I have a pic on mine which I had taken with my new Nikon D70 and now my Zune screams that it belongs to me. The FM radio is a good bonus.I think it's a really good start and things are only going to get better.  Rohit

<Title>Gets the basics right: excellent sound, easy to use, and fast sync
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love portable music players, (I have a 60Gb video iPod and a Sansa e270), and the Zune is a welcome addition.  Despite all the buzz over its wireless capabilities I find that it nails the basics, and that is the primary reason I am giving it 5 stars:  Screen: Bright, big, and easy on the eyes.  While a touch less sharp and crisp than video on the iPod, I appreciate the larger screen.  Controls: Very easy to use and make sense.  iPod users will want the center button to turn, but once you get used to the fact it's more like the directional pad on a videogame controller, it's just as effective.  Sound: *Excellent* sound.  Rich bass, decent equalizer, and if you want loud, it gets loud.  (Crucial for me so I can hear it over the roar of the subway on my commute)  Menus: Much like windows media player.  Attractive, easy to use and navigate.  A few things seem to take an extra click than expected, but I find the layout and flow intuitive.  Radio: Does the job, and is nice to have.  PC software:  If you've used Urge on WMP 11, then the 'Zune Marketplace' will look very very familiar.  It's easy to use, and I really like that you just start typing in something to search for, and it shows you how many artists, albums, or song names were found that contain what you're looking for, and you can then quickly go through them and find what you wanted.    Synchronization:  FAST!  This is critical for me, since I'm constantly shuttling music off and on my player.  I like having a music subscription service option, and since I am always sampling new CDs and such, having fast sync is necessary.  Wireless: I don't find the option to share songs wirelessly very compelling.  I'm hoping for future enhancements that will let me sync wirelessly, or perhaps even download directly to the Zune and bypass my PC someday (like the Music Gremlin mp3 player).  But, that's not possible for now, so I see this as a feature with lots of potential not realized yet.  Style: About as large as a first generation iPod, but seems lighter.  I really like the grippy rubber fingerprint-resistant feel of it.  Not as stylish, but much more practical.  XBox 360: I have one, and enjoy that I can use my XBox live account with the Zune, and also share music with my Xbox with it.  Capacity:  Would like the option to have more than 30Gb, but 30 is more than enough, since the fast sync makes it easy to swap when needed.  Overall, I'm really happy with the Zune so far.  I think it's going to be my player-of-choice for quite awhile to come.

<Title>The Zune vs the iPod 30gb video
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I want to give major kudos to Microsoft for putting out a very solid, iPod competitor. I purchased a Zune on it's first day out, and I must say that it has some major benefits over the current 5th Generation iPod. Currently, I own both a 30gb iPod Video and the 30gb Zune. I will try and be as unbiased and accurate as possible. This review will focus on  the Zune's strong points vs the Apple 30gb video iPod.  Section 1: External Look and feel  I will be the first to admit that when I first saw a picture of the Zune I thought it still had a ways to go, but the more pictures I saw (and even more once I held saw one in the store) the more I began to love how unique it is. The semi-transparent, rubberish exterior is a joy to hold. I was torn between Brown and Black, but I ended up with Brown because it had a nice vintage, cool feel to it. The Black is very impressive as well. It is very sleek and the blue double-shot makes it look very modern. Sitting next to my Black iPod it looks better, the only thing that I don't like is that the circle cover over the 4 way controls is slightly loose (on mine) and it makes it feel a little cheaper than the iPod. This thing is rugged and durable, though. Something that I never felt about my iPod. When I first purchased my iPod, I immediately put it into a thick case, while with the Zune it feels like it's already to go, whether it be in my pocket, backpack or on the seat of my car. I find it funny that people call it a brick as a derogatory nickname, when it feels very durable (like a brick teehee)  Section 2: Navigation on the Zune  Hands down Zune knocks the iPod out of the park for me. If you have looked around at other players, the Zune uses the Toshiba Gigabeat-style navigation and it's quite seamless. It's brilliant. You use your left and right buttons on the center "wheel" to Navigate through your Artists, Albums, Playlists, Songs, etc. then you vertically scroll to each song, picture or video. It's hard to explain, but it is very quick and easy to use. Once you have a song playing, you press the center button to get a range of easy to select options (5-Star Rating System, Show song list, Shuffle, Repeat, send, and flag). With the iPod you have to pan through these options rather than seeing them all at once. The iPod does not have the quick shuffle and quick repeat options that Zune has readily available on each song you play. The learning curve for using the Zune menus is practically non-existent. Finding songs on the iPod is no less difficult, but these quick options and ease of use are really what sets the Zune apart.  One thing I haven't mentioned is how good it looks while you are navigating your content. The subtle yet very noticeable animations when going between songs are very tasteful. That's not to say that the iPod's menus are not tasteful as well, but the Zune gives you a little more life that makes it better (imho). All in all you will fly through your tunes on the Zune. I found myself listening to 10 seconds of each song just because I liked jumping through the menus. I know, I'm a geek; but hey, they look good! The only thing that I noticed that was bad about the animations is that the Anti-Aliasing (type smoothing) seems to disappear when changing menus. This is barely noticable and isn't a deterrent for me at all. It's just something that I noticed.  Skipping to different parts of Audio and Video is better with the iPod's scroll wheel. The Zune does well though, it seems when holding down the right button (fast forward) it has 4 speeds that it cycles through pending how long you hold it (the longer you hold the faster it goes). With the iPod it's easier to let your thumb pace the speed that you want to navigate.   That's not to say that the Zune's buttons are bad. I prefer the Zune buttons over the iPod's for one reason really. The scroll wheel was just too hard to use while driving. I constantly found myself over scrolling songs. With the Zune, you can easily see that the tack you want is X amount of clicks away. It makes it much easier to keep your eyes on the road.  Section 3: Audio and Video playback  Being a musician and somewhat of an audiophile I can say that the Zune and iPod are on pretty level playing fields when it comes to audio playback. I did a quick switch using the Zune's headphones on both the Zune and my iPod and couldn't notice a difference. I went back and forth at least 10 times on a few songs at and I couldn't tell a difference. The iPod has more EQ presets than the Zune does, but the Zune's cover a decent enough range (not that I wouldn't mind having more).  As for video I'm going to give a little to both competitors. The Zune has bright colors and a very clear screen, but with the pre-loaded videos I saw more grain than I'm used to coming from the iPod. The iPod screen is pretty much perfect besides the size. Videos and photos are crystal clear.  Viewing photos is a more pleasurable experience on the Zune because it seems to be just as clear as the iPod, and the screen is bigger. I'm not sure why viewing video suffers and viewing photos doesn't on the Zune, but with the pre-loaded content that's the way it looks. I still prefer the bigger screen over a small loss in video quality.  Section 4: Zune Features Wi-Fi and FM Radio  I just want to quickly highlight the FM Radio and the Wi-Fi features of the Zune. I'm about an hour away from the Cities and the Zune's Radio reception has been poor so far. It seems pretty inconsistent where I am. Almost to the point of not being able to use it. This was pretty disappointing. The wireless has been so dumbed down that it's practically worthless for me. As of now the Zune doesn't have a big fan base. I'm doing my best to get my friends interested, but as it stands I don't have anyone to share my tunes with. It's disappointing to have a feature with such strong potential and not use it to it's full extent. The Wi-Fi being the thing that's supposed to separate the Zune from the iPod, takes a huge blow right away because of the uphill battle that Microsoft has to fight to get more users.  Section 5: Zune Software and Wrap-up  I'll be brief (for once) the Zune Marketplace is an elegant easy-to-use piece of software. It imported my music seemlessly and is a breeze to find the artists you know and discover ones you don't. I hope their playlists become a little more robust in the future because as of now they are pretty thin. The player handles music and ratings beautifully. It has a pretty straight-forward interface. I do like iTunes way of displaying how much and what type of data you have on your iPod. I haven't seen anything as nice as that in the Zune Marketplace.  In closing, I'll give you one of my main reasons for getting the Zune in four words. All You Can Eat. I am a person who wants to try out as many different artists as I want with no commitment (other than $15/mo of course). With the Zune Pass, I flew through their labyrinth of music files (still 1 million less than iTunes) and found tons of artists to stack my 30gb with. Most people like to own their music and that's well and good, but if Apple had a subscription service, I may not have purchased the Zune.  The Zune is a GREAT player, which I feel is much better than the iPod. If this is your first time buying a mp3 player, get the Zune. It's the hands down winner. More features, bigger screen, beautiful interface, very stable and has a little more personality than the iPod. If you're already an iPod owner and don't need things like wi-fi, fm radio and subscription based music, the Zune probably isn't worth a possibly expensive switch.  I'm lovin' my Zune, though. I've been having so much more fun with it than my iPod, but that's just me. Go over to Target or BestBuy if you can to check it out!  -=Edit=- 11/17/06  Section 6: What the Zune is missing   It has been brought to my attention that I missed a few key points. I am not a 'fanboy' of either Microsoft or Apple. These were mute points for me, but I realize that some people may really want some of these functions. The biggest one is that the iPod can be used as a portable mass storage device while the Zune cannot (currently). With the iPod you just plug it in and you have the ability to create folders. The iPod has a whole extras section that's missing from the Zune. I didn't remember to mention them because I never used them. They are:   1. Clock  I have not found a clock on the Zune. I wouldn't mind having one, I usually go to my cell phone before I go to my mp3 player to check the time.  2. Games The games that come on the iPod are pretty basic, but they beat Zune's wopping 0 games. Personally, I played them about one time.  3. Contacts You have the ability to add contact information ranging from phone numbers to web addresses and home addresses. I didn't use this feature.  4. Calendar The iPod has built in Calendar functionality.  5. Notes This is one that is actually going to be hard to lose. I often would throw directions to new locations right on to my iPod to save me the 'trouble' of printing. It was a nice convenience that you will have to live without. Notes work by dragging text documents to your iPod notes folder. I never had any problems with it. The text rendering is pretty basic.  6. Stop Watch The iPod has a nice little stop watch built in. I never used it, but I'd assume it would be nice for more active people than I.  7. I may have mentioned this, but the Zune Marketplace has about 1 Million less songs than iTunes and currently doesn't have any videos available for download where as iTunes has a plethora of tv shows and movies to choose from. I was always aware of this, but I have no doubt that Microsoft will be expanding it's library pretty fast. They have a lot of catching up to do.  In closing (again?) The Zune is the right player for me because of all of the points that I have mentioned. The iTunes has a lot more of the smaller features that I don't really appreciate as much in a PMP. Most of the extras on the iPod I do on my phone. But the mass storage thing is a pretty huge hit, and even though I haven't sold my iPod yet I already miss my notes. The Zune has some tweaks that definitely could help it out, but it is a joy to use as is. When it comes to listening to music and ease of use, the Zune is the winner imho. I will give the iPod credit for it's larger amount of extra features.   If I could change my rating of the Zune, it would be a 4.  I hope this helped Cheers

The menus are easy and the buttons are right where they should be.  Sound quality is very good. The large screen is large and bright. Movie quality is on par as well.  The only thing I dont like is that the sync is all taged based and does not show up as a drive.

<Title>Zuned Out
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Microsoft is taking on Apple in the multimedia player market. Well, Microsoft is a marketing company. They will sell some units. As this is the first release of Zune, there are bound to be some less-than-favorable problems (features). First, if you own a Mac, forget it!  Zune only works with Windows (and not with Vista pre-release.) Commercial media can only be purchased from the Zune store. (No iTunes support, not even under Windows). A typical song costs 79 points. (Points need to be purchased in advance, in five dollar increments for 400 points.) You can purchase subscriptions, for unlimited music downloads, at a fixed monthly charge. If you typically download more than 15 songs in a month, this option may be appealing. Zune is wireless, which has some interesting potential. You can send a song from your Zune to your friend's Zune. BUT, it will only play three times or for three days, whichever comes first. Battery life is rated 13 to 14 hours (depending if wireless is on or off.) On a full charge, the most I saw was about 9 1/2 hours. Although the screen is larger than that of an iPod, the image quality is not as good as you would hope.  There are a couple of good points... There is a built-in FM receiver. Sound quality is reasonably good. I am waiting to see what the next generation is like. But for now, I'll stick with my Mac and an iPod, thank you.

<Title>Zune is Great!  The Software isn't.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this the day it came out because I got the urge the night before.  I immediately had buyer's remorse.  I knew that I hardly ever used my last two (now defunct) iPods, and figured that this would be no different.  Luckily these fears have been put to rest for the most part.  As far as the reviews on Amazon right now I would venture to say that anyone who gave this thing 1 star hasn't bought it and are one of the many rabid Apple fanboys that would buy a quarter for $5 if Steve Jobs made it.  I would also venture to say that the people who gave the Zune 5 stars are maybe a little overzealous.  Yes I did give it a 5, but thats only because theres no 4.5.  The actual Zune unit itself is outstanding.  Its close to the same size as the iPod, costs the same, and offers way more features.  Looks are in the eye of the beholder but personally I think the iPods are starting to look old, and they really aren't very reliable.  The Zune has personality.  The menus are outstanding compared to the iPod.  There are nice subtle animations and everything moves smoothly, something you can't always say about the iPod.  Plus when you hold the Zune you feel like it can fend for itself in you pocket, whereas the iPod would get scratched if you so much as looked at it (exageration).  The Zune is almost, but not quite perfect.  Now the software that comes with Zune...  Thats a whole other story.  Its probably perfect for the average user who just wants to get songs on their device, but me, I like to know everything thats going on.  The software doesn't allow you to choose the install directory, and the first time it starts up it will import just about every song, and most pictures and videos it can find on you computer into the Library.  Something I didn't want it to do.  I don't know if there is something wrong with my songs, but most of the ones that didnt have album art were assigned the wrong covers.  Overall the Zune software is better than Apple's first attempt at iTunes, but nowhere near where it should be.  I didn't mark the unit down much for this because its something that can, and will be improved over the coming months.  Summary: Hardware: Outstanding, a true competitor to iPod if it catchs on. Software: Has a long way to go before the entire process is perfected.

<Title># 82 Best Selling Electronics
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One week after launch, the Zune is being outsold by all iPods, two Sandisk media players, and a Creative media player - OUCH.  Falling all the way to # 82 on the electronics volume selling list...  Read the reviews before purchasing - major software installation problems.  Not compatible with Vista currently.  You must buy fake Zune points to purchase music.  The monthly subscription option does not include all music - you still must purchase the most popular songs separately.  Microsoft launched the player before it was ready - no podcasting support, the list goes on...

<Title>a real owner of a zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The zune is really hot.  people are trying to say that it doesn't play all formats but if you remmebered the ipod didn't play as much as it do now when it first came out.  If you need an mp3 i would choose this one because i sure that microsoft will release updates that allow more formats and many more goodies to be unlocked on the zune.  The software is a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it is really nice. when i had my ipod, it kept breaking, glitches ran a muck and please don't forget, almost every time you turn on you computer there was an update.  So please don't be ignorant and complain about it lack of software.  Just give it time and it will be one of the best mp3 out.

<Title>It's not what it looks like
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's not supported in Vista.  The Wi-Fi is not useful So far I cannot get the Wi-Fi to do anything.  I can't get it to connect to the internet, that's not supported. I can't play or download songs directly from the Zune via WiFi. I can't sync to my computer with WiFi. Wi-Fi will search for and find other Zunes nearby.  (no one else has one and I doubt they will for a while) If someone else had one I could send songs for a couple of plays.   The screen and such... The screen is nice but video and images look about the same as they do on the iPod.  To me there's no real difference except the sideways video thing that increases the viewable area minimally.  The navigation button thing... It only looks like a click wheel.  It's a funky hard to get used to button thing.  I'm used to the iPod that has always had an easy natural feel.  This is a "clunky" way to navigate compared to the iPod.  The software and music store is unnatural and confusing. why points?  why not just dollar amounts?

<Title>Nice product
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was amazed how easy the Zune is to operate. Clicking through files was as easy as operating a PC. You can't do a lot with it other than storage, but that is what the Zune is about. Not crazy about the FM tuner reception. It is great if you want your music, pictures or video to show to family and friends without pulling the old photo album or box out of the basement. The Zune holds tons of material and you can take it anywhere so you don't need a pickup truck to haul all your archived material. You can take it to your friends and family and hook it right up to their TV. Well satisfied.

<Content>I really like the Zune, it has a lot more memory tha the other mp3 players, and you pay the same price that you would pay for the other types. Plus, I was even able to get it in my favorite color, so it's a double bonus for me. It's also cool that you can share music with other Zune owners (even though you can only play it three times). I recommend this product for anyone who listens to a lot of (or different variations of) music. This thing Rocks!!!

<Title>I told my Ipod "Say hello to ebay!"
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Within one week of owning a Zune, my Ipod 30 gig was thrown on ebay. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my Zune, and the features are too great for me to ever want anything else. I did keep my ipod nano (the screen has malfunctioned on its own twice) for jogging, because I wouldn't risk dropping my zune. If you want to be a boring nerd and whine on the internet about screen resolution, and you need an alarm clock and notepad on your Ipod, hey, your a loser and maybe the Ipod is for you. If you want the most for your money and you really couldnt care less about pixels, and just want what looks feels and sounds better....get yourself a Zune. put that ipod on ebay!!

<Title>Zune Purchase
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was very pleased with the recent purchase of the 30g Zune. There were a couple of issues I ran into when downloading: First I found that I loaded 800 or more songs from my cd's and after loaded I deleted some of them to find that when I synced it the songs deleted were removed from my Zune. That was very frustrating. A book with directions and FAQ would have been most beneficial then I would not have had to look all over the internet to find out what the problem was. Overall I do like my zune

<Title>Zune meets the mark!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was a little discouraged about getting a Zune at first, but like so often happens, I found it on Amazon for a price that I couldn't pass up. I went ahead and bought it and when I received it I took a little time to figure it out, but once I got it all program up and running I found that it more than met the mark with what I was looking for. With 30 GB worth of room on it, I've got photo album after photo album on it along with about 3,000 songs and I'm down from 27.7 GB to 24.3 (approx.).   The only thing that I don't like about it is that the battery seems to discharge while its on or off, so I'm constently charging it.  Other than that, I have used it about every day since I've had it and that's been about a month. Great product, get the battery situation worked out and it would be a perfect product!

<Title>Finally the killer has arrived. Look beyond ipods. Why you should avoid Ipod.
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have never liked Apple for its over the edge proprietary control over products and services it offers. What is really disturbing is that people are willingly submitting to apples ridiculus controlling methods. For example not allowing your purchased music to transfer back to PC after a reinstallation or in case of getting a new PC.   Having said that, lets take a look at Zune and compare with ipods. First lets talk about features that Ipods lack.  - Wi-Fi. Oh yes, it will probably be on the next generation ipods, but unlike apple fans, we won't go crazy complaining it was copied from Zune.  - Wireless sharing of music. If apple doesn't even allow paid customers to transfer back their purchased music (from ipod) to a new pc or after a reinstallation, do you think they will allow "sharing" of music? dream on.  File Formats : Stubborn apple doesn't support WMA format. Oh man, don't they love to hate Microsoft although Microsoft saved Apple when it was struggling to survive? But why do you want WMA format? It is because nearly ALL the online music vendors except Apple distributes music in WMA format. So when you get an ipod, you are stuck to Itunes, and Itunes only. Zune in addition to playing WMA, MP3, it plays AAC, JPEG,WMV, MPEG-4, H.264 files as well.   Build Quality : Ipods don't even qualify to be compared in this category. Zune is rigid, solidly, very well built gadget. Even without any kind of cases, it is not scratch prone. Ipods need those expensive fancy cases, but even then they are so easily scratched. Zune has round edges with high quality plastic layer to protect the screen.   Display : Zune can be used and navigated in a horizontal or vertical view. Beat that ipod! Oh did I mention Zune has a larger, brighter display than Ipods. Afterall it is no fun watching video in a lilliputian ipod screen.   Navigation : I really loved it. What a slap in the face of Apple fanbase. Now they won't be able to complain Zune stole the navigational wheel as if nobody else on earth has any creativity. It is not a click-wheel like IPods. Navigation is vertical. It is common sense, the shortest distant from one point to another is a line, not a circle. So that means you can navigate faster using a vertical navigation. Zune navigation is fast and works very well than wheel.   I personally prefer something that is of open architechture, that gives consumer more choices, more flexibility. It is true that not many mp3 players have come and gone, but Zune has a good backing. There are of course better digital players than both ipods and Zune, but because many of those companies are small and don't have enough to allocate for advertising, their products remain unknown. I mean you go everywhere, you see ipod ads. That is the sole reason for their success because it lacks in features and substance. So it needs a way of tricking people. Much like they annoyoing PC-vs-Mac guy ads. They say, if you repeat a lie 10 times, it becomes the truth. Apple says ipods are the best, we hordes of sheep say "oh yes allmighty apple, I'm honored to buy an inferior product, I'm happy to be given only one choice, .."   Cowon (iaudio, jetaudio) makes some of the BEST music players. Creative makes great soundcards but its mp3 players have been very disappointing. And finally IRiver is also good choice. Do your research, know what you are getting unless you are one of those blind apple fan who will reject everything non-apple.   It is time to put a stop to Apples manipulation.  WAKE UP people.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On another note, it seems that I got a defective Zune (why would this be the case since it's the first batch of devices?). Anyway, the battery status is very inconsistent and moving up and down. I only played the Zune for 15 minutes and the battery is now half and falling below that margin after a fully charged.   Being very nice to the device, I also turn off the Wireless feature, just to conserve on battery (what a joke that was). And yes! It was fully charged before I started using it.   Contacted Amazon for a refund on this thing.

<Content>I actually really love this thing! Everything works as it should and the screen is the reason I bought this. It's great to watch videos and movies on this. I also have an Ipod, but I am giving that to my wife. Videos and pictures look way better on the Zune, and the navigation is easier to use than the Ipod. Surprisingly, the sound quality out of the Zune is better than my Ipod too.   The software that runs with the Zune is good but it will be great when their music catalog is more up to speed with the number of tracks available in Itunes. The Zune software is not as good as the Zune itself - yet. Sync works great for music, video, and pictures.

<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never owned an iPod, so since Zune hit the market I'd thought I'd check it out. Went to my local retailer and was able to do some hands on comparing the iPod and Zune. The iPod had a much better feel and was lighter. The sound qualty was the same (using the same set of head phones for each). The scrolling was easier on the iPod. The Zune is larger than the iPod, the iPod felt right in my hand. The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods. Now as far as software installation, I don't know. but when I walked out of the store, an iPod came home with me. The iPod software installed quickly, works smoothly with iTunes. I am so glad I compare first! I say get an iPod!

<Title>Why all the hatred?
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What's up with all the animosity?  I can't see why anyone would rate this product a 1 star.  The only thing that comes to mind is the few ignorant Ipod loyalists that haven't really spent the time to figure this out.  I too love my Ipod but I'm also open to new ideas.   For most people, an Ipod is everything they need.  It's in it's 5th generation, it's small, compact, well polished, the software is getting there, and it has tremendous aftermarket support.  But for me, it lacks some features that should've been introduced from Apple a long long time ago.  Apple's market monopoly is holding back and releasing as slow as possible to milk us.  Simple.  Now that Microsoft, with it's deep pockets, introduced their Zune, Apple will have no choice but to get things moving.  That's good for us, the consumer.  So why all the hate?  If you're an Ipod lover, you should be happy that Microsoft got things rolling.  Because, after all the smoke clears, we're the true winners.  In my industry, when I get visitors from competing Japanese firms, they're nothing but inquisitive.  They don't look at my products and stick their noses up in the air and say that they're products are superior.  They want to learn everything about our operation.  Microsoft's been quiet for 5 years.. maybe they've learned a thing or two.  About the Zune.. It's big.  Ofcourse.. it has a protective case already wrapped around it.  All you need is a screen protector.  It has a 44% larger screen.  That I don't really care for too much because a 3" screen is still a 3" screen lol.  Can't wait until Apple or MS brings out a 4.5" or something.  The Zune also has wireless built-in.  And an outstanding digital radio.  I can zoom in on my images too.  And the screen doesn't scratch like my Ipod.   (Why the heck were Ipod's so easily scratched?  Was that Apple's way of negotiating with 3rd party case manufacturers?  That was lame!  Easily the biggest reason I hated my Ipod.  So beautiful yet had to be covered by some ugly cover)   Screen resolution..  Have you ever seen a Sony PSP with it's beautifully large 4.3" widescreen?  It's got a software limited 368x208.  The Zune has a 320x240 resolution in a standard 4:3 ratio.  If you discount the extra horizontal resolution the PSP has due to it's wider screen, the Zune is sharper!  Click wheel.. Ipod's click wheel was neat at first but I got tired of it real fast.  I was never 100% precise with it and would often overshoot my songs.  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  Seriously, why spin your thumbs around in circles when you can easily just hold down a button?  The Zune scrolls just as fast as any Ipod.  I never saw the logic in that.  The button is more precise and less fatiguing.  Hands down.  Firmware.. If you've seen a store model and it's "glitchy," whatever that may mean,  chances are, the Zune was never plugged into a computer and never had it's firmware updated.  If you go to settings>about>zune, you'll see your firmware version number.  As of right now, the current version is 1.1 (322) and released hardware is 2.0.  If you install the CD into your computer, it'll update your firmware for you.  Easy.  I'm not a brand loyalist, I'm a product a fantatic.  And until Ipod can come out with something better, I'm all for the Zune.  But I'm sure Microsoft won't let just stand there and watch.

<Title>like my zune
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a zune in exchange for my i-river H10 that crapped out on me (only had that for 13 months, very little use).  Used the zune when I went running this morning, it did not skip or quit playing (held it in my hand, don't have a fancy case yet).  It was a bit time-consuming to start up the software, with the upgrade, but all my wma files nicely synced.  I stayed away from ipod mostly because I used windows media player to rip my own cd's to the computer--I don't have any music purchased from the internet.  Yes, it is a bit big, but just last year I was carrying a cd player when I exercised, so this is a lot nicer.  I do have a flash-memory player also, but I can just have so much more music with me with the larger player.  I also like the fm radio, very handy to check the score of a ballgame when out on a run.  I am just an average 40-something who is a bit technology impaired, so I was just thrilled to figure out how to play music without have to search out directions.  (Had a Creative Zen--returned it, never could figure out how to load the thing.)  If people are so happy with their ipods, that's great.  If you already have a player that works so well, then why go spend the money on a new one only to bash it?  I'm not a brand-specific person for any kind of items, but when I find something that works, I tend to stay with it--when will there be a zune-mini???  Thanks for the nice product!

<Title>MS may have got it right this time...
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought one of these babies and I really like it.  They didnt copy that annoyingly touchy thumb wheel from the Ipod and it is considerably easier to navigate through menus.  It came with a free 14 day trial so I have unlimited downloads from their marketplace. I was admittedly apprehensive about their music selection but was pleasantly surprised that they seem to have all 30 or so artists that I enjoy (from White Zombie, Puddle of Mudd to Hoobastank).  I did have to re-download a couple of songs from the marketplace (free unlimited downloads thank god) that would not transfer from Itunes due to Apple's annoying need to utilize their exclusive m4p filetype. Luckly, it had no probem transferring my movies and pictures. I am very happy to ditch Itunes since it doesnt "play nice" with ANY of my other devices and tends to crash my system.  The Zune marketplace seems to work fine and allows me to do things like download a new song and transfer it to my phone's ringtone. The customization of the Zune Marketplace interface needs a little work, but knowing MS they will catch up fast. Yes, I bought the brown one and it is really not a bad color at all. The green tinge looks cool too. I gave my video Ipod to my husband :) Although after seeing my Zune, he's not really that happy about my "gift".

<Title>Zune Great Job!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I Just got one and i really  love it. My best friend loved his ipod, but he gave it to his wife after he played with mine. lol. it it's real good. Big and bright screen, I really love the fact that you can put any picture as background, it really look great!. the controls are really well organized, the menu is smooth, really easy to get to everything you need. The radio works good, I like how it give me info of the radio station and it also show you the title and artist of the song currently playing on the radio station, remember when you heard a cool song on the radio and wonder you is it? well now you will know so u can easy get the song later.  One thing I notice after reading some previews here is that a lot of them are misleading. For example, one says Zune doesn't play DivX and Xvid. first anybody that has a ipod knows that ipod does not play DivX and Xvid , even more the only video file that ipod plays is mp4. Zune plays mp4, H.264 and WMV. plus who care if it doen't play Divx , remember that Divx is a old codes, and now days is mp4 is becoming more standar, so Zune is in the right track.  Next, some people says negatives things about the 3 times or 3 days song shearing feature. well remember it's the music industry fault. they are the ones that doesn't want people to share music, The copyright laws are the ones that limit this awsome feature of wireless music shearing , so don't take on the Zune. But pictures are very easy to send from Zune to Zune and those are yours to keep, isn't that great? .so don't let anybody fool you, Apple's Ipod does not even have wireless capabilities, so why people even dare to say something bad about Zune, having something is always better than having nothing.  Also, I read a complaint about the sinc cable saying that u can only use the type that came with the player and not a USB to mini USB one. well ley me tell you that that exactly the same way ipod cable works , u can only the type that came with the ipod.  I'm just saying get info from different places, cause some people say things that Zune lacks but they forget to say that Ipod lacks them too.  and with the Zune marketplace soon the will add video too!!!!!

<Title>What's the point of sharing...
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...if you can only play the songs you get from other people 3 times within 3 days?  That's right, read the fine print before you buy a Zune for it's sharing capabilities.  You can only play shared songs 3 times in 3 days (whichever comes first), and then POOF... no more song, only a link to the buggy and limited Zune Marketplace to buy the track.  Talk about lame!  The only reason I'm not giving the Zune a 1 star rating is because the player itself isn't all that bad... it's bigger and bulkier than a full sized iPod, but the controls work quite nicely.  However, getting the Zune to work on your machine will probably be more difficult than with an iPod.  I've owned two iPods, and I've never had any problems making them sync with any of my computers (Macs and PCs).  Not so with the Zune.  If during the course of using your Zune with your computer you run into no problems, count yourself lucky; I ran into several.  Another downside is that you can't use iTunes with the Zune, and nothing touches iTunes for easy media organization in my opinion.  In Microsoft's defense, this IS a first generation product, and there were bound to be issues.  But the Zune has a long way to go before it's anywhere near competing with the iPod in terms of ease of use (not to mention the thousands upon thousands of accessories that are available for iPods, the ability to play feature films, and podcasting, all of which are not available for Zune).  The only reason I would recommend this player to anyone is if it were significantly cheaper than the iPod... then it would have at least some differentiation.  As of now, however, the overall user experience with the Zune is not even half of what the iPod offers, yet the 30 GB models of the iPod and the Zune are the same price.  So the real question is... why buy a Zune over an iPod?  The answer...  Don't.

<Title>New 30-gig ZUNE - did not work the 1st time 
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a new (not a refurbished) 30-gig ZUNE as a gift for my wife.  On receiving the new Zune we tried to charge and play it - it never worked.  After several lengthy calls to Microsoft for their assistance we were informed the device is defective and to send it in for either repair or replacement.  MS had sent a box with which to send the device to their repair or replacement shop.  After being gone for a good period of time it was returned to us.  On opening the original return package we noticed the device was replaced with a refurbished unit.  I had purchased a new device however I received a rebuilt one - likely with a used hard drive, screen and battery, and whatever repairs there were to make it work.  There is no way of telling how old the device is.  Had I wanted to originally economize I would have bought a refurb'ed unit.  After several lengthy phone calls to MS and talking to ten different people we were told it is their practice to replace defective units with refurbished units.  We were not told this before sending it back.  Be aware of this when returning your device for repairs - you may likely get a rebuilt one and yours refurbished for someone else.  Fortunate for us we purchased this ZUNE from Amazon who replaced it on hearing of our plight - Amazon is the place to shop for nearly all your wants/needs.  S.D.

<Title>Zune
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purcahsed 2 of the Brown 30gb. One worked fine the other one did not. I sent it back in one of Microsoft supplied boxes. They lost it and told me it was never received yet I had a signed copy of the person who signed for it. I finally got one back. Not the one I sent in to have fixed. Not real happy with Micosoft and their support or lack therre of. No problems with Amazon they have been great.

<Title>It's Okay
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This device was received in a timely manner.  I bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfried because he is a truck driver and I wanted him to be able to watch movies when his television is not working properly in various cities.  It is very, very, very hard to download movies to the zune. I am a little upset because that's why I bought.  Zune's music site has a lot of music but you have to pay for them which is a bommer.  But you can sync the music you already have on your computer.  He has two movies on the Zune right now and I can' tell you how long it took or how I did it.  I tried various software conversions, it was very tiresome. I can't seem to be able to download anymore.  Now my computer is now showing the zune screen, and I have deleted and reinstalled the software several times.  But I used my sister's computer and downloading is just very difficult.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I gave this to my wife and wow is all I can say.  She wanted a new mp3 player, but I got her a whole entertainment center.  She has several movies on it, hundreds of songs, and enough pictures to last a long time before you see repeats.  With the home a/v package she can turn any of our tv's or computers into giant digital picture frames that play music.  Too awsome to describe, and easy to use.  Had to get conversion program to download movies, but it is simple.

<Title>Nice, but clunky
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this product as a replacement for my Creative Zen Vision:M and I was a bit disappointed.  Obviously any of these devices can play mp3's just fine, but the MS Zune is unable to play just about any video.  There is one video file type that it will natively play and anything else will require you to go through a cryptic conversion process.  The size of this old version is a large pill to swallow as well.  The size of the screen is awesome, no doubt about it.  Unfortunately its inability to play most videos forced me to revert to my Zen Vision:M.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the very few videos that i did get to work looked great, but it took so much work to get them recognized that i was literally angry when I watched them.

<Content>This was an awsome buy and I could not be happier.  I currently have over 2,000 songs on it plus every video and picture I've ever taken of my 11 month old daughter and still have tons of memory left.  My husband plans on taking it with him when he deploys so that he can have hours of video and tons of pictures of us. Really easy to use and organize. Very very happy with this product.

<Title>Zune 30GB...pretty amazing
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I absolutely love this Zune.  I had a Creative Zen Vision:M, but the screen cracked, so I needed to get something new, and this is much better than that, at least in by opinion.  I gave it 4 stars only becuase it could have come with some more accessories...like a wall charger and screen protector.  The only issue that I had with it was the battery life.  Everywhere I look it says that it should last between 12-14 hours for audio play.  I felt like I was charging it every other day, and couldnt figure out why it was dying so quickly.  I did some reading and it turns out that the way that it says to turn it off is wrong.  They say to hold down the play/pause button for three seconds, but that only puts it in sleep mode.  The way to completely power it off is to hold down the back button and the down button (on the D-pad).  That seems to have helped.  The software is a little tricky to figure out, but there is ample information online to answer any questions you may have.  You should have no problems if you take your music right off a CD or purchase it from the Zune store, I am not sure about itunes.    I have shown this to my friends that have ipods and they have said that they like it much better than an ipod.    I am very happy I bought this.  Great Product!!

<Title>LOVE mine. So many people HATE Microsoft...
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beware many of these reviews. There's a huge sector of the techie world that has a deep-seeded resentment of anything Microsoft, and most hardcore Apple users have an emotional attachment to the iPod as the one thing Apple's done that's really "caught on" in the popular sector. I'm here to say that as an unbiased consumer, I really love my Zune.  I am a careful buyer. I read many reviews after my iPod bit the dust last week (convenient timing) and I was debating a switch. I heard there might be trouble with the software, so I downloaded it from the Zune site and installed it. The software installed with no problem at all. Never even a glitch. It's simple, intuitive, and clean. I had no problem with iTunes, either, for the record. I like Zune's sync with the player better, though.   The Zune itself? Not as big as some reports had led me to think. Very comparable in size to my 30G iPod video, a tiny bit bigger. It seems lighter, to me, and I like the screen much better. My friend Dusty - who very well might write one of those venomous anti-Microsoft reviews somewhere else - had to admit the screen was better than the iPod. He loves the Zune, now. Customization is nice - you can use any photo you have to "skin" the background. Wireless? I haven't had much chance to use that, it wasn't a big selling point to me, but the few people who were playing with the wireless function at the store seemed to have no problem. I hear they're going to open up more wireless functionality with future updates.   Music - well, it sounds great.   Pictures? I love the widescreen slideshow.   Video? Again, the widescreen is nice.   Battery life seems fine, I haven't made a lot of calculation there  the headphones have a neat little magnetic fucntion to hold them together when not in use.   What would I change? Well, the Zune store only sells music. They should add video since it's a major function of the player.   Basically, I'd like to see a genuine contender in this market compete with iPod. Competition is good for innovation, and price. I hear people say "will this be the iPod killer," and I find that ridiculous. Some people drink Pepsi, some people drink Coke. One isn't going to replace the other anytime soon. I hope the same will be true for the Zune and the iPod, and I look forward to seeing what future generations of both bring us.

<Title>I really wanted to like this!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zune two days ago and exchanged it for a black 5.5 gen iPod today (I had sold my white 5 gen iPod to buy the Zune).  I was really excited about the Zune, and really wanted to enjoy it. I was looking forward to the large screen, and connecting it up to my 360. But alas, it was not meant to be. The device itself is great, I loved the design, it felt great in my hand (despite being a bit thicker than I would have liked), the screen is beautiful, and the menu system seemed very easy to use. The software loaded fine on my computer, but when I connected my Zune, that's where things went shady.  I disconnected and reconnected my Zune many many times, and got varying results (but never the desired ones). Sometimes niether the Zune nor the software would do anything...sometimes the Zune would start charging, but nothing else...sometimes the the Zune would say "Connected" but nothing would happen on the software side. Once (once!), it actually worked...the Zune said "Connected" and the device showed up in the software and started to update the Zune firmware...then it froze. I even tried removing the software a few times and reinstalling it, to no avail.  I wasted six hours over two evenings trying to get this thing to work, and I had enough. At least I got a new iPod out of the ordeal.  My advice: - If you own an iPod, keep it! Maybe upgrade to the 6 gen when they come out, as they'll likely feature the few things about the Zune that make it appealing. - If you're looking for your first media player, consider the iPod or Creative Zen before even thinking about the Zune.

<Title>Run for the Money
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I posted this in reply to a review then decided to post so everyone could see. [...]    The 3-times/days WECF (Which Ever Comes First) ONLY applies to music that you recieve via wifi from other Zune's. At the very most this could be a bit misleading but you can't even do this with an Ipod. I think I can see where Microsoft is going with this, given there 'Welcome to the Social' add campaign. Maybe your friend has an album you interested in but you want to hear more before you buy it yourself. If you both have zune's he can "gift" (Ipod terminology thievery)it to you so you can decide wether or not to buy within three days or three plays. Maybe instead of standing under those giant 'hair dryers' they call listening stations at your local music store you can walk in there pick up the album through wifi and decide while you shop for other stuff or come back later. Granted these situations and many others like it requires a substantial number of people using zunes but given what looks like a decent first outing I can't say it's beyond the realm of possibility. Microsoft looks to be in it for the long haul and I hope that Apple steps it's game up too. But to knock the Zune for offering a feature that's not even availble on the Ipod semes kind of pointless. You have to remember also that you can't even share Itunes you've purchased with other Ipods at all. The only music you can listen to without any restrictions (except for actually 'owning' it) are through people who have Itunes and connected to your network. For most of us this isn't a plus unless you're allowed to have Itunes at work.  If you own the music you will have no problem transfering to Zune UNLESS you've purchased it through Itunes (Microsoft and Apple should lower that barrier why should this turn into another Mac vs. PC battle). As for the wireless syncing listening to Major Nelson podcast (via Itunes) who is actually an employee of Microsoft interview with Ross Honey who works with the Xbox Live Video Marketplace and Zune software "Hinted" (using qoutes sparingly) that the wifi pc syncing feature along with others would be availible through firmware updates (such as the ipod update that allowed you to show album art while playing the song).  While not totaly convienced that I'm gonna make the switch, the lack of podcasting (a feature I can't live without) is the only negative for ME that I can actually report on. While there are several reviews of software/hardware misshaps, so be careful. Either return it for another Zune or get another Ipod.

<Title>Tune to Zune!
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, let me just tell you....I'm an iPod user.  I do enjoy the sleek look of iPod...and yes...I do enjoy being a part of the buzz surrounding the product.  However, I got a chance to play with the Zune at launch and to my surprise, I was completely delighted.    Things I like:  Twist interface - flows so smooth and fast The build quality - I love the feeling of the zune.  no fingerprints! The brown - I purchased it...I think its very trendy looking FM tuner - Not a biggy, but it's handy I suppose WiFi - I'm hoping MS expands this feature...I feel they will Screen - Beautiful...nuff said Transfer Speed - GEEZ!  This thing is SUPER fast! MarketPlace - Typical, but very intuitive and sleek  Things I don't like  Microsoft - They have a reputation for abandoning things. (DRM) Video - Where's the store guys?  At least have SOMETHING for launch Points System - Lame.  All in all it's a great PMP.  I highly suggest going out today and picking one up!

<Title>A Little Shine in macland
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I work in a pre-press environment (i.e Mac fan-boy land). I myself can take or leave a mac or pc I am smart enough to use both. I had an ipod the 60 GB photo. It "claimed to have features it did not when I bought it and then with it's first update to add the feature mac made my accessory obsolete and started selling their own for only 39.95. needless to say I returned it and got off the i-pod wagon forever. This post is not to bash the ipod though it is a fine player but it's not for me. Since then i have tried several several other players some had ice features but the best ovrall way to describe them is "clunky". a few months ago I noticed the GIgabeat burning up the review circuit and was planning on the purchase. then just before buy date noticed microsoft's offering so I held off.   In the months of development I read teasers and leaks and then reviews of final models. I went to the store yesterday planning on being disappointed by the hype. I picked one up and brought it home turned it on and gave it the once through and everything lived up to expectations. I installed the software without issue it takes some time but without issue. I was happy it wasn't the windows media player software. It's simple but nice. it isn't not quite as robust as i-tunes yet but is a great start. I prefer media monkey for my library and hoping some of the third-party developers will get on board and write plugins to support the Zune.  Most importantly it works well with the Zune. I browsed the marketplace and like I-tune's decided not to buy. I enjoy the freedom of choice i get with ripping cd's.   After importing in about 800 songs to the software I did my first Sync. it took about 5-10 min not bag for 8 gigs each song was a matter of seconds. I then tried to put the zune through it's paces and really found nothing wrong with the way things work. The Twist interface is great and I thought I'd miss the click wheel of my past i-pod but really didn't. I really prefer the controls of this. The changeable background although only a novelty makes my zune personal and is a nice touch. Album art takes center stage while playing and with the time I took tagging my collection it is nice to see my work properly displayed. I played with the features for a number of hours adding video and photos and really was happy with the product. It managed to live up to the hype.   Well the next day I brought the zune into work and thought I'd show it off to my friends at work. I really expected a lot of "it's not an i-pod so I'm not interested" But I was pleasantly surprised. After explaining the controls quickly" It's not a click wheel, Up down left and right. The center button is the enter key, the arrow key goes back." I gave them all a chance for a hands on experience. as they got to the music section I explained the twist interface " ok click on a album, Notice how the menu bar changes so that you can now go from album to album now using the left and right direction." Although I got a few I'll stick with my ipod, I also got several unexpected quotes like  "Apple has got to watch out because this is actually really good.",  "Apple finally has a real competitor", " I actually like this better than my I-pod. The menu thing is really cool", " It's easier to use than I thought it would be.", " This is going to make the ipod better now that they have some competition" I was amazed that I didn't hear all the normal microsoft bashing and there seemed to be some real respect for another media player. I doubt any of the group will make the change and I wouldn't expect them to. But I can bet they may look twice if mac support is added to the Zune.   Well My final part of the review wil be things i can see coming within the design of the zune. With vista just over the horizon and the media abilities of that os you can see the wifi thing possibly taking off more, Also in the video player portion of the zune the "quick" fast forward jumps the video ahead 30 seconds (enough for a standard length commercial), With the announcement of the X-box live store of downloadable movies and TV shows it's only a matter of time til that content makes it to this device, Also syncing via the xbox 360 seems inevitable also. Microsoft has a 3 headed monster with it's multimedia integration so expect a long drawn out fight with the ipod. It'll be tough but fun to enjoy the benefits as consumers. Both apple and microsoft should be bringing their "A" games.

<Title>Accompanying software won't work and wiped out preloaded content
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I opened the box I was excited, and after playing with the device I thought Microsoft might have gotten it right for once.  But when I tried to load the accompanying software, it wouldn't install fully -- it just hung at "Installing software". When I connected the device to the PC, it started the software and the software said "Your device needs to be updated from v1.0 to 1.1 - click Next" -- I clicked Next, and I got "No updates could be found." Wtf? At that point the software wouldn't recognize the device had been connected, so I couldn't sync any content.  Tried MSFT support, but they couldn't help.  The next morning I thought I'd reconnect and try again. When I connected the device I got a screen that said "Removing content" and ALL THE PRELOADED CONTENT GOT ERASED, but it still wouldn't update the device. I could not have been more horked.  Does not increase my confidence in MSFT's ability to develop software. Liked the form factor of the device, but now I'm returning it due to its dysfunctional content-erasing software. Buyer beware.

<Title>I LOVE My Zune
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Firstly let me say that I have no idea why people who don't even own a Zune write reviews about it. Those people should just continue to be happy with their sheep status with the Ipod. The Ipod is an excellent device, Kudos to apple for making the first truly fabulous portable music player. I have owned no less than 5 different Ipods going back to 2001 when most Ipod fan boys did not even know ipods existed, and my first mp3 player in 1998. Alas I wanted something different, and tried an army of mp3 players. When Microsoft announced the Zune i could not wait. I finally have the device and I love it. The sound quality is better than the Ipod. The screen is great, the device is light and pleasant to hold. The menu is easy. I applaud the Zune folks for not trying to be just another Ipod rip off, but to distinguish itself in a sea of mp3 players. I can't wait to start meeting fellow zune owners on my commute and beam songs back and forth. The greatest thing about the Zune, is how the built in wifi is going to be used going forward. It should be exciting. For those who don't own a Zune, no one wants to hear from you, write reviews for the Ipod instead, people over there will care.

<Content>It seems, some PC's front USB ports don't carry enough power to support the Zune. Try the rear USB ports and try not to use any extension USB cables. This should take care of most of the sync problems. I wasted a good 4 hours trying to figure out the problem until I read the solution on a Zune forum.

<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The wireless sharing concept is good, and Apple needs to incorporate it into its iPod, but there are not enough Zune owners to make it work.  Also, once you've shared a tune with someone, you can't share with that someone again.  So, that makes it doubly bad.  First, there aren't many Zune owners,and then, when you do find one, you can only share once.  Microsoft needs to change that.

<Title>First Time Digital Media Player User
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is fabulous!  I loved it, the fact that it could work with both itunes and windows media player is great.  As a first time buyer/user of digital media players I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by it.  It has traveled quite a few places with me proving itself to be a hardy product.  My two year old niece got hold of it and even after her onslaught it is working amazingly.  I use it at the gym and even with it's slightly larger size, which some people found undesirable, I find it is still convenient.  The larger screen is great for pictures and videos and is really clear.  What I did find a little irritating was that the player instead of having a wall plug-in charger, had a USB cord that was used both to move media and to charge the battery.  This is not a totally bad thing but I mainly use mine for travel and I don't always bring my laptop along so on my first trip I had to sabotage a hotel computer to get it fully charged for a flight.  Obviously buying a wall charger will solve the problem but I must have missed the USB cord in the product description.  I also, like many others, found the installation of the software to be a little confusing, but not so much so that I would let that stop me from buying the product.  I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it to any first time user/buyer. Five stars for a excellent product, not bad microsoft, not bad at all.

<Title>Zune 30 GB is great!
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have to admit that I was hesitant to buy older technology. But the fact that I could get 30GB for the same price of the new 8gb Zune led me to buy this unit.   The first thing it did when I plugged it into my computer was tell me to update the software and "BOOM" it looks and acts just like the new models, but this one has an equalizer and the new ones don't.  The only thing that is missing from this unit versus the new models is the touch pad. But honestly, I have tried the touch pad and I would probably disable it anyway. It is too sensitive for my fingers.  My son has an iPod 80gb. He loves it. I hate it. Unless you use iTunes to rip your CDs you don't get the album art. And you HAVE to use iTunes to use your iPod unless you jump through all kinds of 3rd-party software hoops. No thank you. iTunes is a resources HOG! I tried using it as a music player and my computer slowed down to a crawl and I have a 3.0 ghz dual core system with 2gb of ram! I also rip all of my music to a central drive at a very high quality. If you do that, iTunes does not pickup the album art. So he has this cool flip-cover software on his iPod but all of his covers are blank since he is pulling the music from our mp3 library.  Though the Zune software is nothing to get excited about, in fact it is a bit clunky, it picks up the album art and syncs with no problem.  It also has better sound quality than any iPod that I have tried.   Buy this player!

<Content>As you can tell by the title, I absolutely love my Zune!  I bought it for myself (from my husband :) for Christmas.  I don't have anything bad to say about it!  It has soooo much space & I love the fact that it has an internal battery... I was using a small 1GB mp3 player that took AAA batteries and they always died after 2 workout sessions!!  The savings on the batteries alone is astronomical!!!!  The menu is super easy and I just love the "Quick List".  You just add your favorite songs into it, set it to "shuffle" and you get an awesome song every time!!!!  I use Amazon's mp3 downloader and I love it!  The songs go right into Media Player and the Zune program, making this product really easy to use!!  The sound quality is great and the large screen is awesome!    The 30GB Zune is quite a bit larger than the iPod Nano, but that is no problem!  I use the DLO Action Jacket to strap it to my arm while exercising and you don't even notice the size of it!!  The easy to use menu and buttons make it easy to skip a song if I need a peppier one to keep me going!!  I will admit that I was having a hard time deciding between the iPod and the Zune.  I am sooooo glad that I chose the Zune... and you will be too!!

<Title>Good device, terrible software!
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like the 30GB Zune's features. I'm glad I got it at a clearance price from a large retailer, because normally it's overpriced, just like the Ipod. The scrolling display makes it easy to reach any song or any artist very quickly. With firmware version 2.3 I can wirelessly sync with my laptop from across the room: not a crucial feature, but nice. The sound quality seems better than other MP3 players I have - maybe because of the Zune's discrete components inside.   But there are some negatives too.  I'm not getting anywhere near the advertised 13 hour battery life - maybe half that much. (and yes I reset my battery display after updating the firmware).  The short life could be because I usually have the volume set near the maximum 20. I'm using less efficient but better-sounding headphones, not the earbuds that came with it. Or else I'm playing it thru powered speakers, which work best with the highest possible input.   My car and home stereos have USB ports, but the Zune is not recognized. Probably because it does not identify itself as a Mass Storage device. So I have to use the Aux in jack, with reduced sound quality, and shorter battery life.   The worst thing about the Zune by far: the PC software! Once again Microsoft wins the crapware contest hands down. All users needed was an interface like Windows Explorer. Would that have been so hard, Mr Gates?? Instead we get this cutesy full-screen bloatware that doesn't tell us bitrates or any other important information about our MP3's. It makes it hard to see the contents of the Zune or the PC, it syncs without being told to, it flashes random percentages that seem to have no meaning, it can't get simple album covers correct. Thank you Microsoft for showing us that a worse product than Windows Vista can actually be foisted on the public.   I'm hoping some future hacks will give us better sync software, easier Mass Storage usage, etc. I will add a star to my rating if those things appear someday. Come on hackers, let's show Microsoft how to do it right.  I also recommend not buying the overpriced Zune branded extra cables and chargers. There are much cheaper generics for sale on the web that work just as well.

<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm having a difficult time finding words for my disappointment.  Let me start off by saying that the hardware is more than decent.  The Zune sounds great and feels solid, with that said; the software is worse than I ever could have imagined.  If you buy this, make sure your music is tagged to perfection and even then, the Zune's software misinterprets tags and randomly fills in blanks with information it pulls seemingly out of nowhere.  I truly cannot believe that the people behind the software interface still have jobs.

<Title>Great starting point.
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Honestly, this is the second MP3 player i've owned (still have my Zen 8gig microphoto) and I absolutly love it. I was all gung ho about the iPod. my cousin has one and i thought it was awsome, but I figured, id go with something different. I have absolutly no complaints at all. All I need a player to do is organize my music how I want it, and play it, and it does just that.   Sure the wi-fi feature is off, but like i said, its a starting point. Nothing else has that (that i know of), so no reason to cut it down. If I remember correctly, the ipod was sort of boring when it first came out as well. And to compare this first gen product, to a first gen ipod or zen, would be crazy. I love the navigation, the clarity of the pictures, and everything.   And something else peopel may not seem to be thinking about (I see a lot of you have multiple ipods), instead of having to buy a whole new upgraded player (version 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, etc) I think microsoft may just decided to let you download the upgrade.. just something to think about.

<Title>Good Product, Bad policy
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is an excellent player. It seemed to load songs and videos a little faster than the 5.5 gen 30g Ipod (I got this last Saturday, and the gapless play back feature seems really redundant), and the big screen is a HUGE advantage. The movies seem much more better, and really make the video on the Ipod look futile. As a multimedia player, it is really faultless.   However, the fact that it doesn't have text reading capabilites, the fact that it cannot be used as a hard drive; the fact that the "Welcome to the Social" has a fine print which makes it useless; the fact that it doesn't have a searching option is really irritating.  What's worse is that most of these are easy to be implemented. With enough Hack programs coming, it would be an excellent "SOCIAL" player.   Nonetheless the possibilities are a definite edge over other mp3 devices, and as an ordinary player, it is definitely an noteworthy investment.

<Title>An excellent alternative to the iPod
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Even though many will balk at a product from Microsoft this item has many nice features.  The PC interface is very much like Windows Media Player and using it you can organize your selections into playlists and categorize by artist, genre, album title, etc.  The integrated FM radio is very nice and some stations stream the artist and song title.  I find this extremely nice when I hear a song and want to know the artist and title.  I just received this as a gift yesterday so have not utilized the video and picture capabilites but if they are integrated with other Microsoft software they should be just as simple to use as music organization capabilites.  The lack of printed instructions will be a disappointment for some, but the online help that comes with the Zune PC software is very good.  My step-son was envious (he has an iPod) of the wireless capabilites that allow you to share with other Zune users who are in range.  I can see this as a very social device with younger users.  By entering the market later Microsoft has integrated some very nice features into this player and it is well worth a look.

<Title>I like it as much as I like the iPod
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a 30 GB video iPod for several months before accidentally dropping it into the washing machine, killing it instantly. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to turn what was a tragedy into an excuse to check out the new Zune. My first impression is that the people who bash this thing are silly. To call this vastly inferior to the iPod screams Apple fanboy to me. I like them both.  One of the things I prefer about the Zune is the LACK of the clickwheel. That's right. I never was nuts about the iPod's clickwheel. It's a neat little gimmick at first, but I always had trouble selecting what I wanted to play, often accidentally clicking on the wrong thing. I find the Zune's standard up and down, left and right navigation much more practical and easier to use.  I *like* the heavier, tougher design of the Zune. Like some other reviewers have pointed out, the iPod was very pretty and elegant almost to the point of being a disadvantage. In order to keep it from turning into a scratched fingerprint-laden mess, you had to put it in an ugly case. While I'm not planning to use it as a hockey puck any time soon, the Zune feels much more durable and fit for outdoor use than the iPod.  Another thing I love about the Zune is that I find the menus more user friendly. I like being able to click left and right to fluctuate between artists, albums, songs, and whatnot while keeping the menu on what I'm listening to. Plus, the ability to change the background and add your own pictures is nice.  The sample videos I played looked very crisp and colorful on the larger screen.  Now, a few minor complaints:  The Zune seems to be lacking some features that I took for granted with the iPod: a clock, alarm, and calander. Oh well.  The Zune does not have a "sound check" feature for normalizing the volume of my songs.  It does not yet seem to have gapless playback capability. However, neither did my iPod until a recent update.  The Zune doesn't group compilation artists together like my iPod did. For example, I ripped both of the Nuggets box sets and a couple of soundtracks to my library, and instead of grouping the artists from those albums as Various Artists or whatever, it listed each individual artist on the artists menu of the Zune. So I was left with dozens of artists on my menu that I only had one or two songs by, making it a real chore to browse by artists on my Zune.  Okay, a bigger complaint: I'm not crazy about the software. No one seems to know why Microsoft didn't just make this thing compatible with Windows Media Player. With the software, the synching seems a little shakey at times. For example, getting album covers to transfer to my Zune sometimes requires a little coaxing. However, I should point out that I wasn't nuts about iTunes at first either, so it's likely that I'll grow to like Zune's software more with experience.  There have been quite a few complaints about the Zune Marketplace, but I'm not bothered by that because I've never purchased music online nor do I plan to. I rip exclusively from my own CDs and vinyl, and the Zune handles that just fine. Also, I haven't bothered trying out the wi-fi feature yet, as no one I know owns a Zune yet, and I doubt many strangers would like the crap I listen to anyway.  Now, that may sound like a lot of complaints, but I refer to them as minor for a reason: the room to grow via updates from Microsoft. This is a brand new product, folks. There are bound to be some flaws here and there. However, I'm expecting that a lot of these will be taken care of in the coming months, and the Zune will get better and better as the updates start to become available. In the mean time, I'm quite happy with what I have now. Right now, I'm willing to say that it's a hair below the quality of the iPod for the reasons I listed above, but like I've said, I'm not expecting these problems to stick around for long.

<Title>I love my brown Zune
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wasn't sure what to expect - but I love my device. My husand has an iPod and I've tried it a bit, so I've used both similarly and with no prior experience in either. BTW brown is the new black! Okay, just had to add that. :-) Wasn't sure I would like it but it's very unique and fun.  What's different: The Zune has an up/down/side interface vs. the circle. I personally prefer it because with the circle, I always ended up 5 songs past where I wanted to be. But others like the speed of the circle, so this is a personal thing.  What's cool: Great screen - at least 15+ people have commented on how nice it is. You can set backgrounds with any pictures, it's really easy and looks great. You have album art and you can send photos to another Zune very easily. You can share music with other Zune owners - I don't mind the 3-day/3-listen limit. It gives you a reasonable chance of enjoying the music and the option to go buy it (support your artists!) :-) The relocate feature lets you connect as a Guest to other machines easily. I found the battery life to be good tho haven't compared it to other devices. Sounds really sweet with high quality rips from my CDs.  All in all I'm glad I made the purchase and while there are a few things to figure out, I really like the device. I think its pretty easy to use, makes sharing photos and music really simple, and offers a significant feature set for a music player of its price.  PS: I don't hit the same issues with my software, but I empathize with other folks and hope these issues get fixed soon. The up side here is that these types of bugs can be resolved with software updates.

<Title>Zune: very disappointing!
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just like a lot of us I bought one of these, thinking that it would be better than the Ipod (bigger screen etc.). I use Microsoft Vista, and first of all the device is not recognized, so I try to download the drivers and no luck, it simply doesn't work under Vista. So I go to my wife's windows XP machine and I start fiddling with it, after few unsuccessful tries (hours!) I am finally able to listen to my own songs from Zune.  Zune's interface is clearly not as good as the Ipod, the Ipod does make sense and it's a no brainer, the creators of Zune probably focussed on getting the Zune as cheap as they could so they can hope to make a few sales so they didn't focus on the interface, and/or computer support. After hours wasted I understood that the Zune is completely unusable and I will not wait 6 months that Microsoft releases a patch for it to somewhat make it work. I am returning it to the store today to get an Ipod, it's a no brainer, the Ipod is the same price and WORKS.  If you are thinking about buying one of these, then don't. Get an Ipod.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was a bit skeptical at first, but I've been extremely pleased with my Zune.  Right out of the box I was able to install the Zune Marketplace software, download, sync, etc. within minutes.  What absolutely sold me was the way the menus are laid out on the device.  I no longer have to click "Music > Artist > Album > Song" to enjoy a quick tune, and I've used the radio much more than I thought I would (sometimes you just need a break from the songs you've heard time & time again).  Some features (such as being able to sync wirelessly) aren't present yet, but those should be coming out soon as updates.  This is a solid first start, and I'm looking forward to future updates and versions of the device. I highly recommend it!

The Zune is an excellent product, as is the Ipod in its own right. I own both and prefer the Zune for its interface , screen, sound quality and solid form. There are some quirks with the software which should be resolved but are not reason enough to not buy one. Oh yeah .. it also comes with an excellent FM tuner which can be found on almost any gadget you buy except an Ipod.

<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This 30 GB system is even bigger than Apple's 80 GB video iPod.  Hardly any accessories are built for the Zune, no airplanes are installing video adaptors and power adaptors for the Zune, but they are for the iPod.  Same with cars.  Wireless function is severely hampered.  You can get a song "squirted" to you only if the other person gives you permission.  Even then, you can only listen to the song three times or for three days, whichever comes first.  DRM is even more strict than Apple's Fairplay.  Why bother with the Zune?

<Title>5 star music experience, 3 star video
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disclosure:  I've worked at Microsoft for about a year now, although I am in no way related to the Zune team, nor do I have any info a consumer doesn't have.  I've had mine since this Tuesday and am comfortable with my understanding of it at this point.  So, what are my thoughts?  First off, Zune is an _excellent_ music player.  The experience for music use is nearly perfect.  On this front it has one killer feature compared to the iTunes/iPod combo which is Zune Pass.  Zune Pass is a $15 a month subscription where you can download and put on your Zune nearly any song from the Zune Marketplace (in my experience I have been able to download every song I wanted except for Beatles songs, but those aren't available via iTunes either).  The second is the Zune-to-Zune sharing feature, which is really only appealing in high Zune-density areas (like the Microsoft campus) until Zune becomes more widespread.  There is also a 3 day or 3 plays limitation to shared music, but this doesn't affect anyone with Zune Pass since they can simply download the song when they get back to their computer (shared music is flagged for you when you sync so you can download it [zune pass] or buy it [no pass] if you decide you like it and want to keep it.  Audio quality is excellent and even the included ear bud headphones are a step above those included with other players.  The video experience has pluses and minuses.  The pluses are that the screen is large, clear and bright.  It makes watching video on the postage-stamp style screens on the video iPods seem ridiculous.  Seriously, was it that important to them to have it look exactly the same as the day it came out that they didn't bother reorienting the screen for maximum real estate?  Maybe they could but had battery problems I don't know.  Or maybe they thought the boring iPod shape was "iconic" and didn't want to change it.  Needless to say I'm sure a future version of the iPod will correct this problem, but as of now the experience of watching video goes to Zune hands down.    That brings us to the problem which is lack of content.  Zune cannot play protected mp4 files so you can't watch the video available from the iTunes store and Zune as of now has no videos in the marketplace.  Your only options are any unprotected mp4 or wmv video you might have or can find on YouTube, Soapbox or Google video.  While it is technically possible to rip your DVDs to Zune format, due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act it is currently illegal to do so if your DVD is encrypted (nearly all commercial DVDs are encrypted and while copying your DVD onto your portable device is legal, the Digital Millennium Copyright act made it illegal to break encryption on media without the permission of the copyright holders).  Enterprising users will discover that they can decrypt their DVDs using freely available (though illegal in the US) software and then encode them to Zune format using Windows Media Encoder (available from Microsoft), but there is no US based commercial software available to streamline and make the process easy.  The few companies under US jurisdiction that produced such software were sued out of existence by the movie studios.  On the plus side, if you have a Media Center computer, you can convert your recorded TV shows to play on Zune, but not many people have a Media Center at this point.  As such, the best option would be if the Zune Marketplace had a video catalog similar to the iTunes store, but as of release, there are no videos in the Marketplace.  I'm sure that this is simply a side effect of the fact that the Zune team didn't have the resources to sign up the TV studios and the music studios at the same time and will be remedied in the near future.    In fact, nearly everything about the Zune seems to be geared towards future improvement.  The upgradeable firmware of the device along with it's hardware capabilities pave the road for a number of as of yet unimplemented features which will no doubt be implemented not too far down the road such as wireless sync'ing, wireless purchasing and downloading of music directly on the device, games, videos in the Zune marketplace and more Zune-to-Zune features along the lines of song sharing.    If I had to summarize my feelings about Zune in a few sentences, I would say that what Zune does it does very well.  That seems to be the design choice made.  Rather than throwing in every feature under the sun with lackluster execution, the designers clearly decided to do what they could do well and with polish and leave those other features for future updates. As of launch that means that you have an excellent music player and a store to go along with it, and also an excellent video player, but no videos to watch on it.     If you can live without a video / TV store for your player, or feel comfortable transferring recorded media from your Media Center PC or have another video source, I can highly recommend this player for you.

<Title>Subscription sealed the deal.
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I heard the the Zune Marketplace was going to support a monthly all-you-can-download subscription plan (which iTunes doesn't support) I knew I had to get this player. I refuse to pay to "own" any track with DRM on it, but a subscription plan takes away that anxiety because it's understood that I don't actually own any of the music anyway and that I can consume vast amounts of it for a relatively low cost. Kind of like XM or Sirius satellite radio.  That said, onto the player:  External aesthetics: I have the black Zune, but like the look of all three. It actually doesn't seem bulk in person at all, and I love the matte finish on it. As others have said it's scratch resistant and has a silky and durable feel. Also, it's worth mentioning the the black color takes on a blue hue in certain light. Very cool.  Zune software (on the Zune itself): Navigation is easy and intuitive. No complaints here. The size of the screen is a big plus and everything looks good. Only nitpick is the album art could be higher quality, however, doing so would use up more space. It doesn't look bad, but it could look a lot better. There should be a way to choose high or low res artwork depending on how much space you can afford to use.  My other complaint is that the artists category of the music library gets over cluttered in the since that if there is a contributing artist then they end up in the list. This is EXTREMELY annoying, and the only reason I don't knock a star off the review is because 1) this is subjective, someone else might appreciate that, and 2) the unfair 1 star reviews by people who haven't used a Zune need to be balanced out. I only want the artists that I explicitly chose to download an album or track from in the list. I don't care about some random contributing artist. I am definitely going to attempt to figure out how to stop this from occuring without having to manually edit each track in my library.  Zune marketplace: I've found the Zune Marketplace easy to use and find and download music from. No complaints here. I've never used iTunes, so I can't compare them, but I've been able to find just about every artist I've wanted (including some surprisingly obscure ones) and since I can download an unlimited amount of music due to the subscription thing, I'm as happy as a bear in a beehive.   Misc: One small detail that I am extremely happy with is how powerful the audio output of the Zune headphone jack is. It goes up to 20, but I usually listen to it at 4 or 5 with headphones. However, when I connect it to the auxiliary jack in my car, I end up cranking the volume up to 18. This detail is essential because the extra volume really allows the zune to sound GREAT in my car via the aux input. I don't have to over amplify and end up distorting or increasing noise in the music. My previous mp3 player sounds horrible over the aux jack. The Zune sounds as good as if it was built in!  So in summary I love my Zune and the unlimited music feature. The artist list thing really needs to be fixed, but in the scheme of things it's something that I can live with and it's not a deal breaker. The other details that I like make up for it.  So if you haven't made the mistake of getting locked into the iTunes format by "buying" DRMed tracks and want to try out a great subscription based music player (think of it as radio on demand), then I highly recommend the Zune.

<Title>Not as good as I hoped
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a serious gadget junkie. I have more mp3 players than I care to admit - iPod, iRiver, even a Rio. You name a player, I probably have it. I was very interested in Zune, and the fact that I now have one here in Switzerland where it officially can't be bought yet shows to what length I was prepared to go to get it.  First the good:  + Zune's sound quality is good (I did not use the earphones that come with it, though), + Browsing your music is simple. The transitions between menus is slick, and the user interface is quite intuitive.  + It feels solid, and does not pick up scratches or fingerprints as easy as it's direct competitor, the iPod.  + Purchasing songs is simple, and can be done worldwide. + Large color display is bright, colors are vivid. Good playback of videos. So-so display of images. + Plays my unencrypted (DRM'd) WMA, MP3, AAC files  The bad:  - Zune's software (the part you install on your PC) was a mess to install, and did not install on the Vista beta (This will hopefully change with the final release of Vista).  - It looks nice, but the marketplace experience does not hold a candle against iTunes Music Store (neither does the selection). Also, you purchase using 'MS points' that can only be purchased in chunks of 5 USD or more, and it's not easy to convert the points to my local currency. There currently is no video selection, nor can you easily subscribe to podcasts - Zune can't load my previously purchased (DRM'd) WMA files (Plays-for-Sure). Zune, from MS does not conform to 'Plays for sure' by MS. This means you must re-purchase all your songs. - Zune songs can't be played by other players. In this regard Zune is as bad (a closed system) as the iPod. Wasn't Bill Gates on the record saying that 'People want choice'? Well, not if you own Zune - at least for now. - Does not play video formats other than WMV (i.e. no m4v, mov) - You can't use Zune as an external hard drive. I couldn't believe it myself either. Why??? - I must physically connect Zune to my PC to load songs  - Zune currently can't sync wirelessly. - You can't use Windows media player to manager your Zune's content - For some reason I am unable to listen to Zune while it's charging. This may be a fault of mine, though. - The scroll wheel is not a scroll wheel. It integrates well with Zune's interface, but is not as efficient as the iPod's wheel it obviously resembles - The color display's resolution is the same as the iPod's, just bigger. Side-to-side comparison between a video played on the iPod and Zune shows a distinct advantage for the iPod, because the image (even though smaller) looks much sharper. It would have been better if Zune had a higher resolution.  I was unable to try the song sharing feature (for obvious reasons - no-one else has it here).  All in all I am seriously disappointed by Zune. The player itself is nice - the whole package (player, software, experience), however, is riddled with half-baked features, or intentional restrictions that make no sense. Comparing it directly to the other closed-system competitor, the iPod, shows that Zune has a long way to go just to catch up. It fares OK when compared with other mp3-players - until you realize that you'll have to re-purchase your music. If you are prepared to take that step you might as well go with the iPod, which is clearly the better package.

<Title>Zune - not an iPod Killer, but nice MP3 player in it's own right
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The size isn't bad, it's surprisingly small given the size of the screen. If you want to watch movies and videos on a larger screen, a larger device is the price you pay at the moment. The WiFi needs to be de-crippled, it's way to restrictive, but hopefully that is something Microsoft can address in a firmware update. Actually there are a couple other things Microsoft could address with a firmware release, releax the DRM 3 play/3day restriction, turn it into a storage device, add some simple games/utilties etc, and increase what you can do with WiFi. Judging from how they've handled customer feedback on the Xbox and Xbox Live, I expect we'll see those types of changes sooner rather than later. The screen is big, crisp, and bright a nice change from the tiny iPod screen. The star of the device, believe it or not, is the UI. It's quick, intuitive, and attractive. While the iPod is simpler, unless you're a technophobe, you'll pick up the Zune's UI in a matter of moments. The black color is kind of cool, it's semi translucent and has a nice grippy texture to it and unlike the iPod doesn't show fingerprints, and worse get scratched to heck even if you look at it funny. Overall a solid first effort, but not enought to unseat the iPod. Firmware changes would be a good start toward that goal.  I'll be getting an Xbox 360 for the kids this Christmas, so it'll be interesting to see how that all integrates. Not sure about brown though, that's a strange choice in my book, but maybe that's the appeal of it; I'm old enough to remebmer the 70s when brown was the in color. Maybe a Harvest Gold Zune is not far behind.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an excellent player. Besides a robust marketplace software, that let you easily browse your own selection, I think he subscription concept is a fantastic. You just go there download whatever you like and listen, that simple. Besides, if there is something you really like, then just flag it and then you can come back to the marketplace and downright buy it.  The player is a little bit on the big side for my taste, but the functionality is so rich that it is worth it evey ounce!  On the downside: the earphones are not that good. I plugged it a seinheiser set I own and the sound rocks!

<Title>Attractive Product that Back-Stabs the Consumer in 2 Ways
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune is clearly an attractive package in terms of interface and sound quality but Microsoft has, with this product, betrayed the consumer in two ways: First, Microsoft didn't fulfill its promise to allow customers to trade all their iPod songs, for free, for their Zune. Clearly, when the reality of this "trade" hit Microsoft, they back-tracked. Second, a percentage of all sales goes to Universal based on the presumption that Zune owners are going to steal music. This is a horrible precedent, to charge customers based on the theory that they use MP3 players to steal. Now will other companies have a hidden "steal" charge? Such a flagrant disrespect and betrayal of the customer should repel everyone from the Zune. If the Zune fails, the public wins.

<Title>Try it for yourself
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune seems to be a pretty nice music player.  I had no issues with software installation or syncing any of my music,pictures, or videos.  I've had no problems with deleting anything I decided that I didn't need.  I did have a problem after installing my 14 day trial code (but I needed to just sign out and sign back in for the code to take) . I've read mixed reviews, but I don't get it - I think many of the extra features  will grow with future updates and make this the only mp3 player you will need.  I'm not a fanboy of any particular maker, I just like what I like, and this something that helps make my entertainment that much easier. I like Zune  (don't get caught up in all the lame fanboys hatred), try it for yourself, you might too.

<Title>Hardware is Great, Software Needs Improvement
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got my black Zune 30gb. I love the interface and the way it looks, because I've gotten so sick of the iPod look. I don't think its bulky, only a little thicker than and iPod. The thickness has no complaints. I love the menus and the photo quality is beautiful, better than an iPod Classic, Video, and Nano. The Zune player is absolutely wonderful! I was so excited to recieve it. The software is really annoying. It has a lot of problems. It took about 2 hours just to get 200 songs on the player. I kept getting an error code and I researched it. Now, I can sync all of my songs...but I have to sync them in small bunches. Sync 30%, disconnect, connect, sync next %30...and so on. It is a drag, but hey, its worth it. The sound quality is good. Hopefully the software will improve.  Zune player 9.5/10 stars  Software 5/10 stars

<Title>Great MP3 player for the money
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did not own a mp3 player or was in the market for one. However, it was selling for $100 before Christmas so I decided to get one. First, I thought that Brown color will not look good, but since only brown one was on sale, I did not mind. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised how good my Zune looks. I'm glad that black Zune was not on sale and I went with this one. Everybody knows what it does, so I will only review things that are annoying to me: 1. Files cannot be deleted from the player without a PC. 2. When you mark what songs you like and what songs you don't, there are only to choices. You like it or you don't. I would like to see one more option, so a. I could mark all mp3 that I do not like and I want to delete them, b. mark mp3s that are ok and can be listened to once in a while and c. my favorites that I want to listen all the time.  Besides those two things, I think the player is great.

<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my zune 30GB black from amazon for over a month now, and to tell you the truth its been an awesome experience using the zune until now.  The screen is crisp and clear and I love the full screen album art when playing my favorite mp3's.  Syncing my music to the zune was a no brainer once i installed the zune software.  Watching movies on it is also really good and comes in handy if your on a plane or in a spot waiting for someone or something.  I would totally recommend the zune to anyone looking for a mp3 / movie player.  I was skeptical at first, but my doubts are all gone now after I've used this awesome device for a month.

<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recieved the 30 gig brown zune for xmas, I was a little suprised and annoyed that the included software wasn't vista compatable. But after using the update on thier site I had my zune running with little trouble.  Two things make the zune stand out from ipod very well, the larger screen and it's FM radio. I use to have a Iriver and I loved being able to use it as a radio and even though the zune's reception isn't so great (which i can't blame on the device alone my clock radio has trouble too so it probibly has alot to do with then concrete walls.)I was pretty happy with having an option to being able to listen to whats onthe air when i get sick of my music.  The larger screen is great for videos especally for WMV which i had converted my copy of the BBC series Life On Mars and got an average of one hour long episodes onto my zune for only a 1/4th of a gig (250mb)  But still i think it comes down to the hardware being great but it's still limited by it's software. hopefully they'll fix it better but til then i'm content with using my drm free mp3s from amazon and the digital copies of series i made at home onto wmv.

<Title>Zune is good, but How cheap can Microsoft be...
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune works fine, but my question is why does it not come with a charger besides having to plug it in to your computer? Seriously, at least cell phones provide you with some kind of charger whether a home or car charger.  The Zune is not exactly inexpensive so would it hurt Microsoft to provide you with some kind of charger? Preferably a car charger because you can plug it into your computer at home and charge it there for home charging, but that of course means you have to have your computer on. Then, the accessories available for Zune are either dirt bottom cheap junk made in China (i.e. my car charger that Amazon recommended I buy along with the Zune that broke within literally 5 days. The wires came right out of the plug that goes into the Zune in less than a week, NICE. Or you have the choice to buy a Zune car charger for a minimum 40.00 dollars or more. The top of the line cell phone chargers only cost around 30.00 dollars. Microsoft needs to get with it and treat their customers right.  The company is obviously cheap and stingy and doesn't know anything about doing right by their customers.

<Title>Poor design, poor DRM sytem, and limited features
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow.  Aside from the clunky and rather cheap design of the player, I was surprised to learn how poorly thought out the music rights were.  It won't even play songs from Microsoft's own older DRM system and instead has adopted this convoluted system based on "points" instead of dollars.  Which makes you feel like you're playing some game, rather than choosing how to spend your hard earned cash.  Also, while it plays video, there is currently no way to buy any for the player.  And the limited wi-fi "sharing" feature gets old fast and is only usable if you happen to be a few feet away from another Zune player.  It's all very strange and poorly thought out.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After 2 days, countless trips to various stores & endless HOURS of tech support I have come to the decision that Zune simply sucks.   First issue I had with the Zune - No power! I bought the player, but could not locate a charger in the store (they were out, being as they only had 4 shipped to them in the first place, but 20 players????). Microsoft doesn't tell you that unless you have a USB port that ALSO has power charging capabilities you're going to need the AC adapting charger... I drove to 5 different stores, no one had the AC Adapter! Meanwhile I see a couple dozen different style chargers, cases, and all the accessories you could imagine & want for an iPod at every single store. Accessories for a Zune = ZERO!  The 'manual' that is included with the player simply has 3 instructions: "Load software, When prompted plug in cable and hook up media player, Enjoy..." Ok... so what happens when it doesn't work? No advice from their manual. I looked up the website, went through all of their troubleshooters... nothing. I called & spoke with tech support, who were very nice & spent 2 whole hours on the phone... uninstall, reinstall...back & forth, right click on this, right click on that, check your device manager. I had the exact same problems as other reviewers on Amazon when it came to syncing the Zune to the application. It never happened.  I saved for a while to buy myself a media player and am very disappointed with the fact that I just bought a $250 brick... I really wanted the Zune. But my time & my money are more valuable. Call me crazy, but when I drop $250 I expect something to work... the first time.  Save yourself the hassle & headache (and gas & phone charges...) Maybe in 2 years when Microsoft nails this whole 'media player craze' down, they will actually produce a quality product and have all the accessories you will ACTUALLY NEED readily available.

The Zune is now much better than the iPod, not only in capabilities but in quality both hardware and software wize.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Why does Microsoft feel it necessary to copy everyone? This is nothing more than an iPod ripoff, and an inferior, heavier one at that. If they find it so necessary to copy Apple and their competitors, at least create a device that is backwards compatible with your own music format ("PlayForSure").  Microsoft felt left out by the iPod's success. Unfortunately for them, their PC monopoly isn't going to help them create a successful MP3 player. The Zune is destined to be a failure. Oh, yes. It will fail.

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned an ipod (video 5g) before, and decided to get a Zune to replace it after i decided to give it to my sister.  Compared to the ipod, it has different advantages and shortcomings that overall make it an excellent competitor to the ipod. design-wise, they couldve slimmed it down a little.  the doubleshot effect gives it a glow effect and the metal trim around the screen and 4 way switch is really nice. it strains my hand a little but after getting used to it felt very solid and sturdy.  its great for holding sideways for video viewing, as it has a small concave spot on the back for easier gripping (great little addition on microsofts part).   on UI, Zune beats the ipod hands down.  its full color and easy to use menu really cut down on effort and time to find the song i wanted.  i was amazed at how easy it was to use! the screen is big, bold an beautiful and it really is the zune's forte (other than the menu and personalization). the 4way toggle switch feels a little cheap and creaks a little when i press it.  the play and back buttons could ve been a little large, my thumb has to search sometimes to press it correctly.   the accessories that came with it actually exceeded my expectations. the heapdphones are in my opinion better quality than the ipod's. they look much more expensive with a metal strip on each bud that actually is slightly magnetic and attaches to the other bud.  even the cable is nicer.  the case is kind of cheap, but serves its purpose.   the radio feature is great and after using it, it was a very nice addition to the player. now, what matters the most is the sound quality.  the sound IS a little more better than the ipod. i tested it with my old video and you can hear a more clearer and crisper sound from the zune than the ipod.  (tested it using speakers)  the ipod is still king, but the zune is probably its strongest enemy and it has great potential to dethrone it. overall, i love my new zune.

<Title>Questionable
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, were to start. The zune is great, to an extent. I bought one when it came out. It looked cool, and I did my research on it. When, I got to my computer, I inserted the CD. Well the software told me I needed SP2. So if you have windows XP and not SP2 you will HAVE to download it off of microsofts website. If I dont get SP2 soon, I will get an IPOD. Another thing, these media players in general need a High Speed Internet, I have AOL    dial-up, so it is going to take a long time for this to all happen. The 14 day trial, sucks, it is only good for 14 days once you use it, and any songs you download from this last 14 days and then stop playing, however I got the bright idea to load the song on to the 360 or burn a cd with it on, hopefull this works and after 14 days it will work and then i just retransfer the song from the cd to the zune. There is no thick direction booklet, all there is is insert cd, download, plug in zune, have fun. That is it. I reccomend this only if you have SP2, high speed internet, a lot of time, a good computer, and if you are planning on buying the apple laptop in the summer that comes with a free ipod. If you dont have any of these do not get it, the ipod is much better and much less hassle, i got one because i will be getting the laptop in the summer, and i want to say i owned one of these things in the beginning.

Actually had a box in my hand, ready to purchase, then read the system requirements (the Zune box was the only place I found these). Windows only! Alas I am a Mac user, and it absolutely does not work with a Mac. Nice planning, Microsoft! Just thought you'd like to know, since that fact is not prominently featured in most reviews and there are millions of Mac users who might have otherwise purchased the Zune. Guess I'll get an iPod after all. It is possible that I am a completely blind lunatic and missed this somewhere. If that's the case, I'm sure someone will point this out to me promptly. But before trudging off to purchase it, I read many reviews and checked the product description and technical details here on Amazon. I didn't see any system requirements listed. Pretty important detail to leave out, don't you think?

<Title>Same reason I won't buy an I pod.
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say, I really wanted to like the Zune.  The interface is great, the unit is only marginally different from the IPOD in size, the screen is not the best quality available but very nice, and (while it is not as sleek as the ipod) it still has it own style.  I do worry a bit about the coating on the case... seems like something that could wear-out or stain quickly with constant use.  However, my biggest kvetch is the closed architecture.  Fix this and I'm sold.  I'm not a typical end-user but, I , along with millions of others, I'm sure, would love to drag-and-drop stuff into place from my pc and have no other worries. Hopefully one of the update addresses this "down-the-road".  Microsoft has done all they can to stay within the letter of the law with all their music endeavors and they should be commended for that. However, for my money I'd just assume go with something like a Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB Portable Media Player and have a Windows interface that doesn't box me in as much.  It's not perfect either but, for my purposes, it's much more well suited to my needs.  I hope, in the not-too-distant future, I'm proven to be short-sighted and Microsoft updates this product to exceed my expectations and everyone elses as well.

<Title>Greatest MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this MP3 player. I would only change the color I got but Brown works. I am finding new things daily about the player. I've downloaded movies to it and it has great video quality. Recommend for those quick road trips or airline trips.  The kids will love it too. I love having the FM Radio on there.

<Title>Works for me
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like this better than my better half's iPod. The BIG screen is nice, and 30 gigs at a great price. Zune marketplace now supports podcasts. I've had no problems with the marketplace other than it being down the same time as Xbox Live was having troubles during the Christmas season.  My son and I bought the software to rip our DVD's to the Zunes. Works great.

<Title>Zune - it's whats for breakfast
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>so I went through most of the reviews that everyone posted and went ahead and bought the red 30bg zune. I have to say I love this thing! The 1st gen software sucks but that gets updated as soon as you setup and synch the device. I'm not crazy about the video setup for this because it takes quite a while for moviemaker to create something that the zune will accept but overall it did a decent job.   I dont' see why everyone is complaining about these. It's durable, easy to use, ok battery life and holds a lot of stuff.   is it an IPod killer? not necessarily but I will say that for the price, I'll take one of these ANYDAY before I go the way of the Ifool... too expensive and way to easy to break...   For once, good job microsoft... even tho you are the evil empire!

<Title>For those who want a great alternative to the iPod
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The last reviewer really doesn't even know what he's talking about, especially because he's reviewing a product that hasn't even been released yet.  The fact is, Microsoft isn't going to kill the iPod with its 1st generation Zune, but they will definitely take out a big chunk of Apple's market share in the music player industry.  And as they update the device with future generations, it will only get better.  This is going to be a fantastic device with many more features than the current iPods.  Microsoft has created some extremely intuitive software for this device, making navigation a breeze.  Being able to share music, movies, and pictures with friends will be great.  The 3" screen is much bigger than the tiny screen on the iPod, so this is much better suited to watching movies.  And the fact that you can import your music straight from iTunes will make changing over to the Zune that much easier!  In my opinion, this is a great alternative to the iPod.

<Title>Zune has enough unique features to bite into Apple's pie
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Packing a 3" screen, an FM-tuner, and Wireless features into a unit almost exactly the size of a video iPod, Zune is a compelling alternative to Apple's iconic iPod.   While it's hard to match the elegance and innovation of iPod, Microsoft has broken new ground with its "community" features of Zune - which allow wireless sharing of songs from one Zune to any nearby Zune. The shared songs are limited to 3-plays-in-3-days.   With its aggressive pricing, and feature-packed opening model, Microsoft may just turn the portable media player world into a two-horse race.

<Title>Good jumping off point for Microsoft
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's impossible to not compare the Zune to the iPod so I'm not even going to try, but let's get one thing out of the way right quick: Anyone who calls the Zune an iPod killer needs to have their head examined.  Let's not forget that there are many people who have invested hundreds or thousands of dollars into iTunes music, so they're pretty much iPod customers for life(as Zune customers will be if they choose to use the Zune marketplace, but more on that later). And in case you haven't noticed, the iPod is a pretty darn good device.  The Zune doesn't really offer anything that should have iPod+iTunes users jumping ship, but it does offer a compelling option for those looking to purchase a product like this for the first time or iPod users who have chosen to continue to buy CDs instead of digital albums.  The first thing you'll notice after purchasing the Zune is that if they ever gave away some type of award for product packaging, the Zune would probably win it.  The brown portion of the Zune box slips off to reveal a compartmentalized box inside that includes the Zune, the docking cable, stock earbuds, the Zune software, the token cheap felt case, and the documentation.    Onto the Zune itself.  Even at 30 gigs it's a bit longer and thicker than the 80 gig iPod. It is substantially heavier but not to a fault.  Those looking to use an MP3 player for active use will probably want a flash player anyway.  Where the Zune holds a big advantage over the iPod however is the rubbery-plastic finish.  Whereas the iPod's glossy finish is a magnet for fingerprints, the Zune's rubbery plastic feel attracts virtually no fingerprints, and when it does they simply wipe off.  The screen accumulates them quickly, and while a thin plastic film coating is included, it has some large text on it, so you might have to invest in a third-party screen protector.  Bummer.   The control pad has been often maligned for not being a scroll wheel, but I don't understand why.  Is moving your thumb around in circles really THAT intuitive?   Onto the software. It's a bit dissapointing that the Zune doesn't simply intergrate seamlessly with Windows Media Player 11 like most MP3 players now do.  Instead you'll have to install the dedicated Zune software, which is essentially Windows Media Player 11 in some new clothing and with the Zune Marketplace built in.  There have been many reports of hiccups installing the new software, so beware.  It seems I was lucky. Once you do get the software going, syncing your music library to your player is a breeze, with a transfer speed of about two seconds per song.    As I said, the Zune software is essentially WMP11 with the Zune Marketplace included.  The first time you enter the marketplace the software will ask you for your Windows Live ID.  This is where one very cool perk comes into play if you are an XBox Live user.  When you login with your ID, your Zune Marketplace account automatically links up with your XBox Live account, so you can share your Microsoft Points you already have across both services!  Very very convienent.    Unfortunately, that may be the highlight of the Zune Marketplace.  Graphically, it can't hold a candle to iTunes and is pretty darn ugly.  Users can't review albums, and it as of yet doesn't offer anything besides music(this is probably going to change very very soon).  I don't even use an iPod and I like browsing the iTunes store to see what's new and read user reviews.  I couldn't imagine using the Zune Marketplace for anything except buying an album.  But even that wouldn't be advisable, since the music you purchase on the Zune marketplace will work ONLY on the Microsoft Zune and nothing else.  So until it starts offering TV Shows and movies, the Zune Marketplace is a major dud.     This is where the real treat comes in, once you get your music onto the Zune and fire it up for the first time, many of your initial doubts will vanish.  The screen is large, bright, and the background is fully customizable.  The interface is a huge breath of fresh air after using the stale Artist>Album>Song system on iPods and Creative players for so many years.  Instead, Artist, Album, and Song are listed horizontally at the top of the screen, and as you move the cursor over each option all of the items spill out down the substantial screen, with thumbnail album art included!  When you do choose a song, the album art for that song dominates the screen, and the sound quality is excellent.  You can easily adjust the volume by pressing up-and-down on the control pad, and scroll through the song by pushing left and right.     So music playback is a huge "hit", but how about the video?  The format support is pretty limited, and while the Zune software will convert just about anything, the playback format of converted videos is pretty poor.  It was also a puzzling move for the Zune to have a 16x9 screen but only support 4:3 resolution.  The stretching of the picture doesn't really take that much away, but it seems a bit pointless.  One handy feature is that the control pad will re-orient the controls for the Zune when you hold the player sideways.    One last thing, you might have noticed I haven't even mentioned the much-hyped wi-fi feature.  Why?  Because it's practically useless.  Songs received via wi-fi transfer can only be played three times within a three day period, and songs by some artists(such as the Rolling Stones) won't even transfer at all!  The wi-fi capabilities of the Zune certainly offers exciting possibilities for future firmware updates, but they're certainly not present now.    So that's it.  The Zune offers nothing that will have seasoned iPod+iTunes users jumping ship,  and it certainly' won't kill the iPod, but the exceptional physical design, vastly superior user interface, and wi-fi possiblities in the future warrant a serious look by shoppers.

I bought two zunes, one for my wife, and I have to say that the wireless sharing works great and as avertised.  It is also more resistant to scratches.

<Content>I don't work for Microsoft, nor have any intentions to but please let us be fair, after examing and the Zune. Hands down, it is the best MP3 player since the IPOD invasion. With all fairness, the IPOD had its place in History but currently there has being other better Mp3 players since. ZUNE is currently the Editor's choice. Once again pls don't fight Microsft, try the ZUNE on your own. None of us will be happy if we were punished by word of mouth for the sins of our forefathers. Why penalise the ZUNE, it stands on its own. Try the Zune and forget about thoughtless words which stirs up confusion.  THANKS: kObE

<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't know what everyone is talking about. This product is great. Everything about is convenient. Its ridicuously easy to use, simple but yet very good. Half of the people on here that are "dogging" this product haven't even bought one. I was going to get an ipod but then i heard about this and decided to check it out. I talked to didfferent people who had or used an ipod before and did a comparison on the the specs of both products online. It also has more features like the tuner and wi-fi. i love it. The only way i could see someone complaining is that OP system has to be Windows XP Professional. But if you don't have that by now, well what can i say. The main reason i bought this though was because all my downloaded songs are from limewire in a windows media format and i heard(an employee from best buy and other ipod users) that the ipod has problems with windows media format. I also saw that someone said when using the Zune, when listening to music and trying to look at pictures at the same time that the music stops playing. Not true. I am doing it now. I would recommend this product to anyone. But it really all depends what operating system you have or if use itunes or limewire because the ipod's and the zunes have different copyrights so you can't buy itunes for the zune in the zune marketplace. I don't have itunes but i did read that if you already have music downloaded from itunes that the zune will automatically change the format when you upload to the zune. but this product is great. i love it.

<Title>looking good so far with a couple things to fix
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just want to say one thing first: i dont, nor did i ever own an ipod.  this isn't because of any "anti-apple" feelings, in fact, their ipod led the way in the innovation of the mp3 player by having possibly the greatest one available.  I just never felt like spending the money until now.  I chose to buy the zune, and i like it a lot.  Not wanting to get anyone too upset, but if u didn't do your homework and do some research (say, just look up zune on google and read some stuff like the product specs) then u shouldn't complain saying things like "i didn't like how it can't be used as an external hard drive?" or "why don't the songs from itunes work?" cuz i, not the most computer saavy person, in just a few mintues of googling found sites where many people could have found these things out before buying.  (They could have complained first and then choose not to buy it!  however this seems not to have happened as people buy it, complain, return it, and then buy an ipod.  Whats up with that?!)  For the record, I DONT WORSHIP APPLE, NOR DO I WORSHIP MICROSOFT!!!  I believe in competition, though, and found that this was the best mp3 player for what i wanted to do.  in other words, buy it only if u feel like u should and not because of who made it.  To end this review, i'll leave u with the overused and seemingly powerful statement:  The choice is yours! (and yours alone!!!)

<Content>What's the big deal? I looked at it in the store, took it for a test drive. No big deal.   So you can wifi a song to a friend. Big deal, whoopee. They can only listen to the darn song 3 lousy times for 3 days. Gee, don't let me get too excited.  The 1-star is for the 3" display screen, which is nice. And the 30GB is OK.   But we don't get anything new here and are still tied down in many ways to music subscriptions. It's baloney. AND the price is no deal.   Do yourself a favor and buy the Creative Zen Vision:W or Creative Zen Vision:M. I've used both, and an iPod. Creative Zen or iRiver offer the most flexibility and the most features without strapping into a million rules.  What all these MP3 & photo players could use is better calendaring, more like Palm calendaring AND wifi for anything.

<Title>Zune is doomed upon arrival. Don't get stuck with this mess!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This supposed 'Ipod Killer' will be lucky to even steal market share from the smallest of competitor's in the now over-populated mp3 player market. The problem with this player is that it comes prepackaged with all the arrogance and restrictiveness one has come to expect from Microsoft. Whilst the Ipod has been able to beautifully merge itself from being simply a music player, to a platform within itself, this product seems destined to head in the direction of the 'PlaysForSure' debacle. The problem with Microsoft, as was demonstrated recently by them shutting down their MSN music site, is that they show no commitment to their customers. As soon as sales of the Zune inevitably prove to be too low to justify them even being produced, Microsoft will pull the plug, leaving consumers with a device which will be as useless as a torn plastic bag.  Microsoft certainly have millions to burn, and their campaigns have been quick to point out the social networking feature of the zune. However, the fine print which accompanies this feature far outweighs any usefulness it might have had to average user. Unless Microsoft magically sells 60 million units of this thing within the next couple of years, the wireless connectivity feature will be a useless gimmick which will leave consumers feeling quite duped.  The whole UMG deal also shows just how arrogant Microsoft can be. You see, the precedent set by this deal will have serious consequences on music listeners for many years to come. When the Zune exits the market, Microsoft can take pleasure in knowing that they single-handedly destroyed an entire industry.  Apple may have a near monopoly on the market at the moment, but they have proven themselves to be quite attentive and loyal to their customers. They have constantly improved their devices and services, and have stood their ground in refusing to raise their Itunes prices.  You have to ask yourself, Do you really want a player which will practically hold you captive to gods of DRM?

<Title>Decent Player, Horrid Store
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player is nice, if a little large.  The store is terrible.  You have to buy a package of points.  If you don't spend all your points Microsoft still gets the money and keeps it until you do.  Say you want two songs.  You have to buy $5 worth of points from Microsoft.  Each song costs $0.99, so Microsoft keeps your $3.02 in it's back account until you spend it.  Now say you buy 5 songs at once.  At .99 a song that comes to $4.95.  Microsoft keeps your nickel.  So in reality the price of the songs are more than iTunes, but they don't tell you that.  If you buy just one song, it's $5.  If you buy 2, it's $2.50 a song.  If you buy 5, it's a dollar each.  Microsoft does not tell you about the hidden pricing.  It's this kind of if not downright deceptive then misleading practice that makes me shy away from the player.

<Title>Just as good as the iPOD, if not better!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I own the third gen ipod that was 15gb and was just an LCD without color. It has the wheel and 4 buttons on top. No click wheel. I then upgraded to the Ipod Video and immediately disliked it and thought it was a step back in terms of usability. Sure, you have less buttons, but that doesn't make it better.  So, I disliked my Ipod video somewhat so I wanted something better. I bought this and connected it and installed the software. It does not ask you where you want to install it. Not only that but it automatically thinks I want to  upload all my video captures to my Zune and does so without asking me once. Of course I cancel that and change the options. It only took a few seconds. I had no problems with installing the software. Microsoft must think everyone is an idiot and just does everything automatic without asking.   The transfer of my mp3 files to the Zune went ok and I never yet had the system crash.   I checked my artist listings after the transfer and several were all named differently, but it's super easy to fix. You can rename multiple track names and artists at the same time.  Strangely, it doesn't download every single piece of CD art it finds. I click on a foreign language album and see art there, but it doesn't update. Only on certain albumbs. 95% of my american CDs had album art automatically downloaded. I just need to figure out if there is a way to NOT display the colored default album art for titles that have no artwork. Probably not.  The unit sounds good, but they need more EQ settings. The ipod has more options for this. Bass Boost or Bass Reducer like on the Ipod would have been nice. I also wish the volume could go a little higher. 20/20 is not enough for some songs/headphones.  I like the button on this. Not having a wheel is no big deal. I never liked the wheel anyway. It takes absolutely no effort to press the button on this unlike on some other units (Philips and those tiny silver buttons). To scroll up, you can hold it down instead of pressing the button over and over again.  I love the design. It's pretty much perfect. It's not a big deal, but I find it more comfortable to hold than my Ipod Video. I will admit though that the interface takes a few more steps to play music than the Ipod.  So far I honestly haven't found many negatives about the unit. I've just had ZERO problems with it and no I don't work for Microsoft! Once I find out a problem with it, i'll update this review. I do think the biggest annoyance is that the volume could be a little louder if needed.  No, it's not an Ipod killer, but it's just as good as the Ipod, if not better. I do think it's better in most ways. It's not as simple and easy to navigate in as the Ipod though, but pretty close.  Battery life was ok. I don't know if my unit was fully charged when I first used it, but it lasted about 6 hours, but I had the volume cranked and wasn't going for power saving.   If you have an Ipod video already and love it, then there is no reason to get this unless you just want something new. I didn't like the Ipod Video, so this is a good replacement.

<Title>Zune Marketplace Store is Really Weird
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am considering getting an MP3 player for someone, but I have something that is making it very difficult to seriously consider the Zune.  If someone could explain what is going on with the Zune Marketplace, I would appreciate it.  Whatever the merits of the player itself, the only place that you can buy anything online is at the Zune Marketplace store and its song pricing policy appears very deceptive.  Zune has its own currency where $.99 in US dollars equals $.79 in Zune dollars.  You must also deposit money in $5 (US Dollar) increments.  If you buy five songs, it costs you $3.95 in Zune dollars, $4.95 in US dollars.  But Microsoft still has $.05 (in US Dollars) of your original $5 deposit left over.  This left over gap actually keeps getting larger for quite sometime.  If you give them $95 and buy 95 songs, you will still have $.95 (US Dollars) left in your account.  If they want to charge $1 (US) for each song, why not just do it.  Of course, if you don't buy five songs for each $5 you put in, the effective price for each song is well over $1.   Adding on the conversion of all this money into Zune dollars is possibly Microsoft's cute idea that no one will figure all this out.  Do people really want to multiply their Zune expenditures by $.99/$.79 to do the conversions or remember the exact number of songs that they have bought so that they can directly multiple the number of songs by $.99?  I would really appreciate someone telling me why any of this is reasonable.  Do I want to give someone a headache dealing with this whole set up?  At least so far, it comes across as Microsoft trying to take advantage of people.  If someone can justify this complicated pricing structure that actually makes virtually everyone pay more than the officially advertised price for songs, I would appreciate it.  Until this concern is addressed, I have to give Zune a single star.

<Title>Extremely pleased...
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After bad-mouthing Microsoft's attempt at even considering entering the cluttered, overcrowded MP3 player market, I have to admit...I'm eating a bit of crow now.  I've owned a few different players, including the iPod, the Sansa, and a Creative Zen device.  Whereas the Zune is the most expensive player I've owned, it shot out in front of the crowd while I was investigating available options to replace my broken Zen.  Firstly, the hardware is actually a modified Toshiba GigaBeat product loaded with a revamped version of Media Center Mobile.  I've always wondered what the GigaBeat feels like and would probably have been prettly pleased had I ever taken the plunge and purchased the Toshiba offering.  The Zune feels great in my hand, yet not like it will crumble if/when I drop it to the floor.  It looks and feels sturdy to withstand the general wear and tear that made my iPod look like I ran it through the dryer a few times a month.  (I didn't.)  The software built into the Zune is truly fantastic.  MUCH speedier than the other players I've owned and also the best looking and most functional.  (I love being able to customize the background with a picture of my kids...'course, that's just me.)  With all of this said, that the Zune Marketplace offers a subscription service is what convinced me to buy the Zune.  I own a TON of CD's, mostly Greatest Hits packages, but love listening to new music, too.  I just find it more practical to get them as part of a subscription to make sure I won't be wasting my $$ if/when I decide to buy them digitally or at the CD store.  The Marketplace is actually pretty cool, but still simple enough to navigate quickly.  And is amazingly fast when it comes time to sync the files to my Zune.  (I'm not sure if I've just used the wrong combination of player/software in the past, but the speed of the sync really blows me away.)  All in all, I am extremly pleased with my Zune (Black).  For the price, I feel like I got a great bargain and am excited to see what's in store for the Zune as MS improves the burned-in software and the desktop Zune app.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is way more than I expected. Sure, it doesn't offer much the iPod hasn't offered before (just the WiFi and FM) but you have to try it for yourself. The interface is great and very intuitive. It took me about 1 minute to figure out all its features. I didn't have any problems with the software or to synchronize it. It's actually very fast! It took it about 1-2 seconds per song. Although the screen is just half an inch larger than the iPod's looks way better. Very bright and sharp image, like an XBRITE LCD. The integration with Zune Marketplace is perfect. Very smooth and easy to use. I subscribed to the Zune Pass option ($14.99 plus tax) which gives you unlimited songs in up to three PCs and syncronization to up to two Zunes. Beware of all those 1-star reviews of people who haven't even used it! You have to try it for yourself. I'm loving mine!

<Content>This is a great mp3 player, and if you are in the market for an iPod or iPod-like media player, do yourself a favour and try it out. The screen is beautiful, and sound quality is very sweet indeed.  Do your research and make an educated decision. Don't write off the Zune just because it's not from Apple!

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted a replacement for the iPod 30gig which I had broken. This was the only logical choice seeing as Apple no longer makes the 30gig iPod. The Zen players I never really liked aesthetically. Great player, does everything you need from a HDD music player. Only thing different from the iPod is the poorly designed Zune software. The software makes editing ID3 tags a pain, but thankfully I still have Itunes for this reason. Only thing I could have asked for was a clock. No installation problems, as of now wireless syncing does not work, haven't found anyone with a Zune to share music with either. These fixes I assume will be fixed in later versions of the firmware updates, I am not worried, I am waiting for the possibilities of the wireless function to open up. Not an iPod killer, good alternative though, and holds up better to scratches and wear and tear.

<Title>Solid Player
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this for my wife and the controls are easy to use. The large screen is also very nice. When the cable is plugged in to the bottom of the Zune sometimes we have to 'jiggle' it a little in order to make a good connection. The battery life is about what we expected.  We use it mostly for playing mp3's and podcasts.  It is a nice way for my wife to show off pictures of our kids. Several things were questionable like being able to play video with an A/V cable.  But once we connected the Zune to the PC and performed a firmware upgrade, it works fine now.  This is a nice substitute for an iPod; costs a lot less too.

Apple may control this product market, but it's not based on quality or value - just being first to market and having no real competition early on.

<Content>I have had the Zune for a couple months now. It was originally bought for my wife, but we both use it quite a bit. Not only have i loaded every single CD I own on to it, but we load movies onto it as well. With the video out cable we hook it up to the player in the back seat and the girls can watch movies while we drive, or we plug it into the car stereo and then we don't care how bad the radio reception is. The wireless has had some issues with synching with our network, but we usually don't use that anyway, so it's not that big an issue. Overall I've been very happy with the Zune.

Well I found everything that I was looking for in the ZUNE!  My daughter absolutely loves it!  I am not a computer techy, but the graphics are vivid!  It is easy to use.  I was not turned off by the size, because it wouldn't be hard to lose it.  The sound quality is pretty good.  It is very easy to download songs.  I made a very good investment!  I would definately recommend this to everyone!  I also purchased the 3 pack chargers, which included: the ac adapter, car charger, and the usb cable.  I only paid $12 for ALL 3 of them, also from Amazon.com.  For that price, you can't go wrong!

The only disadvantage is that, the charging has to be done by connecting Zune to the system. We need to buy the charger seperately, if u need to charge it directly without connecting it to the system.   Other than this difficulty, i find Zune as one of the best items i own.

<Content>The 30 GB ZUNE is absolutely the best product out there even though the newer versions are out on the market, this product can't be beat. You can't purchase any brand with the equal amount of space and features as this model for the same price, heck even the 4 GB model is more than what I purchased this one for. It was purchased as a gift, so its going to be even harder finding the 30GB ZUNE at a reasonable price. I'm glad to have been able to get one.

I really like the fact that everything I had in my Windows Media Player quickly converted over onto the Zune Player(minus some of the videos which through conversion software I have done) much nicer than Itunes.  The screen on it is beautiful and much nicer than the Ipods.  Have not had a chance to try out the wi-fi on it yet, but the fm radio works great.  Would recommend to andybody I know to purchase.  Worth the money, don't consider these other reviews from people who have not tried it.

<Title>Thumbs up!
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My experience so far with the Zune has been positive overall. I will get my only bummer out of the way: the earbuds supplied with the Zune do not fit my ears, but no earbuds of that type do. My ears are just too small.  I know there are a lot of reviews out there dogging Microsoft for this and that, but honestly the only choices MS made that stink are not allowing Plays For Sure songs to run on the Zune, and the crazy points system on the Marketplace. I haven't purchased any tunes from them, so it doesn't apply to me. I also don't plan on purchasing many songs from the Zune Marketplace (if at all), as I like to actually own music with CDs. Thus no loss of starriness in my review. Your mileage may vary.  I should note what kind of consumer I am. This is the first mp3 player that I've owned. I plan to use this at the gym, at work, and at home on the speakers. I was never looking into iPods heavily, mostly because I really wanted an FM tuner built into my player. I have no personal issues with Apple, in fact I'm no Microsoft junkie either. I also wanted something that could hold my CD collection. The Creative Zen Vision:M and the Zune were the two front-runners; about the same price for most of the same features. I chose the Zune for the ruggedness of its case--the Zen was scratched to h@ll at Best Buy--and the interface. I wasn't a fan of the vertical touch pad (just to add: I also am not fond of the click wheel of the iPod; I tended to end up stopping past my chosen point). The Zune just seemed to make sense as I went through the menus. I also chose the Zune partly for its looks; the Zen looked like a boring variation of the iPod, and the Zune's screen looked better than the Zen's.  It's been very hard finding comparisons between the Creative Vision:M and the Zune, as most compare both to the iPod but not to each other. For those unable to decide, though, it may all come down to the players' sizes, the potential of the Zune's WiFi (kinda nerfed now, but the future is promising) and minor cosmetic or functional preferences, depending on the person. I really wanted to like the Zen more, because I don't think Bill Gates needs more of my money, but the Zune really won me over on the intangibles.  Software: some are reporting problems. I loaded it up with no crashing and no confusion. Rips my CDs just fine (needed to load album art a couple of times, but that's all). I have had zero problems and can figure out how to do things with it quite easily. I'm not a computer whiz either, just so you know.  Overall, I'm thrilled with my Zune, the sound it produces is super, the screen looks great for video (if that's what you like, I won't be using that much), and I'm looking forward to the growth of Zunedom.  Before you buy, you might want to check out the software for yourself and see how the Marketplace and interface works. Just go to the zune site and click on the download software links.  Happy shopping!

<Title>OK but sure is not an ipod. Doesnt work 
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an ok thing. I had to get one because i am a huge ipod fan and had to test one of these ipod killers as they say and see how great it was and what everyone was talking about with it. So i got one. The first thing i noticed is the wheel is not a wheel its actually a d pad desquised as a wheel. The screen is larger but when you set it side by side with an ipod its not relaly much bigger its a very deciving thing. It looks bigger till you put it next to an ipod then you realize the screen is not really that much bigger.   Tried installing it the zune crashed and then would not see the OS. Then after unplugging it and replugging it several times it finally say the OS. Then it was such a pain to install it wanted several different places for me to sign up for a live account and i didnt want that. I only wanted to see how it works to purchase music. NO such luck i coulndt get around it. THis is not user friendly so far.  After getting it all installed (took 2 hours) i logged in to the zune store. THis place is a mess no album reviews no movies, podcasts, videos or anything like that. The music selection is very basic mostly top 40 stuff. Well i for one dont listen to that garbage and it seems MS thinks we all do so therefor lets only put this music on our store.  Its not user friendly at all it just is not click and download like the itunes/ipod. I dont like the subscrption idea i want to own my songs i dont want to pay someone $15 a month just to rent some songs. I rent movies i OWN songs. But to buy you have to buy ms points and then MICROcrap will keep whatever you dont use.   I just cant see anyone who is not a geek wanting this thing. Its think it heavy and its weird it just doesnt work right it is no where close to the the ipod. I dont like the interface its ok but nothing special. I also dont like that microsoft refused to put there name anywhere on it. Makes me think as a business person the only reason i wouldnt want to put my name on something is if i think its crap or junk.   I dont see these selling very much and if you have never owned an MP3 player DONT BUY THIS ONE!!!! Get an ipod or if you have a thing against the ipod then get anything else but not a zune. I have several different players and this one would come in dead last as far as functionality and form. Im not baised i think everyone deserves a chance but im sorry zune is just not worth the money. why would i spend the same ammount on the zune as an ipod when my ipod will do so much more?  THis will not play podcasts, videos movies or games. It has wifi but i dont know anyone who wants a zune let aone would buy one so who am i going to wifi with? i know tons of ipod users but wifi is not a big thing i would rather just share headphones and jam right along with my friend. The FM radio well not even an issue i could buy a fm for my ipod but i didnt buy a mp3 player to listen to the radio. If i want that i will turn on my radio in my house or car. FM is dead anyway XM and Sirius are the future of radio.  Think before you buy if you want this because it has wifi well first you have to find someone who will wifi with you. As steve balmer put it i could squirt something to you. NO THANKS KEEP YOUR SQUIRTING to yourself. It just sounds sick and nasty.  Have you seen the commercials to these things? They make no sence and if anyone watched them i see nothing in the commercial that makes me want one or even after words knowing what the thing is.

<Title>Zune Raises the Stakes
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I fly several times a week, so portable entertainment is a must for me. I bought the black Zune; white's a summer color and brown just doesn't go with enough of my wardrobe. But, color is not important - all Zunes are created equal. I won't go into the elegant packaging, which felt very reminiscent of opening my year old iPod. I hope you didn't think I would write a review of the Zune without comparing the two. I'm typing it in Word on the plane, so it may be long.  Fresh out of the box, the Zune felt warm, as in comfortable. Its blue edges glowed in all their double-shot finish beauty. The next thing I noticed was its size. It's noticeably heavier than my iPod, and slightly too big for my dainty hands. I guess that's the price of a bigger screen, which is not as grainy as reviews made it out to be - though it's not as crisp as my iPod side by side.  Holding them up together, I can use the Zune a little bit further from my face when viewing, an inch or two. But honestly, neither of them is comfortable enough to hold for too long. The iPod definitely wins when it comes to watching for long periods but I like the sideways viewing of the Zune. I'll take them both on flights now in case one dies, but I usually use my laptop on flights over an hour anyway.   I have a photo of my doggie set as my background. It's a nice feature but I don't see it much since the players are always in my bag on shuffle or playing a video. I know the more I view it, the more the battery dies.  Of the two, my iPod has got more use over the last five days. I'm a huge fan of podcasts like National Geographic's Atmosphere, Science Friday and NPR. The Zune menu doesn't have a podcast selection and it doesn't support podcasts that well. I don't think any company should make a player without podcasts. As a frequent traveler, they're my news and entertainment. I'm not used to having to go find my podcasts. They've always been right there on iTunes.  After I figured out how to download a few audio podcasts manually, I realized it's not worth the effort.  No wonder people say iPod made podcasts accessible to the world.  If this is what it was like before iTunes managed podcasts, I would have never spent the time to discover them. I was troubled several times when I had to search for where I left off in the middle of a podcast, apparently the Zune doesn't store that information if you stop and listen to some music. I started pausing my Zune and switching to the iPod to avoid losing my place. Now I don't use it for podcasts at all.  Some of my videos were automatically transferred, but my Good Eats episodes stayed behind. It's a shame; those were my favorite time passers and I'm behind by about a hundred episodes. Alton Brown is so nerd-cute. They don't play on my iPod either though. But, I was hoping I could view them somewhere other than the laptop. After I checked, many more of my videos had not got transferred. I don't know why. I guess it won't matter when people legally buy their videos from the Zune Store, but Zune doesn't have them yet.  Then there's listening to music.  I knew my iTunes purchased songs wouldn't convert but I don't plan on getting rid of my iPod anyway. The first thing I noticed was how easy it was to navigate from albums to artists to genres to songs.  The Zune navigation is great. This is the first thing I hope Apple learns from Zune. There's no reason to back all the way out to the main menu to switch from songs to albums. Shuffling was a breeze; it's only a click away. I don't know why iPod doesn't use the center button more effectively. Another beauty was discovered in album view. The Zune shows tiny album art right beside the album name.  I disabled album art on my iPod because all the storage is filled with video, but I know it doesn't have this tiny album art feature. I'll probably disable them on my Zune if I can. The only problem I had with music was that when listening to music I was constantly changing the volume. I think the iPod takes care of this so that all songs are equally loud.  I keep my wireless off because I'm afraid I'll forget to do it on the plane. I don't know what it will do, but I'm not going to be the one who does it. I've also read wireless off will give me more battery life. The Zune seems to last at least an hour less than my iPod but I've never timed them. I don't think many people would like my music; that's why I got an iPod in the first place. So, without sharing, I don't really have a use for the wireless. As I mentioned, I always have the wireless off so nobody would see my Zune anyway.  Not that I was going to start talking to people in the airports.  The Zune Store just doesn't compare to iTunes. I've only looked around but it doesn't seem as easy or well organized.  Maybe I've just used iTunes too much. I was going to buy a song to try it out but I had to advance pay with Zune Pass. So I'll stick with iTunes for now. I can't look at it from up here, so I won't comment.  From what I've read there is no way to store documents on the Zune, which I do with 1 gigabyte of my iPod. Most of them are on my company laptop because they're confidential and our IT department said iTunes screen lock wasn't secure enough. I also can't sync Microsoft Outlook with my Microsoft Zune, weird. I find that strange since my Outlook calendar and contacts sync with my Apple iPod. Because of that, my Zune has no contacts or appointments on it.  I guess it's not required but I don't always have my laptop and have become quite used to checking my iPod for contacts, flight times, and other information.  I think my favorite feature of the Zune is tagging. I can tag any song so that I can do something to it later - usually delete it. Sometimes on my iPod I want to add the song to a different playlist, like the one I use for waking up.  All those songs start off soft and pick up the intensity slowly - a great way to wake up. I can't tag on iPod so I have to use the menu to find the song and hold the center button to add it to the iPod's to-go playlist. Tagging on the iPod takes two clicks of the center button. This is another thing Apple could make easier.  Overall I like my Zune, but it just doesn't do enough to replace my iPod. Actually, not near enough as it's missing everything I've come to rely on. The two will work together for the foreseeable future unless I decide to give the Zune to my nephew. This desire to write a Zune review has sparked me to write one for my iPod as well. I'm rating the Zune a three and the iPod a four.  There are too many important features missing from the Zune. Neither gets a five-star rating because they both don't do things I wish they could, like recording our board meetings. I wouldn't switch from iPod to Zune for anything and I wouldn't recommend it over an iPod. Depending on what you want to do the Zune is nice, but if you like features over the latest buzz I'd stay away for now.

<Title>Great Gen1 Product
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No, it's not an iPod killer for most people, but it is for me. Having attempted to use the klunky iTunes interface and having to buy third party products to avoid the 3 day (yes...days!) WMA -> MP3 / Apple conversion time iTunes said it would take - I've had enough. I can't even remember when the last time was that I tried to synch it. On the contrary, the Zune was installed, configured correctly and all of my music (with album art correctly associated), pictures and videos were on the Zune in under 10 minutes. And as an FYI - this isn't "substantially" heavier as some people have noted. It's a whopping 1.25oz heavier - I know, I weighed them! I think that's easily attributed to the extra hardware that's inside, not to mention the larger screen. Then again, what do I care? My bag is filled with a laptop, portable hard drives, an Origami and so on...an ounce doesn't mean much to me.  I'm a little confused as to how people are having difficulty getting this up and running. Aside from some of the stupid text, e.g. "welcome to the social" - the installation is very smooth and the transfer is moron proof. My only regret in purchasing this was the wasted money on iPod accessories, but hey...I suppose I can put them all up on Amazon or another auction site!  All and all, good experience - looking forward to seeing future updates to maximize the potential here, particularly with Media Center and XBox 360 - nothing Apple will be able to touch.

<Title>Waste of money
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1.	For every Zune you buy, $1 goes to Universal (why?). 2.	Confusing method of points to purchase music. 3.	Thick and heavy. 4.	The wheel is fake. Apple owns the patent for the click wheel. 5.	WiFi only for songs, not for PC Sync, downloading music, etc. 6.	WiFI transferred songs will delete after 3 plays or three days,       whichever first. Even songs ripped from CD's or songs from       Kazaa,etc. 7.	Songs with any DRM (other than zune-drm), even MSN-DRM (playforsure) will not work on the       Zune. 8.	Short battery life (you get less than 8 hours of audio playback). 9.	Has plenty of problems when you sync to PC.  10.	 Even though the Zune's screen is depicted in press photos as being sharper than the iPod's, both have a resolution of 320x240. The Bigger screen with the same resolution means FUZZIER resolution. The Ipod delivers a crispier image.  *** And oh yes, I do have both here, an Ipod G5 and a brown brick zune, which I won in a bet. I am giving it away though. I do feel responsible to tell other people that if you are going to get one, watch out. At least I did not pay to use this garbage.

<Title>Simply Amazing
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a new "chocolate colored (brown) zune" today. It is a little thicker than the Ipod (a little less than twice the ipod's thickness), but feels as light as ipod. The brown zune has a shiny green glow across its borders due to the doubleshot effect and it looks wonderful.   These are advantages of zune over ipod  1. 3 inch screen compared to a very small ipod screen,  that makes video viewing more enjoyable than the ipod 2. "All you can eat" zune pass. My zune came with a 14 day trial of the zune pass and I am already enjoying the pleasure of renting as many songs as I can for a small monthly fee. 3. A tough and sleek look and feel. The photographs do not do justice to how zune looks or feels in your hand. You have to hold it to notice the difference. It is very smooth and looks like it can take a beating. I am more confident with handling my zune now, because it seems more resistant to damage or scratches. 4. "Software" - I have read all kinds of software reviews that installation is painful, buggy, software is not usable etc.... but it was a very smooth experience for me. I did not have any problems and I love the software. The zune marketplace has "search as you type" feature that makes searching for a song so easy. All my songs look so lively in the software because of the emphasis on album art. I like the slideshows too. 5. "Software inside zune" - I love the horizontal navigation which eliminates having to go into levels and levels of nested menus. Handling zune's like a breeze. 6. I can set a " wallpaper"  7. Zune looks colorful and lively - both the device and software inside and outside of it. This is unlike ipod - a very dull and boring interface. 8. Radio is awesome. 9. Wireless is good, but I wish MS should have done more with it  It imported all my music, videos and pictures very nicely and very fast onto my zune. It looked like much faster than ipod.  I am very very satisfied and I think its a 5 star product.

<Title>It's Fantastic!
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After two Ipods, Iriver, and a couple off brand MP3's, I've found the one! This device is a little bulkier than others, but comperable in size where you won't notice the difference. The Screen is SO CLEAR. The sound better, and buttons so much simpler to understand than it's rivals. I truly love the Zune Marketplace, and am happy they're supposed to be offering movies as part of the standard monthly rates. That alone may be an Ipod Killer. The unit itself is comparable to an IPOD. There's only so much they can do to better or worsen it. the pros of this item to an IPOD is the Sound, Screen, and Zune Marketplaces. The negative if you'll call it that, is the size is a 1/4 inch larger tall, but still smaller width. I love my Zune and several friends are enjoying theirs and the WIFI file swapping. Real Cool device! Great battery life! I'm real happy with my Zune.

<Title>You would be better off with something else
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A friend of mine bought one a zune. You've probably already read that it is larger than other mp3 players in size but the real problem is the difficulty of installing the software and getting it to work with the PC. My friend has a Dell that is only about 3 months old running Win XP and we had a hard time getting the PC to recognize the Zune. Just to see if it was his port we tried my Ipod (he already had itunes installed) recognized it just like that. After about an hour fiddling with the zune he took it back and exchanged for an ipod and is quite happy with it.  The ipod is just a better thought out device, the sandisk player is also supposed to be pretty good but I would stay away from the zune if I were you. Lots of money spent on advertising this device, doesn't look like much was spent developing it.

<Title>Zune? Whats a Zune?
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is so light years behind the iPod it is laughable. Sad really because Microsft has said it will go broke trying to make this player go top MP3 player. It says it will lose money for years on it. It has hopes on beating out iPods but the problem is the internal structure of the iPod is just light years ahead of it and MS has little to no chance to catch up with this one.   Using the Zune for the first time, my recollections are this; -Its way to heavy. Considerably heavier than the heaviest iPod. -Battery life is abysmal, absolutely terrible when WiFi is enabled. -Sharing songs is more bugged than useful. It takes a full 15 minutes to send the song and by the time youve transfered it, the batteries are 3/4s gone. -Marketplace uses points instead of dollars. In a VERY MS move it is trying here to disguise the fact that youre spending money. Instead of telling you that a song is 1.99 it tells you how many "points" you need. Very sneaky and very Microsoft. -MEnus within the player are buggy and very sluggish. Things move in a jerky motion and nothing is fluid about the navigation.  -this player is just not even an average player in a market that has been dominated by the iPod. The iPod has done so by listening to what people want in their MP3 player. Didnt someone tell Microsoft that the iPod maker Apple has a bit of information on what to do and what NOT to do in a MP3 player?! Im guessing not.

<Title>What Is Brown And Stinks?
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>....a DOA brown Zune.  I was given a Zune as a gift and was excited to own my first MP3 player. Unfortunately it was the brown one but oh well, it was free. It took awhile to figure out the software as it was confusing. I have Windows XP Pro and am no slouch with the computer but it was still confusing. They really need to make everything a bit easier to get up and running. Finally I loaded some songs onto it. Decent sound. Ok, maybe this is gonna work out. Then I turned it off. 30 minutes later I went to turn it back on and NOTHING. It would not turn on. Where is the QC from MS?  I called a friend of mine who is a bit of a MacDroid. One of the reasons I never considered the iPod is because he constantly raves about it and sometimes he drives me nuts. He always says he likes to reward innovation, not imitation. I was hoping I could "one up him" with something new.  So I called him and he brought his iPod over and we put the players side by side. Then he showed me iTunes. The Zune did seem clunky and awkward after sitting next to the iPod. And that software, MS has a long way to go to catch up with iTunes. Yea, it was impressive and looked easy to use.  At this point I am done with the Zune. I gave it a shot and it died out of the gate. I am taking it back (hope there is a warranty) and buying an iPod.  I have no choice but to give anything DOA one star.  Without the backing of the corporate world it will be interesting to see if the Zune sinks or swims.

<Title>No iPod killer (why would you want to kill it anyway) but works great!
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me tell you that I have been using iPod/iTunes for last 4 years and I think iPods are great music players. That said, Zune is a very impressive first attempt by Microsoft to gain an entry into the mp3 players market. I have been using the player for last couple of days and I have been nothing but impressed with this player.  Pros:  1. Works with mp3, aac, wma etc. It had no problem importing my entire iTunes library using the zune software. It also preserved all my playlists and order of songs (impressive). I didn't have any problems with the software as some people of reported - there is a firmware upgrade that you need to install right when you install the software from the CD (that comes with the zune). This could be painful to some - but hey iPods do not come with any CDs at all and you have to download the entire iTunes software anyway. So overall the installation was pretty straight forward.  2. Zune is fast. I mean blazing fast - when you browse through the playlists/albums and select a song/playlist to play - its instantaneous. The album art appears instantly, the song starts playing instantly with absolutely no lag. I tried using my friend's 5.5 Gen iPod (30 GB) and it had visible lags of 1-2 seconds between pressing the center button and the song starting to play.  3. Up/down, left/right click - works better and more intuitive in my opinion. The circular click wheel is good - but to me this is *much* more intuitive and easy. Add to the fact that there is circular scrolling in the menu. In iPods when you reach the end of a list (playlist/menu/settings anything) you have to go back up - it doesn't just go from bottom to top in a circular scroll.  4. Integrated FM tuner. Always a plus (apple charges $50 for it).  5. More customizable interface. You can choose/create your own themes, wallpapers etc. Adds a little personal touch.  6. Big screen. Its only a little bigger but looks like a huge screen in front of the iPod. The resolution may be same - but makes watching videos/pictures that much more comfortable.  7. Sturdy construction. No fingerprints/scratches.  Cons:  1. No podcast directory. I am going to miss that.  2. No games - c'mon microsft - at least solitaire/bricks etc.  3. Zune software needs a lot of improvement. Microsoft's own money system where you buy "points" in a chunk and then buy songs for 79 "points" each (comes to about a $1 per song) sucks. Thats very stupid and needs to be made simple like iTunes.  4. A little bulkier than iPod. Well I guess thats a part of making it more rugged and scratchproof. Not too bad for a HDD based player as most people who need it for workouts etc. will get a flash based player.  Overall a great start by Microsoft. From a hardware point of view, Zune is excellent. The software needs improvements (lots of it).   The iPod, zune rivalry is good for the consumers as this can only lead to improvements in both the iPod and the Zune, with us being the winners. I would like to give it a 4.5 stars (same as I would give the iPod). Depending on your preference you may like one over the other - I like both.  On a whole - a recommended buy!

<Title>Don't do this to a loved one
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I usually don't get involved in making a point known like this, but to anyone who is looking to buy a Zune because you believe it to be a good option to the iPod your loved one wants, please reconsider.  This is not even close to the same thing.  It's not cool, and education wise, doesn't even support pocasting.  Making a kid use one of these Zunes is akin to making them ware high-water pants.  There is also some doubt as to whether this product will even be on the market half a year from now.  If you still feel inclined to purchase this product, I'd encourage you to read Andy Ihnatko's (he's the personal technology reviewer for the Chicago Sun Times) November 23 article on the Zune.

<Title>So Far So Good
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have own a zune for  about a week and half now and so far its great. I was extremely happy that it automatically loaded in all the songs on my computer in about 20 minutes(about 3500 songs) to the player. The best part of this is that it takes ipod format stuff.Everyone in my family owns an ipod so its all in that aac format. The screen is perfectly clear and is better than the ipods screen by far. If your really that crazy about size its a bit chunky,but to me itsthe perfect size. Its actually not that ugly at all(if you dont get the brown)and doesnt have the stupid scroll of an ipod where you skipping over songs. The videos are pretty good.It wont take ipod videos because they are protected which made me mad. Im not a computer guy but it wouldnt take some videos i downloaded off of youtube and google video but got about 75 percent. I dont know much about the software because I dont use it that much(installing it went fine and was not confusing at all--step by step tutorials). The sound is very good,im not very technical on this so cant be too much help. The loading time is great. It takes no time to boot upat all and switching on long playlists is fast as well. Now the reason Ididntgive this five stars is because it scares me a little bit. Sometimes when i know i lock it thebattery stillseems to drain which really annoys me.Also I suggestyou get some external charger because the computer takes forever,almost two and half hours. It sometimes loads in music i already deleted(automatically installing music is great and annoying at thesame time.)there are ways around thisbut i havent gotten into that far.Exceptfor the sometimes funky battery and it not excepting some videos(even though its in the right format and the right size and all that stuff)I cant find anything wrong with it and would recommend it over the ipods which all break in less then a year anyways(hopefully in a year the zune still works).So far happy with purchase four out of five stars.would have given 9 out of ten.

<Title>A Good Player
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ive had the zune for about 4 days now and i used it on a 6 hour trip over thanksgiving, so Ive been able to mess around with it. First off Ive owned the 4G Ipod (which i consider to be one of the best mp3 players ive owned) a creative zen vision M, and now the Microsoft Zune. I liked my iPod but it was black and white and i kind of wanted something to play movies and for it to be in color. I also hated paying .99 a song, thats why I decided to get the Creative Zen Vision M. With the creative I could use Rhapsody and it played virtually every video encoding. But i decided to sell it and buty the Zune.  The zune is a great music player, the user interface is phenominal and in my opinion is better than the iPod. Despite what most people will lead you to believe it's very simple, most of my friends figure it out within 30 seconds. The thing I like best about it is that when you are say in artists at the top there is a horizontal view that lists genres, albums, songs, ect. and instead of going back to change sections you just press to  the side on your d pad. It makes things go faster and makes it feel as though you save time by not having to keep pressing back. What I dont like is that I sometimes forget about it and accidentally hit the back button and it takes me to the main page. Perhaps the biggest thing that gets to me is that when I do this there is no "now playing" option so i have to wait until it goes to the song thats playing screen after a few seconds. Overall the controlls are great and along with the user interface makes the zune great.   What I despise the most is the short batter life. Usually I dont really notice the battery life but on the trip it was going down at a phenominal rate. With the Zune, if you like to manually choose songs then it dwindles your battery life: fast. I think after five hours I only had about 1/4 of batter life left, which is totally unacceptable for a 250 dollar mp3 player. But if you use shuffle then your batter life lasts quite long but still I didnt buy the zune to shuffle my songs, if I wanted that I could have bought an ipod shuffle.  The screen is great and it really makes a difference. Ignore those who state that with the larger screen the picture looses sharpness. This may be true in a technical sense and if you look especially close, but for a regular person its great, and personally I can't see any noticable fuzziness.   The Zune itself is great in terms of durability. Although I haven't dropped it, but compared to the iPod with the scratches and fingerprints, the Zune is virtually incappable of leaving makrs from your fingers. The matte finish is great too since it provides a nice feeling service instead of a metal background. The size of the zune is perfect, although I have owned a Creative Zen which is quite big, but its roughly the size of 4G 40GB iPod. The weight is great too. By looking at it and because of its size youd think it would be quite heavy, but its not. It feels very light and feels very durable in your hand. I also liked the double shot finish on it. When you hold the black zune up to the light the sides turn slightly blue and make it a nice addition to it.   The installation of the software took me forever. I installed it and it said there was an error so I called microsoft and they told me to update something. So I did and then it worked. After you get going they make you create a windows live ID to download songs, so I did that and purchased the Zune Pass. But all of a sudden it kept importin all of my tracks on my computer into the library, and i did not want that. So I went through and deleted them all and started downloading from marketplace (marketplace is great they had all of my 2,000 song library from rhapsody and itunes so dont worry about them not having all of your songs, they mine at least). Then I plugged in the Zune and started to sync my library but lo and behold there were all my songs from my computer still there. It seems that microsoft has this thing where if you delete a song that it will come back. So to save you the trouble and time Ill tell you what you need to do. When you install Marketplace it will ask you if you want to make marketplace the main media player or you can choose custom. Choose custom. Then go to options then click on Add Folder To Library and choose the files you want to ignore. Then on that same box it will say at the bottom Advanced Options click on that and then uncheck the box that says "add files previously deleted from library". now it wont import some songs and it wont keep adding songs from your computer.   Overall the zune is great. I havent used the wifi yet but Im sure when more people start buying zunes thatll Ill have someone to share it with. If you have an iPod video then I dont think that this is something that you need to switch to, but with the firmware updates coming it may be in the near future.

<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't personally own one of these, but I have messed with them in the stores. I don't believe all that bad stuff thats being said about this. Like for instance, one review I have read, was that the people who have perviously used Ipods would have trouble with the Zune. Actually the zune is easier to navigate with. Instead of missing your song every time on the ipod you can just click down... My cousin has a Ipod and I couldn't get to the song I wanted very easily. The only ones I have played with are the brown.. Thats a CON, When your looking at the brown Zune you can see a green border like thing on it. If you go up and look at it you will notice it too. Yet, I don't personally think Apple has much to worry about. For christmas its either been the Ipod(which has games), or the Zune(which has a big screen). I have now got to mess around with it and its easy to use and the picture on it is great.. This is one thing thats a awesome gift idea!!

<Title>Microsoft does it again with buggy software
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> After ripping CDs for 6 hours Zume software deleted about half of my files from the Zume AND my hard disk and didn't even put the deleted files in the recycle bin. After spending a couple of hours trying to figure out how the poorly documented Zune PC software works (I have provided you with almost as much documentation as Microsoft does and I haven't really documented anything), I began ripping CDs. I moved about 1.5 GBs to the Zune and all went ok. I ripped another 2 GB and moved the music to the Zune. When I looked at the Zune, I was missing about half of the first load and over half of the second load. I figured I would just reload the missing files, but they were missing from the PC hard disk also. I tried more down loads, reloaded the software and nothing improved. It seems about a third of the time some files get deleted. There doesn't seem to be any pattern as to which files get deleted. The hardware is BEAUTIFUL and the graphics are second to none, but the software is about as bad as I have seen and I have been this business for 40 years. I got my first RCA MP3 player 10 years ago so I am no spring chicken. Wait for the next release. My mistake was buying ANY thing on the first release.

<Title>Basically not as good as an iPod, but...
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you're anything like an informed consumer, you'll know what is right and wrong with this mp3 player. Almost every respected reviewer gives the zune few kudos.   This said, what gets me is the audacity of the online reviews here at amazon. Wow, people who have only been moved-for the only and very first time-to write glowing reviews of the zune. Are you folks kidding me? Do you think the public can tell a professional reviewing troll from a genuine buyer? For this reason alone, the zune should fail.   My sense of this device is that it's design is clunky, OS is okay, point scheme is a scheme, DRM is draconian and would have been a worthy competitor against the very first video iPod. Basically, the whole zune thing is undercooked. Yes, I have actually handled a zune this is not a second-hand experience.  If you want a zune, buy a zune. You may be disappointed, but who knows-maybe not. The only real concern should be; what if I buy one of these things and Microsoft bails in the face of staggering losses. Take a look at the sales rank on this item folks! If you convert your music library to zunes proprietary format, a year or so from now you might really want to ring Microsoft's neck. In the meantime, I'll enjoy my iPod(s) and wonder...what were they thinking in Redmond.  I thought to add this in. Would I (clearly not a fan of the zune) buy an alternative to the iPod? The answer is-Yes. I have a number of mp3 players used for different purposes based on storage size,design and functionality. I base my purchases based on quality, ease of use and cost. All consumers should go into any purchase, informed and wary of hype.

<Title>Doesn't support "Plays for Sure"?  What the...?
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Read the other reviews for how this device looks, sounds, and functions. Suffice to say it looks, sounds, and functions quite nicely.  But read on...   About me... I have a library of WMA and MP3 music files that I access through Windows Media Player 11 (WMP11).  I never buy songs on-line.  Instead, I buy CDs, here at Amazon mostly, and rip to my computer.  I'm not interested in the DRM shenanigans of the on-line music stores - too many rules, restrictions, and headaches.  Anyway...  After receiving the Zune I was STUNNED to discover it doesn't support Microsoft's own "Plays for Sure" (PFS) specification.  PFS allows you to plug the player device into any Windows PC using WMP10/11 and it will be immediately recognized and ready for use.  I assumed microsoft's flagship player product would support their own spec.  Instead, you must install a separate program (ala iTunes) in order to access and work with the Zune.   Unfortunately, for THIS user, no PFS and proprietary software is a DEAL KILLER.    Mine is going back to Amazon.  I'm thinking about the "30 GB Creative Zen Vision W" or the "30 GB Toshiba MES30VW Gigabeat" instead.  They have similar features and support PFS.    Take care all.  Update 12/18/2006 I bought a 60 gig Zen W and am very satisfied with it.  It's big though, probably 1/2 again as large as the Zune, so be careful if a small size is important to you.  The Zen's display screen is large and bright.    My gripes about the Zune's lack of "Plays for Sure" compatibility and the need for special software are gone with the Zen W.  Windows Media Player 11 (WMP11) recognized it immediately and was ready to work with it very quickly.  Note that I applied a free firmware update from Creative before I even tried to hook up with WMP11.    The Zen comes with a few special programs that allow you to do music/media synchronization in their own program (if you are not using WMP11).  They also include some groovy software that let's you get Podcasts, Audible books, and information from Outlook - none of which interest me too much.  I'm all about the music.  Take care all and Happy Holidays.

<Title>Nice Screen, Intuitive Interface
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this Zune for a week and a half and am very pleased.  The sound quality is superb.  The screen is the perfect size for watching video on the go.  My only downpoint is that the software seems slow, but I do have an older computer.  The user interface is very intuitive.  I've let friends and relatives play with it and they all agree.  Also, the FM radio is a nice touch.  Other players I looked at didn't offer this feature.  I've seen online complaints that the Zune is too big.  It isn't.  It may be larger than other players (ipod) but it has a larger screen, wifi, and the fm radio tuner.  It fits in my pocket fine, so I can't complain on size.  The 14 day free pass to listen to all the music on the marketplace came in real handy.  I will probably buy better headphones, I'm not a huge fan of the included earbuds, but I guess they get the job done.

<Title>"Avoid the loony Zune" - review from Chicago Sun-Times
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Read this reveiw by Andy Ihnatko at the Chicago Sun-Times:  Yes, Microsoft's new Zune digital music player is just plain dreadful. I've spent a week setting this thing up and using it, and the overall experience is about as pleasant as having an airbag deploy in your face.  "Avoid," is my general message. The Zune is a square wheel, a product that's so absurd and so obviously immune to success that it evokes something akin to a sense of pity.  The setup process stands among the very worst experiences I've ever had with digital music players. The installer app failed, and an hour into the ordeal, I found myself asking my office goldfish, "Has it really come to this? Am I really about to manually create and install a .dll file?"  Only the Zune software can sync music, video and pictures onto the device; Zune is incompatible with Windows Media Player, the familiar hub of the Windows desktop media experience.  The Zune app doesn't even have as many features as WMP. And why (for the love of God) doesn't it support podcasts? That's pure insanity.  It's incompatible with Microsoft's own PlaysForSure standard, too.  You'll have to buy all-new content from the new Zune Marketplace.  Oh, and the Zune Marketplace doesn't even take real money, proving that on the Zune Planet there's no operation so simple that it can't be turned into a confusing ordeal. The Marketplace only accepts Zune Points, with an individual track typically costing the equivalent of the iTunes-standard 99 cents.  Take the Zune's one unique and potentially ginchy feature: Wi-Fi. You see this printed on the box and you immediately think "Cool. So I can sync files from my desktop library without having to plug in a USB cable, right? Maybe even download new content directly to the device from the Internet?"  Typical, selfish user: How does your convenience help make money for Universal? No wonder Doug despises you.  No, the Zune's sole wireless feature is "squirting" -- I know, I know, it's Microsoft's term, not mine -- music and pictures to any other Zune device within direct Wi-Fi range. Even if the track is inherently free (like a podcast) the Zune wraps it in a DRM scheme that causes the track to self-destruct after three days or three plays, whichever comes first.  After that, it's nothing more than a bookmark for purchasing the track in the Zune Marketplace. It amounts to nothing more than free advertising.  The Zune is a complete, humiliating failure. Toshiba's Gigabeat player, for example, is far more versatile, it has none of the Zune's limitations, and Amazon sells the 30-gig model for 40 bucks less.  Companies such as Toshiba and Sandisk (with its wonderful Nano-like Sansa e200 series) compete effectively with the iPod by asking themselves, "What are the things that users want and Apple refuses to provide?"  Microsoft's colossal blunder was to knock the user out of that question and put the music industry in its place.  Result: The Zune will be dead and gone within six months. Good riddance.

<Title>Ahhh! The fanboys!
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I already posted what I consider to be my thorough review of the Zune in the black Zune forum, so if you want to see it, go there (Why Amazon created different product pages when the only differentiator is color is beyond me), but I thought I'd have to comment on the ridiculous fanboy nature of most of the reviews being posted here, both on the anti (iPod fanboys or "iFanboys") and the pro (Not sure what to call the Zune fanboys - Zuneboys?  Zune-bees?).  It completely invalidates the overall rating of a product to have all these 1 star reviews from people who've never even used the product, and similarly some of the positive reviews seem to be from people who simply hate Apple or love MS (strange as it seems, there do exist MS fanboys as well).    If you want to get a good idea of whether the Zune is for you, read some of the 3 and 4 star reviews.  Those would be the most honest given my experience.    The Zune is for you if: You want subscription based music You want an intuitive interface (face it, scrolling up and down by twirling your thumb may be quick, but it is not as intuitive as clicking up and down) You don't want to worry about the technical aspects of managing your player, you just want it to work. You want the player primarily to give you a rich music listening experience (yuck - I can't believe I just used the term rich) You have a video collection of unprotected music already.  The Zune is not for you if: You want to buy TV shows online and watch them on your player - Zune doesn't have this feature in the Marketplace yet and Apple already does (although it's incomplete and the movie selection is even worse). You want to micromanage your player as a tech-device (It doesn't by default allow you to drag and drop music onto it, it requires you to use the Zune software to manage your music etc.  There is a registry hack that allows you to access it as an external hard drive, so MS may choose to enable this feature in the future.  However, given the target audience of non-technically adept 18-24 year old hipsters they may choose to leave this hidden for only the technically adept users).  If you are a tech oriented person you might be better off buying one of the Plays-For-Sure players which don't make you interface through software like Zune or iTunes. You have small pockets - the wireless and large screen lead to a larger device compared to an iPod.  Men likely won't find this a problem, but given the tight jeans some women wear, this could be a problem.

<Title>Microsoft's first attempt, lame, lame, lame
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My technology illiterate step-dad bought one of these because somebody at Best Buy told him it was the next greatest thing.   I will not rehash most points some posters have already made. I will, however, share four observations. First, Windows XP  crashed twice while trying to install the included software. Second, although Zune has a few so called features my Video iPod does not, it is also lacking a few. For instance, I cannot use it as a hard drive, alarm clock, or to view videos or photos on a television (unless you own an x-box, which my step father does not). The  inability to use it as a hard drive is unforgivable, and likely will be the reason it gets returned. I will also point out, I really dislike Fm tuners built into the MP3 player. The reason is the reception always seems to be poor, and it eats up battery. The Zune's FM tuner was a bit better then others I have tried, but the reception was still poor. Moreover, I do not see the use for it. I already have a radio in my house, work and car. These work good. I will not use the MP3 player as a radio.   Third, Microsoft had five years to work on this thing, and should be ashamed of itself. My buddies Dell DJ was better. Moreover, Microsoft's product is being considered to Apple' s soon to be outdated iPod.   Finally, the have to buy five dollars worth of points stinks and is a bit confusing. I understand Microsoft wants to save on credit card fees, but Apple does not do this. Microsoft is the world's richest company, surely it could suck up the extra cost if Apple can.

<Title>Not a smart buy
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Zune in a store and am, i have to say, a bit dissapointed. Many people buy this product because 1) it is newly on the market from a name brand, 2) it offers an alternative to the Ipod. But, i will state again, it is very dissapointing. Now, i'm a very open-minded person and bought to Zune to test it out, but i plan on returning it for the Ipod 30G. And to save you trouble, here are some info on the Zune.   Navigation: the navigation is OK.. lacks some buttons. all it hasis       the backwards, play/pause, and the arrow keys. Now dont be fooled by the design, it is not a click-wheel. the round thingy you see are arrows that you have to click to navigate. clicking all those times kinda makes your thumb sore. so, navigation of the Ipod > Zune. it has some good things however, including the drop-down lists, but all together, it sucks.  Files: im not a computer geek, so i dont know the file names.. like wav avi.. but the Zune only plays one type of video format. it cant play any of my video, so i went online and tried downloading a converter, and none of it works. most of it are filled with Spyware and Adware. music works fine, although the Zune software is kinda hard to use. they lied when they said that Zune is Windows Media Player compatible; its not. it wont even recognize the device. i have never used Itunes before, but its gotta be better than this.  Extras: there are no extras on the zune. no calender, no clock, no games, no stop watch, no voice recorder. theres a radio and you cant even record from it. i was surprized when i tried to look at the time on my Zune and couldnt find a clock. the Zune to Zune thingy is practically useless and need to be developed more. 3 times in 3 days? thats just a way to advertise for the Marketplace. and something else.. theres no power adapter for this!!!!! every time you charge, you have to plug it into the PC and turn on the PC and it gets annoying after a while. and the TV out thingy only works for audio. meaning that you cant view video on your TV. but on the ipod, you can.  Pluses: big screen. hard to scratch. not apple. Minuses: bulky, hard to fit inside pocket. hard navigation, no power adapter, no extras, cant play video, looks ugly.  Conclusion: im not saying that the Zune is a bad player.. wait yes i am. but its a very good attempt against the Ipods. im not an Ipod person, but i just cant find a Mp3 player that comes close. if you dont like Apple period, wait till the second or third generation of the Zune. right now, since its very very noobish, the technology is still ..immature compared to the Ipod 5.5 generation. microsoft still hasent received any complaints to help make their product better... lets wait for those fools out there to test this thingy out, complain to microsoft about it, and lets wait for them to make this thing better. in the meantime, buy an Ipod! or a Creative Zen Sleek Photo! &lt;----very very worth the money. i used to have one.

<Title>Superb player, beyond my expectations! ( not a fanboy) 
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first i was very doubtfull to buy this product or not, since its a first gen zune, and the ipod fanboys have posted so many reviews and having mysef used and ipod before. So anyway i decided that because of the screen size, the price and the zune pass to buy one, and now i dont regret it not even a bit. The first thing i noticed was how everything was so well made up, the box is very nice, and everything is very well acomodated on the inside, then the player itself was beyond my expectations, it has the fill of something sturdy yet it is still light, about the size, its as big as a first gen ipod, but it s not bulky in anyway, while it could be better if it was slimmer, its not something taht realy matters since it is evry liught.  Another thing that is very good, is the interface, god its just so easy to use and very quick. About the screen i have to say that its is bigger than what you think and it looks way better than what i was expecting, even tho it has the same pixels as an ipod.  Talking about music quality it is pretty good, the headphones are ok (better than the ipod ones in my opinion) but still if you realy like music, you are going to use your good pair of headphones on this one.  Other thing i was worried was about instalation, since there are about two or three reviews about troubles on it, in my experience everything was very smooth and quick just put the cd, connect the zune and in about half hour your ready to go.  about the video store and all that stuff, i dont really used them before, and neither do i use them now so i cannot say anything about it, but still the zune software is very user friendly and gets the job done easily. In general it is an amazing player,i havent found something i dont like yet, and it has passed all my "needs" for an mp3 player.  I will keep this review updated in case i find anything. By the ways sorry for my crappy english but im from Mexico.  UPDATE: Ive been using the device for about a month now, and i can say that i am still very happy with it havent had any problem since i bought it and it works perfectly, the batery life with average usage ( i  mean changing songs, 5 second screen on time, no wi fi volume up) is very good about 8 to 10 hour, i havent used the store yet since i only have 3 gigs left of spaes. So far a month and i love it even more.. Dont mind all the bad iboy reviews. Its a great product. Just make sure you have a not so old pc.

<Title>Excited... but then...
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really excited to see the newest gen player on the market. I was shure it has to be better then any other, I mean there is big MS behind it and they have so much money for research and could probably do the best job possible. So I got it to try as soon as possible. But then came the facts: It feels heavier as its competitors, is bigger and looks pretty ugly. The screen looks great, but then the interface is so lousy and absolutely not intuitiv. But the big problems came when trying to connect it to the computer, it did not appear despite the software was correctly installed, I tried for hours to make it work. then a friend who wanted to help me commented he purchased several songs from the MSN music shop under that Plays for shure license, and now he stays in the rain because MS did not have success with that and terminated the whole program. His songs would not even play on that Zune, so I decided to bring this device back to the store and get an iPod instead. Because you can be shure, the Zune will have no sucess and they will have to terminate that song licenses too, so you spend money for songs you will end up not beeing allowed to hear them on new players.

<Title>Nice Player!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not an ipod owner, and I'm not knocking that product I think the ipod is pretty cool, however my prior mp3 players by Creative and Dell supported WMA files which is the format I chose to rip 100's of CD's too, and I really don't want to go through that whole process again! If the ipod had supported WMA, I may have purchased one.   Most of the reviews about the zune here are pretty unfair, it's obvious that most of the negative reviews are by people who either hate microsoft, are ipod fanboys, and don't actually own or have even tried the Zune.  First of all, this is a pretty well made and sturdy player. The interface is nice and navigation is pretty easy, the video display looks fine, and the sound is better than my Dell DJ. When people compare this to the ipod they make it sound like it is the size of a napsack compared to a cell phone, when in all actuallity it is only slighty bigger than an ipod. The control is not a touch scroll wheel like the ipod, it actually has buttons up down and side to side, which in my opinion works just as well or even better than the touch scroll wheel. I've tried the ipods in the store and I kept overshooting my target because the wheel was so sensitive, I don't know if you can adjust that or not, but who cares?  I did have problems initially with the zune software connecting to the Marketplace, however that problem was resolved. I really don't intend on purchasing digital music from the Marketplace anyway, at least not too often. I find that I'd rather buy a CD and make my own higher quality wma files anyway.  I also notice that a lot of complaints about the Zune are pretty minor.  1. You cannot use it as a hard drive. Well, I don't want to use my expensive media player as a hard drive anyway, I have a usb flash drive for that.  2. There are no games or calendar, or clock..  Seriously, what do you want that for? and besides don't you have that on your cell phone?  3. You can't purchase video on Zune Marketplace..  True, at least not yet anyway. Unless you are a mass transit commuter or a college student looking to kill time in between classes, how often are you going to view videos on your portable player anyway? And besides if you really want to there are work-arounds to get video on your zune, which you can easily find by doing a google search.  I won't comment on the wireless feature because I'll likely never get to use it.. I doubt I'll ever be in a setting where there are many people hanging around with Zune's squirting songs to one another. Besides, I can get any song I want to anyway!  Overall, I really should rate this product as 4 stars because there are some kinks to be worked out in the software and firmware, which I am sure will be address in future updates. I felt the need to give it 5 stars to even out the bogus 1 star reviews on here.   One other thing; Why are people complaining about battery life? having more than 10 hrs for listening to music isn't enough?

<Content>What a terrible product, don't waste your valuable time and money. I bought it on the release date, took it home, spent the next 24 hours just trying to load the software. Despite all attempts to load the software on my Dell with all the proper MSFT package, never even got the software loaded.Took it back the day after the release. The unkindest cut was, while I was trying to load the software, I watched a news release announcing Bill Gates' sale of millions of shares of MSFT. What an irony: he is making billions while I waste my time with his lousy products. What a joke; the world's leading software company with all the money and resources and time, can't make a plug and play consumer item if their life depended on it. My Apple Ipod friends chided me, "a consumer unfriendly Microsoft product, what a surprise." I can't believe I waited all this time. What am I asking for in my stocking, an Ipod of course. This is the last MSFT item I will ever willingly own.

The conversions of files took a little while but I just started it worked on other things while I waited and when it was done I just shut down the zune program and played my zune all while charging it up.  The software at times seems slowing like its proccessing something... But Like I said yet to crash.  The software I think could use a little bit more clarity on the side of using bigger icons to label each function.  Other than this... I'm quite happy.  I keep reading about people with problems... But I got none running it from my tablet PC.

<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well needless to say Microsoft has done it again, brought out a product to quickly with many issues including major software problems. I have yet to get the software to work properly on my dell latitude or to get my Loony Zune to recognize the device after repeated installing, removing, etc. etc. I have concluded that Microsoft should have let "the paint dry" before shipping the product. Obviously more work needs to be done at their end to make this product remotely successful.  I even went back to Best Buy (where it was purchased) and they could get the unit to work on 2 of their pc's but on others (3), no luck. Their geek squad was stumped. They offered a swap for a comparable iPod or Zen, which I accepted. I went with the iPod. The screen is smaller, but the resolution is the same, just the pixels are smaller. Very crisp and bright. Out of the box, it just worked. Software worked flawlessly.   Oh well, maybe the next generation of it will have the bugs worked out of it, but for now I'll snag a quote Monty Python's The Holy Grail... "Run away, Run away"

<Content>I have had none of the problems that other people speak of.  Seems like a bunch of Apple/Ipod devotees are writing the bad reviews.  I bought the Zune last week and have copied over a thousand MP3's so far (and it was FAST), lots of photos and videos and still have over 21 GB of space left.  The screen is larger than an Ipod and has a better resolution (from what I compared in the store).  The only thing that I really don't care for is the point system of purchasing music.  A fee per song system would be less confusing and straightforward, although it is basically the same thing.

But, having no difference in things I don't like about the iPod (price, battery life, restricted music store) I don't think I care about this product. The wireless sharing of the Zune seems to me like a gimmick thrown in because they can't match the iPod where it matters. Let's face it, the iPod is way cooler, and at the same price of the Zune, it's a no-brainer. Nice try, Microsoft.

<Title>Microsoft strikes again
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It took me 2 hours to get the Zune to sync with my computer, and an additional hour to load songs onto it. I'm still dumbfounded that someone who's been making software for so long could produce something this bad. After getting past software issues, the Zune player itself isn't all that great either. It's user interface: Junk. It's immitation click wheel (which is actually just a 4 way directional pad): Junk. It's design: to bulky, to heavy. It feels like I'm carrying a brick in my pocket.  Overall: Microsofts first attempt at breaking into the MP3 player market and taking back some of the market share which is primary owned by Apple, is a complete failure. The only hint of innovation that the Zune shows, it's Wi-Fi connection to other Zune's, isn't enough to detire someone from buying the iPod instead. Save your money, save some agrivation, and buy the iPod, it's a far superior product.

<Title>A mediocre product at best
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It isn't just its well-documented install problems. The Zune just looks and feels cheap. The fake-out click wheel interface adds to the aura of chintziness. The Zune software is an unneccessary second step--why not use WMP?--and the Microsoft Points are silly. The lack of podcast support is unforgivable, the inability to use it as an external hard drive is insulting, and the wi-fi is useless.  The screen is marginally larger, and even though it is the exact same resolution with the same number of pixels, it does look slightly more attractive than Apple's iPod does. However, that is more than undone by the sheer unsexiness of the Zune casing, and the inelegance of the clunky interface.  Now, it's not a terrible product. It's a slightly ahead of the Creative Zen, for example.  But it's still well behind the SanDisk Sansa, and even farther still behind Apple's iPod and iPod Nano.  All in all, I would stay away from the Zune.

<Title>A Nice Product
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not sure any of the people that are writing reviews even bought a Zune.  I purchased mine from Amazon.  Zune software loaded easily on my computer, and it created my library with little fuss.    The Zune is a little bigger than the 30 GB iPod, and a touch heavier.  I own both.  There isn't much difference.  The screen on the Zune is much clearer, and the sound equals or exceeds the iPod.    Microsoft needs to further explore the WiFi aspect of the Zune, and from what I've read they will be doing that.   They also need to get podcasts and RSS into the Zune, and I suspect they are doing that, too.  You can load a podcast into the Zune, but the Zune software doesn't do it for you (yet).    Zune works well with Xbox 360.   The Xbox sees it and you can play songs through it (and by extension your sterio and TV).     All in all, a good start.  It's not as polished as the iPod yet, but it is early.

<Content>UPDATE, well after a few motnths with it it broke(software,would no longer respond, called and nothing, i did a hardware restore, software reset and same problem, did the 2.0 update (new interface) and it did not make it work, very un-satisfied., and microsoft would not replace it, so i got a discounted iPod (80gb, black) and it has worked since the day i got it (almost 8 months). and i threw the "brick" in the trash where it belongs.  worked like a charm thinking of upgrading mine to a 80 gig, google it

<Title>TERRIBLE ITEM
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Please save your self a terrible and horrendous headache and if you are even interested in buying this item then DONT and buy an iPod instead. Microsoft has always been strict in their compatibility issues, but the system requirements for this thing are insane. Half of the time it wont even be detected by the computer and if it does work then a few seconds after being detected it crashes the computer.

<Title>Support Universal by buying this product.  Even if you never put music on it.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A portion of the sale of each Zune goes to Universal.  This is a terrible precedent.  Also, unlike Apple, Microsoft is likely to bow down to industry wishes for variable pricing for individual tracks and albums.  The Zune is the product the music industry wants you to have.  The iPod is the product YOU want to have.

<Title>no thanks.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While it looks relatively sleek, the Zune is 60% larger and 17% heavier than a comparable iPod.  That's moving backwards, not forwards.  Picking up speed in reverse, we have Zune's music store.  Songs cost 79 "points" which cost 99 cents but which can only be bought in 5 dollar blocks which just begs the question... how can I trust a pricing scheme that goes to such unneccessary lengths to manipulate my wallet?  Ultimately I can't. So...thanks Microsoft, but no thanks.

<Title>They are lying about compatability
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own a Zune and never will, but I do know that they are lying when they say you can import songs from iTunes and Windows Media Player. Microsoft's Zune is not even compatable with Microsoft's own music program! Also, songs from Napster aren't compatable. I've also heard that the Zune is not compatable with the future Vista. Also, you have to buy Zune Marketplace dollars in $5 incriments so that Microsoft can avoid excessive credit card surcharges when people buy one song at a time.  Good luck to all who's brave enough (or foolish enough) to get it.

<Title>Review from a User Who Owns  a Zune
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's typical, but as I read through the user reviews it seems that most people who are reviewing don't even seem to own a Zune. I feel compelled to at least give anyone who is interested a fair review from someone who has owned a Zune for two weeks.  The Good 1.  The screen is EXCELLENT.  I have ripped some DVDs and had some home videos I have synched with my Zune.  Video quality is outstanding and the screen size is very nice. I sat and watched the entire first season of the Office again on this small screen over Thanksgiving because the sound and video are so good. 2.  The sound quality is top of the line.  I have owned too many mp3 players to count over the years (even an iPod, folks), and I never thought anyone would outdo iRiver.  This device absolutely kicks iRiver. Full, rich sound quality.  If you get the additional home A/V kick, you will find you can crank you stereo and not lose any sound quality.    3.  The Zune Marketplace is kinda cool.  I did not think I would like it, but the idea of a subscription model has grown on me, and I just signed up to continue past the 14 day free trial.  The music is easy to download, and quite frankly, every know (and many unknown) acts/albums are present.  I have learned about new bands and have found that I am always up looking for something new to listen to.  I normally buy at least 1-2 albums a month (either in CD or downloadable format), so the $14.99 a month is a good deal for me. 4.  The ability to share music is fun.  I have a couple of friends who have a Zune, and it's cool to send music that you like to them and hear what they like.  Works very well. 5.  The case is excellent.  I can't believe it has taken so long for a company to come up with a case/shell for an mp3 player that will not smudge.  It also is sturdy.    What Could be Better 1.  I have bought online music from Walmart, MSN Music, and Yahoo.  The files will not play on the Zune (Plays for Sure is not supported by the Zune device).  I was initially ticked about this, but it took a few minutes to burn the files to CD and rip them back and they are now in my library as unprotected wma files.  Now, it does not matter what player I moved to, there is no DRM on these files.  It took Zune to kick me into doing this, but now I am free.   2.  Currently no video downloads on Zune Marketplace.  This is a bummer since there is a great screen on the Zune.  I hear that it is coming, though.  For now, I have ripped several DVDs I own.  As mentioned early, the quality on the video is top notch. 3.  While not really a huge issue, the Zune software is required to sync your device.  I would really have liked to continue to use Media Player, but the Zune software is *very* close to Media Player in features and controls.  I just use it now to play files on my PC.  I had zero issues installing/using the software, and I am very happy with the Zunepass subscription model.  All in all, this is an EXCELLENT first generation player.  While iPods may continue to rule the market in the short-term, I really think this device has the potential to make a dent as new features are added.  Just as everyone has a different taste in music, it seems everyone has a taste in players.  I like the Zune and would recommend it to anyone in the market for a well built player with a nice screen.

<Title>Easy install, works as expected, sounds great
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the product and have been happy with it ever since.  I installed the software without a problem and plugged the device in.  I then directed the Zune software to a network share where I keep all of my files and it proceeded to read and catalog my music (note that it doesn't change anything unless you tell it to).  It took a little while for the Zune to import the 13GB of CDs that I own, but I think that was to be expected.  The only problem I had was that the software didn't find all of my album art.  If I were to estimate it probably found around 80% of it.  It wasn't very hard to find the rest and paste it.  Though this was annoying, it wasn't a show stopper, and could have been my fault for mislabeling or misspelling album or track names.  The sound quality of the device exceeds my expectations, especially with the equalizer set to acoustic.  However, I didn't like the sound of the headphones that came with it, opting to use a pair I already have.  This is a personal preference, most people will be fine with the stock pair.  A few days after buying the device I dropped it onto a wooden floor while it was playing.  It bounced pretty hard on the screen side and then landed screen up.  The Zune survived and there were no scratches or malfunctions resulting from the fall.  I have since taken it on a 6 hr trip to NYC and listened to it all the way there and back with the car kit.  Again, the device played without problem throughout the trip both ways.  Honestly, I couldn't be happier with it.  I like the interface on the device.  It is straight to the point and allows you to find your music quickly based on artist, album or title.  I also like how it displays a large image of the album cover when playing a song.  It looks really slick and yet still functional with a progress meter and a couple status icons more towards the bottom.  You can create play lists on the device or on your computer.  The Zune also lets you customize the background that you see while on the main menu, or while selecting a song.  I used a couple macro photo images of autumn leaves and it really gives the device a personal touch.    I hope that with future updates this product allows you to better utilize the wireless functionality (no 3 day/play limit on non DRMd music, streaming from my network etc) but in my opinion what the Zune does now, it does well.

<Title>Experimenting with Zune is finding inconsistancy.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have wiped my Zune multiple times on purpose to test it. I have 5153 songs in one folder that I am syncing. I format the Zune then sync. Every folder has album art. I start the sync, and every time, the results of the sync are different. All the variables are the same, the results differ EVERY TIME. Here are my findings:  If you have edited your music tags, the Zune will not find the album art the majority of the time, even when the artwork is in the folder of the music. Say you burned a Jimmy Buffett CD and the CDDB used found Jimmy as COUNTRY, so you change it to Caribbean or something else, since the Zune searches pretty much the same CDDB's as everyone else, it will not upload the information or Album art because it does not recognize Jimmy Buffett as Caribbean music under the genre tag. Many of my music is not tagged with the same genre as what it is found on the CDDB's of the world (Porcupine Tree is NOT metal, Miles Davis is NOT Smooth Jazz, etc...). For some reason, it will grab the album art from the directory, sometimes it won't, but I am pretty sure it is because of differences in the tags.  Song totals are not very consistant. I have 5153 songs in one folder with artist and album sub folders. First sync after formating, 4123, second, 2841, third 4875, fourth 5153 (yeah!), fifth 4356. WHAT IS WITH THAT? Every time I get a different sync total. My iPod gets it, the Zune does not.  Sync times are REDICULOUS IF you have files with over 192 bit rate. Every time I do a sync, I kill all running software to let it do it's thing with full processing power. I monitor some of the files that get converted. A certain Tool CD can take 1 minute to convert down from 320 to 192, or it could take over an hour. Conversion of songs is BRUTAL. I don't understand this concept. Most people that want a high capacity player are music nutcases and want quality, not quantity. I want to hear every nuance in Even Less by Porcupine Tree, including the talking in the background, but my ears can tell the difference between 320 and 192, and I don't want 192. Microsoft needs to understand this and change it so some people can stop the conversion.  I think a little more testing and researching the marketplace would have helped Microsoft with the Zune. Hopefully a firmware/software update will fix all of the above, but I doubt Microsoft will be in much hurry. So for now, my Zune goes back on the shelf and my iPod becomes my go to player again. Sadly, I am afraid.

<Title>Good but not great first revision
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one of these for my birthday a while ago.  I think it is well worth the price of purchase, but apparently other people don't, so take my review with a grain of salt.  I was away from my home computer and my MP3 collection when I recieved the Zune, so I used the included 14 day trial of the [........]  When I first started using the computer software to put together my library, I was a little annoyed with it.  My music library is composed entirely of MP3s I have ripped and downloaded, and all of them imported well and played fine.  Those with conflicting tag information were easy to fix with the software, and they were displayed and sorted in a cool and easy to navigate way.  Managing playlists was a little tough and confusing, and determining which items to sync seemed like it could be less work.  Overall, the software is acceptable if you know what you want to do and don't need any hand-holding, but if you're buying this product for a luddite with more than 30 GB of unorganized music, think twice.  Also consider the possibility of software updates to increase functionality, but don't bank on it.  Lastly, I sat down to try and put some video on the device.  I quickly learned that the only formats supported were windows media video(WMV) and mpeg layer 4(mp4).  Most of my video is of AVI or mpeg layer 2(mpg) format, so conversion was required for syncing to the device.  Moreover, after that video is converted to an acceptable format, it must be converted again by the software before syncing to the Zune, which is time consuming.  Once synced, however, video playback looks great and will impress any portable technophile.  I am still not sure how the battery stands up to long periods of video playback.  As an Xbox 360 user, I was excited to connect my Zune to my 360, so that I could listen to music and playlists on it while charging.  It doesn't offer many features over media sharing from the PC, but it looks cool anyway.  Pros: Huge display Cool menus Stylish alternative to the played-out iPod Xbox360 connectivity  Cons: Mediocre software Questionable playback of DRM music Video conversion issues

<Title>Nice, but not all the way there
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my zune, and here's my first comments:  Things I liked: - small size - big screen - album art. this is definitely something that stands out from the ipod and creative zen. the album art takes up most of the screen when the song is playing. also, when you're scrolling by artist, you can see the cover art of the albums. - movie mode goes sideways, so you can really take full advantage of the large screen. - when the movie mode goes sideways, the navigation controls feel very well positioned - navigation is easy to use - fm radio has meta data associated to the stations, like XM. You get the station name, title of the song, etc. pretty sweet. - when playing music, you can navigate around and keep the music playing. - totally irrelevant, but the packaging is definitely an award winner   Things I didn't like: - most importantly, the sound was not very good. it seemed very muttled. I used my mp3s, i used the preloaded mp3s on the zune, i used the included earphones, my headphones, and I plugged it into my stereo. nothing sounded great. I pulled out my Archos MP3 player and compared the same MP3 song (dave mathews), and the Archos was much better sounding. I changed the equalizer's preset settings, and no matter what, the sound wasn't that great. This was very disappointing, and for this reason, I'm probably going to return the zune.  - to use it, your computer must have SP2 or it won't work. I heard it doesn't work with vista either. Not sure what msft was thinking. - no power supply included. it get's it's power from the usb port. although this seems to be standard with mp3 players right now, I think it's ridiculous. Power adapters cost $30 more. - no manual. again, although this seems to be the standard with other mp3 players right now, I think it's ridiculous. - can't use the device as a hard drive. Not really a big deal, but my archos can do this  hopefully this is input is helpful.

<Title>Zunes underrated. 
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Zune the first day it came out. Its amazing. Its just as good as the ipod if not better.  To begin, its soo easy to set up.  It was really easy to start up the device and took about a minute to learn how to operate it. As soon as I connected it to my computer, it recognized it and then I installed the Zune Media Player, which did it perfectly.  The music and videos load quickly and easily onto it.  I also like that they save the album art for each song so when you play it, it displays it.  The music is crisp and clear and loud. Its good so no worries there.  The videos are great seeing that you can choose to display them vertically or horizontally too(you can also do this for the pictures).  Even though it is a little bigger and heavier then the ipod, I dont mind. I think its a good size.  The wifi is pretty cool too. Being able to send picture and songs to other zunes works great. I tried it.  There are some bugs with the program, but that will probally be fixed quickly with the updates.  Zune is really a great player and I know the next Zune will be way better.

<Content>Over the years i have had several different MP3 players. My first one was a cheap RIo Karma, and it did ok. It lasted forever. after that i proceeded to get an Ipod. Do not get an Ipod. Support is terrible and mine was constantly being sent back to the company to be fixed. I sent it back 5-6 times before i just chucked it. The Zune is my newest one, and i love it. The interface is really nice. And it has an amzingly clear screen, which also is a bit bigger then the Ipods.  Pros- -Big screen -Crystal clear videos -easy to instal the program, which is much like a mix between Itunes and WMP. -Wireless music sharing -easy use with the Xbox 360 -Zune marketplace-pay 10 bucks a month for unlimited downloads compared to itunes. -Good sound, not great but good. About as good as the Ipods. -They come in brown!(which mine is.) -very solid button interface, doesnt feel flimsy. -also it does work with windows Vista, which it was rumored not to, as my friend is a Beta tester for it and also has a Zune, so it at least works with the Vista Beta. cons- -not many aftermarket stuff for it yet. -hard to find someone else who has one to use the WiFi 0.o  hopefully this is helpful to buyers.

<Content>When microsoft first announces the zune I was excited, I dont like the lockout system of the iPod so I dont have any Ipod but used to play my music with itunes. Then I saw WMP 11, by far better player than iTunes "the new iTunes copies some cool functionality from it but lacks many others" I then switch to WMP and never look back.   But I dont know who was the genius inside microsoft that choose to copy all the bad things about the iPod and none of the good ones.  You cant use your Zune as HardDrive(Big Mistake), you have to download another media player software; in my opinion less functional one(WMP 11 is the best media player ever) why MS made this duplicated program???, you cant connect your zune wireless with your PC or Xbox "Useless". For me 3 plays sharing is ok but within 3 days (this is ridiculus) I would rename my mp3 as jpg to share with my friends.  Please dont buy this player please it will force microsoft to retool the zune very soon so I can buy my zune when MS clears its compatibility issues and gave support to play for sure.  I am not afected by the zune purchase points; I still find a lot better to buy cds, its cheaper. for example to buy the Aerosmith album "Big Ones" you just have to spend $10 on this site [......]  to buy it from a download site: iTunes, Zunemarket etc you spend $15, one dollar per song. So I better buy the CD and then rip my songs to mp3 files  that are fully compatible with any player on the market.  iPod 4/5; Zune 1.5/5 or iPod vs Zune = PC vs Mac but inverse, here apple wins.

<Title>Don't buy an mp3 player this season
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying I was really happy when I heard iPod was going to get some competition. But the Zune fell flat.   After owning an iPod mini (which I was happy with) for about three years, I decided in July to get a new mp3 player. Hearing rumors about a full-screen iPod with touch-screen capabilities, I decided to wait. Then I heard about the Zune. A bigger screen than the iPod, WiFi enabled, AND I figured, as it is competing with one of the most successful electronics, it has to be very good. Wrong.  The Zune is a prototype. I thin Microsoft rushed to finish it before the holiday season, and it shows. The WiFi isn't good at all, and there aren't enough other Zune-users to use it at all (I have yet to find a good use for it, and I go to a college in the city). Since the Zune service (one pro to this product) doesn't have videos or tv shows, the screen size doesn't matter. The screen is clearer, but I am comparing this to an iPod mini...so.... The color choices (while limited) offer some pretty unique things, but I agree with one reviewer that it looks like iPod's ugly step-brother. It isn't cool looking, and it is semi-clunky. Another disappointing feature is the limited number of options. There are three Zunes, in comparison to I think over 10 iPods. There is no cheaper, smaller nano equivalent, and for those on a big budget, there isn't any shiffle or SanDisk size player. Microsoft needs to fix this.  Now, a few pros.  The Zune music Store has a subscription service. This is much more convenient that .99 cents per song. Despite this tough, there doesn't seem to be much music available, and as mentioned, no videos. Like iTunes, you can only play these songs on a Zune, and you can only put songs on your player from the store.  The back engraving is the final pro (pathetic, yeah, but cool). "Greetings from Seattle!"...a smack in Apple's face.   Despite the engraving, this product isn't good enough to knock the iPod off it's high horse. My suggestion is not to buy an mp3 player this season. If you were going to get one as a gift, give a rain check. Apple is rumored to be releasing an iPod phone in January, and the Zune lineup will likely be expanding too. Wait. The Zune will probably get better, and Apple appears to be making more technological jumps.  Pros- -Zune Store subscription -back engraving - FM Tuner Cons- -bad sound quality -bigger screen is useless, as there few to no videos to watch -little to no WiFi capabilities -clunky and ugly -lack of models  all I can suggest is to wait...wait until 2007!

<Title>Worst mp3 player I have ever owned
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The best things about the this mp3 player, is that it looks pretty.  Everything else about the player is horrible. This mp3 player is made by Microsoft, but is completely incompatible with any of Microsofts media (i.e. PlayForSure, Windows Media Player). Not to mention, the online service to buy music is horrible compared to the iPod. I feel that they make it uneccesarily more difficult to purchase a song.  To buy music, you have to purchase "Zune points". You are forced to buy points in "chunks" so that Microsoft can save themselves credit card processing fees. Microsoft already has been giving in to the music industry, and is likely to start charging more for popular songs. So instead of paying an equivalent of $1.00 per song, you will likely be paying $2-$3 per song.  What does this mean for you? What this means is that you can spend money buying points, and because the songs are not flat amounts, you will end up with left-over music points from your "chunks" of points that don't add up to enough points to spend. You essentially have money floating in limbo!  It would be much better if you can could just be charged for what you want, and not be forced to have wasted points laying around.  This mp3 player DOES NOT support podcasts! This is terrible, as there is absolutely no reason to pick this mp3 player over any other mp3 player.  The WIFI IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK! You might think "Cool. So I can sync files from my computer's mp3 library without having to plug in a USB cable, right?"  WRONG! All this allows you to do it transfer a song to another Zune, which will only be playable on another Zune for 3 plays!!!!  After that the songs erases itself. And then the Zune asks you to purchase the copy. This is really annoying, because it will do this to songs that are already free! It's a mid-advertised feature. This is not WIFI, it is a self-advertising mp3 player.  Horrible mp3 player. My money $250 would have been far better spent on a Nintendo Wii.

<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a person who owns 2 ipods and 800 or so iTunes songs, I mostly bought the Zune out of curiousity and because I liked the larger screen. Having used one for a few weeks now, I must say that I am pleasantly surpised. Make no mistake, the Zune isn't nearly as polished a product as an ipod, and Zune music store is especially weak. That being said, if you're a big fan of music, the Zune has some very compelling features. As a person who works at a computer all day, it is nice to have the ability to occasionally download songs at work. With iTunes this a major pain because an ipod can only connect to one library. This means that if I want to get any music at work, I need to find a device to copy the music to, then copy it over from there to my home pc, and then finally sync my ipod. The Zune can connect to 3 libraries, so this isn't a problem. If I want to download a song at work, I can just download it and it will be synced to my player.  Another nice feature is the option to subscribe rather than purchase. Certainly, the Zune is not the first device linked to a store with a subscription service, but it is the first 'major' music player to offer one. Essentially, a subscription service lets you pay a flat rate, in the case of the Zune, $14.95 a month, for all the music you want. This is a great option if you're someone like me who loves to find new music. While the iTunes store is very good at pointing you to tracks that you'll probably like, through the recommendation feature and the top 100 lists for different categories of music, the actual shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. You find a song you like, then you double click on it and get 30 second clip and you have to decide based on that if you like a song enough to buy it. For me, this decision was always agonizing and I decided to buy a lot of songs that I wound up not liking all that much. I also always felt like I wasting time if in the music store, double clicking on a song, sitting there for thirty seconds, finding another one and so on. With a subscription service, however, you can say something like 'oh, i like band x' and then go download all of x's albums on to your device. Then you can go do work, work out, play video games or whatever and listen to the music and decide which songs you like. I've found this be a stress free and highly efficient form of finding new music. If you're interested in trying it out, Zune's come with a 14-day trial of the subscription service.   In short, if you're looking for a music player, I'd seriously consider what kind of listener you are and give a thought to whether or not the Zune is the right player for you. It certainly isn't the right player for everyone, and lacks much of the polish and many of the features of the ipod. That being said, it brings something to the table if you're serious about finding new music, you're interested in watching video on your device or would want to keep mulitiple libraries on multiple computers.

<Title>Where do I start?
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When i first heard of the Zune, I thought, hmmm, now this product has potential. Wireless, large screen, ect. But after playing around it, I got fustrated with everything about it and went back to my iPod. Here are my biggest gripes.  -the software installation is a complete nightmare. it crashed my computer several times  -the player will NOT play anything Windows Media related or anything that uses Windows Playforsure. That means anything that you have on your computer like movies or anything purchased outside of the Zune store will NOT play on this device. Seriously, how does a windows media device, NOT play windows formated merchandise?  -the online store is a mess to figure out. Instead of using cash, you purchase by buying blocks of $5 at a time and exchanging those for points for purchases in the zune store. The store has no movies, podcasts or tv shows. Ridiculous. Why don't they just tell me the price of something instead of having to purchase the equivalent of tokens before I can buy a song  -the music sharing is a neat idea, but once you share send the file to your friend, the zune automatically encodes your music file with DRM so your friend can only play it 3 times before it disappears from your friend's device. This DRM is put on everything even non protected mp3 files that you own.  -Microsoft pays the music company $1 for every device that they sell. Seriously? Why?  Basically, This is the player that the greedy suits at the recording companies wanted. If Microsoft really looked at their customers, they would have made this player a whole lot more comsumer friendly with less restrictions.   MY suggestion in you are in the market for a new MP3 player is to buy anything else besides The Zune. If you dont like Apple for some reason, there are hundreds of other choices that will allow you to play your music your way and not put you under the restrictions of the music industry. Don't waste your money on this player.

<Title>Very frustrating!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted to like the Zune. I spent several days trying to get this thing to work with my new Dell laptop, and I'm sorry to say after much frustration, I will be retuning my Zune. The final blow came when I discover that by installing the Zune software on my computer it caused me to loose my entire Napster music library. Before you ask, I'm not new to computers. In fact I'm a network administrator so I know a thing or two about computers.   I bought the Zune because a good friend seemed so happy with is Zune. That has since changed; He bought the Zune because he liked the wifi feature. After several failed attempts to share a song he became frustrated with the Zune. The one successful attempt took forever and drained his fully charged battery. At least he didn't lose his music library. This product is not ready for prime time.

<Title>As objective as i can!  I like my Zune
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a 15GB 3rd Gen Ipod, then a 30GB 5th Gen Ipod, and I recently purchased a Zune. (white) I bought it and my wife inherited the ipod.  This is a great player.  Lets break it down.  The zune software works as expected.  They are lacking some content like videos / etc... but it's just a matter of time.  Installation was a breeze.  It was a nice OOBE (out of box experience) to have a device that came with content as well as partial charge for me to try it.  The music transfer was as painless as can be expected.  The DRM restrictions everyone is talking about; you can't help it.  it is not Microsoft's fault that the music industry have yet to get a handle on a way to make digial licensing logical. (at this point it is not, i did have to jump through some hoops to get some of the content from my itunes to zune, but i wont go into details on that. Not the Zune's fault).  The wireless feature, is probably more geared towards highschool students and college kids that would actually gather and share music etc... not something that I would use, and the 3 day 3 play rule it's inevitable due to licensing restrictions.  I am not particularly dying to access the internet on my zune, the same as I have tried to browse the web on a smart phone, or on my son's PSP, and to be honest  WHAT'S THE POINT?  use a laptop!!.  Now the good stuff.   - First of all, the finish.  I would walk around with my ipod constantly cleaning the whole device which was a magnet for fingerprints.  That doesnt happen with the zune.   - The click wheel of the ipod is a novelty.  it is cool to show at first, but it is not that great.  The 5 directional button on the Zune, work absolutely great for me, the "click" under your finger is a lot more user friendly than no feedback at all. - The screen is marvelous. - Battery life, same thing - Sound quality comparable. I used B

<Content>(1) Poor picture quality.  Horizontal lines on vids due to low quality resolution.  Blown away by the amazing quality of iPod...but Zune is truely disappointing.    (2) 50% thicker the comparable 30GB iPod.  In fact, even the 60GB-80GB iPod is slimmer.    (3) Wheel mouse is difficult to use and not cool.   (4) Cheap design.  Plastic snap-on to the surface looks like its going to break off.   Zune is hand down NOT even nearly comparable to iPod's superior design, function and quality.  Forget Zune for Christmas.  Its absolutely horrible.    By the way, the brown looks like the color of feces.  Overall player just grosses me out.

<Title>Problems and very poor support
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune would not install on my two Windows XP 2002 Media Center computers claims I need media Center 2005.  This is a load because it claims to run on the lesser XP home 2002.  Would not load on either XP home computer just gives a blank install error every time you try to install.  Rebooting no use.  Upgrade to mediaplayer 11 no use.  Call support you can expect 30 minutes wasted talking to a thick tongued person who will then ask you to reboot and try to run the exact same install from the internet so you get the same error only SLOWER then they will drop your call because they dont like it when telling you to reboot doesnt fix your problem.  Very very very poor software - product looks wonderful but I expect it was the whole invasive DRM iPodness they were shooting for that made them refuse to simply give you USB DISK DRIVE interface to load files onto and steer everyone into THEIR mangled "lets assume everyone cannot manage files" idiot-proof Wario world media interface with the whole Big Brother thing.  - This is making the PSP look pretty darn good except for the diskspace!

<Title>No issues here - 
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had at one time actually considered buying an iPod, but I'm continually disgusted by Apple's worst enemy - their own customers. Once I dismissed the anti-Microsoft propaganda spewing Mac fan-boys for a moment and took an unbiased look at the Zune for myself, it was tempting, but I was still skeptical overall. After using it for a few days however, I lost all doubt concerning the quality of this product. I have not experienced any of the setbacks that some people have mentioned concerning installation and use of the software, and the interface is clean simple enough for `non-technical' people like my girlfriend and mother to use with ease.   The most impressive feature to me is the screen itself, crisp and clear, with its wide angle view, is perfect for those long waiting periods in the doctor's office (though watching video is more taxing on the battery life), and the photo features work just as well as expected.  I have not yet attempted to use the WiFi feature, though to be honest; it was never a factor in my decision to purchase a Zune.   Overall, this is a great mp3 player with enough extras to make it a 'must have' for me.

<Title>Review by an actual Zune and iPod owner
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a 5th generation iPod and bought a black Zune last week. Why? Primarily because I am a gadget-freak and I like the idea of a bigger screen and WiFi sharing of songs. The Zune comes in a very nice package and with clear installation instructions. I didn't run into any problems on Windows XP SP2 so I cannot comment on some of the problems other people have encountered.  After using it for a week this is how the Zune stacks up against the iPod:  iPod has the advantage in: -Size: Zune is slightly longer and thicker than the iPod but it's not that noticable. Slight advantage for iPod. -Software: Zune software is nice and works but iPod's software is more straightforward and easier to use. Yes, even my iPod software occasionally crashes but overall I like it better. -Applications & Games: no games and apps on Zune yet, some nice apps on the iPod but the games on iPod are pathetic. That's what my Nintendo DS is for. -Many more accessories! It took me a while to find a nice case for the Zune but I assume this will get better over time. Still iPod rules the accessory market. -External USB Device: I can use my iPod as a giant "memory stick", the Zune has this function disabled - although there is way to enable that (do a Google search).  Zune and iPod are even: -Battery Life: Zune (WiFi turned off) and iPod are about the same, 13 1/2 to 14 hours with screen off. -Interface: I liked Zune's menu structure much better than iPod's but I miss the iPod's great click-wheel. Also interface responds quicker on the Zune. -Sound Quality: listening to music with my Sony headphones I could not hear any difference in sound quality. -Headphones: the included headphones with the iPod and the Zune are equally crappy. The first accessory you buy should be new headphones.  Zune has the advantage in: -Screen: ZUNE WINS by a huge margin, screen is bigger and brighter, absolutely stunning! -Materials: iPod's sensitive chrome shell always bugged me and the screen on my iPod is horribly scratched despite a protective case, Zune's black/blue shell looks very nice and it seems to be impervious to finger prints, Zune's screen seems much more scratch resistent too. -Video: Forget the iPod! I converted some DVDs to WM9 and watched them on my Zune, it's a delight! The screen, the landscape mode, the brightness - wonderful. On a high quality setting I was able to fit around 60h of video onto the Zune. -Pictures: again thanks to the screen the Zune beats the iPod. Finally I can show off some baby pictures without people squinting. -WiFi: yeah, I like it. Granted the 3-day/3-play limitation is annoying but I have received a few cool songs so far. Problem is: there aren't too many Zune owners yet. -Radio: HUGE advantage for the Zune. I am at the gym, watching TV and tuning in to the sounds on my Zune. Why Apple hasn't included this yet in the iPod is beyond me. -Song purchase: I love the option of the "all you can eat" for $15/month. Granted most of my music is ripped from CDs but $15 per month for all the music I want is pretty compelling.  OVERALL VERDICT: I love my iPod, I LOVE MY ZUNE EVEN MORE. If Microsoft can write some applications and games and improve the Zune PC software they'll have a perfect consumer device.  To be fair: if you already have an iPod and have no need for radio and better video capabilities then there is no need to upgrade to a Zune. If you want better video, like the idea of radio and WiFi then the Zune is the way to go. If you are in the market for a new MP3 player in the $250 price range the Zune should be on the top of your shopping research list.  Most important: ignore all the fanboy garbage of "Microsoft is evil" and "Apple sucks" and stick with the facts. Reading some of the very loud "reviews" below I can only wonder how many of these writers actually own any of these devices.

<Title>New experiance
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have never used a mp3 player, I still have a cd player.  I am in college and I have these two friends, they both went out to get iPods.  One of them changed his mind, and bought a Zune.  Now, I decided this would be a unique oppurtunity for someone (me) to use both players, and rank each.  I asked each of them, and they both agreed to give me one day with each.  Zune Day  After getting the Zune I had a really hard time with the software, one crash, and customer support wasn't worth anything until the third call.  Downloading songs onto the Zune was easier then I expected, but at the same time, I had trouble getting songs from Windows media player onto the Zune.  The online store is brilliant for Microsoft, but I saw that they, in reality, were using poor business practices.  For all practical purposes, that is, just listening to the songs, I have no complaints.  Sound was comparible to my cd player.  Unfortunatly I couldn't share any songs, no one else I know has a Zune.  At the end of the day, I thought I might ask for a Zune for Christmas, as the cd player is really getting outdated.  iPod day  Software was a breeze, which suprised me because my roomate is a cs major, and says Apple is on lower tier of quality.  Importing songs was even easier, transfers between programs was a synch.  Listening to it was better then the Zune, and the smaller size rocked.  I carried it in my pocket much more comfortably.  Way better then the CD play, and a better then the Zune.  The bigger screen didn't mean much to me, I only listened to music.  I would pick the iPod, until I saw the price, then i decided the Zune would do, but it costs just as much. CD player, one more year for you.  My iPod friend is pleased, as is the Zune friend.  They both play music, so I guess you could say...  iPod has the advantage in Smaller size easier software better sound  Zune has not Apple (though I am less convinced Apple sucks, but there is a reason MS has the market share) bigger screen (for movies/pictures which I didn't test) the brown color, it is cool, the ipod was black and left big finger prints

<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's more or less of a laundry list of features I wanted in an mp3 player. Wireless transmitting? FM Radio? Count me in!  Three hours - yes, you read that right, actual time and no exaggeration - after sitting at my computer (half of the time it was frozen) I returned the device. Absolutely horrible. Once I did get songs onto it the ZUNE ITSELF FROZE!  I took it back to the store and came home with an iPod. I know iPods are huge and people hate the popular product but they really can't be compared. The iPod oblitherates the Zune - and this is coming from an anti-Apple guy!  I want Microsoft to give me back those wasted hours and the restocking fee. What a waste.

<Content>I am very disappointed with Zune.  Zune loaded my music from iPod easily enough.  The Marketplace was horrible, very difficult to use.  I was also very disappointed with the accessories that were available, meaning there were next to none.  I do not recommend spending this kind of money on this product when the iPod has clearly seperated itself as a superior product that is tried and true.

<Title>Fantastic Little Device!
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been heavily resistant to getting an MP3 player with moving internal parts (HDD failure rates tend to be astronomical, understandably). However, one quick spin with this little gem had me convinced.   Sharing music, pictures, movies, and playlists is a snap. Sure with the music you can only listen 3 times in 3 days when someone sends it to you, but that's understandable (licensing and such, be glad it can happen at all *glare at ipod*).   The unit itself is fairly rugged when compared to comporable items. It's surface, both pleasing to look at and touch, doesn't get scratched up and marred as easily as the competition. The screen is very large for what it is.   The headphones are, wsell, pitiful (I suggest buying replacements with the unit), but that's the same for any MP3 player you buy.   Compatible formats encompass a lot of the media found on most users machines, so you can expect a great deal of your movies, music, etc. to already be capable of playing on the unit.   The Zune software itself is effective, but uninspiring. The interface takes a bit of getting used to, but it's imilarity to Windows Media Player is so close, that many will already know their way around.   Vista compatible software should be out soon, and that really seems to be the only place it's lacking.   It's a bit heavy (easily a half pound or so heavier than an iPod), but at least I don't feel like I'm going to break it when I pick it up.

<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Not only did I find this wouldn't install on one of my PCs, since installing it on the second I've had problems with the device not being recognised. I'm not an iPod owner so I've no idea if it's better or worse than one of those but so far the experience with my Zune has been poor.   What sold it for me actually was the idea that I could share my songs, even if only to be played three times but I'm finding that that it's only specific songs I can share and there's no immediate way of telling which ones they are.  I don't mind the look of it so much and the interface seems nice enough but for me it has to be easy to use and my experience so far is that it isn't. I'll probably return it.

<Content>I just recieved my Zune on Tuesday and cannot put it down. I had no problems installing the software and I think it is the perfect size all around (personally I dont like tech that is almost as thin as paper). I didnt find it bulky at all in fact it fits perfectly in my hand (which is rather small). I have never previously owned an MP3 player, but I have toyed around with the ipod and did not like it (I thought it looked simple and I hate the clickwheel) however I do like Itunes... I get my tv shows from there:) Both products have their positive and negative points its just what works for you because they are almost the same. I recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>Poor quality, poor support.
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Saying this product even deserves one star, is like featuring a Yugo in the Dupont Registry. Well, so much for trying something new. I've used Macs for 5 years. But I still have a Windows machine for the media center with XP and SP2, had a lot of stuff saved there. I tried to install the software, and it took 2 hours. Then I had to transfer all the music to the software. Tried to sync the Zune, then tried to sync, then tried again to sync, I reinstalled the SW, started over, then computer crashed. I was going to try to install on my Dual Boot Mac, with XP and SP2, but I really don't want even deal with it when I have an iPod that works now, perfectly. To tell you the truth. I think this really sucks, I was excited about the WiFi feature, because I heard that you can send MP3's that are not protected and listen to them an unlimited amount of times. Then I read that the Zune software DRM's all the of the music, so even if you didn't buy it from the Zune MarketPlace, when you send it to a buddy, they can still listen to it only 3 times. I wanted to find out, but it appears I won't get this thing to work. So I won't know, and at this point don't really care. If I want a friend to listen to a tune, I'll just put it on my iPod used as a hard drive, and give it to them.  Unless Microsoft is paying your mortgage, there is absolutely no reason to try and deal with a 2 hour software install, or really any other of thier rediculously pathetic products. Well, okay Xbox is cool. Thanks to Halo, Xbox team at MS. Stick to the Xbox, no Zune.  Waste of my time. Returned.   And. I have iTunes on the PC, I can take my PC-formatted iPod and sync music from iTunes on the PC, and on then back on the Mac. I can't even use the Zune with the Mac, which I thought was ok, but I have to transfer files over the network, or with my iPod as a hard drive, (can't do that with the Zune), from the Mac to the PC. I've heard the vido resolution of the Zune is the same resolution as the iPod, but on a stretched screen, so the video is slightly distorted, another thing I would love to see for myself, but won't, until I see someone elses because mine is being returned.  Buyers Beware - If you are thinking of just a simple to use MP3 player, get an ipod nano, if you need the video feature, the 30GB ipod video is supurb. If you want to go all out geekery, you can even put Linux on the iPods. Play games like Tetris, and such w/ Linux, its all free, and sweet.

<Title>Hardware Ok, Software obismal
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In short, I purchased the Zune and returned it the next day. I had played with it in the store and initially didn't see anything wrong with it. I could live with he clunky size and lack of scroll wheel support.  When I brought it home I had a completely different experience! The software to get the music on the player is a joke. iTune is much easier to use and doesn't take an hour to install!   (BTW, the long install I could have lived with... there are a number of issues I had w/ the software that finally made me just return it. No drag n drop support from explorer... auto sync is kind hidden so deleting files from explorer automagically takes them off the Zune... the mp3's get converted to custom file format on Zune which only adds to the time to copy music over... and on and on.)  That's my warning, I wish I would have found software reviews for the Zune first... I say get the iPod.  -Justin

<Title>ZUNE or IPOD???
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Why I Love the my Zune: why its better than the iPod and how Microsft can improve the Zune even more.  Why the Zune is better than the iPod: 1. It has wireless 2. It has a much bigger widescreen display. 3. It's easier to navigate - yes, i said it - it's easier. example - say i was browsing through a certain artist's list of songs, if i wanted to go to another artist, on the iPod, i would have to go back one menu, and then find the artist. what the zune does, it give you the previous menu on the top of the screen, and all i have to do is push right or left, and i'm already scrolling through the artist list. 4. you can custumize the backround with any photo you choose. 5. cool feature - if the zune is off, either taking it off hold, or putting the headphones in the jack will turn it on, taking them out will pause playback. 6. you can use the zune while it's charging through the computer (it only snycs when you open the zune software) 7. it has a fm radio. 8. video menu displays video information, year, actors, anything - plus it gives you the option to start from where you left off last time, or from the begining. 9. the coating around the player help it from being scratched and banged up. (I've had it for a month now, and its in PERFECT condition, i kid-you-not) 10. if you have a song by more that one artist - say "akon - smack that (featuring Eminem)" the song will appear by both akon's list and eminem's list of songs. 11. album art is dsplayed nice and big 12. the headphones magneticly stick together very nicely for less tangle when wrapping. these are just some of the many advantages of the zune over the iPod.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ZUNE: 1. who cares about wireless??? - however much cheaper, lighter, and smaller they could have made the zune if it did not have wireless, they should have done so. it's really just a big waste - and to top it off, you only get up to three plays in up to three days. what a wasted technology. 2. it a bit bulkier that the iPod - (its taller to - but the screen is much taller - or wider- than the iPod.) 3. no voice recorder, sleep timer, alarm clock, text, calender, or even a clock. 4. the iPod noise cancellation headphone have better sound. 5. UGLY colors. 6. equalizer can only be accessed through the settings menu 7. cannot be used as a hard drive without editing the registry.  all in all - the zune is an excellent mp3 player - the best one on the market - however, although it is better than the iPod, the margin in not big enough to get all the loyal ipod fans to aknowledge its advantages quite yet, perhaps the second generation will be even more improved to sway the long-time ipod lovers and microsoft haters.

<Title>iPod user gone Zune!
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zune now for just over two weeks now and am really enjoying it.  Here are some of my thoughts.  I am a PC user and have had an iPod mini for over two years now that I used constantly.  Many of you are probably considering upgrading from an iPod to a Zune so I'll compare my experience of the two.  To be fair, I realize that the iPod mini is old technology now and not comparable to the Zune.  Brown Color: You either love or hate the brown zune.  I love it.  The green double shot is really attractive and the dark metal border around the screen and center button offer beautiful contrast.  Screen:  The screen is absolutely gorgeous!  It is very big, very bright, and the first thing everyone asks me about when they see it.  Controls:  The center wheel is a four direction button with a center button and not a touch wheel like the iPod.  My first instinct was to spin the wheel like apple devices and the lack of response was a bit of a let down... at first.  iPod users will no doubt be familiar with trying to navigate menus with the spin wheel and way overshooting what you're looking for or endlessly spinning the wheel to get to the end of your list.  Within an hour or so, I was very much enjoying the simplicity of changing volume and tracks by a single button instead of sliding.  MP3s: Sound great as you would expect.  Great organization.  Love the cover art!  Radio:  I actually find myself using it quite a bit.  The tuner picks up digital information from many stations and lists the station name, genre, and song artist and title.  It's a really nice feature.  Video:  The Zune comes preloaded with some videos which are fun.  My digital camera (Fuji V10) takes beautiful video that looks great on the Zune.  I have been using free Microsoft software (PhotoStory and MovieMaker) to splice music, video, and pictures into videos that I can carry around in my Zune.  This promises to be huge fun in the future.  Also, with a bit of searching, you can find great products that let you put DVDs and Tivo recordings on your player as well.  Zune Navigation:  The menus take a few seconds to get used to, but are very intuitive and easy to navigate.  I love that I can put one of my pictures and make it my background.  It looks very personal.  WIFI: I can't find any other Zunes out there to share with yet.  I'll be searching for them at the gym and work after Christmas.  Battery Life:  They say 14 hours, I think it's closer to 12.  Definitly last more than a full day of use.  If you are watching video, it will be less of course.  No complaints here.  Zune Software:  Wow, does it feel like a beta version!  Install required a reboot and managed to crash what I thought was a fairly crash proof PC.  The software seems to want to be the only thing running.  Any other software seems to make it hang for long periods of time.  It looks and feels very much like Windows Media Player 11 which also tends to hang a bit on my computer.  As for usability, it has a lot of good features: auto playlists (right click on `create playlist'), stacked album cover display, video and picture tabs, built in burning, etc.  Hopefully, they will get this thing running better with updates in the very near future.  Zune Marketplace:  I find it a joke to buy MP3s from services like this.  DRM (digital rights management) protected music is quickly showing its limitations.  Microsoft is a terrible example of the problem and here is why.  The Microsoft Zune will NOT play Microsoft `Plays for Sure' files purchased in the past!  Nor, will it play iTunes purchased files or anything other than Zune Marketplace DRM files.  I WILL NOT purchase DRM music.  All of my music is ripped directly from CDs.  It sounds better, can be used however I want and I will never be locked into a specific media provider for my music.   You get a free 14 day pass with your Zune, but I wont' be trying it.  Carrying case: While not often in the description, the Zune comes with a soft form fitting faux-suede pouch for your Zune.  I love it!  It looks great, lets the player slide smoothly into my pocket, protects the screen and allows me to feel and operate the buttons through the case.  I know already that I will eventually lose it, but that will be a sad day.  Headphones:  They are magnetic to try and prevent tangles, but the magnets aren't strong enough to keep them connected.  They are earbuds which many people don't like, but they happen to nestle perfectly in my ears and I'll use them for the time being.  Size and Weight:  It's a little bigger and a little heavier than my iPod mini, but the added features easily make up for the slight increase in size.  I use it at the gym, slide it in the pocket of my jeans at work and sometimes just hold it to watch videos.  Its smaller than it looks in pictures.  What I miss from the iPod:  In general, not much.  I'm giving my mini to my little brother.  One thing is podcasts.  You can put podcasts on the Zune, but right now, it's a pain in the rear.    The future:  Microsoft will no doubt be releasing upgrades for the Zune player and software in the very near future.  This was a feature sorely lacking from my iPod.  It did the same thing from the day I got it out of the box to today.  There are a tons of possibilities that promise to make the Zune grow better with age.  Wireless syncing over your home network, internet radio, podcasting, radio recording, contacts and calendar options, better synchronizing options, and much more.    The Zune has been a great upgrade for my needs and I can't wait to see how Microsoft makes it better in the future.

<Title>This Zune is Great!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 30GB Zune for my son for Christmas in Dec 2007. I was torn between the ipod and the Zune, but since my son had thousands of songs from his DVDs and MP3 collection which the ipod would not play, I went with the Zune. I was a little concerned by a number of the negative reviews about the Zune PC software.  But I was amazed.  I installed the software on both my Windows XP and my sons Windows VISTA and it was the easiest and fastest instal I have ever done. It installed flawlessly and it recognized the devise immediately, it recognized that a newer version of the Zune software was available and after checking with me it then unstalled it smothly and quickly with no intervention on my part.  It then asked me if I wanted to load MP3,JPEG, and video files from my compuer and allowed me to override or limit, then it synched up the files flawlessly and was ready to play.  The music was great and the large screen (twice the size of the ipod) looked fantastic.  Manuvering around and using the Zune was easy and fun.  If there were problems in the Zune software earlier, they appear to be fixed because everything was easy, smooth and worked great.  I highly recommend the Zune!  Apple better watch out because the new Zune clobers the ipod hands down.  I highly recommend it and I am going to get another for my other son!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

<Content>Returned this unit after trying it for 4 days.  I tried.  I wanted to like it.  The screen is nice.  Software is worse than awful.  None of my purchased music would load -- need to buy new songs from zune!  I've gone back to my iPod (60Gb iPod) and the sense of relief is amazing.  It just works!  Don't waste your time.  The Zune will be dead SOON - no way this will catch on.

<Title>Please do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this product.
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I heard that Microsoft was launching a product initially I was skeptical.  I had had numerous problems with their other products, but this seemed like it might be different, but alas, another problem riddled product from Microsoft.    I purchased my Zune from Target and after getting it home, I worked on installing the software and trying to get my PC to recognize the Zune for more than FOUR hours.  This product was clearly not ready for release, but Microsoft was in such a hurry to get this thing out for the Holiday, they rushed it out without proper testing.    There is nothing redeemable about this product.  From software, to hardware, to their store.  It's just not a good product.  My prediction, this will be pulled from the market within a year.  I returned my Zune and decided to upgrade my iPod to the new 80g model.  I got it home and it was working within 5 minutes.  Save yourself from the headaches, DO NOT buy this product!

<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think Microsoft just wanted to get the Zune on the market before Christmas.  The main reason I bought the Zune was for the video capabilities, the larger screen and I already own the Orignal IPOD.  You cannot sync up your Windows Media Center recordings to your Zune at this time.  Why do I need a Zune then?  Really dispointing!!!  There are no podcasts or videos on the Zune marketplace.  I am going to be patient and see if Microsoft releases some kind of firmware improvement in the next three months.  If I see no improvments Apple IPOD here I come.

<Title>Great device
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought my Zune last week and I have been very surprised with the mixed reviews I have read in Amazon so I decided to publish my own.  I am truly impressed with the user experience so far. The synchronization with my PC was flawless and after I downloaded my video and music collection (in no time) I tried to sync the Zune with my XBOX 360. The experience was really good, not a glitch and I can now play all my Zune songs in my living room home theater!  The design is beautiful. I, like most Zune newcomers expect Microsoft to come up with extended wireless access soon (it will be very nice to access on-line songs and videos from Starbucks).  Be sure to check the "all you can eat" music service. For a very cheap price you can literally hear all the music you want and the Zune comes with 2 weeks for free.  I will not enter into non-sense passion-fueled comparisons, Zune is an excellent product and worth taking a look with an open mind. If you need to give a great present this year this is a good option as you will be able to share songs in a convenient way.

<Title>Microsoft's New Media Device = Glitchy
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like many other people, I purchased my Zune very soon after it launched. I installed the software and added all of my media to the Zune library as soon as I got it home. I put about 6 gigs of media onto my Zune, and took it for a test spin the next day. I have only one word to describe the Zune; GARBAGE. Every 10 minutes of so, the Zune will lock up and stop playing music. I have music playing, and the lock feature enabled because I carry the Zune in my pocket. All is well, when suddenly, everything stops. The Zune justs stops working. All sound has ceased, and none of the buttons are responding. The only solution is to reset the device. This takes about 2 minutes to complete. This happenned to me no less than 2 dozen times over the course of a week.  The Zune is: -Stylish -Very easy to use -Ultimately flawed  The Zune Software is: -Very well laid out -Easy to use -Very good at finding album art  The Zune is a new device, distributed by a company new to the market. Lets not forget that the hardware is manufactured by Toshiba. Toshiba is notorious for having flaws on new products. The Zune is on its way towards being a huge success, but for now, lets give Microsoft and Toshiba some time to work out the bugs. My advice to you is to consider the ipod. Apple has been in the market for years, and knows what they are doing. They have had plenty of time to work major defects out of their devices.

<Content>I also just had to try one out for myself. What a piece of junk! I'm no iPod lover, but this thing pales in comparison. I felt like I was carrying around a sony walkman. The fake click wheel took me by surprise as it's just simple buttons. The software and store r simply ridiculous. Almost impossible to use. CRASH- CRASH CRASH. you can forget about syncing this thing. The battery life is terrible with WiFi on. Which brings up the next point. I found the WiFi useless as nobody I know in their right mind will ever buy one! I gave it a week and sent it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Fairly good start out of the gate for Microsoft!!
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found the Zune to be very user friendly and as an Ipod owner myself (5TH GEN Video) can say that the Zune will offer Apple some much needed competition!  To start w/ the Zune is very user friendly and controls are simple and intuitive.  The screen is larger, brighter and offers a sharper image then my Ipod.  I didn't find the larger size of the Zune to be an issue.  I also found the Zune to sound better than my Ipod.      The major problem for the Zune is the software that is included.  After loading the software and attempting to sync/communicate with the Zune, software would load and generate an error message.  After speaking w/ Microsoft..  they advised to load the software again from CD, however, cancel the portion where it's looking for updates.  The other thing that's ODD was this device is out for 2 - 3 weeks and there's already a FIRMWARE Update needed for the device.. YIKES!!!      I've had the Zune for about 1 week now and really enjoy it (once you get passed the software issues).  Several folks have said that not being able to listen to podcasts or transfer existing "protected" music (music purchased from Itunes) to be an issue.  However, there is software avaialble that let's you legally copy music and videos to Zune pain free.  The Zune Marketplace is simple to use and offers over 2 million songs.  However, Microsoft's "POINTS" kinda sux and the lack of video offerings at launch leaves much to be desired.  But hey give it time.. if Microsoft can do for Zune Marketplace what they have done for XBOX Live/Marketplace.. LOOK OUT APPLE!!

<Title>Zune is a great mobile media device
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While there are inevitable comparisons to the iPod, the Zune stands on it's own merits.  - The screen is large and bright for a device of it's size.  It's also visible in direct daylight. - Support for WMA and WMV formats is a big win but not unexpected. - The subsciption service is an awesome value and not different from those offered by Rhapsody or other quality online music providers.  iTunes lacks this feature. - The wireless music/picture sharing with other Zune users is not a big feature, but it does provide the hardware to later provide synching wirelessly or even over the Internet, or other connectivity I have not thought of. - FM reciever is well implemented and performs very well.  Why Apple never added this feature that so many media players already have is a mystery. - Earbuds are fine and comfortable. I like that they have small magnets so that they stick together to help prevent tangling.  Worth the money.

<Title>Another Microsoft Mistake 
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was curious to see if Microsoft took the same care with this product as they did with the Xbox or was if just like one of the other hundreds of failed products made by Microsoft.    As a current owner of the 5G 30GB iPod I purchased the Zune hoping the big screen would be work the investment.  Well after about a week I ended up returning it, and getting the 80 GB iPod which I could not be happier with.    Here is why I returned it:    1.  After using the iPod for so long I just expect gadgets like these to work.  No way the software included with the Zune is probably the worst that Microsoft has created (and that's saying a lot)  The Zune is not always recognized, the songs are not always uploaded (not to mention you can not use all of those Playsforsure songs everyone has) The software (or the Zune) just didn't want to work.  If you want to keep playing around with it eventually you will be able to upload your stuff, it is just a ton of hassel.    2.  The screen may be a little bigger then the iPods, but it is not as bright, and has the same resolution as the iPods smaller screen.  That made the movies I was watching look less sharp and more grainy on the Zune then the iPod which started to bother me after being used to the higher resolution.    3.  It is just big.  I don't get it my 80 GB iPod has nearly 3 times the storage capacity and double the battery life, and yet the Zune is just a monster compated to it, I cannot imagine it all being the extra inch on the screen size making it that much bigger.    4.  The buttons are no Clickwheel.  I think this is a pretty good example of you don't know how good the Clickwheel is untill you are using something else instead.      Well, I am happy now with my iPod and am looking forward to when Apple will be coming out with a widescreen iPod.  I know a lot more people are going to try the Zune just as I had to, but I hope this information has helped anyway.

The software installed just fine and also imported all my playlists and music ratings from WMP11. The player is incredibly easy to use once you get used to it and i am yet to have any issues with the battery life. I have handed the zune to several people and no everyone has figured the interface out very quickly with minimal instruction, it's that easy to use.I won't comment on the zune marketplace because I have no need to use it, i rip my music from actual CD's. All in all i would say this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great media player for a decent price.

<Title>Good Player 
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have recently purchased a Zune. I've compared the Zune with the Ipod 5.5. Originally the Ipod had my vote, but after some serious deliberation I went with the Zune. I like the positive click action of the controls, they seem easier to use while not looking at the screen. The case does not show fingerprints or scratches (saves the need for a $30.00 cover, just a screen protector)and feels solid. The size is bigger than the Ipod, but the lack of a case/cover helps. The screen is bigger and has a very good picture. It seems easier to watch video on. Sound it very nice. It accepts WMA files without conversion(does not indicate a conversion when syncing).  I can't comment on battery life yet, but plays for hours even when using the controls and some video.   I don't use the online stores to purchase music, so the good/bad of itunes/Microsoft does not matter to me. The software installed quickly and easily on my Dell work machine and my home gaming machine using WinXP pro. The Zune connects and syncs quickly. So far it does exactly what I need without things I won't use. If it developes problems I will switch to the ipod 5.5. Apple has a fine player, but without using the online stores for music/video content, the Zune was better for me. The earbuds for both are terrible. I threw mine away and use a pair of folding Sennheiser PX100. The difference is unbelievable.

<Content>Unless you are hopelessly addicted to using your opposable thumb in a circular motion, the Zune is light years ahead of the ipod.  With a larger display screen, video's and pictures are much easier to watch and since digital music is digital, the difference being in the earbuds, Zune & ipod both deliver, altho with Zune's wallpaper ability, the Zune has a nicer backdrop to your tune info.  Zune has a SUPER FM radio and wireless music xfer w/other Zune's.  The casing is scratch resistant.  MS has done it again.....

<Title>For me, Best Audio/Video Player on the market
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Initially, I was looking for a portable media player that would be primarily used in the Living Room as my "CD Player" so that I don't clutter my space up with CDs (I have 1500 CDs). For this, it needed to have decent accessories support (have you seen how many MP3 players are just the player and nothing else?) ... since I needed some sort of dock and remote control for it, as well as a decent memory size.  Personally, I don't care for the iPod (I'm not keen on the scroll wheel - the thumb movement is awkward especially when you have a LOT of albums). The Zune uses a simple D-Pad arrangement (disguised as a wheel) and has a larger screen to boot! I noticed that a LOT of companies have announced 3rd party accessories for the Zune and that makes Zune the only other "alternative" to iPod as far as I'm concerned.  However, I have discovered that the large screen on the screen is very acceptable for watching video and I am now expanding my use of it! As well as the Living Room CD player, it is used on my commute and when I fly. It's way better than listening/watching the rubbish they put on aircraft - plus you can pause, go back, etc.  The Zune and the Zune software have worked flawlessly since I got it. On first connect, it updated the firmware on the Zune and personally, I like the fact that MS can do this. It gives them the opportunity to fix bugs and/or add new capabilities.  I'm an "own it" kind of a guy, so all of my audio/video is purchased on CD/DVD. I use MediaMonkey for the audio and ImToo DVD Ripper to get my DVDs onto the Zune. Hence, I don't use the Zune MarketPlace, but I do use the Zune software for synchronization, etc. Hence DRM isn't an issue for me.  I am very pleased with this purchase. Co-workers have generally been wow-ed (except for the Linux geeks who absolutely loathe MS as a rule). I gave it 4 stars since 30GB was smaller than I would have liked (80 or 100GB, please), but I'll upgrade later to a larger model when they release it.  A very, very good release for what is a version 1.0 product.

<Title>No i-Pod killer, but its a worthy alternative.
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had ny Zune for 2 weeks. I think its an incredible peace of hardware. While it has a while to cacth up with the I-pod in terms of ease of use and marketplace diversity it is a great alternative. The screen is larger than the i-Pod video and the addition of a radio is a fanatastic option. While the color selection could be more diverse,at a price that is only $50 more than an I-pod nano its a decent bargain. Anyone that may have installation issues you must have the Service Pack 2 installed.  If you own an Xbox 360, Zune is the perfect companion piece. Unlike the i-Pod which can't play songs on the Xbox that were downloaded from the i-Tunes store the Zune communicates with the 360 very easily.  Also if I understand how the Zune marketplace works, every time you log in microsoft keeps a record of all the songs purchased on your account. So if for some reason you lose all your data on your current PC, all you have to do is log in again and the marketplace will download your catalog again. I might be wrong about this feature, but I think its accurate. The Zune marketplace is linked to the Xbox Live marketplace. So if you own a 360, like I said before its an ideal companion piece.  What the Zune marketplace lacks is a videodownload selection, which I can only hope will be added soon. Zune will not beat I-pod for market dominance, however I still enjoy it very much! I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.

<Title>Zune
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, I had an Ipod mini, but it got crushed by my daughter. I picked a Zune and I like it for the most part. Im still getting used to some things, but I like it.   Pro's:FM Radio, Better screen than Ipod, scratch resistant, sounds good, plays videos, Built in WI Fi and exchange music.  Con's: Software/Marketplace needs work, but Itunes is now 7.0, have to buy points, heavier than Ipod (not a big deal to me), slightly bigger than Ipod(again not a big deal), No belt clip.  I would have given it a 5 if it had a belt clip.

<Content>Supposedly, 5% or 1 out of a hundred(quoting tech service) will have their software fail on installation, which included me.

I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks. I have about 1900 songs,40 videos, and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go. Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband, son, and sister. We are now a 6 Zune family and growing. We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older.

<Title>Great deal at $99
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Dell for their $99 price which included shipping.  Originally this was for only the brown version, but Dell ran out and substituted a white model which was nice.  I'm running the v2.3 firmware and I have the latest version of the Zune software.  I've had no sync problems.  The software is excellent and it's easy to manage my CD collection.  I have zero complaints about this product, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $200 price people are asking.   Pros: 1. Zune Software is easy to use 2. Zune UI is easy to use 3. Music quality is good 4. Wireless sync now works 5. Seems to be well made Cons: 1. A bit bulky 2. No auto rotate feature on the videos (doesn't auto-sense like an iPod phone). 3. Supplied earbuds are not that great (iPod owners complain of the same issue).  I got this as a Christmas present.  I liked it so much, I got two.  What I like best is that this simply does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple.  It was also a bargain.  I use it with an Altec Lansing docking station and that's also very nice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQLPZE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Altec Lansing M604 Powered Audio System for Zune</a>.

<Title>Very Cool
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned several other MP3 players that had small storage that I used in the gym, so I was looking forward to the release of the Zune to hold my entire music collection, sync TV shows from my Media Center PC, and share music, pictures, and video w/ my XBOX 360.  I never really considered an iPod since I am not a Mac user.  The Zune provides better convergence with my PC and 360 that iPod can't do.  No regrets, great investment!  I had the device out of the box, software installed, all of my music synced and downloading new tracks in 15 minutes.  It will take a while for the Zune to catch up with the huge head start that the iPod has, but Microsoft will continue to innovate and provide more value in the long run.

<Title>iPod Killer? Not Yet...
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros - Very cool design. Nice feel to the Zune.   Cons - Battery Life is very low on mine for some reason. Its bigger than my iPod video. The sharing thing that thay are advertising so much is not all that. You can only listen to your shared song 3 times in 3 days. Thats not sharing at all! They should call it a sample from your friends. Other than that I should have went ahead and bought another iPod.  Additional Thoughts - Not ready for the market yet. The software is a PAIN to install. And the sharing with other people is really a joke. It still does not give you the control that you should have over your own media. Good idea though.

<Title>Great MP3 player!!
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the zune player on the release day and I must admit I have been satisfied with the devise so far. Considering it's a first generation media player the product is outstanding. The zune marketplace works seemlessly with the zune player. I had no problem installing the software on a windows xp computer; along with the software came a 14 day trial of the service--that was pretty sweet! Although the hardware and software is very intuitive, the zune does have its shortcomings. One of my complaints is the battery life, I can't say its horrible, but its just not great. Another complaint is that the zune marketplace is currently not offering videos, it only offers music. Although MS said they will offer videos in the near future, it would have been nice to have some at launch. I guess to overcome the lack of videos, the zune player comes pre-installed with videos, music, and very cool art that you can use to customize the background. For those complaining that the zune is bigger than the ipod, you have to remember its a first generation model that will change as the it evolves. I think it's only fair that if your going to compare the zune to the ipod, you compare it the first generation ipod--remember those ipods, they were big and bulky!  Note: The zune has a big screen for viewing your videos, which is a factor in its overall size, but the player is very light and easy to carry. Also, it has wi-fi, which allows you to send songs wirelessly to friends who are near you and have zune player.

<Title>No Net Library? No Bookmarking? No Sale!
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is not a machine for the 40+ crowd that shuns the attention fracturing music of today's youth. One of these days the mega Zunipod corporations will realize that much of the well-to-do middle aged and up demographic actually listen to BOOKS on their MP3 players.  What the audiofile wants in an MP3 player is:  1. 'Plays for Sure' compatibility so that we can copy our NET LIBRARY books using Windows Media Player to our audio devices.  2. BOOKMARKING!!!!! A 17 hour WMA file is a sad thing when you lose your place in it and have to start over. Without bookmarking the player is essentially 'highjacked' by the book because if you move to another sound file you lose your place. (Note that this is not an issue for Zune. Although it won't bookmark, you can't get Net Library books on it in the first place!)  The final word is: If you want to listen to audio books, get a Creative or a Rio with 'Bookmarking.' Avoid this device.

<Title>Designed to hoodwink consumers
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While the larger screen suggests higher resolution, the number of pixels is identical to the Apple iPod.  Blown up that size, album art looks a lot worse, is more pixelated with compression artifacts abound.  Lack of compatibility with both iTunes AND Windows Media Player is definitely not a positive.  The included ZUNE software feels mostly incomplete.  The final straw is that circular control.  "Oh cool," I thought. "Somebody finally figured out how to do the scroll wheel like on the iPod."  Think again.  The "scroll wheel" you see at the bottom of the Zune is nothing more than a cheap, flimsy four-way rocker switch designed to look like a touch pad.  Complete, utter garbage.  Avoid avoid avoid.

Sound quality- Very good, up to par with creative and ipod products. Wireless- Have not got a chance to use this. Buy this. In my opinion this comes up to par of apples 5.5th generation device.

<Title>Some Common Sense
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me first say that I do not own this product nor do I own an iPod at this time. I have another MP3 player which I use with one of the subscription music services out there. However, I am considering either the Zune or the iPod to replace that player. To be fair, I have also had the opportunity to play with the iPods before as friends of mine have them.  What has gotten to me here is the almost silliness of some of the comments about the Zune. And though I am not huge fan of Microsoft I feel the need to defend them here a little. This is not due to any bias against Apple or Microsoft, but because some of the agruments are just insane. The following applies to the 30gb capacity for both brands.  First the physical size: The iPod measures 4.1" x 2.4" x 0.4". The Zune measures 4.4" x 2.4" x 0.6" Maybe it's me, but it doesn't seem the Zune is that much bigger. Especially with the WiFi, FM radio and larger screen.  How about the weight? iPod: 4.8oz Zune: 5.0oz Is the weight of a few sheets of paper really that much of a difference? Again I point to the additional features.  The style of the device is really up to each person's preference. We hear about the sturdiness of the devices and get all sorts of conflicting reports. I have held both and they both feel pretty sturdy, though I do understand where people talk about fingerprints and scratches with the iPod.  The music service alone (forget the video and podcasts) to me is a difference. I like the idea of a $15 unlimited plan. I have a varied taste and am constantly trying new music so it makes sense for me.  As for video and podcasts - yes. I do want to see those as future offerings. I also admit to liking the idea of the FM radio.   The WiFi doesn't really matter at this stage as there aren't enough Zune users out there yet. Big negatives to the WiFi are the addition of DRM to unlicensed files, the inability to access files through a wireless interface and the inability to send or receive video files. Hopefully those will be addressed in the future.  The software issues I can not speak on first hand as I have not installed either iTunes or Zune Marketplace with one of the devices. I have heard horror stories on both pieces of software however. Right now it's the Zune software more than not mainly because it's a new product and also because of some of the animosity toward Microsoft.  Overall, the two products are about the same size and weights. They have the same storage capacity and both seem to have comparable sound quality. The screen size though is dramatically different and the Zune does offer a bit of personalization which the iPod does not. Yes, it would be nice to have easy import of files purchased from other music store, but the burn to CD and rip them down option is there for the moment.  In basic features the Zune does have the advantages of the WiFi, bigger screen and the FM radio tuner.  I'm inclined to give the Zune a shot. Yes, it's a first generation unit and I'm sure there are bugs with it. If I decide to purchase either the iPod or the Zune I will be happy to give a fair commentary on that product. Hope this helps many of you.

<Title>Horrible device, huge waste of money
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is probably the worst device I have ever had the misfortune of using. Aside from the painful software support, buggy/crashieness of the device, and terrible audio format compatibility, the device is clumsy. The WiFi does not work as advertised, it wastes battery life (which isn't so hot to begin with) and this thing doesn't even work with Microsoft's own classic online music service (Since this is not a 'Play for Sure' device).   Do not waste your money on this device. Save yourself headache and regret by getting a new iPod, or waiting for the 6th gen iPod to come out later this coming year. You'll thank yourself for going with a quality product instead of this hodge-podge, 'rushed to market', flunk.  Not to mention MS' awful DRM scheme and policies with their music store. Owning your music is the way to go.

<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well i just received my Zune (Black). I tried to hold out but broke down and bought it. I can't say enough about the 3" screen. Its visually engaging and you have to love the transitioning between portrait and lanscape views. It is feature loaded with the FM Tuner, WiFi community, XBOX 360 streamin, etc. I saw that some people wrote in their review that the software took a while to install, update and sync with the Zune. I have to agree with that. Not sure why it does, but you just have to be patient. I thought it was frozen when I was installing but it just took a while. I just let it do its thing and walked away. When I did get it installed and sync'd, the Zune software was much more than I expected. It did so much as far as organization and ease of use. So far I have only had my Zune a little while and I take it every where. Just can't put it down.

<Title>Welcome To The Social.... Misfit
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When my daughter asked for a Zune as a birthday gift, I took it as an opportunity to see what Microsoft brought to the party.  Having owned 2 iPods (Gen 2 and Gen 4) and getting ready to upgrade again, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for a head to head comparison; one that would help me decide what my next purchase might be.  Honestly, it didn't take very long.  In my opinion, just like with all other MicroSoft products, it seems as though they dumped it on the market with the intent of letting the consumer do their beta testing.  Right from the get-go, from trouble installing the software, to the extensive registration process, to the clumsy store functionality, this was a no win situation.  AND, on top of that, it's a pretty heavy device when compared to the iPod. However, the Zune does have one advantage over the iPod, and thats it's screen size. Other than that...  The short of the story is that even my daughter was dissapointed.  I returned it, took her to our local Apple store and she picked out a (Product) Red 8G Nano, and she couldn't be happier.  I think she captured it best when she described the Zune as the iPod's Ugly Step Sister.

<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Someday, if I decide to mess around long enough with this, the clunky, counter-intuitive, user-hostile Zune software will transfer what I want into my Zune.  Or someone will develop software that will.  The software is inflexible to install, froze countless times during the installation, and runs at a snail's pace when it runs at all.    The player itself is okay, and if I figure out how to put video into it (not one word on "video" in Zune's software "help" ...) it might even do something my old Creative Zen Xtra didn't do.  Oh yeah ... it does have a radio tuner.  Oh yeah ... avoiding radio was why I wanted an MP3 player.  What a disappointing purchase.

<Title>A Fair Review
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off I am going to say I am a firm believer if you read somebodys review and they are mentioning one firm to be superior than the othe they are clearly bias in the situation.  I stand true to the fact that if one company makes a better product than the other buy it! Be it Microsoft or Apple or Brooks Brothers for that matter it's better buy it.  I ahve waited exactly one week to write this so I have ample time to experiment with all of the features and benefits of this product.  Remeber this is first gen creation of a new line for Microsoft, and they pulled it off mavelously.  The easy Zune interface lets you sync you Zune effortlessly to your existing library, and from Zune marketplace.  The marketplace is beyond excellent with endless arrays of artists and albums to keep you happy.  Quickly I might add too, I am a student of 18 credits and 40+ hours of work and I already have 3300 songs downloaded.  The Apple counterpart had to lower it's price upon isertion of the Zune into the market.  Either this was the extinction of their price skimming, or the knowledge that the Zune offered way too much for them too compete at a premium price.  Not to mention the Wirless sharing, excellent. Tell me you don't want to send that beautiful girl endless love from across the room(friends listen to endless love in the dark) that is just beyond awesome.  The FM transmitter actually works, my friends ipod sounds horrible, and my other friend had to open his and replace it with copper in order to transmit properly.  Anyone who leaves iPod fanatic review know this, in free market there is always the opportunity for someone to come along and do it bigger and better.  Look at Intel and AMD perfect example.  In summation this product is sheer excellence and I highly suggest it to anyone who loves music or simply wants and MP3 player.  You will not be disappointed.

<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It really looks cheap.  Made from what looks like plastic.  Strange corners.  A big boxy feel.  Feels empty, not a solid, dense feel.  It surely looks better in the pictures; but don't be fooled, in real life it is ugly.  The screen is bigger but the resolution is just 320x240, like your iPod.  So why all the advertisement about the bigger screen?  Is it becuase they couldn't build something sleek and sexy?  The click wheel isn't a wheel at all - it is four buttons: up, down, left, right.  You want to scroll down?  Push and hold the down butten.  Looks like an iPod thumb twirler but actually just buttons.  Parents.  Don't surpise your kids with one of these, they will only be embarrassed.  Disclaimer: I own a new iPod Shuffe 2G.  I checked the Zune out is an electronics store; my 13 y.o. son laughed when he first realized the click wheel was four buttons.

<Content>Well, this is my first mp3 player but i had researched other products extensively and this was presented to me as the "best' out right now and I beg to differ...not greatly differ but it is just an okay item.  The software is undeniably terrible. I mean, what is the use of video capability when they don't offer video support? it converts shows on itunes and if i had known that i would have asked my mom for the ipod.  Secondly, the battery life is short. I can listen to it all day but if i don't put it on the charger THAT NIGHT i am not going to be able to use it the next day. it just seems like i have it on the charger all the time.  The mp3 player, as far as size, design, function is concerned is okay. a good sized screen. it plays music. i got what i paid for. But if ur looking for something reputable don't buy this...not the first generation "ginuea pig" ones anyway

Nice product, not.I owned an IPOD, and let me tell you, the Zune hasn't locked up on me once, which isn't something I can say about the pod.Also, Microsoft doesn't use IPOD like software that will make it a pain in the arse to move files around. Message to the clones. Buying ITUNES content is the worst mistake you can make.

<Title>I LOVE MY ZUNE!
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are a lot of great MP3 players out there and deciding which one is right for you can be tough.  The Zune is obviously most comprable to the iPod, which is well grounded and has a large following and a lot of third party support.  So what does the Zune have over it?  The wifi feature is great, especially if you have an xbox 360.  The FM radio's nice too, and the large beautiful screen.  Plus considering how new it is there is already decent support.  They make all kinds of accessories, cases with or without armbands, car adapters, docking stations, nice speaker systems, and a cable to link it to your TV (however if you have an XBOX 360 you won't need it, you can stream your music/videos through your 360 and even use your Zune as a music device while you're playing games, so no more having to save your music on your hard drive or streaming what your computer is willing to allow!).  As far as syncing with my computer I had no problems, it absorbed ALL of my music quickly and with no snags whatsoever.  I've messed with iPods in the past, and they're really nice, but I'll be sticking with my Zune from now on.

<Title>FOR THOSE OF US JUST NOW CATCHING ONTO THE MP3 CRAZE . . .
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>That's my target audience for this review: People who have never owned an Ipod or any other Mp3 player.  I bought this because I was getting tired of making CD-R's every time I wanted to listen to music in my truck. I wanted my whole music library in one place.  So, here is what I think of my new Zune . . .  PROS: Has a 30GB hard-drive, so unless you own every album in music history you should have no problem having your music library in one place.  The viewing screen is a pleasant size, without making the unit too bulky. I have small hands and I think it fits rather nicely.   In addition to music, you can view videos and pictures. I liked how I was able to take some of my pictures and turn them into a background to "personalize" my Zune.   Perhaps the biggest reason why I got this is because it supports the ".wma" files. If you use Windows Media Player to rip music, then the Zune is clearly worth considering, since you don't have to convert the files to another format.    You can drag and drop your music files for your Zune to "synchronize" and it will automatically detect which songs it can "download" to your Zune and which it can't.  I have owned my Zune since the day it came out and haven't experienced ANY strange problems/bugs/defects.   CONS:  I didn't think the Zune main screen (where you "synchronize" your content) was all that intuitive. I still haven't figured out how playlists work on this thing or how to delete files I don't want.   Speaking of files I don't want, a very small part of your 30GB is already taken up with music from bands I've never heard of (and never care to hear again), pictures of graffiti and pathetic music videos.   The most aggravating thing about the Zune, for me, is that it doesn't preserve the original name format. I label my music like this: BAND NAME IN ALL CAPS Song Name Like This. But when you Synchronize, your Zune might rename your file to "Unknown" or Track 06. Now how on earth are you supposed to find that song?! And your Zune makes a pathetic attempt to label your music by genre.   Ready for a laugh? A battle theme tune from Final Fantasy 6 got labeled "Christian Gangsta Rap" !!!   Also, I've experienced the Zune renaming some of my songs on my LAPTOP hard-drive after synchronizing, which, needless to say, is unacceptable.   OVERALL:   If your primary goal is to have your entire music library (consisting of mostly .wma or .mp3 files) in one place, then the Zune is probably what you're looking for. But if the above doesn't apply to you, then you'd probably be better off with an Ipod. The Zune is powerful, but, like most Microsoft products, far from perfect.

<Title>Great Alternative To Ipod
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this thing. I've been using it for a month or so now, and I can't put it down. All my friends have had ipods for a while, but can't stop talking about how cool the zune is.  The screen is huge and doesn't scrath easily. It's a little thicker than the ipod, but there's really not that big of difference, they're both fairly compact (and most ipod owners buy a case which makes their ipod just as big as the zune, since the ipod is so prone to fingerprints. That saves you 20 bucks right there, not having to buy a case) I also love being able to change the background, and how the interface is set up.  The scrolling buttons are not as nice being able to use a scroll wheel, but it's just as fast/easy. The only difference is you just hold the button down rather than moving your thumb in a circular motion.  Another small (but cool) thing is that the headphones are magnetic and will stick to each other. They're also quite comfortable.  I haven't really had an opportunity to use the send song to a friend feature, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal to me. Cool, sure, but don't buy it just for that.  The one thing that I a little disappointed about was the lack of games and calendars like the ipod has. When it comes down to it though, it's all about the music.  So- If you want something cool, new, and customizable, and don't really have a need for the games and calendar stuff that the ipod has, go with the zune. If you want a player that has a wide variety of features, won't be watching many videos, and you're not bothered that a huge amount of people have the same thing that you'll be getting, go with the ipod.

<Title>2 Zunes "Zuned" out.
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been buying the iPods for years and i dropped my iPods on the ground few times thanks to my butterfingers, the worst thing that has happened is that the Ipod screen cracked but it still worked. So i decided to by a Zune and i dropped it in my room on the carpet while listening to music and that was the last time "i heard that Zune", so i thought that the unit is defective so i exchanged it, the second one worked for about 3 weeks until i was updating the Zune which was on my computer desk, so i reach for my coffee and by accident i move my Zune which falls on the ground, and that was it for that one.  My final word here is do yourself or whoever you're buying this unreliable MP3 player for and buy a iPod, i HIGHLY reccomend a iPod Nano since it has no Hard Drive which means that you can drop the Nano and nothing inside will break since no parts inside are moving, Zune has a VERY cheap Hard Drive which broke on me even thought my 1st Zune fell on carpet from about 5 feet and my 2nd Zune fell 3 feet from my computer desk to the floor.

<Title>Yes, it can in fact play protected Ipod viedo & music!
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those who whine about the new Zune not being capable with playing Ipod Videos & Music need to do some better research. As is true of most generalized players, they intentionally format their videos and music files to be compatible with their own payers, duh, makes sense, why share with everyone, who would buy their songs and videos then?! However, there are plenty programs out there now that can and will flawlessly convert MV4 or other DRM video and mp3's to any compatible format for what ever player you own...including the Zune, and yes, it is all 100% legal if used for your own enjoyment, not to sell around. The best converter for this on the web, in my opinion, is TUNE Bite's Platinum converting program. It cost about $35 but you will ALWAYS be able to convert Itune M4V videos into WMV format to play on your ZUNE. I have done it, and you know what...it's WAY better looking than watching it on the Ipod, because the ZUNE has a bigger wide screen! This program works as well for formatting ANY protected MP3 format too. This program also works vise versa for converting WMV into M4V if you want to convert to watch on your Ipod...but please, don't knock a player by saying it "doesn't" play Ipod this or Ipod that, it does, you just need to know where to go and how to do it! I give the ZUNE 5 stars, regardless of what some people think, it's not as limited as perceived. In fact, once you get past the Video conversion thing, it has way more features than the Ipod, I know, cause I owned one...

<Title>Love it or hate it...
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, to the guy who claimed to have "dropped" his Zune twice from a "short" distance and on soft "carpet" only for it to succumb to the demise of permanent damage must be working for iPod. I got a Zune to replace my standard (fourth generation monochrome) iPod and I had dropped mine once on my Pergo flooring (it was a scary moment, I'll admit!) and watched it slide a few feet before picking it up (fearing the worst) only to find that...well...that it still worked just fine! In fact, that was a week and a half ago and it's still doing great (made no something-just-broke-loose-in-there sound when I shook it so it's all good!)!  The upsides to the Zune are definitely the larger screen, which is VERY bright (we all know iPod will jump on this bandwagon as well in the not too distant future...yer all copy cats!) the sound is far better than that of my iPod, even though the Zune has limited EQ settings, all presets, no biggie. The radio is a cool feature and works great in most places. The scroll pad, if that's what you can call it, works a tad differently from that of the click wheel on an iPod, but that took like two seconds to get used too and it actually scrolls more accurately than the iPod (that click wheel can be annoying sometimes, admit it people!). The size and weight of it are no big deal for my larger hands; in fact, I like weight a lot better, feels substantial and durable!  Okay, biggest downfall of the Zune are the typical for a sophomore media player...The software! A complete nightmare at times, and occasionally, simply doesn't want to work period! I have found that starting up the software before plugging in the Zune seems to work a lot better than the other way around. The software has trouble locating the player or vise versa when you plug the player in first and then load the software. Some other shortcomings, but nothing to really cry about too much are - The very short life of the battery even when fully charged. I watched two Family Guy shows on it (came out very nice on that big LCD screen!) and that used almost an entire charge of the fully charged battery. With that bright backlight and larger screen to run, I guess it would, but it can be annoying at times. The Wireless control, like everyone else has said, it pretty pointless. They probably could have made the unit a tiny bit smaller without that piece of useless hardware in there. All in all the Zune is a welcome breath of fresh air from the typical clichof the MP3/media world that is iPod. I have no doubt future Zunes will be far better and who knows, might someday turn the iPoder's around for a second look. I say it's worth it! Not bad for a first generation (keep in mind, that's what it is)  ...please do something about that ZUNE software MS! :-0

<Title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Zune
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I own a Zune.  Yes.  Imagine that.  Someone reviewing a product that they actually own.    Have I owned an iPod?  No.  Have I used one?  Yes.  On many occassions. So, I will admit, I don't have as much experience with the iPod as I do the Zune.  I had a Rio Carbon before the Zune.  It just so happened to stop charging a few days after the Zunes came out.  I was really debating on which one to go for as a replacement.    To be honest, they are both about the same.  Regardless of what you may have read, the differences aren't really that big.  I'll try to go over my observations here:  Size:  A lot has been made of the size differences.  By reading some peoples reviews, you'd think the Zune were the size of a brick and weighed as much as a car battery.  I feel sorry for those who can't handle carrying an extra .8 ounces and are shocked that it is .3 inches bigger in height and .13 inches bigger in depth.  The size differences are miniscule.  Sound quality:  Isn't this what MP3 players are all about?  Well, I can't tell any difference in sound quality between the two.  So, that wasn't a decision decider for me.  Durability:  Zune wins this one hands down.  The iPods I've used of some co-workers look like they have been to Iraq and back.  Several times.  The Zune actually seems to be pretty good at resisting scratches and any fingerprints on the case actually disappear right before your eyes.    Video:  Here is another thing people really slam on the Zune.  A lot of people say, "Yeah, the Zunes screen is 3 inches compared to iPod's 2.5 inches, but they both are at the same resolution."  So what?  First off, I use the video portion when I'm on an airplane.  Lets me not have to drag out my laptop during trips and the video quality is great (depending on how much you compress the video).  I never thought half an inch would make that much of a difference to me when watching movies, but it does.  It feels like going from watching a 13 inch to at least a 21 inch tv.  The resolution doesn't really effect how well the video looks at this size.  But the larger screen does.  Zuen wins this one easily.  Accessories:  iPod wins this one, no problem.  But of course it would.  It has been out a lot longer than Zune, but I have to say, the Zune accessories are coming out pretty quick.  When I bought mine a few weeks ago, all I saw were the official accessories.  Now, I'm seeing a lot of companies releasing cases, chargers, etc.  So, it's only a matter of time before these two are comparable.  Software:  I hate both to be honest.  iTunes is a massive resource hog.  When I open it, my computer slows down dramatically.  Zunes software doesn't seem to do this that often, but it has it's own problems.  Both irritate the hell out of me by placing restrictions on the music you buy (yes, I've bought with both).  I understand why they do this, but it still doesn't mean I like it.  iTunes seems a bit more stable then the Zune Marketplace, but not by much.  And people have protested the fact that you can't use iTunes music on the Zune and vice versa.  Not a big deal if you know how to get around it (which I do).  So, the few songs I have from iTunes are playing just fine on my Zune.  And another common gripe with Zune is, it has fewer songs available than iTunes.  Again, not a big deal.  They will both even out eventually and I'd have to say that about 95% of the songs I've looked for are available for Zune.  So, maybe I can't get Yanni's Greatest Hits (just kidding), but I can live with that.  Wi-Fi:  iPod doesn't have it, and Zune does.  So, Zune wins, regardless of what you think of the 3days/3plays rule.  While it isn't a huge decider in buying it, it does have future potential.  And some are saying the 3/3 rule is applied to pictures as well.  Not true.  You can't transfer movies yet, but I expect either Microsoft will change that in the future or some wise Zune owner will.  Just a matter of time.  Podcast:  3rd party software allows for easy podcasting, so this isn't an issue anymore.  Battery life:  about the same  FM radio:  Again, iPod doesn't have it, and Zune does.  While I don't use this feature that much, it is good.  My Zune gets better reception than my stereo in my SUV does.  Not a big deal, but nice to have.  Customization:  Zune is the champ here.  Nice feature allowing you to use your own custom background image, but again, not a major decider.  Click wheel:  This seems to be a big deal for a lot of iPod owners.  I could care less.  The click wheel shaped buttons on the Zune are just as easy to use.  Want to scroll through your albums?  Just press and hold the down button.  That wasn't too hard.   So, with that, I chose the Zune.  To put it bluntly, it has everything iPod has and a little extra.  While the little extra isn't dramatic (yet), it is still extra.  So, if I couldn't see paying the same price for something else that didn't offer anything I couldn't get with the Zune.  iPod killer?  No.  Healthy competition?  Yes.  And that is good for us, the consumers.  All I can recommend is doing what I did.  Go into the store with an open mind.  Try them both out.  Pick the one that you like most.  Don't let the Apple lovers and Microsoft haters decide for you. Same goes for the Apple haters and Microsoft lovers (are there any of those?).    I hope my experience has helped someone out there, but don't rely on my review either.  Decide for yourself. If you have any questions, feel free to post them in the comments on my review.  I'll try to answer them as soon as I can.

<Title>Review by Actual Zune and IPod owner
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a 5th generation iPod and bought a Zune last week. Why? Primarily because I am a gadget-freak and I like the idea of a bigger screen and WiFi sharing of songs.  The Zune comes in a very nice package and with clear installation instructions. I didn't run into any problems on Windows XP SP2 so I cannot comment on some of the problems other people have encountered.   After using it for a week this is how the Zune stacks up against the iPod:   iPod has the advantage in:  -Size: Zune is slightly longer and thicker than the iPod but it's not that noticable. Slight advantage for iPod.  -Software: Zune software is nice and works but iPod's software is more straightforward and easier to use. Yes, even my iPod software occasionally crashes but overall I like it better.  -Applications & Games: no games and apps on Zune yet, some nice apps on the iPod but the games on iPod are pathetic. That's what my Nintendo DS is for.  -Many more accessories! It took me a while to find a nice case for the Zune but I assume this will get better over time. Still iPod rules the accessory market.  -External USB Device: I can use my iPod as a giant "memory stick", the Zune has this function disabled - although there is way to enable that (do a Google search).   Zune and iPod are even:  -Battery Life: Zune (WiFi turned off) and iPod are about the same, 13 1/2 to 14 hours with screen off.  -Interface: I liked Zune's menu structure much better than iPod's but I miss the iPod's great click-wheel. Also interface responds quicker on the Zune.  -Sound Quality: listening to music with my Sony headphones I could not hear any difference in sound quality.  -Headphones: the included headphones with the iPod and the Zune are equally crappy. The first accessory you buy should be new headphones.   Zune has the advantage in:  -Screen: ZUNE WINS by a huge margin, screen is bigger and brighter, absolutely stunning!  -Materials: iPod's sensitive chrome shell always bugged me and the screen on my iPod is horribly scratched despite a protective case, Zune's black/blue shell looks very nice and it seems to be impervious to finger prints, Zune's screen seems much more scratch resistent too.  -Video: Forget the iPod! I converted some DVDs to WM9 and watched them on my Zune, it's a delight! The screen, the landscape mode, the brightness - wonderful. On a high quality setting I was able to fit around 60h of video onto the Zune.  -Pictures: again thanks to the screen the Zune beats the iPod. Finally I can show off some baby pictures without people squinting.  -WiFi: yeah, I like it. Granted the 3-day/3-play limitation is annoying but I have received a few cool songs so far. Problem is: there aren't too many Zune owners yet.  -Radio: HUGE advantage for the Zune. I am at the gym, watching TV and tuning in to the sounds on my Zune. Why Apple hasn't included this yet in the iPod is beyond me.  -Song purchase: I love the option of the "all you can eat" for $15/month. Granted most of my music is ripped from CDs but $15 per month for all the music I want is pretty compelling.   OVERALL VERDICT: I love my iPod, I LOVE MY ZUNE EVEN MORE. If Microsoft can write some applications and games and improve the Zune PC software they'll have a perfect consumer device.   To be fair: if you already have an iPod and have no need for radio and better video capabilities then there is no need to upgrade to a Zune. If you want better video, like the idea of radio and WiFi then the Zune is the way to go. If you are in the market for a new MP3 player in the $250 price range the Zune should be on the top of your shopping research list.   Most important: ignore all the fanboy garbage of "Microsoft is evil" and "Apple sucks" and stick with the facts. Reading some of the very loud "reviews" below I can only wonder how many of these writers actually own any of these devices.

<Title>The Zune
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is a great MP3 player.  My beloved Creative Zen Xtra of 1.75 yrs was starting to die, so I was in the market for a new MP3 Player.  I was leaning towards another Creative player, until I found out the Zune would integrate with Xbox Live Marketplace Points. After seeing the menus and UI on cnet, I was sold and bought a Zune on launch day.  I love it, though I do miss my Creative sound filters.    Pros: + Best UI of any mp3 player on the market, way ahead of Creative and Ipod.  This is what sold me. + Uses buttons, No thumb scroll wheel.  Ya think Apple must have invented the thumb or something.  The Zune has a surperior selection button, and unless you have a wierd thing about using your thumb in a circular motion, you will not miss the Ipod here. + Lots of expansion potential with the 360, Vistas, and XP PCs.   + Looks better than the Ipod.  The Ipod looks tacky, despite what the social snobs say, plus the Nanos are WAY over priced for their capacity. + Sounds quality is better than the Ipod, and is basically on par with a Creative player. + Your Zune account links to the Windows Live Id (which means your Xbox Live account name is also your Zune account name). + Xbox Live Marketplace points can be used to buy songs.  This works really well, seeing as I never use my live points on anything.  I bought Gear of War at bestbuy and recieved a 1600 Live point card for free.  All of those points are going to be used for songs, and at 79 points a song, I can get 20 songs.  Next time a game I want has a market place point card as a freebie, I will be buying it. + Good picture and movie quality, better than Ipod's. Cons: - Zune software has a tendency to lag, even on the PC I built, which runs Battlefield 2142, Battlefield 2, and Guild Wars on high settings with no issues.  It is also not PlayforSure.  This is the only real con, IMO, and keeps it from being 5 stars in my book. - Creative has awesome sound filters, Zune does not.  - Quicktime files play as audio only, no big loss unless you downloaded a good portion of Red vs Blue in Quicktime format.  Ultimately, the choice is yours.  If you have an Ipod, you should stick with it if you have Itunes songs.  If not, just buy your music in cd form from a store and put them on your player. You have nothing to lose going with the Zune or Creative.  The belkin acrylic case and screen guard is a must have if you buy a Zune.  Not only do they protect your player, they look awesome to.  The media dubbed the Zune the 'Ipod Killer,' not Microsoft.  But, who knows, in a few generations, the Zune might hot on Ipod's heels.  Don't listen to the Microsoft and Xbox haters who are browsing from their Mac.

<Content>I bought a Zune on launch day and have been enjoying it ever since.  If you can look past the anti-Microsoft/pro-Apple sentiment you'll find a tidy player that does what it was designed for well: namely playing music and video.  The controls are intuitive, the screen is very crisp and navigation is easy.  I had zero troubles installing the software on a varity of computers.  It's much more scratch resistant than the iPod with it's matte finish.  If there are any downsides it would be software, with a few missing features here and there but I'm sure updates will be available soon.  The hardware portion is rock solid and I've been very pleased with my purchase.

<Content>Tengo un amigo que comprel Zune, que a decir verdad por sus caracter�sticas se oye novedoso y llama la atenci�n....  ...Pero tiene una gran desventaja. Aun con todas las bondades que tenga el aparatito este, si no le puedes a�adir m�sica y todo lo dem�s, pues no vale mucho la pena y ese es el problema que tiene mi amigo y por lo que he investigado mas gente que a comentado lo mismo en sus blogs y en foros por todo internet.  El problema es que el software no se puede instalar en algunos casos y sin el no se puede sincronizar el Zune por lo que no se puede utilizar. Y no existe una soluci�n sencilla que hayamos encontrado hasta la fecha para este problema (ni oficial de Microsoft ni extraoficial por otra fuente)  Digo, si el iPod tuviera este problema no creo que se hubieran vendido los millones que se han vendido hasta hoy; aqui se ve que lo primordial para el �xito que ha tenido el iPod y mas recientmente Apple en general es la sencillez de su uso que ofrece y el que sea libre de problemas... "It just works"  Aun y con estos puntos negativos, lo que si se es que el Zune es un producto que promete y la idea de compartir m�sica, fotos, etc es algo innovador para mi punto de vista. Creo que es la competencia que le hac�a falta al iPod para que mejore aun mas.  -----  A friend of mine bought a Zune, wich telling the truth has appeling features and turns attention to it...  ... But it has a great inconvenient. Even with all pros this little gadget has, if you can't add your music and everything else, it doesn't has much use and that is the trouble my friend has and looking on what i have on blogs and all over the internet it is a common problem for more people.  The software cannot be installed in some cases and without software you can't sync the Zune at all and it is practically useless. And there is no simple way to get it work properly so far (nor Microsoft's official nor other source)  I mean, if iPod had these issues i don't think it would sell the millions units it has so far; it is clear the success of iPod and Apple in general its their simplicity of use and its trouble-free use... "It just works"  Even with its cons, the Zune promises and the idea of sharing music, photos, etc it's innovative in my point of view. I think it's the competence that iPod needed to be even better.

<Title>Zune is a dreadful product
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first non-five star review on Amazon. I've never before posted a negative review here. That is not to say that I have not come across some awful products and poorly written books because I have. In the past, I have simply chosen to only post the positive review - I assume you are looking for a recommendation to buy a good product and not for a bad one!  This review is an exception. My experience with Zune was so dreadful that I think it is necessary to share this with others. Good news is that blogger Andy Ihnatko have already done this for me:  "Yes, Microsoft's new Zune digital music player is just plain dreadful. I've spent a week setting this thing up and using it, and the overall experience is about as pleasant as having an airbag deploy in your face.   "Avoid," is my general message. The Zune is a square wheel, a product that's so absurd and so obviously immune to success that it evokes something akin to a sense of pity.   The setup process stands among the very worst experiences I've ever had with digital music players. The installer app failed, and an hour into the ordeal, I found myself asking my office goldfish, "Has it really come to this? Am I really about to manually create and install a .dll file?"  But there it was, right on the Zune's tech support page. Is this really what parents want to be doing at 4 a.m. on Christmas morning?  The new Zune portable media player represents Microsoft Corp.'s effort to compete against Apple's iPod will include wireless technology to let people share their favorite songs, playlists or pictures with other Zune users.   That might not be Zune's fault. After about a year of operation, it's almost as if a Windows machine develops some sort of antibodies that prevent it from recognizing new hardware. But what's Microsoft's excuse for everything else?   Only the Zune software can sync music, video and pictures onto the device; Zune is incompatible with Windows Media Player, the familiar hub of the Windows desktop media experience.   The Zune app doesn't even have as many features as WMP. And why (for the love of God) doesn't it support podcasts? That's pure insanity.   It's incompatible with Microsoft's own PlaysForSure standard, too.   You'll have to buy all-new content from the new Zune Marketplace.   Oh, and the Zune Marketplace doesn't even take real money, proving that on the Zune Planet there's no operation so simple that it can't be turned into a confusing ordeal. The Marketplace only accepts Zune Points, with an individual track typically costing the equivalent of the iTunes-standard 99 cents.   By forcing users to buy blocks of Zune Points (with a $5 minimum), the Marketplace only has to pay one credit-card processing fee.   Zune Points will also make it easier for the Zune Marketplace to institute variable pricing. The music industry wants it desperately. The industry has been pressuring Apple to abandon its flat 99 cent pricing and start charging more for "hot" tracks.   Apple has stood firm against this, insisting that low, uniform prices keep sales high and discourage the iTunes Store's users from downloading music illegally.   I'm certain Microsoft will cave on this one. It has already given the music industry the other thing the industry has been demanding from Apple: a kickback on every player sold.   "These devices are just repositories for stolen music, and they all know it," said Doug Morris, CEO of Universal Music Group. "So it's time to get paid for it."  Well, Morris is just a big, clueless idiot, of course. Do you honestly want morons like him to have power over your music player?   Then go ahead and buy a Zune. You'll find that the Zune Planet orbits the music industry's Bizarro World, where users aren't allowed to do anything that isn't in the industry's direct interests.   Take the Zune's one unique and potentially ginchy feature: Wi-Fi. You see this printed on the box and you immediately think "Cool. So I can sync files from my desktop library without having to plug in a USB cable, right? Maybe even download new content directly to the device from the Internet?"   Typical, selfish user: How does your convenience help make money for Universal? No wonder Doug despises you.   No, the Zune's sole wireless feature is "squirting" -- I know, I know, it's Microsoft's term, not mine -- music and pictures to any other Zune device within direct Wi-Fi range. Even if the track is inherently free (like a podcast) the Zune wraps it in a DRM scheme that causes the track to self-destruct after three days or three plays, whichever comes first.   After that, it's nothing more than a bookmark for purchasing the track in the Zune Marketplace. It amounts to nothing more than free advertising.   The Zune is a complete, humiliating failure. Toshiba's Gigabeat player, for example, is far more versatile, it has none of the Zune's limitations, and Amazon sells the 30-gig model for 40 bucks less.   Throw in the Zune's tail-wagging relationship with music publishers, and it almost becomes important that you encourage people not to buy one.   The iPod owns 85 percent of the market because it deserves to. Apple consistently makes decisions that benefit the company, the users and the media publishers -- and they continue to innovatively expand the device's capabilities without sacrificing its simplicity.   Companies such as Toshiba and Sandisk (with its wonderful Nano-like Sansa e200 series) compete effectively with the iPod by asking themselves, "What are the things that users want and Apple refuses to provide?"   Microsoft's colossal blunder was to knock the user out of that question and put the music industry in its place.   Result: The Zune will be dead and gone within six months. Good riddance".

<Title>Love it in places.  Hate it in places.  Im placing alot of trust in Microsoft.
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok heres the story.  I purchased a Zune.  My wife has an Ipod.  Ive seen both.  Here's the total lowdown.  The Zune is made of plastic.  No it's not as pretty as an Ipod, then again looking at a 2 year old Ipod with scratches I think it will hold up better. The screen is bigger than Ipods.  Same resolution... yea.  A 20" tv has the same resolution as a 32" tv.  Get the picture?  No movies or Tv shows on the Zune Marketplace yet.  MS is supposed to be getting this feature up soon.  As of now I am using my Tivo to put things on the Zune.  It works ok.  Has to convert the files though and that takes some time.  So far to me the wifi is useless.  Im putting alot of faith in Microsoft to upgrade the features (and quickly) when it comes to Zune and its wifi.  Im a Zune user.  Im a PC owner.  If they drop the ball on my $250 Zune investment with them, I will be an Ipod user and a Mac owner. The software on the Zune is nice but still needs work.  I like the look and navagation of the Zune, however scrolling through large libraries of music quickly it stalls and can be annoying sometimes (Note I have over 2000 songs on it as of now).  I havent seen this on my wife's Ipod.  The scrolling features on the Ipod are smooth without jerkiness.  I expect MS to work out the bugs in this as well.  Also Ive seen my Zune randomly decide to shut itself off.  Another software bug they need to work out quickly.  So heres the sweeter stuff on the Zune and the only reasons I still havent returned it.  My music library of over 2000 songs, I built it in 3 days.  I am a subscriber to the Zune Marketplace.  14.99 a month and I download all I can squeeze onto the machine (sone 7500 songs).  You will hear that you dont 'own' the music, and thats true.  You can only use it on the Zune and your PC.  You cannot steal it and send it to 1000 people.  The music is only leased to you for as long as you are a subscriber.  Good news here though.  If you transfer a song to someone else's Zune, they can tag it and, if they are a subscriber, download it for free for theirself.  Kinda Cool.  I like versatility.  It doesnt hurt my feelings that the music isn't "mine" as long as I can listen whenever, wherever, and for as long as I want.  Love the FM Tuner.  I can listen to any radio station and (assuming they have the right technology) get song names and artist info, for downloading later.  I am hoping that MS will put in the ability to tag songs for download from radio stations.  I hear you can exchange stuff with the Xbox 360.  I dont own one so I dont know.  Sounds ok I guess. :shrug:  Bottom line, MS has work to do on their Zune.  Its mainly on the software as the hardware seems to be good.  Ill stick it out for now as I like what Ive got so far.  Looking forward to the upgrades to come.

<Title>Not a Microsoft employee... Just an experienced buyer!
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, I just wanted to tell all of you that I'm not working for any companies or corporations.  I owe mp3/video players from Creative, Apple, iRiver, and Microsoft.  I bought a Zune a few days ago.  I also have a 5th generation Ipod.  I have a Creative Zen Vision M.  I love the Zune the most.  If you know how to use an ipod, and if you have common sense, this product is for you.  I read the reviews everyone wrote for this product, and I'm sure that these people are just M$oft bashers.  I have plenty of friends who blame everything on Microsoft, corporations, and oil companies for all their miseries.  I have to say that I have an ipod, and I think it's made for simpletons and people who like to do the fad.  Ipods are toys for idiots who would buy something, because of a famous personality being it's spokeperson or the commercials on TV.  Something people buy, because everyone else has one.  The a latest ipod costs $250 to 300 and you are lucky if you get it for cheaper.  It can't do anything right.  The ipod freezes way too often and the video is horrible.  The 5th ipod doesn't seem to be made for playing long videos, even though it has the nickname ipod video.  You have to wait a few seconds for the video to load and start playing.  And I believe that buying music online is a bunch of bull sht.  If you uninstall your music program, you loose all the music you downloaded, because of all those copywright crap, like DRM, they put in with the music files.  I would just buy the cd for like $10 from circuit city and convert it to MP3 or WMA.  Ipod doesn't support all the many types of Audio or video files that the Zune can handle.  The Zune also has a better brighter screen with more resolution and colors.  Put it side by side with an ipod and compare the difference for yourself.  The audio is way better on a Zune.  Don't download videos from iTunes or anything like that.  Only idiots pay to download videos.  Instead rip the videos, or download it from some other source.  Then don't use the programs like Zune marketplace or iTunes.  You shouldn't have to install any software to add music and videos to your player.  And for those who think that this toy looks ugly, why don't you shove your ipods, because this comes with a low maintainence package.  My ipod was full of scratches the first day I opened it out of the package.  I bought an ipod using apple, and I had to buy better headphones, a 3rd party cases, and other stuff.  I just got sick of it, so I gave it away to my little brother.  Now he even complaints about it.  The ipod is a fad, so get over it.  Some people think that podcasts can only be done with an ipod.  You people are getting ripped off for your money.  I want a media player that can play all my music files, including WMAs.  I want one that can play my DVD rips without freezing or slow starts.  I want something that is different from what everyone else has.  I like to listen to live radio broadcasts sometimes, so I need an FM tuner.  I need something that will support Microsoft vista fully in the future.  Do some real research before you talk about or buy a product.  Read unbiased reviews, not the opinions of people who don't even own a Zune.  Shop smart for yourself!  If you are really serious about learning more about the zune and the ipod, you must visit www dot zunescene dot com to learn more about it.  The Zune is basically an upgraded ipod.  It's faster, more customizable, but more for the geeks and .

<Title>The Ultimate in MP3 Players and perfect travel companion
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been a Zune owner for one full week and must say that this device is very cool. It is the ultimate travel companion. I have owned other MP3 players but have not used them quite as often as this one.  I can listen to music in my car using the FM transceiver.  It is now integrated into my home theater system via the A/V kit, and can share music and video with my Xbox 360 and Windows Media Center PC. Total home entertainment integration that was very easy to set up.  The Zune Marketplace is very easy to use, and if you were a Napster user before you will find the all you can eat subscription very familiar. If you are like me you download current chart toppers and listen to it for a few days and then get updated content. It is much cheaper that buying albums just to listen to a few songs on it. If you find music you like simple purchase it.   What's really cool about this device is the music sharing. It allows me to receive music from other Zune users who may have different musicale taste from me. I can listen to the shared music for three plays or three days. If I like the music I can download it from the marketplace using the monthly subscription or purchase it. For you Xbox gamers out there, you can use the same tag for both subscriptions  and share points between the two marketplaces (Xbox and Zune).  It is the must have MP3 player.

<Title>Much better than the iPod...  Just wish that it held more than 30GB!
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Microsoft Zune is being attacked by loyal iPod / Apple customers on here, who should have just stuck with their iPod.  The Microsoft Zune is fantastic.  The screen is awesome, the sound is far superior to the sound on an iPod (and isn't that what it's all about anyway)?  It's still new, and Microsoft will improve with future ZUNE units.  I'm sure they are working on units like the Nano, etc.    I definitely give the Zune 5 stars, and would recommend it to anyone - unconditionally.  I think it's funny how everyone who likes to complain about it says the same things (it sounds like they all got together and are trying to really ruin ZUNE).  If you are trying to decide, I have both an iPod and Zune, and use the Zune ALL the time now - much more than the iPod.

<Title>Not Recommended - A first attempt
<Date>Tue Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had an opportunity to own a variety of these devices, including iPod's and a couple of the others.I tried to forget about all the good and bad press about this and try to use the product with a fresh start.  As I used the Zune I thought this looks like a pretty well made product (apparently made by Toshiba, a good company) that has a couple of intriguing features.  Indeed, the screen is larger, and that does count for visual media, but in a world of fast changing technology, it seems highly likely that the iPod will probably have a similar, or better screen in short order. A 1/2" difference doesn't make for a compelling purchase decision in such a fast changing world.  The sharing idea (or "squirt" as Microsoft calls it) looks pretty good on paper, but in real life I found it to be a novelty at best. You have to put the WiFi on (which kills the battery life), and the other person has to have the same. Once you get that worked out, then you can share for 3 plays/3 days - that part is fine. I found myself spending time trying to get it to work, getting more than my share of errors, and pretty much forgetting about it after a couple of days. It's just not the technology that's solely at fault here, the process doesn't work well between people.  It's a very good music player, and with good headphones the tracks sound as good if not slightly better than the iTunes version. That probably makes sense, since the default is 192K for the Zune, and 128K for the iPod. Again, this was really splitting hairs and hard to hear in real life situations at best. It's a rough estimate, but I did notice that Zune seems to use up more available space for the same song, which would make sense based on the different bit rates. So, that's a tradeoff you'll have to really think about. Personally, 30 GB is big by my standards, and holds a lot of music.....so either will probably serve most anyone's needs.  Now the part I don't like about the music section. You can't use any, no ANY of your previously purchased "Plays for Sure" content without some real steps. Doesn't matter who made your device, or how you got it, it doesn't work. YOU ARE SCREWED. If you have current ITunes content, you will not be adding it either. Throw it away... Now that is just plain ridiculous! Who in their right mind in Redmond decided to orphan all of their customers own previous music purchases? The lack of iTunes support I can understand, but do I risk buying Zune content only to find out they abandon it in a year? Not to mention the fact that they've stranded all their previous business partners, which includes some pretty heavy hitters, like Creative. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Parents beware of buying something like this....  If you want to use this in your car, and you own a recently purchased model, or will be buying a new car or stereo soon, it seems silly to buy something that doesn't include factory integration in the design. I have not heard of a single car manufacturer announcing support for Zune, but many already have it for the iPod. Hands down that's abig plus for the iPod. That industry doesn't make fast commitments, so you are years out at best before you see a similar trend. Unless Microsoft can sell millions of these in the next year or so, count it out for the future. I'm sure the car manufacturers are also waiting to see how big a sales success Zune really is before making any new interfaces. Smart move.  Having said all that, I really can't imagine why you would buy a Zune over an iPod or (even another player) other than novelty at this point. My advice - wait a year or so, if it survives, the next generation of software and hardware will be much better. In the meantime, if you don't need video, or a lot of storage, get an iPod Nano, or one of the Creative players to use and save your money for the future. If you need the hard disk quantity of storage, or video and don't like the iPod, try out the Toshiba version of the Zune. At least your content will play there.....  Looking at the buying rankings on Amazon today, it looks like people have already figured that out.

<Title>Excellent for my circumstances
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is overall an excellent mp3/video player.  The material of the case is virtually fingerprint and scratch proof.  Although it weighs more than the Ipod, when comparing it with one in one hand one in the other, both my friend and I agreed that the Zune felt lighter, probably because it is alot lighter for its size.  The interaface is excellent and helps minimize time.  The controls are minimal and easy to get used to.  The screen resolution is very good.  The Zune software is very similair to WMP 11, but i prefer the look of WMP and wish that I didnt have to waste more hard drive space on more software.  Syncing is very fast  and works fairly well, however once in a while  I get a message that the Zune is slow or not responding.  The file type issue for videos is a bit annoying since it doesn't support avi files, but neither does the ipod.  The  drm issue could be a good reason not to get the zune, but if all your music is from cds,p2p or torrents, there is no problem.  I have not met anyone else with a zune so therefore i have not tried out the wifi.  There is currently a hack to get around the 3 day thing, but it is not worth it and i expect better ones to come out.  Luckily, I can be optimistic because I expect the firmware to change a lot along with the features that use wifi.

<Title>Gives Record Companies What They Want, Not Consumers
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune software is a nightmare to set up. Once I did, I found out that the Zune does not play all the music I had purchased from online music stores that use Microsoft's own "Plays for Sure" DRM. Why would Microsoft abadon thier own encryption? If they think I'm going to re-buy music from their own store, they're nuts! (I won't even get into Microsoft's stupid point system for buying music)  Even my own mp3's, from CD's I own, also had to be re-encoded and that took for ever. I figured that I would just use the Windows Media Player instead of this lousy Zune software, but guess what! That won't sync to the Zune either.  Didn't Microsoft see what happend to Sony's "Connect" software. If you have not heard of "Sony Connect", that's because they tried to do exactly what Microsoft is doing with the Zune, and nobody used it.  The wireless feature is a joke. If you can find someone to send a song to, they can only listen to it 3 times or 3 days, whichever comes first. How is this a feature? Wireless would have been a good idea if you could actually "share" your music with someone else. More proof that Microsoft does what the record companies want them to do. Wireless also drains the battery in a hurry. Even with the wireless off, the battery life stinks.   Another fact I found out, was that Microsoft gives record companies money for every Zune sold, because THEY KNOW all the music on MP3 players are stolen. What about MP3 CD's that are played on CD players? I don't know about you, but I'm not going to support a company that wants to open the flood gates, and pay record and movie companies just because a device can play content the way I want to. This would mean every DVD, CD, VHS, and Tivo players sold would have to give money to the record and movie companies, because THEY KNOW all of these products have stolen content on them.  If Microsoft had decent software (which may be fixed eventually) and I could use the music I already own on this player, and Microsoft wasn't supporting companies that label me as a thief, I may have considered keeping this thing, but I need something that plays music, not something that annoys the heck out of me. I'll have to try something else. What a waste of time.

<Title>Final review
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third review of the Zune. At first I gave the Zune four stars, but then posted a new review with two stars. Most of my dissatisfaction with the Zune came from the early version of the software, which has been much improved with the 1.2 update.   Things I still don't like:   1.	The 30 gig drive is too small. 2.	The WI-FI has so much potential, and is so underused. If you own a PSP, you know what I mean. I can surf the web with my PSP, and play with other PSP owners, as well as listening to RSS. Using the Zune to get on the web, stream RSS, and stream files from a server is a must for the Zune to make it in the market. The Zune could also be used as a remote for products like the Soundbridge. You could see album info and covers on your Zune while playing through the Soundbridge. I believe this could all be done with firmware updates (or most of it anyway). 3.	Does not support 16X9 video, and many video formats.  4.	Restricted to Zune Marketplace-I am becoming more adjusted to this, see below.  Things I like:  1.	I love the look of the Zune. It also feels solid. My Zune has done a great deal of traveling, and seems very sturdy.  2.	The sound is very good. I used a HI-MD player from Sony for years, and I find the sound of the Zune to be a little better, even though I use small files. 3.	The 1.2 update seems very stable. We all still want some updates to utilize the WI-FI (as mentioned above). I believe MS is already late on this, and it is a must for them to do this, with THIS version of the machine (I will not buy a new Zune just to get some features that should be available on the one a purchased). 4.	Most of the accessories seem good. I like the travel pack. The premium headphones are very good. Give them a chance, and you will like them. (The FM transmitter, which is not in the travel pack, is NOT very good. Use another brand, or use a cassette unit.)  5.	The Zune sounds very good with a headphone amp and good headphones ($149 Headroom amp and Grado 60's work really well-but this does double the price of the hardware). 6.	The Zune should be viewed a total experience. MS clearly wanted to make it a brand, and not a single machine. The best thing about owning a Zune is the marketplace monthly subscription. You can download songs from the Marketplace onto the Zune, and stream them with a Soundbridge or other such device. You cannot burn them onto CD, and you will lose the rights to the music if you drop your subscription. But having access to this much music is wonderful.  Because I now see the Zune as a brand and not a single device, I would give the entire experience four stars, if one uses the Marketplace. I believe the Zune brand will be very successful (if MS properly supports the first machine to provide a loyal following).  PS. I have read reviews of Zunes overheating and having cracked screens because of a battery issues. I have charged mine for over 24 hours with no problems, but I do not discount the problems others have had.   Zune users and Ipod users should view these two machines as providing competition for each other-this can only help make every MP3 player better and cheaper. I am surprised at the two "camps" fighting it out, and wonder where this all starts.

<Title>Lousy, clunky, useless
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, who needs simple mp3 playing anymore? At 5 years after iPod's introduction, what people truly wants is a MULTIMEDIA player and there Zunes fails short: it plays only M$'s own wm and a bastard type of mpeg4 of its own creation when most people now rips DVDs using the .avi format either in DivX or Xvid. What we need is a player that allows the user to load the latest codecs into it to play any kind of media format he prefers. Zune, instead, puts the user in a straightjacket imposing what Microsoft wants him to play. And what M$ allows you to play is movies with no compression which take over 2Gb space when any DivX takes only 700Mbs. On top of that--even in this day when most TVs support letterbox, Zune forces you to view them in the standard 4:3 ratio, distorting the images. I'm selling mine on eBay and getting something else.

<Title>Fine by me
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player ever. I must say that I had no problem loading the software, and I was able to figure out how to sync and delete within minutes of loading it. I read lots of reviews saying the software was hard to use and froze a lot. This has never happened to me. any new music I add is automaticaly transferred to zune and syncs with the player in seconds of plugging it in. The only thing I am still trying to figure out is putting movies onto it. I can put short clips from the internet that are in windows media player format, but have yet to get anything else. But like anything I will do my research and hope to figure it out soon. This product is not as bad as people say it is.

<Title>Zune is awful--get an iPod
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Everything you read about this being bad is true.  zune is garbage.  Just save yourself the time and agony and get an iPod instead.  Although the Zune screen is bigger, the resolution is the same as an iPod so the picture actually looks worse than the iPod.  The music interface is clunky and hard to use and it's just physically big and ugly.  The wifi feature is so bad its useless and only works with other zunes.

<Title>Zune is a great MP3 player!  Buy it and give it your own review.  I think you will agree!
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Dec. 20 - I spent some more time today physically comparing features of the Ipod, Creative Zen, SanDisk, and Zune.  I stress to anyone considering an MP3 player purchase, go and try the Zune out at a store.  Don't let the Ipod click wheel hypnotize you into thinking it is the best way to control an MP3 player user interface.    I actually prefer the Zune rocker over the click wheel because it is easier to control the movement while scrolling and you don't have to spin your finger in circles to scroll. The Zune rocker dial is different and will initially feel awkward if you move from an Ipod to a Zune but don't give up on the Zune.    Try out the user interface and compare it to any of the other MP3 players I mentioned.  The Zune interface is by far the most intuitive and easy to use.  It also has the nicest looking graphics.  Click on Music and then click the rocker wheel to the right and see how easy it is to move from Genre, to Artist, to Album, etc...  Go back and click on Video and do the same.  Then go and compare all the steps you have to take to do this same task with the other players.  It takes multiple steps to achieve the same thing you can do by just pushing to the left or right with rocker dial on the Zune.          Stop on Albums and see the Album Art feature.  When you are viewing your Albums on the Zune you actually see the Album Art next to each album with additional information. When you scroll down through all your albums and hold the rocker down a large overlay letter appears on the screen that matches up with the first letter in the Album title and changes as you scroll.  This helps you know where you are at in your list so you can scroll quickly.  This same feature occurs when you are scrolling down through the artists.  When you click on an individual Artist it opens up and shows each of that artist's albums with the Album Art next to each Album for that artist.  When you play your music the Album Art fills the screen which creates a nice look and is a feature that is very different than what you see when you look at an Ipod and other players.  Ipod has album art once you play an album but not when you are viewing an Artist and seeing an Artist's ablums.  You can actually see the difference in the screen shots of the players on Amazon.  On an Ipod and other players the Album art doesn't fill the entire screen or look even close to as nice as it does on the Zune.  The Album Art  and other graphic features make the Zune standout and make the Ipod screen seem bland.    I also like that I can personalize my Zune by selecting my own background and Zune name.  I am using a photo that I took as the wallpaper I see as I flip through my screens.  Your Zune name is what other Zunes see when you turn the WiFi on.  I currently have around 3300 songs(192Kpbs), 15 videos, and 4 pictures on my Zune.  When I showed it to my friends with Ipods they immediately said they like the material the Zune is made of because their Ipods were all scratched up and full of fingerprints.  They thought the Zune material seemed more scratch and fingerprint resistant with the flat finish. They also liked the feel of the Zune in their hand, widescreen video, the double shot color, the way it uses Album Art and the graphics in the user interface.  You may hear people say things about the size of the Zune and how they can't fit into their pockets.  This is not true at all.  I have put it in my shirt pockets, jacket pockets, side pockets on my jeans, sweat pant pockets and have never been upset with the size.  The extra size was obviously necessary for the extra features it offers that the Ipod and others don't offer like the Larger Screen, WiFi, and the FM tuner.    I have shared songs between Zunes wirelessly and it is a nice feature. The wireless transfer was very quick and the process is easy. Songs are shared in a matter of seconds. All you do is choose a song, podcast, or picture you want to send, hit the send button, and then choose the Nearby Zune you want to send it to. Then, the Nearby Zune user you send it to either accepts or rejects the file you send. The wireless feature looks similiar to the wireless you see on your PC with the names of other available Zunes in the area.  Microsoft has said that they intend to expand the functionality of the wireless capabilities over time.  I am looking forward to the wifi development but I am glad my Zune has this feature NOW rather than having to wait for it to HOPEFULLY be an option in the future.  Wifi is not available on Ipods.    With the Zune, someone can send you a song that you can hear three times for free on your own Zune and then decide if you want to buy from the Zune Marketplace by flagging it on the Zune.  I don't understand why the anti-Zune folks can't just appreciate this feature for what it is, a way to share music that you like with someone else. It is a social experience even if it is a limited one.  Since I am 35, I probably won't use the feature like I would if I was in Jr. High, High School, or College where I would be with my friends more often. I know I would use the sharing feature all the time if I were in that group the same way they use text messaging all the time.    The Zune software and marketplace are easy to use. Before I purchased the Zune I actually preferred Windows Media Player to Itunes which is why I like the Zune Software.  It is very straightforward and resembles Windows Media Player 11.  I have a large selection of CDs that I ripped to my hard drive and synced to my Zune so I haven't had a need YET to join the Zune Marketplace subscription service.  I do really like the fact that it is available and easy to use if I want to be able to download all the music I want for $15 a month.  This is another MAJOR difference between Zune and Ipod.  Ipod doesn't have a subscription service available.    The Zune has more shuffle options than the Ipod.  With the Zune you can turn the shuffle feature on in the main menu music setting and this allows you to choose an Artist and shuffle all of the Albums for a single Artist.  Not on the Ipod.  You can also shuffle by Genre on the Zune and have all the music playback shuffled for that Genre.  Not on the Ipod. On the Zune, you can also shuffle all the Albums, a Single Album, and you can shuffle by all the Songs in your entire collection.  The Ipod gives you two choices, shuffle by Album or Songs but you can not break it down the same way that you can on the Zune.       Some people reviewing are complaining about Zune not being able to download podcasts. I already download Podcasts to my Zune.  They go right into my Zune folder and sync without a problem at all.  I have recently learned how to put YouTube videos on it as well.  I am doing this with the free FeedYourZune and TubeSucker shareware.  Microsoft has said they will be providing firmware upgrades in the future that will make it possible to get podcasts via the Zune but the 3rd party software works great NOW.    The Ipod is the only MP3 player with more accessories available then the Zune at this time.  There are already plenty of accessories for the Zune with many more planned for the future. I purchased the Home A/V Pack and you can see what I think of that product in the review I wrote there.  In short, it makes me like my Zune even more!  :-)  I decided to use a 2nd Home A/V Pack in my car with the Zune car charger.  More info about that below.  I am using the Home A/V pack and Zune Car Charger in my car as well.  I put the Zune dock in my car, plugged the Zune car charger into the dock and plugged the aux audio cable coming off the back of my Alpine into my Zune headphone jack.  The Zune home A/V pack includes a wireless remote. Bottom line, I am now able to put my Zune on the dock and it will charge and play through my car stereo with wireless control via the remote.  If my car stereo was setup for video and I had LCDs I could also hook up the yellow A/V cable Video connection and the Zune video would play through the LCDs as well.    I can't see any reason why someone would pick a 30GB Ipod or other 30GB MP3 player over a Zune.  I guess I can understand why you might if you have purchased a lot of music from Itunes that has wrapped your music with DRM software since that controls how and where you can use your music.  It would be expensive to have to go and buy all that music again via the Zune Marketplace or CD.  This is the same issue a Zune user who purchases from the Zune Marketplace will have since Zune wraps your music in DRM software as well.  I prefer buying CDs and ripping them so I am not controlled by Microsoft or Apple.    My only advice, go and compare Zune features side-by-side to other players and see for yourself. Just because Ipods are the most popular device doesn't mean they are the best device.  Zune is a different device with NEW features.  I am really happy with my Zune and Zune accessory purchases.

<Title>Zune is all they claim it is and more.
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my zune about two weeks ago.  I've had no problems at all.  All my MP3s & WMAs are ripped from CD or "borrowed" from back in the old napster days, so I really had no problems dealing with DRM.  For the past year or so, I've been using Yahoo Unlimited to stream on-demand music, so I had no reason to buy the tracks... thus no complaints about compatibility there either.  On to the Zune software.  No real complaints there.  I enjoy the Zune Pass.  I will probably pay for it once my trial is up.  I would like to see some kind of "radio" or genre jukebox feature in the future.  I love that there are already hacks for the Zune.  Most aren't very useful to me, but it still fun to try them out.  All in all, the Zune is very much a solid entry into the media player market.

<Title>Sexy But Very Disappointing.
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No power cord, No Record functionality, No User Manual, No Custom EQ (only presets), No ability to directly copy music to Zune. No useful caring case, No useful earphones, even the ON/OFF is poorly designed. From the moment you open the box you can begin to see that the Zune is a real mess! Everything is aimed at making it look "sexy", with complete disregard for functionality. Installation is bloated with copyright infringement protection, and not much else. On restarting your computer Zune automatically takes control of your computer, grabbing every possible file without allowing you to decide which pictures or music you want on the Zune. Playback has very little customization available. No custom folders, etc. The only things that I found impressive was the radio and the large screen. Very disappointing for anyone wanting media YOUR way.

<Title>Not bad
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was in the market for a high end music player, and would have, almost certainly bought an iPod.  Unfortunately for Apple, they gave me an unexpected opportunity to evaluate their system when they downloaded and installed iTunes (without my knowledge or consent) when I was updating Quicktime.  I gave it a try, and I was not impressed.  So, in spite of the lame ad campaign, I bought a Zune.  I have used it for about 3 weeks and here is what I think:  Audio -- I'm no audiophile but it sounds good.  Video -- a secondary issue for me, looks okay but I haven't tried it much.  Interface -- First device of this type that I find easy to navigate.  Wireless -- My only interest in this is figuring out how to turn it off.  That is easy to do.  Zune computer program -- A watered-down version of WMP 11.  Hopefully, features will be put back in over time.  Still superior to iTunes.  Marketplace -- needs work but I've been able to find about 80% of the songs I've look for.  Microsoft points -- Works fine and is a good alternative to having a bunch of 99 cent charges on a credit card statement.  Subscription -- Pricy but works well and allows you to play the whole song before downloading it.  No useless 30 second samples.  Documentation -- Not so good.  The help files are superficial and the stuff on zune.net, while informative, is all marketing driven.  They need a good technical manual posted somewhere.  Particularly they need to spell out their DRM system in detail.  Bottom line: I like it.

<Title>Dissapointing - Returned it for an iPod. :(
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was initially very excited about this player - seemed like a pretty sweet product, but after getting mine and spending a few days using the messy and incongruent software, i started to get annoyed. iTunes is okay, but now that i've used microsoft's version, i'm realizing that iTunes is really good in comparison.  The breaking point, though, was that the controls on this thing are just BAD. The interface is flashy and looks neat, but usability-wise, this thing is lame. I can't even skip tracks while in the menu because the skip buttons are used to change my view from albums to artists etc.   I thought this fancy new interface would be an upgrade, but it turned out to only be a change for the worse. While i have to admit that the visuals on the zune's interface were neato, and makes my new ipod's interface look a little boring, the iPod actually gets stuff done much quicker, and acts like i expect it to (like i was Hoping the zune would, but fails to deliver.)  Also, the wireless thing is useless, and i dont much like the music store.  My new iPod might not seem as as fancy, but it's smaller, better looking, and works like you expect it to.   I'll check out the next Zune, but this one is a PASS.

<Title>Microsoft's Boondoggle - The ultimate white elephant gift
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune's overall design is quite good. It's built for more wear and tear than an iPod and the controls are a bit wonky but it's nice that it doesn't pick up every single fingerprint and scratch. That is pretty much the end of the good for this product. No, really, I tried to think of more stuff. Ok, the screen is bigger. Ok, now I'm done.  Installation is a nightmare! From my own experience, every written account (even the positive ones) this is a pain to install. Manual DLL file installation? Are you kidding? The obtuse and "idiotic" installation was even admitted to me at a company function that high level Microsoft reps were attending. They admitted up and down that it was vastly flawed,  and were "working the bugs out" then shrugged and laughed (manically) about it. Then when they got up on a podium and raffled one off they called it the "iPod killer".  I love company party-line scripts.   The surcharge for purchasing blocks of tunes for the Zune is borderline consumer rape. Why should you have to pay a surcharge to buy from a company? "Hey welcome to McDonalds. That will be $2.00 to look at our menu please." Are you kidding me? Nothing much exclusive to the Zune makes it worth giving up your ipod. A killer? This won't even be an "iPod annoyance". I'm not a huge fan of the iPod and the way that it's really the only decent show in town. I wanted there to be an alternative, but right now the Zune offers little or nothing for the discerning consumer. Save your money, buy an ipod or buy yourself a really fresh 80's boombox with lots of knobs and a fly Kool Mo Dee tape to play in it. A product made to be forgotten, I give it 2 years before they stop supporting this. I almost feel bad for Microsoft... Almost.

<Title>Functionality over Design
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm sure I'm going to ruffle a few feathers when I say that I think the Zune is far more straight-forward and easy to use than the I-pod.  Although I loved using the click wheel of the I-pod I did think that it was a little extravagant, and even clumsy.  I also found the I-pod menu system overly complicated (though I do miss the fact that you could listen to play lists by 'recently added', 'genre' and other predetermined menus).  I read a review which said the Zune was hard to turn off, but it's far easier, just hold down 'play/pause' for a moment, what's so difficult about that?    The Zune's direction buttons, and select buttons are extremely intuitive.  When playing music, up and down turn the volume 'up and down' (genius), forward either takes you to the next song, or moves you through the media file.  The extra large screen is impressive and turning the picture horizontal maximises it's potential.  When Zune receives it's full functionality I'm sure I will be watching full movies on this format on long journeys.  I suppose the downside of the Zune at the moment is that Microsoft have obviously given it possibilities which it has not developed as I'm sure the approach is to look at providing new aspects to attract new users.  I would therefore anticipate a good number of updates as time goes on, increasing functionality and improving both the software design and Zune functionality.  Hopefully Microsoft will be a bit more consumer friendly than Apple.  I had an I-pod, but when my computer hard-drive crashed Apple offered me nothing more than a replacement for almost full-price as they determined that a prior dent had probably 'damaged the hard-drive'  not much good to me when my computer back-up on my hard-drive is bust too (hence me buying a Zune).  I will admit that I did have a problem one day syncing my Zune.  But I reinstalled/resynced my Zune and I've not had any problems since.    I would therefore summarise the Zune as a very useful and functional MP3 player.  The choice of this over an I-pod is probably one of preference of aesthetics and branding.  Though the fact that the Zune plays in a Windows friendly media format makes me think that it is far preferable to the I-pod encoded one.  Although the I-pods established branding means that more accessories exist out there which are currently compatible with I-pods than Zunes.  PS As I'm probably the only person in the UK to have one I have no one to use the Wi-Fi ability with.  Though I would like to be able to use that on local Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, and a dock/speaker set would definietly be a good idea.

<Title>Seriously people
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never write reviews, but after reading all the hate on this one and seein the ratings, i really have to say somthing... if you read the reviews and look at the ratings from all these people, you would be very mislead... seriously, i mean all these one stars??? its almost like you people have never used this or have a personal beef with it...  some of them even resorted to name calling :) thats just funny (its like they are ipod whipped or something)... Anyways, i bought one and love it... a bunch of my friends who got a chance to see it went ahead and ordered one as well cause they liked it... Its an awesome device... unless your whole library is from itunes, then your kinda screwed  (the main reason why i never jumped on that wagon... why did apple make music sharing such a pain?)... anyways, for what its worth, id say 90 percent of these reviews are dishonest just by their choice of words... its a good buy

<Title>Very happy with Zune
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune is my first mp3 player with any kind of large storage capacity (my previous one was 512MB and didn't last long).  I've been very happy with it, although I don't have much to compare it to.  The Zune hardware is really, really nice. It feels substantial and not at all cheap.  I found the controls quite intuitive and navigating through the interface quite easy.  The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to forward a bit in a track.  The Zune fits easily in a very tiny purse or in pockets.  The battery life seems quite acceptable - after about 10 hours, I still had 1/4 left on the battery.  Sound quality is really good, although the earbuds that come with it were too big for my ears.  I bought a different pair, which is no big deal to me.  The Zune software was a little challenging to set up.  There's a definite learning curve, and not a lot of documentation for it.  If you have a lot of music, I'd suggest that you first set up a directory for the stuff you think you'll want on your Zune.  Add that directory to the ones Zune watches, and then manually sync it.  It will save you some irritation, especially if you have a very large music collection.  The software is the one thing about the Zune that is kind of frustrating, but I think a lot of my problems were related to the fact that I didn't really understand the concept of syncing.  Now that I understand more, I don't have problems with the software.  The picture viewing functionality is nice, and you can select any of your pictures to use as your Zune's background (I love this feature.).  Picture quality seems pretty good and you can view pictures at your own speed or via a slideshow.  The pictures are helped by an amazing screen - everyone I've showed my Zune to is blown away by how good the screen looks.  I haven't tried any video, and am not likely too, as I want this for music.    I highly recommend the Zune.  Lots of features, price is pretty typical for what it offers, and it works well.

<Title>Wait for the next version!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my zune after reading all the good reviews for it. I disregarded the bad reviews b/c I thought they were all just apple lovers and microsoft haters. But that's not the case. Zune really does suck! (at least the first version) Before I bought my zune, I went to best buy to check it out. And evidently, everything seemed fine when I was in the store. I think this is Zune's strategy to make you buy. That is the case because in the store you won't know anything about the sync process with your computer. So I admit that Zune's interface, looks, feel, and ease of browsing when using the player is better than ipod. However, the downside is with the program. You cannot use windows media player to sync with it, nor any other third party program. You have to use Zune's program, but that is where the problem lies. It is so buggy, it's obvious microsoft rushed this product to the market. You could say they took the baby out while it was still in the womb! It is an unfinished product that doesn't sync well with the computer at all. I tried all the other features like video, fm, photos, wi-fi (this feature is just a waste cuz how many of your friends have zunes?). But they all seem to be pretty good other than the fm, which i think it lacks in reception power. What I recommend is, wait for the next 2-3 generation of zunes to come out. This way Microsoft will try and better the software and features. by that time i think the wi-fi will be able to sync with your computer.

<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I couldn't be happier with this product.  I am not a technical person so I am speeking from what I want out of an mp3 player and this fits my needs wonderfully.  I havn't had any problems with it.  The software that comes with the Zune is very easy to use and allows any music you already have on your computer to easily be added to your Zune.  You can also easily add pictures and videos from your computer.  I would highly recommend this product.   I am not here to debate whether the Zune is better or not than the Ipod.  I could care less.  My girlfriend bought this product for me as a gift and all I can say is that I love it and would recommend it to anyone considering it.

<Content>The round dial makes you think you are getting an IPOD. Its a clicky directional pad like the old nintendos had. Its ok. The screen and graphics move well, not quite in the same league as apple but the unit lets you subscribe to ZUNE. Its flat out cool and makes all other services obcelete. A device like this will wipe out all other services, this means you itunes. Havent we heard enough Icrap...?? I This.   If you want the first subscription player that works, this is a good one for you. This is the first one, in three years this thing will be even better. My computer was stolen a few weeks ago and all my itunes with it, apple wont replace music I paid for, so they lost my business.. this new zune is pretty rad, you will like it.

<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i got my zune as a gift. i had an open mind but i couldn't install the zune software for a few hours..it kept crashing my machine! then i took it to my main PC which has plenty of RAM and HD space. same thing. the zune software is bloated and unacceptable.  the actual unit is nice and i like it. i've never had an ipod so i can't compare but i like the big screen. the battery life is a bit weak...i have an cowon iaudio and the batteries last a whole heck of a lot longer.  nonetheless the unit itself is pretty good. ditch the headphones..useless!!  i would recommend folks consider a cowon if they need to record (the zune sure doesn't!) and if not, then get the ipod. it's a much more mature product and will cause a lot less aggravation.  annoyances! no games no wifi file transfers to/from pc no flac or lossless playback no recording it has wimpy battery life (especially playing video!) no ac power (usb cord only..pc must be on to charge it!) no clock or calendar (come on folks!) not many accessories no elegant controls (switches and buttons feel cheap compared to you know who) no podcasting integration limited file playback formats BLOATED AND UNACCEPTABLE ZUNE SOFTWARE!!!!! radio gets data over the airwaves so it will display the station call letters and other info...when you can get it...   good things big screen  nice menu navigation with some nice UI features music pauses if you pull the headphone plug out very nice look and feel over all nice packaging zune software when it doesn't freeze your machine will convert files to formats the zune can play (more hd space on your machine though...) radio reception sucks!!! doesn't play apple drm or play for sure files....sucka!   all in all the zune would make a nice gift...if i had to pay I would stick to my cowon since i'm a musician that neeeds to be able record    a product that was rushed out to market too soon...typical microsoft.  i hope it lasts as i think most of the problems can be ironed out but only if microsoft sticks with this product *unlike play4sure*

<Title>Lovin' It
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read a ton of the interviews here on the site, the back and forths about who is working for Microsoft, etc. and to be honest it did turn me off to Zune a little bit... I thought I'd give it a shot anyway and I'll tell you now that I am glad I did.   I've only had my Zune for a few days, but it's been great so far. To answer another reviewer, the Zune software look like it's a skinned version of Windows Media Player 11, which I don't consider a bad thing -- why would anyone re-write from the ground up a media player just for this? The interface is great, for those of you who have played with Windows Media Center you'll find it very familiar.  Regarding syncing, I had zero problems with getting Zune to connect and talk to my PC... Soon as I plugged it in the little pop-up saying "New Hardware found: Zune" came up and that was the end of the story. In fact, the one thing that was *awesome* about Zune was syncing.. I have about a 20 gig music library that is in WMA format (I used the Microsoft converter utility to convert all my music from .mp3 to .wma) and I was able to sync   my entire music library to the Zune is about an hour. Compared to my old iPod which I had recently sync'd that took over 31 hours to finish and required that I purchase another $35 dollar piece of software (XPlay, which, btw, if you do own a iPod is a great package).  For me now, the biggest annoyance is the lack of codecs on the Zune for movies and video.. specifically two big ones: DivX and the DVR-MS format. The DivX one is by far the biggest annoyance as it means I have to convert my entire digital video library from DivX to WMV... Even on my duo processor box that is going on three days to accomplish and I'll just have to do it any for any other video I download.   The second format, DVR-MS, is the Microsoft format that tv shows get recorded in from my Windows Media Center PC. I don't know what Microsoft was smoking not having a tight integration between Zune and WMC -- I want to be able to see my TV shows in the Zune media player, and when I go on a trip sync a few I haven't gotten a chance to watch yet to the device before I leave and it should automatically transcode and copy them to my device. I think it's really stupid that this didn't work out of box..  As for the other stuff on the device... Radio works great, I like the way the device feels in my hand, I find that I have no use for that little touch-circle thing that's on my iPod so I don't miss it... I know the device has some sort of restricted WiFi built in but I don't know if I care about that or not just yet.. idea sounds cool and all but I think the Wifi thing is more of a forward-thinking idea which is no where near it's time yet.  As far as the Zune Marketplace / three day listen demo thing... I think that's probably a good idea for some people but even Gates has admitted DRM (digital rights management) sucks right now.. I don't like the idea of buying a song (regardless of soruce) and being forced into a way of doing things from there on in so I'm taking his advice -- I buy CDs and rip them for most everything.   Let's see... anything else... The interface while cool has a really junk background image IMHO... other then that let me just say that I do *not* work for Microsoft, I am in fact on the other side of the fence and work in the open source world. You can google me if you want to prove that. I bought Zune because I have a Windows Media Center PC which controls all the TVs in my house (I reprovisioned a old Xbox with the WMC extender software and I have a XBox360 in my living room). I wanted something that was going to play nice with that and Zune fits the bill... minus the video aggervations I have at least.. If you're not a zealot against Microsoft technologies and are looking for a easy to use PMC then I'd take a real look at Zune..

<Title>iPod Killer, Believe the Hype
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read through a lot of these reviews and I found it pretty comical to read some of these reviews which were clearly written by people that do not own the device, simply wish to bash the device to help their inner iPod love grow stronger and/or wanted to take a chance to take cheap shots at Microsoft, for no apparent reason other than Corporate loathe.   Let me start off my clarifying that I own a 4th gen 20GB iPod and a Black Microsoft Zune. I wanted to move to a device that supported video, pics and music all at the same time, music and videos being the major selling points.   I bought my iPod late last year and for the year I owned it, I had times where I loved the device and times I hated the device. From hanging, rebooting itself, ceasing to play any iTunes DRM content, or rendering itself useless and needing to be formatted by the iPod utility, the iPod is by no means without its flaws. The upside to the iPod was that you ould get a ton of acessories for it, the interface was pretty simple to navigate and it did play music pretty well. I had many parties where we used nothing more than my iPod and my home stereo to provide music to the guests.  Currently, my iPod still cannot play DRM'd iTunes music due to an issue with the latest 4G iPod firmware and the new version of iTunes for the PC. I read a lot of reviews in here that bashed the Zune Marketplace and its flaws and I can honestly say the Zune MP is working far better for me at the moment than iTunes. Good luck getting Apple to fix a problem with their older devices that they released an update for and broke. Nice one Steve!  On to the Zune.   I dont buy MP3 players to rave about the packaging. I can care less what it looks like, as long as I have a device, sync cable and some ear buds. I'm not an audiophile, I dont buy $400 earphones, I just stick with what they give you. I love the feel of the Zune. Microsoft picked the perfect casing material to use its smooth yet rugged feeling, doesnt seem to scratch much, and fits nicely in my coat pocket. The sync cable is your basic synch + charge cable, no frills. The one thing missing is an AC adapter, but I didn't really use my iPod AC adapter a lot anyhow, so I dont miss that with the Zune much. YMMV.  The interface on the Zune dwarfs the iPod. There is just NO comparison to how well the UI on the Zune was designed. Major thumbs up to Microsoft on this. Before I have shots fired at me by the iPod lovers, I am simply referring to the navigational capabilities of the Zune and more specifically how you navigate from album to album, song to song, etc. The Zune controls are more aligned with how I need to use a device. I didnt like the thumb wheel thing on the iPod, although I did like that you clicked the same thing you controlled it directionally with. The Zune is similar, since the button is located in the center of the D-style control pad.  The Marketplace is nice, although it is easy to see it is V1 and needs some enhancements. The search capability isnt up to par with iTunes yet, but the all you can eat music for $15 a month will certainly ease the pain on people. I look forward to them offering TV shows, movies, etc via the Marketplace in the future, when they do that is when the real comparison between the two (iTunes and ZuneMP) can begin. For now, The ZuneMP wins for me because I can actually play my protected content on my Zune at the moment, unlike my busted iTunes content thanks to Apples brilliant software developers.  Now here is where the Zune will kill the iPod:  Integration with the XBox360: Currently the best selling V3 console on the market and the center of many peoples home entertainment units. This is by far the coolest feature to have on a MP3 player, toss in the Zune wireless remote and you have quite the home audio setup going on.   Wireless: As of now, the wireless capablity is limited as it should be for a new device. The filesharing capability between Zunes is really cool. Not just for audio, but for pictures as well and hopefully someday soon you will be able to share video as well. Can you imagine seeing something on YouTube, tossing it on your Zune and sending it to your friend, rather than sending a link via email? The 3-Play/3-Day limitation on audio shouldnt upset anyone. If you are sending it to another Zune user, I would certainly hope he/she is smart enough to go with the Zune Pass. Then they can download the song themselves if they like it, or let it expire if they dont. Maybe its your own bands music? That's the one place where I see the need for the 3-day/3-play to be removable. Hopefully MS can figure this one out.   Overall. I feel the Zune is a better product that has more potential and... has better developers backing it.

<Title>After a lot of time spent with the player & software
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A modified version of this review appears on a personal Web site, but I'm tired enough of reading the bad reviews that I wanted to add some thoughts.  Hope it's helpful to potential buyers.  Overall I'm thrilled with the Zune.    About The Package  The packaging is definitely designed to please. Zune comes in a small, sturdy box, with separate compartments for software, player, headphones. This is all cosmetics, but you definitely feel like you've invested in something serious when you open it.  The only disappointment is that an AC adapter is not included, which I should point out is something Apple hasn't done since their 4G.  About The Software  The Software is the biggest obstacle to Zune happiness, and I hope that it will improve over time. It does well importing new albums with accurate artwork and title information. It doesn't always do so well recognizing music you already have: album covers are attached to music files in a way that can be frustrating, and because Widows loves the right-click, editing pretty much anything means you'll be tiring out your middle finger. When you browse the Zune itself, album art there is married to the display art you have on your PC. So if you delete the album, the Zune retains the album cover, but it doesn't display your PC screen. Strange.    Also, you only edit your metadata before it's transferred to the player; similarly you can't play music directly from the player while its connected.  You can create dynamic playlists, but not, that I've found, exclusively for the Zune; you create them in software and transfer them over, which is genuinely silly if I want to see how I play songs and albums in a way that doesn't depend on what I keep and don't keep on my hard drive.  I hope the software changes dramatically toward a simpler interface, though the more I use it, obviously, the more I stop noticing that it isn't the program I used to use.  About The Zune  Ultimately, it's all about the Player, and despite all the reviews or articles you may have read, I'll say the Zune is a lot nicer than you have been led to believe.   Interestingly, the Zune is based on the Toshiba Gigagabeat, but reviewers who were kind to Toshiba took Microsoft to task, primarily for not allowing PlaysForSure compatibility (See CNET). I've never used PFS, so I don't have an issue.  What I like about the player are all the navigation options, and the increased dimensionality in exploring media that I get from a D-pad versus a scroll wheel. What I don't love is how images are divided up into folders that mimic your hard drive. Zune wants me to manage your content a lot better than I want to manage my content.  I love the FM tuner. I love that the tuner reads data from the stations so I know what and to whom I am listening. FM is an item that you have to purchase separately for your Apple product, and that has always been irksome to me. I mean, it's FM radio -- it's not like people have never heard of it before. Whenever I get bored of my lousy music, I can tune into something new. That's the simple brilliance of it.  I have a Me Fetish and so I love the personalization features. I've changed my background image from a game screen capture to photos from the photography site "Daily Dose of Imagery" to my own digital imagery, and they all look great.  I also downloaded a couple WMV film trailers and they look and sound incredible.  The sound quality is excellent from the Zune. Though fewer in number, the Zune equalizer settings are much, much better than my 4G iThing's EQ settings, which were utterly useless.  Here's hoping the film store available to Xbox 360 owners becomes available to Zune players; but how could it not?  About The Social  No, I haven't met another Zune in the wild. However, here's the fun of owning a Zune: they look fantastic in the wild. It really draws attention. The screen is huge by comparison to Apple's. The other plus, I think is that this is a new product going forward. Not that Apple doesn't evolve, but when I bought my 4G I felt like there wasn't any real alternative from a strong brand, and it soon became obsolete when color screen were introduced.  I have high-hopes for the Zune: the firmware is upgradeable (1.2 is out today), so that means (hopefully) new features, new EQs, updates to menu navigation, etc.  Everyone underestimated Microsoft when the Xbox came out, and I think the Zune will become a stronger brand with time. I've read articles quoting Zune designers and staff that they don't want to alienate their early adopters by upgrading without them, and I believe they're sincere about that because essentially everyone's against them at this point.  And really, it seemed an attractive player before I owned one, and now that I have it, I really, really enjoy it. The overall experience has been a lot more exciting than with my iPod, and I don't think I have to look over my shoulder, waiting for it to become obsolete.

<Title>Love it! Love it! Love it! Bought 2 more!
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit leary of my purchase but after getting it home, the Zune QUICKLY cast away all of my worries, doubts, and concerns.   After spending two weeks with my Zune, I had to buy 2 more...one for my husband and one for my daughter just so I could have mine back!  First off...I had absolutely no problems with the software at all!  It loaded quickly without any fuss AT ALL!   Using it was the same...plug it in and there you go.  We have several other mp3 players of various brands and none of them were this simple.  My 9 year old uses it without any instructions or complications at all even though she could not download to her mp3 and I would spend hours trying to get it right since titles and such would disappear. Even my husband who can't navigate the computer or internet without someone looking over his shoulder to tell him what to do has mastered using his zune and software BY HIMSELF! Probably the most amazing thing to me is the quickness with which the software and the zune sync....20 hours worth of music in less than a minute!  I thought for sure this was it...the glitch in the software!  Yet when I disconnected the sync cable and scrolled through my music it was all there!    Even ripping music from cd's is soooo easy...just open the zune software, put the cd in the drive and in no time...the entire cd is right there on your music list!  Again I thought there must be a problem with the software...the music must be messed up...pieces missing from the files and such...but it was perfect!  Loading photos and videos was the same....Everything should be this easy!  The Zune marketplace is also simple to use even if you can't remember the entire title or full artist name AND at only 79 microsoft points per song (less than a dollar per song...400pts for $5) it is definitely not going to break the bank.  They have a wider selection of music than we anticipated.  My husband even found obscure songs from his youth that we couldn't find on other music sites.  The song downloads also work on the other mp3's we have around here that are now just collecting dust and we OWN the songs so we can burn them to cd's and load them on every mp3 device we have!  I bought the car kit with the fm transmiter as well.  All of my friends and family members have to check out my zune when we go anywhere.  In fact, most of them, having not owned a mp3 player, found it so simple to use that they actually managed to make their own playlists on my zune without any help or instruction (let alone my approval). Even my friends who are avid iPod junkies and had tried to talk me out of the Zune in the first place are now singing its praises and have added it to their Christmas lists, at least the ones who didn't run out right away and buy one for themselves.  If I had to find anything wrong with the Zune it would be that there is only one model in 3 colors.  I would have prefered a less expensive (preferably $100 or less), slightly smaller model for my 9 year old daughter. But considering the fact that I don't have to spend hours let alone days trying to get her new cd ripped and sync'd with her device and that she loves it so much because it is so easy for her to use that she is afraid of losing it or being without it so she takes better care of it than anything she owns...it was well worth the money!

<Title>DefectiveByDesign
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune is a case study in Groupthink. Share a song with someone IF they are within 30 feet (despite wifi can't share with friends across town our around the globe), for 3 days or three plays which ever comes first, after navigating though a time-consuming menu of permissions? Half the songs from the Marketplace are blocked for sharing. Zune's Wi-Fi is crippled so that it doesn't connect to your PC or to the Internet. Zune is bigger and heavier and more difficult to use. Why anyone would buy this is a mystery to me.

<Title>Problems Syncing and Updating Firmware
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok ... So this thing is about 2 weeks old and there's already a "firmware update?"  Mine wouldn't finish updating after waiting 45 minutes.  I loaded my whole music library in less time than that.  Now every time I try to sync, it just hangs.  Looks like I'll have to be doing a hard reset.  Too bad ... it played pretty well the 1st couple of weeks.  Maybe I'll find a place for it on craigs list or ebay.

<Title>Ipod replacement? Think again.
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Background: I recently "misplaced my iPod" and was looking for a replacement. Before the Zune shipped to stores, I was caught up in the hype. I wanted to purchase this device because I was in the market for a multimedia player. I saw the ads, read the promises, and wanted to buy one; none were available in my area. I purchased an iPod instead and found the iPod to be a great device. Later, I lost my iPod and decided to give the Zune a try although others had given the device bad reviews. I honestly thought that many of the others had been "going for the status quo" and wanted to jump on the anti-Microsoft band wagon.  My experience: I got my Zune and immediately opened the box. I have to admit, if you want nifty packaging, Microsoft did it right. I plugged the device into my system and Windows doesn't immediatly recognize the device....I am thinking, WTF, this is a Microsoft product, it should be recognized. Anyhow, I installed the Zune software without a hitch, yes, the installation was error free. The Zune was updated to firmware vs. 1.1 and I was running. The problems occurred when I tried to sync the device. The Zune software was able to pull up all of my media from other shared locations and create the media library. However, when I tried to sync the entire library, the sync failed. When I tried to sync one album, the sync just stalled. I attempted to sync one song, multiple songs, shut down the program, reboot the computer, but nothing worked. As a matter of fact, when I went home for lunch, the device was "still syncing" from this morning. I said the heck with it and went to my local exchange to look for another iPod. Luckily for me, they had another iPod in the back and I am going to exchange the Zune tomorrow.  I will give Microsoft props for the case; I did like the feel of it. Yes, it did appear scratch resistant, my first iPod was scratched up on the first day. The Zune did feel a bit heavier than the iPod and since I was used to the click wheel, the Zune controls would have taken some getting used too. The Zune software wasn't as user friendly as iTunes, but hey, it is their first version. Look at Windows, they are still fixing that. Maybe, when/if the Zune makes it to version 2, I would give it another try, but for now, I will stick with my iPod.

<Title>Why are the cultists here?
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got the Zune for my wife.  It's run beautifully, no problems.  I would be inclined to give it only 4 stars because of the limitations on the initial (but updateable) operating software but for one thing: I feel I need to counteract the cultists.  Has anyone else noticed that the vast, VAST majority of one-star reviews end with "Buy an iPod!"?  I did a scan of the reviews of some of the one-star reviewers, and what I found is that this is either their first review (as it is mine) or they have a long and storied history of slamming ANYTHING from Microsoft, or they have a history of slamming ANYTHING that competes with Apple, period.  I just read a Creative Zen review by one of the guys slamming the Zune, and it was equally negative, and ended with "buy an iPod!!!!"  I know that Jobs has a cult going.  He's had one since the beginning. I've met people that will resort to violence if the sacred Apple is spoken of in less than glowing terms.  I have to ask, though... if your product is so wonderful, then why do you have to lie about the competition?  I am certain the cultists are reading all posts and will flag this one as unacceptable, while using their own posts to slam Zune some more.  They have free time, and I have to get back to work.

<Title>Zunes are the Best
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yet I have not bought or recieved a Zune yet, I plan on getting one. I have used my friends, are it was awesome. The sceen was so much bigger which made it easier to watch movies or music videos. Yes, it has very few accessories, but come on it just came out. I have already found a case I want for it and everything. If you compare ipod and Zune prices, Zune is a much better choice. A 30G ipod costs about $300. A 30G Zune is about $250. Now which one would you choose? I have used an ipod before and it was much harder to control. Although it doesn't have everything  an ipod has, I still think it is a much better choice. Not very many people would choose a Zune since ipods are still very popular, but I would. I did alot of research on Zunes and ipods, and found that I would feel alot happier with a Zune.

<Title>Needs some updates, but overall GREAT
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are a few things that make this stand out from an iPod Video.     1 - The screen.  The screen is huge and watching video in widescreen is awesome.  Everyone comments on how great the picture is, it looks like a mini-HDTV.    2 - Radio.  The radio tuner is very powerful and has the ablilty to tell you the station name and even the song that is currently playing.  3 - Wifi Sharing - This is pretty limited as of now considering you can only keep the songs you share with other people for 3 days, but it's still a cool idea and could get a LOT better with firmware updates.  4 - Pictures viewing in widescreen.  It make pictures a thousand times better... Better than iPod hands down.  Other than that everything is at least up to par with an iPod for the most part.  It doesn't have some of the basic features you would expect, such as a clock/alarm, or any programs for that matter.  I believe these will be added later with firmware updates.  The software for the most part is easy to use, but not as easy as it should be to install.  Afterall, this is a Microsoft product on a Micrsoft O/S, there really shouldn't be any flaws at all, but there are a few minor ones.  Overall this thing is great, works for all your multimedia needs.

<Title>Player is nice,  software is a nightmare
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the player. I hate the software that is required in order to use the player.   First of all it took well over two hours just to install the software on a  PC. This PC had only a handfull songs/pictures on it(None: them were transfered in the process. Note if you have lots of songs on your computer expect a 5 hour install process!!!!  Also note your CPU useage will be 90-100% so will not be able to use your computer during the install process!!!! Once you get the software installed you have to upgrade the firmware of the zune.    Microsoft created plays for sure and the zune,  but the zune does not support Plays for Sure.  You cannot use Zune with other online music services like Napster, Yahoo Unlimited, etc.  I am return my as defective I waited for HOURS for it install on a fast duo core laptop and still had not finished the install process!    Why use a standard USB connection if you are not going to use a standard USB cable?  There is absoulty no reason to make a proprietary cable for a standard protocol.  The MAJOR problems with the Zune: 1) Installing required software takes HOURS per computer. 2) Not a "mass storage device" 3) must use proprietary cable to transfer files 4) does not support "Plays for Sure" 5) deleting songs form the Zune takes way too long.

<Title>Yes, it can in fact play protected Ipod video & music...
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those who whine about the new Zune not being capable with playing Ipod Videos & Music need to do some better research. As is true of most generalized players, they intentionally format their videos and music files to be compatible with their own payers, duh, makes sense, why share with everyone, who would buy their songs and videos then?! However, there are plenty programs out there now that can and will flawlessly convert MV4 or other DRM video and mp3's to any compatible format for what ever player you own...including the Zune, and yes, it is all 100% legal if used for your own enjoyment, not to sell around. The best converter for this on the web, in my opinion, is TUNE Bite's Platinum converting program. It cost about $35 but you will ALWAYS be able to convert Itune M4V videos into WMV format to play on your ZUNE. I have done it, and you know what...it's WAY better looking than watching it on the Ipod, because the ZUNE has a bigger wide screen! This program works as well for formatting ANY protected MP3 format too. This program also works vise versa for converting WMV into M4V if you want to convert to watch on your Ipod...but please, don't knock a player by saying it "doesn't" play Ipod this or Ipod that, it does, you just need to know where to go and how to do it! I give the ZUNE 5 stars, regardless of what some people think, it's not as limited as perceived. In fact, once you get past the Video conversion thing, it has way more features than the Ipod, I know, cause I owned one...

<Title>Very happy with my purchase!
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's funny how many reviews end up being only a few sentences about how much Microsoft sucks and how the ipod is so much better. I thought the point of these reviews was to inform people of the quality of the product and not to post opinions about Microsoft or Apple. I work with Microsoft and Apple products every day, they both have their pros and cons and one is definitely not better than the other.  With that said, I've owned my Zune for a little more than a week and so far I'm very happy with my purchase. This is not my first digital media player, I still have two others, one from Apple and one from Creative although only one still works, but only holds a charge for about an hour, which is why I purchased a third.   I did my research before I made my purchase, I read the reviews (sifted though the crap) and I went to the local electronics stores and played a little. I also have a co-worker who purchased the device and he allowed me to use it for an afternoon, that was when I finally made the decision to buy. I really liked how easy it was to use. The navigation was not "clunky" in the least bit, it was actually better than any I've used, but of course that's my own opinion. No, it doesn't have a scroll wheel, it's not an ipod, it's a Zune and it had a D pad, which is much easier to use in the car. The scroll wheel was nice on the ipod, but I'm not really missing it.  The packaging was excellent and well thought out. I won't spend to much time here since I really don't care much about the package, but I did think to myself that "this box is really nice" when I was opening it.   Software loaded easily, I had no problems here. However, I was told before hand to make sure my Windows media player was updated to the most current version, mine was only version 10 which would not work with the Zune software. Not sure if I would have had problems with installation if I hadn't updated. Once the software loaded, I plugged in the Zune, had a firmware update (5 minutes) and then all my music, videos and pictures were loaded to the device. This took a total of about 25 minutes to load about 8 gigs of music, video and photos, that was a nice surprise! Much faster then the other players I've had and the one part I was not looking forward to. My itunes music was a little bit of a pain, but it's all on my Zune now. There are a number of ways to accomplish this and none of them are hard. The marketplace is not iTunes, it's different and it took some time to figure out like any new program does. Once I learned how to use the program, I really liked it. It could use some more features, like video, but it is version 1. I'm loving the 14 day pass! I've downloaded around 200 songs and purchased a few CDs because of the free pass. Hopefully video will be added soon and I guess games, although I doubt I'd buy any games.  The Wifi is a little limited, but I've been loving it. My co-worker and I have very different tastes in music, but we share songs all the time and just through him I've been exposed to music I never would have listened to otherwise. It's been great, not at all bad for a first attempt at wifi. I guess that's the point of the phrase "Welcome to the social." There is also an easy way around the 3 day 3 play rule (look on some Zune forums for the answer). The FM radio is great too, I listen to my favorite talk show every morning now. The reception is crystal clear.   There really isn't anything I can think of that really bugs me. I haven't had any problems so far. And, since I've owned the device I've gotten two firmware updates and one update to the software. This just shows that MS is working to make the experience better. The device does what I need it to do, play my music, video and show my pictures. It would be nice to have video in the marketplace and I wish the software supported more codecs for video, but other than that I'm happy! Remember this is my opinion, but it's coming from someone who actually owns the product.

<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought the Zune just as it came out. I was kinda pissed at Apple because my iPod went dead (dropped it) and after getting no satisfaction at the Apple store I thot Zune would offer a couple advantages and maybe better service. I don't live in a big city, but lots of peeps here are PC oriented (I live around a lot of defense contractors and military bases) and I thot that someone would have a zune in the mall or downtown and I could swap some tunes and maybe - dare I say- meet a girl. Long story short- NOBODY, I mean nobody has a zune that I could find. And what's up with the Zune Marketplace? Geez, iTunes is so freggin' easy to use, I got addicted to it and my parents got pissed off that I was D/Ling albums and videos. I'm putting my Zune on eBay and will be forced to buy another ipod (without the HD) - who needs 80 gigs of storage for crying out load?

<Content>Outstanding, gorgeous, powerful, easy to use.... BUT, I'm shocked to learn that any music I ever downloaded from MSN Music (that is currently in my Windows Media Player library) in the past will NOT transfer to my ZUNE (doesn't matter that MSN owns both) because of the new digital coding that ZUNE requires. You either have to rip, burn to CD, and create MP3's of your prior downloads before the ZUNE will accept them, or buy the music again from ZUNE! This is the device to buy if you are starting a downloadable music library today, but if you already have a downloaded library, good luck!

<Title>Incomplete user experience dooms device
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this device because I thought it would be a nice departure from the iPod and offer a complete user experience similar to apple without the being a slave to apple's store and policies.  I even bought the brown one to be 'different'.  Packaging:  A lot of people have commented how nice the packaging is.  True, it is pleasant and a real departure for MS. Still, it is a freakin' box.  The nice box will not matter to consumers in the end.  A nice box will not help a bad product (not that this is a bad product, but in general).  Installation: Difficult, time consuming.  Needed three tries to get all software and hardware to install and synch.  This is likely a Windows problem, not a zune problem per se.  It is no different than installing a new printer.  It never works right the first time but once you mess with it enought it you can get it to run.    Device: works as advertised.  I don't know if the sound quality is any better than an iPod.  To me, the cheap headphones that come with this or the iPod are equally bad.  Better headphones give you a better experience.  The fake click-wheel is a cheezy attempt to look like an iPod without the functionality.  I am not sure why MS did this... they could have gone with their own design.  It is a bit heavy but the screen is a nice size and I do like the feel of the soft case material.  User Interface/Store:  Unfortunately, this is where the device, in my opinion, fails on many fronts.  First, the whole choice of DRM by MS and going against their long standing policy by introducing yet another format for consumers is a disaster.  Strike one.  Next, the store itself is not nearly as well designed, user friendly, and most importantly populated with music and video as iTunes.  I don't want to buy points and then buy songs.  I just want my music.  Strike two.  Finally, there is nothing really new and exciting about this product that will truly convert people away from the iPod.  While bluetooth file sharing is a great idea, the execution on this device fails because of the 3 play limit and also the current lack of critical mass of people that own the device to share with.  Strike three.  Many folks have said that the whole 'social' advertising campaign was the biggest mistake of the launch.  I think that is probably accurate at this point.  It is a chicken-egg problem.  You need critical mass to be 'social' with the device and there are not enough of them out there, and won't be for a long time if you read MS' sales projections, to be social with.  I think one of two things will happen with the zune.  It will either get a major upgrade very soon along with a new store and lower pricing on more content or it will die quickly as failed product.  My guess after using this for a month is that it will be the latter.  I have given my zune to a  charity for christmas.  I don't like it enough to bother keeping it.

<Content>I find it tiring reading the ignorant iPod user complain about the Zune.  The Zune is superior with (1) radio (2) ability to communicate to other Zune users (3) wmv and wma are superior codecs (4) more durable construction.  If you get beyond the marketing hype of Apple and realize they are laughing as they redeem their stock options, it becomes apparent their product is inferior. I have installed video and audio and never had an issue with the software or hardware after using it for the past two weeks.  I installed the Vista patch and it works great.  DRM with the wireless transfer seems to be required outside of violating copyright laws.  At least I can listen before I buy.

<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player is great! I came from an Archos Gmini 400 and this blows it out of the water. Skipping tracks through shuffle mode has almost no delay, unlike my Gmini which had a 2-3 second delay to buffer. The sound quality is very good, but would be better with a customizable EQ. Video is fantastic. Although it only takes certain formats (AVI is not one of them), converting was pretty painless and the 3" screen is beautiful to look at. The radio is awesome too! It has RDS technology, which shows station information (music artist, title, etc.). I'm very glad I chose this player.  Pros: +Beautiful 3" screen +Superb UI +Album Art takes up 3/4's of the screen +Doubleshot effect +Scrolling is very efficient. I would even prefer this over the iPods clickwheel +Painless software  Cons: -Proprietary USB cable (iPod also uses a proprietary cable) -Not a UMS device (although a hack does enable drag anddrop) -Wifi is pretty much useless, but I didn't buy it for that -Few EQ options  Would I recommend this over the iPod? Definitely. It's got more features for a similar price, and the UI is just, so, awesome.

<Title>Zune Player Pro's and Con's
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the zune player several days back, as a replacement for my old Toshiba mp3 player. How was it?  Packaging and Accessories: Pros ~The packing looks really nice, it is apparent that a lot of work went to it.  ~The headphones are simple, but powerful. The headphones are of good quality and can have magnets in both ends to prevent messy entangles.  Cons ~No a/c charger or cable, it has to be plug to the computer. ~Not enough information. The instructions were simple and easy to follow; but no decent instructions for the software that comes with it, nor details about video quality or accepted formats. ~It comes with a very mediocre pouch.  Software  Cons  ~It is a copy of window media player, and unless you had some experience with past windows media players, its going to be long hours. ~The software is straight forward (to straight forward); it is design for beginners. It works well when all you want to have is a list of endless music without any organization, but if you want a playlist get ready to experiment (since there is no manual). ~There is no software for converting videos into the zune screen, so you will have to get an independent one. ~It doesn't take audio files from stores like napster (Most audio files are on mp3 player format, which it does take). ~The stupid software assigns pictures to the music files. In my case it assigned a single picture to about 60% of all music, making me see the same picture every time song comes up.  Pros ~Similar to Windows media player ~Fast ~Contradictory to other reviews, has not crashed.  Zune Player  Pros  ~Design wise PERFECT. It is probably one of the best designs I've seen so far (better that Ipod). ~The body is not likely to be full of thumbprints. ~Resistant. I am a long distance runner and my mp3 suffer from constant   falls and bumps. So far it has been dropped several times, and the player has not skipped or turned off. ~Battery life is decent, there are some mp3 players out there that will give you 35 hours or so, the zune gives you about 12 hours which more than satisfies my needs. ~Fm radio with presets. ~Video is of good quality and viewable. ~Picture quality is really nice, you can see pictures and listen to music at the same time; it also has the zoom in feature included to see the picture up-close.  ~Music. Sound quality is really good. As for volume it goes from 1 to 20 and putting it above 5 gives me a headache.  ~Cons  ~The equalizers are all the way back in the setup menu, can not be access directly from the now playing (The software allows for the user to select which equalizer to use for individual songs). ~You can not customize how the now playing looks. A picture in the center with the information in the bottom.  Future?! ~One of the most interesting features is the wi-fi, which allows you to connect with other zune players. It is an interesting feature, but it is useless unless you are sending pics, because for songs they limit the amount of times it can replay. The Zune is firmware updatable, and Microsoft can add future services to the mp3 player, hopefully making the wi-fi to better use.   Overall:  It does not have any extreme drawbacks; the design mix with the features makes it a fit rival for the ipod. I especially recommend it for beginners, since it extremely simple to use. The only real complain is the software, and the fact it can not be used as external hard rive.

<Title>Definetly and IPOD killer!!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I find it hard to believe why someone will say this is not a great device, or even say IPOD is better than Zune. In short, Zune is a trend setter and on a class of it's own. It has functionalities IPOD owners can only wish and dream of. For starters, you could easily share songs, and pictures with friends and families without a computer.   This is one of the strenght of Zune. It is built on the concept of socializing with your device. Napster taught us how to share files online, Zune teaches you how to share your music, and pictures on the fly...no computers. What else can you ask for Zune haters? Yes, the software is a little quirky sometimes, but that is the truth about software. Even the itunes is known to be very unstable and even worst you don't get a software disc when you buy an IPOD now, you will have to download it...too bad if you don't have an internet connection.  So let's not kill a device that has opened doors to a new way of socializing, rather applaud the effort of Microsoft and give them there kudos.

<Title>The imposter
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It would be hard to write this review without getting too politcal. So I will pre-empt here by saying that the Zune goes a lot deeper than just being another mp3 player "choice." I am a Mac/iPod fanatic who got the chance to try out a Zune recently.  As much as i liked the Zune, it simply didn't stack up over all, for these reasons:   1.  the industrial design simply isn't there.  this is where Apple succeeds and Microsoft fails each time.  i will call the Zune their lame attempt to create a turd-brown version of the iPod.  it's as if Microsoft is saying to consumers:  "you see, we can do it, too. it's vertically oriented, same proportions, screen on upper half of device, controls on lower half of device, slightly rounded edges, etc." 2.  the bigger screen.  yeah...  old people and the blind need to be able to see what song they're playing.  i found the Gen 5 iPod's screen to be more luminous and has better resolution, despite the size difference.  besides, i don't watch movies on my iPod, i listen to music. 3.  the WiFi.  it doesn't work well.  period.  besides, i don't want to share music.  i have better taste in music than all my friends combined.  and i remind them of that constantly.  hahaha. 4.  the subscription service.  transient "borrowing" of mp3's as long as i pay my fee?  yuck.  apple already fought the battle for ownership (digital rights management).  people want their songs without the strings.  remember Rhapsody, anyone? 5.  overall, i found the zune to be reasonably user friendly.  but every time i saw a feature i liked, i was reminded that Apple developed it first, and frankly, does it better.  so, if this really doesn't do anything valuable that an iPod can't do, and the iPod has been deemed the coolest object of the new millenium, then what exactly is the Zune's "raison d'etre" ?????   to kill the iPod.  all in all, it is startling and more than a little disappointing to see Microsoft attempt such a ham-handed stab at the iPod's market share.  Here's hoping Apple can counter attack in '07 and finally put the MP3 player wars in the history books.  what Microsoft forgot here, though, was that coolness sells.  and the white earbuds of the 'pod culture have an incalcuable, intangible value to youngsters - heck, everyone. and the Zune....  folks should see it for what it is:  an imposter.

<Title>As good as ipod, but different
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd like to start this by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft or an Apple snob, just an average person who likes music. I bought a zune because I liked the bigger screen, I like the brown (so sue me), and I personally find it easier to navigate. I am a PC user, so the mini version of Windows Media Player is more intuitive to me. I also have spent many hours with friend's and family's ipods. They both store as much music as I need, they both sound good, and they both seem to be built well. The software installed fine and downloading songs was no problem (after a free upgrade to WMP 11). The zune found all of  the MPEG4 videos I had on my computer, including Yacht Rock, and played them fine. I do like apple's click wheel a little better, although I seem to have a little trouble stopping exactly where I want to, but I like zune's interface, screen, and customizability. I would give the ipod five stars as well, so I really don't think it has to be a major life altering decision as to what type of person you want to be. They're pretty much the same. Go to the store and buy the one you like, they both work fine.

<Title>Zune, this is it...
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had used/played with (virtually) every iPod since the beginning...sure it is a "copy" just as Apple copied (and is now being sued for) other MP3 players before it (much like their Mac UI if you know your history).  A player is a player, all I care about is what works and sounds good - have not have a single glitch and it sounds and looks great.  Admittedly their add-ons are a bit light but it took others months if not years to build up a following so I am not overly concerned.  What I am concerned about is people who do not even try it (of course good players are not cheap so not everyone can just try them all enough to really know one way or another so...)  In other words if you have one, give it a while to sink in and see if it works for you - if you don't play with a friend's and see what happens...either way competition is good so I hear and now there is some competition...  If you buy something just beause you think it is hip or anti-corporate remember that the iPod is certainly corporate and as to it being hip - hmmm....maybe you should buy something because you want it and it works and not just what others say you should...

<Title>Great MP3 Player, highly recomended
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, i know everyone compares the zune to ipod,and let me just say that they are both very good products. Previously i owned an ipod mini, and looking for an upgrade i went out on a limb and got a zune for Christmas. First thing i noticed was the zune a tad bigger then i expected, but for a bigger size i was rewarded with a much bigger screen which is a definite plus. from then on i have no complaints. i love the fact that it has no scroll wheel, (never like the scroll wheel in the first place), i love the fact that the case is practically fingerprint proof, (except the screen of course)the software setup is a breeze, way simple. I would like to point out i had no trouble setting it up and it was very fast, despite the fact that some people seem to have opposite problem. I just followed the instructions and in a flash i was easily syncing music to my zune. software is almost identical to windows media player. it was so nice after stupid itunes crappy software, which i hate with a passion, that half the time doesnt recognize my ipod. anyways software very nice. My favorite part of the zune is the interface on the zune itself. the ipod was so, blah and boring. i love the innovative interface, 10X better than the ipod or zen or any other MP3 player i have ever used. its a breath of fresh air. video is excellent especially with bigger screen, a big difference, the wi-fi is a novelty, not practical for me since i live in rural, wrangler idaho. i say wi-fi and everyone thinks im talking about the newest boombox. hopefully they will develop that feature soon, which i hear they will. I love the zune, prefer it over ipod any day. i dont understand why so many people dislike it, but i highly recommend it.

<Title>Not as bad as some think
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I asked Zune for Christmas, because I needed something other than carrying a CD case around with nearly 200 CD's in it.  As I do my fair share of driving, that gets fairly hard to do, since flipping through a CD case is not the smartest thing to do going 70mph down the highway.  I will admit that I picked the Zune over an Ipod mostly because I dislike Apple.  However, after reading several reviews I became to be a little uneasy about my choice since I did not want to get a piece of hardware that I could not use.  However opening the Zune and getting it going has already set my fears at ease.  The interface was quite easy to get use to, and I absolutely loved it that the Zune program came with a MP3 burner so I could get all my CD's onto my computer and thus my Zune.  So far I have had no problems with any of the CD's, and I even have stopped, unplugged my Zune and made sure that I could play the songs.  A few of the draw backs is the interface on the Zune.  So far it feels a little awkward and slightly difficult to use.  This would also include the buttons on the Zune.  Had the buttons been a little more separated (the circle four separate buttons around a fifth middle) I would have been a lot happier.  However I am wiling to bet that those two problems will be non-existent as I get more and more use to the Zune.    Over all, I am very happy with the Zune and Microsoft, especially after I had some problems with my Xbox 360 (which I eventually got fixed and have had no further problems).

<Title>Zune...A welcome change to the iPod 
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not going to dive into the deep philosophical reason why this is different from the iPod...let's be honest...if you're considered buying it...you already know or have read some of the differences.  The screen seems to be a big hit with Zune users already, not to mention the FM tuner...but hey let's face it...if you already have your library on the Zune...why in the heck would you want to listen to the radio?  But hey it's your life.  I find it really easy to upload music on it...and contrary to popular belief...YES you can put iTunes music on it...it just takes a couple of steps...such as converting your iTune library into unprotected MP3's.  The songs that you have purchased from the iTune store can be placed on the Zune after you burn them all to a cd...once that's done...then rip it back onto your computer in MP3 format...and you should be good to go.  The interface is excellent.  There you have it...a simple concise review of the product...after all who wants to read a ten page review by a person...on Amazon?

<Title>Not that difficult
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Zune for my wife who is no computer genious and she had no problem setting up the software and connecting to the Zune. So I am not sure of peoples problems with setting it up everything went very smoothly as she followed the simple instalation instructions. Later we decided to move it to another Pc from the laptop only because of the amount of space needed and I did have to update the Windows XP software with SP2 and other windows updates..but this was only I neglected the pc. I can only assume from this is that the people who have been having trouble with the loading of the software is more to do with the state of thier pc's than anything else. For the same price as the ipod 30 meg machine you get a built in radio, a bigger..less likely to scratch screen and the wireless that allows you to pass three songs to other users...a nice feature though she will probably never use it. There are of course more accessories for the IPod but i think the Zune is better value than the equivalent Ipod.

<Title>Its all about Zune.
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one of these for christmas and I gotta tell ya its a wonderful little piece of technology. Now lets get a few things cons out of the way first. It does take awhile to sync up to your computer so you will have to be patient when first using it.  Turning off the auto-sync was a bit of a pain and the zune software is a little hard to figure out at first but once you get the ball rollings it makes alot of sense.    Its missing alot of those other features the IPOD has such as the calendear and mini games but I don't know about you but I use MP3 players for music not to play games. Sure it also plays videos but neither this nor the Ipod screen really make that a good experience at all. My favorite feature is the screen and how it allows space for up to five albums at a time to show on screen along with the album art. Being able to see all my album art makes me giddy and truly feels like I am taking my CD collection with me where ever I go.   The ear phones it comes with are pretty good and they even include a magnet to keep them from tangling up in your pocket or bag. One review mentioned that that the Zune doesn't keep your place when you turn it off but thats simply not true. When you turn it back on you'll be back at the menu screen just press the back button and you'll go right back to where you left off. Its light weight, smooth, and the screen is B-E-A-utiful! Its the perfect anti-ipod device although it has alot of the same frustrating restrictions as the IPOD. Why must I keep all these MP3 files on my computer in order to have then on my MP3 player? Come on now! Its a storage device for goodness sakes! Another pet peeve of mine is that it came with alot of preloaded crap that I had to delete and the auto-sync feature is a pain in the [...].    The click pad works better for me then the Ipod's click wheel because I don't have to worry about scrolling past my song or having to slowly creep my thumb to get to the sound level that I want. The click wheel just isn't as exact because its too sensitive, the Zune touch pad does the job without all that nonsense.  If you are thinking of getting a Zune and don't mind the little quirks I mentioned above then you'll love it.

<Title>More then happy!
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've seen the Zune around for a while now and for the longest time I gave it the cold shoulder. It didn't impress me, just like the Ipod. I started to take interest in the Zune when the Zune 80 was announced 80 gigs for $250 was not bad in my book, plus the controls for it reminded me of my Creative zen micro. I've been a big Creative mp3 player fan for the longest time. I was considering getting another one till I saw that the Zune 30 was going to have the same firm ware as the Zune 80 and it was on sale for $89.99 on Amazon. I could not pass up a deal like that, so I bought the brown Zune 30 gb, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXP946/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune Home A/V Pack</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWN1LM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune Leather Case 30 GB</a>, and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M1EBGG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Car Charger Cigarette Lighter Adapter for Microsoft Zune</a> which I got all of these for under $180. Getting the Zune was probably one of the best decision I have made in my life. It's very stylish (I don't care what people say, but brown is a nice color for a mp3 player), it's really easy to use, the software isn't as bad as people say it is, and it was very cheep (at least for how much I got it for). Only problems I have with it is that I don't know many that have Zune's so the wireless social file transferring is kind of pointless to me. Another thing that annoyed me about the Zune is that it is only compatible with the Zune software and don't work for WMP's "PlayForSure" software (which I used for my Zen and worked just fine). One last thing that I had a problem was that the wireless transfer to PC was a Vista only(I got XP and I don't want to "upgrade"), not really a problem but I wanted to try it out. But the few problems aside this is a really good mp3 player and for the value I got it for, it blows other mp3 players out of the water! I would highly recommend this mp3 player to PC users.

<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zune delivers everything that I expected except it cannot be used as an external hard drive without a hack.... which is why I gave it 4 stars, not 5.   The exterior is superior to the iPod since it won't scratch. The quality of the music and video are nothing short of spectacular.  The radio is a nice added bonus and the wireless capability has a lot of potential.  Basically, you cannot trust anyone who gives this a 1 star because like the iPod it is a quality product.

<Content>The Zune is the best media player out right now.  I have an Ipod and the Zune software is so user friendly and easy to use (unlike the itunes software).  I love it.  The picture is crystal clear.  Right now I have downloaded 1000 songs and six 2hr movies and I haven't even cracked 20 gigs yet.  I love the automatic upgrades that download to the Zune automatically when you plug it into your computer....which makes this 1st gen. Zune (really a Toshiba Gigabeat S2.0 on STEROIDS) able to last a long time. The body is more durable than the Ipod as well....You will not be disappointed with this purchase.

<Title>Very surpised how much I ended up NOT liking this player !
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Zune after listening to the mostly positive reviews on Amazon. I loved the scratch resistant finish, the screen size is wonderful, audio quality, especially the FM radio- with Artist, song, and artist information. The deal breakers are lack of video format compatibility (the Zune software converts some formats to WMV, but this process is very lengthy and causes loss of picture quality. The worst thing was the clunky Zune software. You cannot add/ delete files without this thing. I prefer it when the MP3 player just shows up as a hard drive in Windows and therefore you can drag and drop files to/from it. I also don't like the lack of compatible music/video services. Microsoft should've had their Zune marketplace more "beefed up" to compete with the "big boys",I am truly happy for those who love this player. In the future (hopefully soon) this will be a  worthy opponent to Ipod and Creative products. I for one will stick with Creative with the Zen Vision for now. Thanks for listening.

<Title>This is a quite cool device - totally recommend it, you'll have fun!!!
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my brown zune a few days ago and I'm having a lot of fun with it and happy with my purchase. As there are many feature oriented reviews out there ... I rather share a more user experience type of review.  Before that I have to say that the brown Zune has a realy nice look, is the best looking Zune of all, as taste is a personal thing, you need to go and check it out on your own, rather than trust on others opinion.   The experience:  - Software installation was flawless, then just plugged the device and updated the firmware automatically, it was quick and simple process. The Zune player looks like a stripped down version of Windows Media Player and is very simple to use.  - The software then synched all media I had on my computer (music, photos and videos) to the Zune. It was long process as I had more than 15 Gb of this on my PC. The software converted the files to the appropiatte rate for the Zune. Latter I deleted what I didn't wanted from the Zune library and it was taken out of the device.  - I used my windows live account to purchase Microsoft points and in a snap I was purchasing songs @ 79 points each (1200 points @ 15 = 80 points per dollar).  - Then I created some playlists on the Zune software and synched to the device. The Zune has a "quick list" playlist that allows you to create an on the fly playlist by adding songs, complete albums, artists or existing playlists, so that you can create a "current mood" playlist ...  - I then checked pictures, while having my music playing on the background I was able to start a picture slideshow of the entire collection or specific collections on the Zune. I noticed that while checking a specific picture I could just make it the Zune background, giving my device a more personal look ...  - Videos play fantastic on this big screen that also has the right format (match to TV 4:3 format), so now I can easily enjoy my videos and more frecuently bother my friends with my " family latest vacation video" :-)  - Radio also works fine.  I still haven't had the opportunity to plat with the sharing feature, but looking forward to.  Overall I'm very happy with my brown Zune and I'm actually looking forward to see if Bose makes a Zune brown SoundDock to pick one for my office. Another cool thing is what you find in the zune box, just a USB sync cable (no power adapter), earphones, installation CD and a soft velvet type of carryng case to protect your investment from scratches.

<Title>Cheap and expensive
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My recommendation is to wait for the next generation or even two for the Zune.  I experienced the Zune and iPod for the first time during the last couple of weeks.  The Zune felt cheap and clunky compared to the iPod.  I thought the iPod had better screen resolution and seemed like better quality.  The Zune is still working out bugs finally working with Vista but the wireless seems quarky.  No one has the Zune yet so no one to share with.  The FM doesn't seem to work very well on the Zune having a lot of static with the stations it connects with.  It would seem Microsoft would put better quality FM with the Zune since it is one of the features iPod doesn't have.    The iPod seemed better polished and the interfaces worked better.  I would wait if I were you for a year or so before getting a Zune.  Don't throw your money away at a first generation product that still has to many bugs to work out.

<Content>Well said by Tvshooter, "I think Microsoft just wanted to get the Zune on the market before Christmas".  I have been in the software/hardware business for thirty years and this item has missed its mark!  After playing with the zune.inf file and registering .dlls to get it to work, I finally called it quits and returned the product for an IPod!  My gut instinct told me not to purchase a product that is version 1.0; however, since it was Microsoft -  I thought - ummm - what the hell -  let's give it a try!  Well, dissapointing! I felt like I had returned to the dark ages when PCs first came on the scene. This was no way to spend a Christmas morning! I will wait for version 3.0.

<Title>Excellent hardware and firmware - the PC software is lacking
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We are on our 6th iPod in our house (1 lost, 1 broken - USB connect broke off a shuttle, 1 inexplicably dead after less than a year of use and 3 still in use). That's a lot of Apple products in about 4 years.  My shuttle is getting a bit old and the batteries aren't what they used to be so I thought a Zune might be worth a try. My wife obliged by getting me one for Christmas.  I love the Zune hardware and firmware (it's much, much nicer than my wife's video iPod). However, I spent several hours trying to get it to work on my Dell Laptop with XP Home on it. I gave up because the Zune USB driver on my Laptop kept complaining about communication failures.   I was about to pack it up and send it back and replace it with a video iPod when I tried it on my desktop PC. This desktop is an MCE 2005 (w/rollup 2) and the software installed without issue and the Zune connected and worked like a champ.  After using it for a couple of days, I love the Zune. The firmware is great; it makes the iPod firmware look old and crusty. I love the FM receiver and downloading my wife's unprotected iPod videos has worked well with the Zune software.  I haven't tried the wifi support (it requires another Zune to use). So I'm not sure what to make of that feature.  I'm not sure what's up with the software issues on my Laptop. My Laptop has been the most reliable PC in my house for the last year, so I seriously doubt this was some goofy issue with it. You'd think that Microsoft would have a good handle on software issues like that. I've never had a problem with any iPod software and that's from Apple, a company whose core competency isn't Windows based PC's.   Let's hope that the next release of PC software and drivers solves this issue.

The software, as far as im concerned is easy to use even for someone not completely computer literate. Obviously the biggest attribute is the screen, its about twice as big as the Ipods.

<Title>Maybe they didn't update their versions of Windows...?
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Zune as a late Christmas present and I was on the fence after reading the negative reviews about it.  Let me tell you, do NOT buy into the negativity.  I've read the horror stories about botched installs and I didn't have any issues of the sort.  I just popped in the CD and BAM, I was off and running!  I can only surmise that the people who had trouble installing haven't updated their systems.  It says on the bottom of the box "Windows XP SP2, or later".  I really like the big screen and the music quality is top-notch.  As for those who want to use it as an extra hard-drive, well it's a music/video player, NOT an alternative hard-drive.  I tried out the Zune marketplace and I found it very intuitive and EASY.  It's a great player and it's a great start for Microsoft in the music player department.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because it has to convert some of my videos to go onto the player.  Besides, nothing's perfect. ^_^

<Title>For 99$ its a steal. 
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall a good player for 99$, especially with the latest firmware update. But it doesn't play well with Linux, unless you have a virtual machine installed [VirtualBox on Linux with USB enabled]. Another lock-in is the MS Zune Player software.   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a>

<Title>Very Disappointed
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this as a Christmas gift.  Wasted 6 hours trying to install software on my PC, finally got it to sort of work after reading several MS online articles, then had mp3s freeze during playback on the Zune. Other problems included errors syncing, softwware not recognizing Zune, playing audio or video was slow or unresponsive.  Returning it ASAP.  Looking into the Zen Vision W instead.

<Title>Did My Research, Found What I Wanted/Needed, Bought a Zune...  And I'm VERY Happy w/it.
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really interested in the Zune when I first heard it was being released.  I was dying for a video MP3 player, but wasn't sure what to get.   The overall size of the Zune appealed to me immediately, as I wanted something with a little size that didn't feel like it'd break.  IThe larger screen that you can also customize the brightness is great, and makes it easier for me to use this unit for longer periods of times.  I also hoped that it'd interface better with my computer as it's a Windows-based computer, and the idea that I could get updates for it through Microsoft, making this a unit that will evolve and grow, was really appealing.  There were a ton of other "sexy" features, like WiFi file sharing, Microsoft backed software, the landscape video screen, the "wireless DJ" which caught my interest.  The ability to play wma's was the icing on the cake, as most of my music is in WMA format.  Plus, I happen to think it looks great (though why they chose brown as their third color...)  I'd been reading the reviews of the Zune and after hearing all of these horror stories, I anticipated all of these problems getting it synced and transferring my already-present music collection to the unit.  However, I had absolutely no problems.  I popped the CD in, and everything worked seamlessly.  Within maybe 20 minutes, I was listening to music on my Zune.  The only problem was I realized how spectacularly disorganized my music collection was, making the artist/song lists uploaded in the Zune look like an unintelligible nightmare.  It took me several hours to correct the problem (the result of my bad file-keeping not problems with the Zune) which was frustrating...  The frustration compounded by the "autosync" feature...  When I'd edit the Zune files in the Zune program, it would read that the files in the program were different than the ones in the "My Music" file and then auto-update the files to the info from the "My Music" file, totally undoing all my work, making me want to throw my computer out the window.  However, after turning that feature off, life was good again.  While I wish there was a user's manual for this unit, for the people like me who've only borrowed other people's video players and never actually owned one, but it's not hard to figure out how it all works (it helps to be computer savvy, though).  It's rather intuitive, and it's user friendly (after that damn auto-sync is turned off), and it interfaces beautifully with my existing programs.  Ripping CD's is shockingly easy, and almost no effort is required at all to rip a CD onto your Zune.  Downloading songs through the Marketplace is also a breeze.  The marketplace has a fair to good selection of songs, though the marketplace really loses to the ITunes store for including no videos, music, TV, movie, or otherwise (I can only assume that it's on the way?).  Another loss comes in that the videos from ITunes are not compatible with the Zune, so for awhile there, I was worried I'd have no videos for the Zune, making me want to cry.  However, I found a file conversion program that allows me to convert flm files to be compatible with the Zune, so I'm getting music videos from other sites online and converting them with no problems.  Now I have several hours of music videos, as well as a few downloads of full movies which I was able to get after getting a DVD to Zune program online (search DVD to Zune to find it).  The sound quality and video quality is spectacular on this unit, well worth the money.  The unit needs a recharge after about 12-14 hours of music use, and if I'm watching a video, I can watch about 2 2-hour movies on one charge.  It recharges via the computer's USB port, something I can't decide is a plus or a minus.  It's a plus that it recharges as I upload and sync it to new music, but a pain that I need my computer to be up and running in order for it to recharge (since I have a laptop, it's something of a PITA to leave it up and running and undisturbed for the length of recharging).    While I think the Zune is great, it isn't for everybody, so do your research before committing to what you buy.  If you want something that's small and flashy, this isn't it, but something that has some weight to it and feels like it can take some use and abuse, and has a variety of unique features,  this is it.  What it loses in flashiness (I still can't get over it...  Brown...  Why brown?)  I could wish the Marketplace was a little fuller, and I wish I could get videos direct from the Marketplace (if I can, I can't figure out where, though I'm sure it's coming), and I think they should tweak the subscription feature to the store, which I'm not that impressed with...    But with all the features it has along with the constant updates which provide limitless potentials for growth, I think this is by far the better digital media player for the price...  For my needs, anyway.  I'll admit, I'm not caught up in this "Apple vs. MSFT" thing, nor am I a MSFT junkie (I don't even own/want an XBox...  Though for those that do, Zune has some great features that you'll like in terms of an XBox sync/interface), but I think plenty of people will find that what meets their needs may not be what fits another's needs.  I like the Ipod, but it's not for me, and while I realize it's popular with a huge following of people who love it, I'm not going to make a major electronics investment on a piece of equipment simply because it's the more popular option.  I'm going to pick what meets my needs, and I think the Zune will meet a lot of needs not currently met by the Ipod.  That doesn't make the Ipod bad or the Zune better, that just means it appeals to different markets.  If I simply wanted to play videos and listen to music, I'd get an Ipod, but I needed/wanted a little more and I was willing to sacrafice some of the flashiness that Ipod has.  Word of warning: Don't get the Zune if you have Vista, or you're on dialup.  The Marketplace interface will fail or run horribly, and you'll wonder why you wasted your time.  However, the same holds true for people who have ITunes and numerous other digital media, so I think it's reasonable to expect you should only use it if you have something other than dialup.  In the end, do your research, don't buy into the hype for or against both the Ipod or Zune, and pick what meets your needs.  For those of you who choose Zune, you'll love what you get.  :)

<Title>Excellent hardware . . . software needs work
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am writing this review in two parts, because I feel the software should be reviewed separately from the hardware.  Why?  Because very few reviewers factor in Itunes when reviewing the Ipod, so I feel it's only fair to evaluate the hardware, which mostly will stay the same, separately from the software, which (hopefully) may be changed a lot.  I currently own an Ipod Gen 4 and my wife has the newer video Ipod.  The Zune beats the video Ipod.  I won't bother re-hashing what others have said.  My primary interest in the Zune was the larger, better proportioned screen.  I make videos and slide shows and they look great on the Zune.  Also, the sound seems better and I can get somewhat higher volume from it.  The radio works beautifully and I live outside of a large city.  It's kind of fun to see the additional data the stations broadcast.  A few stations actually display the song/artist, while others just "promote" the station.  But it's cool to see and the display is vivid and crisp.  Setup was reasonably easy, although I made the mistake of opening another program during the install and the install had to be restarted . . . which brings me to the software:  It's not so good.  Of course it's functional, but the interface is non-traditional and non-intuitive.  I'm still not sure I understand everything about it, and it's often slow to update.  I have hope that after reading enough bad reviews Microsoft will re-think the non-traditional interface.  It's puzzling, and I've taught multimedia production at the college level.  I have a strong dislike for programs that work outside the standard Windows interface.  They may look pretty, but form follows function and you'll often find yourself staring at the computer screen trying to figure out what exactly is going on.  So why five stars?  The hardware is top notch.  If I factored in the software, I would have to lower my rating, but I'm not going to do that.  I also feel I should try to average out the ridiculous "one star" reviews from Ipod fanboys who have obviously never even picked up a Zune.  (Amazon should dump such "reviews." IMHO)  And if you think I can't be harsh in my reviews, check out what I have to say about the Zune Car Pack.  In fact, the Zune is a well-made piece of hardware.  It does not feel junky or cheap as a previous reviewer said. It looks great, sounds great and does a super job with my videos.  Will it ever be an Ipod killer?   Probably not, but the competition will be good for Microsoft and Apple and the consumers will be the eventual winners.  (One other thing.  If you're using Vista, the latest software/firmware upgrades during installation will give you compatibility.  You can download directly from Microsoft.)

<Title>Better features than an iPod for the same price
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If your looking for an MP3 player and video player then why would you buy something with a smaller screen and less features?  If you already own a bunch of iTunes DRM music then you have to stick with the iPod but for someone new to the market, I don't see that the iPod video has anything to offer over the Zune.  Maybe the iTunes software and website add a plus to the video iPod but I refuse to spend money on DRMed content that I can not play where I want to.  I have not had any issues with the Zune software on my XP PC and the latest update to the Zune loaded fine and cleared up a few minor things.  Reviewers complain about the wireless but seem to leave out the fact that the iPod doesn't have it at all.  Just the fact that it has wireless leaves a lot of room for future features.  Zune has the bigger screen, plays my MP3s without issue, same hard drive size and price a video iPod, plays my podcasts and video podcasts without issue, has a nice interface, sweet FM tuner and the same price as the iPod.  Bigger screen, option to use wireless if new features appear, newer technology.  I voted Zune and I really like it after 3 weeks of daily use.  Why buy old tech if your not committed to iTunes DRM?

<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received the Zune 30 GB Digital Media player for christmas. I can honestly say, I was thrilled. The appearance of the Zune surpassed the iPod by far. I rushed to install the software in my computer and it was not compatable because we had an older version of the windows media center. After two days of trying to update our computer we finally gave in and used it on my dads. The software is a little buggy, and the syncronizing part of it is annoying but all in all Im happy with my gift.

<Title>The fatal flaw
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before you purchase this product, there's something you should know about the controls you see on the front, in the pictures.  That round thing underneath the big screen is not a 'scroll wheel', like that thing on the front of an iPod.  It's a four-way pad, the same interface that those old Nintendo controllers had from 1985.  You can press it in four directions, but it doesn't turn.  Perhaps the designers of the Zune made it round-looking in order to cause confusion deliberately.  I have no idea.  But it's a four-way pad.  So why does this matter?  Because it's the Zune's user interface: your gateway to controlling everything that happens on that impressive Zune display.  Compare it to the user interface on the Zune's competition, the iPod.  The 'scroll wheel' on the iPod is THE reason the iPod is 'easy to use'.  No other reason.  You put your thumb on it and you can scroll through items as quickly or as slowly as you want, for as long as you want, and you don't have to wait for any acceleration to kick in, like you do on the Zune's four-way pad.  As a design decision, it's now a no-brainer.  Someone at Apple thought it up and planted it on an iPod and from that point on, it became the obvious solution to the problem of scrolling up and down a list on a compact device.  So why hasn't Creative used it, and why isn't it here on the Zen?  Elementary, my dear Watson:  Apple's got it patented up the wazoo.  Basically they won't ALLOW any other music player to emerge with a 'scroll wheel' on it, because it's one of the defining traits of the iPod.  So Microsoft was forced to license and release a music player with what is (nowadays) a sub-standard interface because of lawyerly shenanigans.  If you haven't used a Zen and an iPod side-by-side, you may not understand what a big difference this little interface element makes, but trust me, when all your music is in lists, and you scroll through those lists twenty times a day cueing up music (as well as seeking in songs, and adjusting the volume), the difference becomes crystal clear.  When I saw the Zune in photos I thought I was looking at a 'scroll wheel'.  I should have obviously done more research.  And to all the people who are (bizarrely) trying to give 'kudos' to Microsoft for 'making the effort' with this ho-hum music player:  Are you honestly concerned for the emotional well-being of a multi-headed zillion-dollar corporate entity??  I don't understand that at all.  What's more, if you're expecting the second or third generation of the Zune to be ten times better, you're bound for disappointment.  Apple will not license that 'scroll wheel' patent.  Therefore the Zune, no matter how pretty the box it comes in, will never be as easy to use.  I gave mine away and bought an 8GB red iPod Nano as a replacement.  I advise anyone with the leftover cash to do the same.

<Title>Zune Great, Software Lacking
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received the black Zune as a Christmas present and am enjoying it so far.  The device itself seems to have nearly everything I wanted in a personal audio/video device.  What would make it a 5-star device is A/V mini-jack compatibility (video-out through the headphones), line-out in addition to headphone out, and a built-in FM transmitter.  The internal software could probably be re-worked as updates occur, but I'd like to see an option - per song - to adjust the preset EQ.  The Zune software itself is pretty slick, though I'm having trouble adjusting from my former favorite, MediaMonkey.  The main feature I look for in media managers such as Zune or MediaMonkey is their ability to tag more easily and efficiently.  MediaMonkey pulls song information from Amazon through a simple search system that I really like.  The Zune software mysteriously updates songs as it sees fit - I didn't find anywhere to query the Zune catalog and refine my results.  Sometimes I don't care if the metadata is the *right* data, just pertinent.  And it is 2007 (mostly) now, shouldn't the Zune software and device fully recognize ID3 tags in their entirety?  How cool would it be to have access to all the ID3 tag information on the handheld (e.g. lyrics, composer, year, genre, etc.).

<Title>Honest Opinion - Really good product
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read a lot of reviews, here and elsewhere, before I decided to buy the Zune.  I already have a 1G Nano so I wanted a bigger player, and one that had a nice display for pics and vids.  I didn't expect to be watching a lot of movies on it, probably short video clips that I either filmed myself and wanted to show, or ones I downloaded and wanted to show.  So knowing that, I have to say the Zune is exactly what I wanted and works perfectly.  A+.  I installed the Zune software and synched up all my music, video, and pic files first.  I actually took a few days to clean up a lot of junk that I didn't want before I even connected the Zune player.   I also made sure only the folders I wanted synched were listed. I then left it overnight to sync all the files.  I don't know how long it took but everything synched fine, about 25GB of material.  Unlike other people who have had problems with synching, with USB ports, with whatever, I had no problems at all.  My computer is 4 years old, a P4 2Ghz with 1G of Ram running XP, nothing special and it worked perfectly (using the front USB ports which are only USB 1.0) The Zune software runs smoother on my computer than iTunes does, no stutters or glitches, and seems to use less memory than iTunes judging by the Windows task bar.  As for the player it is no large "Brick" or any other nonsense that you might read.  It is slightly, very slightly, larger than my friends 30GB Ipod, also slightly heavier.  We are talking &lt;5% difference in my opinion here, virtually negligible.  The menus and graphical interface work great and I think are easier to navigate than my Nano.  The screen is bright and pictures and videos look great on it.  The  non-scroll wheel is fine once you stop trying to turn it, took me 1 day and a half.  For someone that has never owned an Ipod it is a non-event.  Only pain in the neck for me was fixing some of the mp3 meta data so the Artists and albums would be correct, not really Zune's fault, more the result of me not doing it correctly originally.  Earbuds are okay, a little too big for my ears but I have probs with my Apple ones also so that is more a genetic problem for me than an indictment on earbuds.    I have not tried using the wireless sharing yet, nor was that attractive for me.  My interest lies in wireless synching or downloading, something I expect to be able to do very shortly.  Zune marketplace is also a non-event for me as I get my music from other sources including [...] so I can't comment there.  My two cents.

<Title>Even better than expected
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my Dad for Christmas and he wanted an ipod because thats the only big name he heard of. I was looking between the ipod and the zune and since he's in his 50's and pretty rugged with his stuff I thought I would give the Zune a shot. It does have a bigger screen which is better for his eyes, the screen supposedly scratches less than the ipods does, I actually liked that this was a bit thicker, it feels sturdier than the thinner ipod, and I think (my preference and what I think would be better for my dad) the click wheel is easier to use than the touch sensitive one that the ipod has. After playing with it I was amazed by the zunes interface, its so much easier to move through the menus than on the ipods (again preference) so that was a nice bonus when I started to play with it.  The zune software for your PC gave me some troubles installing until i found out that one of my USB devices was interfering with it. I'm not sure which one so I just unplugged all of them but my mouse and installed the software when the install was done I just plugged all of them back in and it worked perfectly. I had been hearing really bad things about the software for the PC so this is where I was the most nervous, especially since my Dad was going to be using it. I knew it had to be simple and straightforward so he wouldn't get frustrated with it. After playing around with it I knew the interface in about 10 minutes. I then walked my dad through everything and he thought it was great. He was ripping and syncing in no time. I had to teach him what "ripping" and "syncing" was, he didn't know the lingo if you will. He has been playing with it for three days now and on his own he has been putting all of his CDs onto the computer and syncing them over to the zune. I also just set it up so he can plug his zune in his car and listen to all of his music through the car speakers which was the biggest reason he wanted an mp3 player.   I have no real big complaints about the Zune or the software. It has decent third party support but it needs much more and they are hard to find in stores such as Best Buy, I had better luck at GameStop I believe it was. I'm now on the search for something to hold his zune in his car without having to lay it in the cup holder unprotected since he is known to spill coffee there. I keep hearing more accessories are coming in January and February so I'll keep my eyes open.   I fully recommend this product.

<Title>Disappointed with Zune
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to agree with M. Sullivan.  I really wanted to like the Zune. Nice packaging, big screen, easy to operate but the short time I had the Zune I experienced difficulties with the software. I downloaded the software into my almost brand new computer and created an account with Zune so I could download songs, etc. What kept happening is that I could never log on....so I called Zune on Christmas day. I was on the phone for over an hour trying to understand why the software wasn't working on my computer.    Problem: My operating system is Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002.  Zune does not work with Windows XP Media Center Versions 2002 nor 2004. It will only work with the recent XP's Media Edition 2005 which is only available on newer computers -- no available software upgrade due to newer hardware installations, blah, blah, blah.  Needless to say, I took my Zune back and got the 30G Apple iPod and am very happy with it -- no problems at all!! Also, it is my understanding that Zune does not offer "movies" like the Apple ipod website....? I rated the Zune with 3 stars because I did the see its potential including all its accessories as well.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yesterday I changed my 4GB Sansa e200 for a Zune, and man was it a good thing I did. First off the Zune has 30GB space and it's like an Ipod Video. But the Zune has a wireless feature in which you can share songs, pics, vids, whatever, with other people, it also has a Zune Marketplace in which you can rent music, yeah that's kinda bad, you can only rent them, altough the Zune comes with a 14day subscription for rental. The skin of the Zune is more strong and durable than the Ipod, and the screen is larger, making it better. Another cool feature is putting a background for your Zune, right now I have a cool graphitti one. The Zune's battery life is kinda short, it only has like 12 hours of battery life, less than the Ipod. For downloading via the Zune Marketplace you can buy a subscription or use XBOX 360 points to buy stuff, which is pretty cool. The Zune's controls are like classic, it looks like an Ipod control but you just press down on the circular thingy to go down, up to go up, and it works like that. The Zune also has a built in FM Radio, which is cool if you are tired of your music. In conclusion the Zune is a player and it's great for its price, it lets you play videos, music, radio, pics and lets you share music wirelessly.

<Title>Good device; definitely recommend to consider
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to agree with most of the things that Jordan has to say (the other "top" review).  The Zune is a good quality device, and in the two days I've had it, it's already proved to be an indispensible addition to my collection of gadgets.  I prefer the approach that MS took with it; I like the interface better than the iPod's (the "slide" pad never suited me) and the "feel" of the device is better in terms of the surface.  I've had no functionality issues with the Zune software either (aside from preferences regarding use and how it organizes things, but that's personal taste), and wish it had been integrated with Media Player 11 as well (it seems like it could have been a good module to add to that software).  I run Windows XP Professional, and I had no hitches with the install, with connecting to the Zune marketplace or anything else.  So, it runs as smoothly as I would normally expect.  All in all, I think it's an excellent device and MS did a good job with creating their own MP3 player.  The major downside is that most of the "extras" are currently made for iPods and it will take a while before other manufacturers start making things for the Zune.  So, expect finding accessories to be a bit thin for a while.  Otherwise, it's worth considering when looking for a portable music player of some kind (whether iPod, Zune or another manufacturer).

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved a black Zune for Christmas and I'm very pleased with the product!  I've had no problems with the software (I myself have Windows XP).  I've also owned a iPod Nano for a year, with which I was very satisfied, but I was ready for something more.  I'm not strongly sided with Apple or Microsoft, but I a few key features convinced me to choose a Zune.  I specifically liked the Zune's included FM Radio and the larger screen.  When I looked at the Zune in person at a local Radio Shack I was first struck by the different texture of the Zune.  Its body is much more welcoming to the touch and doesn't easily attract fingerprints.  Whereas, I always kept my Nano in its case because I hated getting all the fingerprints on its shiny front and mirrored back.  The Zune's controls almost seem more instinctive than the iPod's click wheel.  I've always thought of the iPods' click wheels as very interesting and cool, but never as the easiest technique to use on an MP3 player.  I also love the ability to put pictures as the background of your Zune; it really personalizes the player to your own liking and brightens up the screen!  The only downside I can see to the Zune is the marketplace's lack of movies or music videos.  I'm sure these are soon to come in the future and it's just a matter of time, but as of now the only way to get movies or music videos for your Zune is illegally.    I even tried Walmart's new attempt at the digital movie market.  They've began this thing where when you buy Superman Returns from their store, you can go to their website and type in the code to download the movie for $2 in a portable music player format.  But after I downloaded the movie, I discovered that you can only use the movie file in the Windows Media program.  Therefore the movie can only be synced to MP3 players that have the ability to sync with the Windows Media Program, which is neither iPods nor Zunes!  Clearly, Microsoft has made a good solid product!  I have no complaining to do about the product itself, but I only hope that Microsoft can quickly create a market where Zune owners can buy movies and music videos.

So I have yet to see her operate her own, but she gives the store displays quite a run for their money.  Which is exactly why she is getting the Zune instead of any of the other MP3s on the market.

<Title>A pleasant surprise
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted the zune, because it was the first ipod-equivelent device that supported a subscription service, but I wanted to wait, because I know Microsoft usually gradually enters the marketplace and I knew they hadn't opened the video section of their marketplace.  But then I went to Frys and used one, I loved it, so I picked it up.  The interface is nice, it looks good to me, I like the interface, and I "love" the zune pass.  15/month for unlimited music for 3 computers and 2 zunes?  My wife and I both cancelled our rhapsody accounts and switched to zune pass.  I know some people hate subscription music services, but I love them, I download 2-3 albums per week because I love trying new music, something I wouldn't do if I had to pay 99 cents a song, and I'm too busy to spend my time listening song by song.  When I'm bored with my playlist, I download a few albums before work, then I sample them, toss out what I don't like, and keep the good ones in my playlist.  I can't wait to see what they do in the video marketplace, until then the zune is just "nice", afterwards hopefully it will be a must have!

<Title>A Great Player
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player for Christmas and really like it. It replaced  my 20 GB Dell DJ, which i loved, but i wanted a video player. I don't have the "iPod knowledge," but for those whom never have had an iPod, and want something different, the zune is perfect. It's screen and video quality are amazing, much better than what i've seen on iPods. the sound is great, and the player is very simple to use. Plus, i like the music subscription plan of Marketplace. The raido is a big plus too.  My complaints are the click wheel can be a hassle if you want to find music quickly (i was spoiled by the Dell DJ's scroll bar). The software is sometimes a pain, especially if your PC doesn't support it (i had to download Service Pack 2 to support the Zune Software).  Yet, with any player there are going to be annoying problems, even the iPod. With the Zune, the good out-weighs the bad by a lot. For those who never had an iPod (or even if you have), the Zune is the best alternative.

<Title>Where's the battery?
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now, I have never owned a Zune, but have two close friends who did.  I played with it for all of a few minutes and was pleased by the large color screen, the sound quality, the video capabilities.  However, both of my friends wanted to exchange their product for a different brand mp3 player after a mere two days of ownership.  Apparently the Zune's fresh, fully charged battery barely makes it past an hour or two of play.  It just doesn't support the capabilities of this little machine.  And that terrible battery life just overshadows whatever potential it might have had.

<Title>Don't Expect Miracles....nor Disappointments
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After five years of using an ol' RCA Lyra MP3 player I wanted something new.  My old one was crashing all the time and the battery was failing so I went for the Zune.  I chose it mainly because it has a big and beautiful screen that can play movies.  What I got was just that, an MP3 player that sounds good, plays movies, has a picture viewer, a wi-fi connection, and can get FM radio.  Since I don't download music (most of my collection is hard-to-find even in CD form) I had no problems with the Digital Rights Management scheme.  Users of sites such as iTunes and PlayForSure may want to hold off in getting the device,  At least until Microsoft updates the firmware with greater support of other DRM software as well as a non-crippled wireless.  The music playback is crisp and clear, with a little tweaking the equalizer, has a good bass too.  Movies also play very smoothly.  However, unless they are Windows Video or one of a few other types of movies, conversion is required.  I don't mean the built-in conversion that goes with transferring a video over, I mean a full video re-encoding.  For instance, let's say you have a movie on your computer in MPEG format encoded in Divx or Xvid.  These CANNOT by default be used with Zune.  They must be re-encoded to Windows Video first.  The best way to do that is to use the Windows Media Encoder found at Microsoft's site.  The FM tuner picks up most channels, but if you're hoping that you can switch to AM frequencies, you will be disappointed.  On a more positive note, the Zune can be reconfigured to use European and Japanese frequencies...if you live or travel there, that's good.  The wireless connection is, in a word, crippled.  You can transfer the songs to other players, but after three days or three plays they stop working.  The software for the Zune is basically Windows Media Player 11 with Zune decals.  But, it is setup much differently than WMP 11.  It will transfer over all of your music library and and CD images you have.  If you have many of these images, go to the web and download and paste in higher resolution images, approx. 200x200.  Much smaller and they won't show up well on the Zune during music playback.  The software is configured to sync everything you have on the computer with the Zune and is, by default, going to find songs you removed from your library and send them to the device.  This would be great if you just wanted to listen to music without the hassle of finding each album individually.  But, for the more experienced user, is more of an annoying nuisance until you get the software tweaked to your specifications.  Songs you remove magically reappear on the Zune, until you squint at the computer screen and find the options menu.  Thankfully, you can stop auto-sync and transfer over songs you listen to the most.  An example of this would be an artists "Greatest Hits" album.  Most of it is songs you already have with a few new ones thrown in.  Unless you change the syncing options you can waste a lot of space with repeats of songs.  Overall, my experience with the Zune is not better than the Lyra.  But it is much more feature-rich.  The design of the device itself is solid with a rubber-like coating that will resist fingerprints and minor scratches.  The screen is very bright and clear.  Sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is a little hit-or-miss.  If you start an album and play it though without skipping tracks you will get very decent battery life.  But video and wireless options will drain your battery significantly.  Thankfully, it charges fast.

<Title>Quality Hardware, Poor Software
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I receieved the Zune for Christmas as a replacement for my aging original iPod (pre-photo/color screen)I usually am an avid supporter of Microsoft products, but this does not quite hold up to what I would expect of the company.  Overall I have some mixed feelings but feel satisfied.  The hardware itself is very satisfactory, the software however is lacking.  The device itself is excellent.  Sound quality is superb even with the in-box ear pieces, and using more powerful headphones it sounds superb.  The screen is large and extremely clear, and video plays seamlessly and is impressive.  Battery life is not disappointing (provided that you disable the WiFi) and the player itself is very durable and made of a material that wont scratch and look worn like iPods tend to do.  It is a little larger than I expected (proabaly due to the WiFi inclusion) but its size is exactly on par with all comporable media players.  The FM transmitter works well and picks up most stations, and the WiFi feature is intriguing (althought I haven't used it yet). Using the interface and control are simple although require a little getting used to (switching from the iPod to this) but are not disappointing.  Overall the player itself is nice and easy to use and I was very satisfied.  My complaints and problems with the Zune come not with the unit itself but the PC side of things.  Microsoft intentionally set the Zune team up entirely seperate from the rest of the company (exactly like the Xbox).  This sounds like a good idea, it gave the team plenty of room to work free of beuaricratic restraints, but unfortunatly it was also free from all the good things Microsoft has developed.    The Zune Software/Player is the only program which works to sync music to the Zune, this includes Windows Media Player 11!  Also, the Zune Marketplace is the only music store which works with the Zune (the exception being eMusic or one of the very few stores with music that is not DMR protected).  Suprisingly, the Zune is not PlayForSure compatible, meaning Zune will only allow non-DMR music to be put on it unless it came from the Zune Marketplace.  If you have any popular music subscription(Napster, Rhapsody, iTunes, Urge, etc.), even if they are PlayForSure they will not work with Zune.  Also if you have music from MSN Music (before it was discontinued), it apparently will not work with the Zune).   Video syncing withe the Zune is possible but is a process.  If you have video in MPEG, AVI, DivX, etc. you will have to convert it beforehand (and by convert i mean completely re-encode!).  It takes some time, but is easily done using a converter (not included) like Windows Media Encoder 9, [...]  So, is the Zune an iPod killer?  Not yet, but the Zune has potential.  Microsoft got the hard[ware] part right at least.  Overall, if you are in need of a new music player and you are not hinged by a particular music store the Zune is a good option.  Otherwise, wait.  The player is still in its youth and the company is devoted to its success, things will improve.  It may be a bit before the Zune is fully functional in the windows environment (i.e. unhinged from the Zune software a bit, and supported by other music stores), but it will undoubtadly happen as the Zune gains popularity and Microsoft continues to navigate the bumps in the road that Apple faced so long ago.

<Title>Love My Zune!!!
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased the Zune a couple of days ago. I had been reading the reviews and was a little concerned with all the negitive reviews. But I went to a store and played with one on display and I really liked how it operated. So, I took the chance and I am very happy I did. By the way I bought it through Amazon because their price is lower than the stores. Anyway, I unpacked it, loaded the software and plugged my Zune in and it worked right away with none of the problems that I heard others mention. I did update my Windows XP the day before which I had read was important. I was concerned because my computer is about 4 years old, but I have had no problems. I have not used an ipod before but my son has one and all his music was on my computer. All that music was put on my Zune. I did have to remove a lot of his music because it is not what I like to listen to, but that was not a problem. It did take a little while which didn't bother me. I found that if you hold down the Ctrl key you can highlight several songs at a time to remove them instead of doing one song at a time. I'm all set now and I am adding more of my own music as I write this. I am very, very happy with my Zune and cannot understand the negitive reviews I read. I highly recommend the Zune.

<Title>If you don't own it Don't WRITE A Review!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read thru tons of reviews...almost all of the positive ones came from people who actually own the device and as you guessed it the negative ones were from people who..."Have played around with their friends", don't even own it, or just hate Microsoft so much that they pass judgement without merit.  Ok now on to my review...because I own one as well as a 30GB iPod.  If you have neither (Zune or iPod) and you want a high capacity music player (>8GB not a flash-based player) and 30GB is your size buy the Zune or even the Zen Vision:M (nice as well but smaller screen so zune is nicer).  It is far more flexible of a player than the iPod predominately because of the subscription service (Zune Pass)...something Apple doesn't have.  The subscription service is so awesome it is however similar to Yahoo Music Unlimited's to-go and napster to-go service...but Zune doesn't work on their services, other players do such as the Zen.  It's an all-you-can-eat monthly program.  You pay one flat $15 a month fee and you can put as much music on your Zune as you can fit and pay no more than $15 a month!!!  That would only get me 15 Songs on iTunes!!!  Plus you can also put as much music as you want on your main pc as well as 2 other...a total of 3 PC from one Subscription!!  This is really sweet and cost effective compared to the iTunes setup because they have no subscription plan!  That makes probably the biggest different.  But even if you don't use the subscription service the Zune is still very nice and offers alot of advantages over the iPod.  Second the screen...WOW the iPod screen isn't even close...no argument...period!!!  With the screen comes the interface.  Once again the Zune kills it.  Battery life is the same, sound quality seems to be better on the zune...I plugged both into my bose headphones and tested a handful of the same songs on both units in their native formats (Zune WMA@128 and the iPod in AAC) the Zune sounded better, this is probably subjective and my opinion but I tried hard to tell which one was better and that was the Zune!  The Wi-Fi...I can't see myself using right now.  You can send a song to another Zune and they can listen to it 3 time within a 3-day period and it's gone.  A week would have been better and 5 listen, but I'm sure those idiots at the RIAA had something to do with it!!  I hate those guys...and you can quote me!  Another difference is the FM tuner...once again the iPod doesn't have it.  As for Controls it's a wash...I like both.     Now the iPod does do some nice things like Podcasts something currently not available on the Zune...it is in the works.  I love Podcast...chalk one up for the iPod...which isn't doing well in this review.  Also, the iPod has a handful of games you can load on it..nothing to crazy but the zune has none (currently)...not really a big plus.  Accessories the iPod has a ton...none of which I use or none of which are outside of any accessory I can't get for the Zune anyway.  So once again...not a big plus.  Size the iPod is slightly smaller and slightly lighter...but not that much so not a factor to me.  Look I used to love my iPod (I still do) but it has aged and the lack of a subscription program like Zune Pass and a smaller screen just kinda made me feel like apple is missing something as of right now.  But then again why do they have to add the subscription service when everyone is still buying it and they hold such a huge market share?  But still No FM Tuner, Wi-Fi, big screen.  The current iPod generation is approaching 2 years old.  Apple is due for a redesign on a great product that has pioneered and industry.  As of right now the Zune has it.  If you dont have a music player and want something >8GB look no further the Zune is the one...for now!  Don't let any fanboy tell you different!!

<Title>I've Owned It For Five Days....
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...and it really has been a nice player. I like the way when you first plug it in, it automatically puts all compataible media files onto the Zune. Although, I had to go through and delete all of the picture files, well except for the ones I'm using as wallpapers. The only blip in the Zune is the fact it isn't compatible with AVI video files. I had to by a video converter wich cost me $45 but that wasn't too bad since I just used Christmas money. But for people not as lucky it would be a serious drag.   The video quality is great, though when the scene is dark you can see little green and gray pixtels but it happpens on the computer too so my opinion on that is; whatever. However, your video watching quality depends on the quality of your video.   The battery life when watching a video sucks, though. I can watch one full length two hour and thirty minute video and the battery is dead. So, to fix that I bought a car charger and that seems to work. But scrolling through the menu also messes with the battery so I'm debating whether or not to take it back and get a new battery because it might just be my battery.   Anyway, overall, this is a good product and I would recomend it to those who like to watch videos and listen to music on the same device.

<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is great. Its not perfect, but its totally satisfactory.  The software need a tiny bit of work plus needs more codec support, but simply use WinAVI and you wont have any problems with video.  Other than that its a beautiful durable piece of hardware, unlike the ip*d that will totally shatter from a 1 or 2 foot drop.  plus the screen is beautiful, a little higher resolution would have been nice.  Plus all those people who complain that the wireless in horrible, how could a free (and with the ip*d you wont get anything for free or "built In") feature be a minus.  Its affective plus in the newer firmware versions it will definitely have much more functionality.  I'm not an Apple Hater, ive owned an ipod 5th gen and i was totally unhappy.  Video's were hard to watch and there were very little converters out there.  But its funny how this .5 inch increase in screen size is a HUGE improvement, i was truly amazed by how much bigger it looked.  Ive had alot of experience with PVP and DAP's(Personal Video Players and Digital Audio Players) and i follow these things alot.  Ive owned an Ipod 5th Gen, Zen Vision M(also a great buy btw for the price and great video codec) a Microsoft Zune, and have played with the Toshiba Gigabeat a lot.  My favorite thing about the zune is its great interface(GUI)  Its amazing and really catches the users attention.  Now dont get me wrong, the ipod is a great player, but it leaves much to be desired.

<Title>[...] : Target : : iPod : Zune
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Zune comes with software that offers you the Zune player, which is a pumped-up version of the Windows Media Player (11).  The Zune Marketplace (Zune's version of iTunes) also offers the Zune Pass, which is a little under $30 bucks a month: basically, it's a music buffet that allows you to get as much music as you want, and you can keep the music for as long as you pay for the subscription.  Not convenient for my uses, but I'm sure that it works for others with a steady income.  I'm a Lime/FrostWire junkie, so in the end, price makes no difference to me.  ZUNE SOFTWARE: Your files are organized into folders with your Zune software and computer folders.  Connecting your Sync cable to a USB port automatically syncs all of your files to the Zune, which comes in handy.  Hand-sync your playlists.  INTERFACE: The opening menu screen lists the options as shown:  Music / Videos / Pictures / Radio / Community / Settings  The background for your menu is customizable!  Three preset backgrounds can be chosen in the Settings, and any pictures that you have on your Zune can be chosen as the background in three clicks or less.  CLICKWHEEL: It's a beautiful thing.  It consists of two unlabeled circles.  The first circle, the middle one, is basically the "Enter" button, while the surrounding circle is for browsing.  When listening to music, the clickwheel changes functions: the top and bottom adjust music (which goes from volumes 1-20), while the side buttons are for song skipping.  Much like the iPod, granted, but without touch sensitivity. (One friend says that this is much more convenient for surfing menus without having to constantly correct inadvertent menu changes.)   MUSIC: Quality is perfect.  Also, a GREAT addition is the fact that you can view the album art of the song while the seconds and minutes of the song ticks down below the art.  Beneath the time ticker is the song information.  VIDEO:  See the "SCREEN" section below.  PICTURES: See the "SCREEN" section below.  RADIO: Radio quality is great, and it definitely isn't something you can get from the iPod. Your stations are customizable to either North America, Europe, or Japan.  Preset your stations for easy access to them.  SCREEN: [The obvious one:] The Zune has a much larger screen.  Though the resolution is the same, it doesn't affect the image quality much at all.  Of course, gradient and stretching issues of videos depend on the video quality, not the device's makeup.  COMMUNITY: Zune has Wi-Fi that lets you send files to other Zune devices.  When I heard, I was quietly exubrant [read:"WoOT WoOt"-ing] all the way to Sam's Club, but then a painful realization set in: I don't know anybody else with a Zune.  Later on, though, I did meet someone. There are 3-day/3-play restrictions on songs, though [...] can easily teach you how to hack that feature. Only twice have I lost wi-fi connection. Otherwise, the wi-fi feature is FUN.   HOW THE DEVICE FEELS: It has a smooth, rubbery skin that basically immune to scratching and fingerprints.  The screen is as vulnerable as any other device's, of course, but a good screen cover for $10 or less can easily solve the problem.  It is a bit heavier and thicker than the iPod, though not by much, and besides, Zune's just FEEL better in your hands.  BATTERY LIFE: Can't complain.  Get a car charger.  Shouldn't 8-10 hours of Zune-ing be enough for you?  'Tis for me.  THE FINAL WORD: Zune is wonderful.  And though iPod may be the mainstream, Zune is its smaller, hipper alternative.

<Content>Oh my word! I called ZUNE support and was expecting "thune teckonall soppot". Nope, I got a FRIENDLY guy who speaks FLUENT ENGLISH! He helped me out with my problem(You have to finish a sync before you can delete stuff from the Zune.) I called at 12:10 AM EST January 1, 2007 and the WHOLE CALL took less than three minutes. I have never used an IPOD but I am very pleased with the ZUNE.

<Title>Zunes good for me
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would have to say that the Zune is a a pretty great Mp3/Video player..I agree with all the other positive reviews of this item. One thing that I would complain about is the software that comes with it, it IS a little tedious to work with..say when you delete something from your library  it automaticly deletes it from the Zune..but I have heard that Itunes also does this..Also when you import you audio files into the software you may need to mess around with the track names/album names because I sometimes get two of the same folders on my Zune. Either way I am pleased with the Zune.

<Title>Examine merits, not focus on brands
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Brand loyalty isn't always a bad thing - but putting it above the merits of the actual products can be a mistake.  As some background - the Zune is not my first MP3 player. I started with one of the original Zen Jukeboxes, then an iPod Nano, chosen for their merits rather than the brand. Apple, Microsoft, and Creative all make good products! I bought a Zen Vision M very recently, but wound up exchanging it after trying a friend's Zune.   The Zune is a very good player. Unfortunately, it's starting at a real disadvantage, and it's 99% to do with the company name. Microsoft have come out with an excellent first model - and if the player were made by anyone else, I believe reviews would be much more favorable.   The hardware and the feature set are solid. You aren't buying into the equivalent of a 1st generation iPod here; thanks to Apple, Creative, and others, media player technology has stabilized considerably, and it's clear Microsoft have studied other brands and invested a lot of time into developing the Zune.  Pros:  - The screen is very large, bright, and clear. I've enjoyed watching videos on here much more than on the Zen Vision M or the iPod video. - There's no scrollwheel, but the controls are very intuitive. I do miss the wheel sometimes, but equally I don't find myself accidentally slamming the volume up to max.  - The Windows software is actually pretty good. Much better than the Creative software bundled with the Zen, not as good as iTunes though.  - Swapping music is neat! Tried it out and a whole album transferred in about 2 minutes. The downside: the person receiving the song can only play it three times before it expires. This is kind of inevitable though; unrestricted music exchange doesn't fit the current business model. - I really like the interface. Looks more professional than the Zen Vision (no comic sans style font!), large and easy to read, and it's easy to navigate. The icon display of album covers is terrific. However, they need to alter the full screen display of album art - the software just stretches thumbnail size pictures to fill the screen and it's very pixelated. - The built-in radio is a really nice touch, and I've had no problems with reception. Rumor is that XM radio will be integrated, which would be an awesome addition. - Stylish design. Not sure why they picked brown as a launching colour - but the player itself is sleek, and the matte finish doesn't show fingerprints (the iPod, though gorgeous, made me feel like a clumsy greasy human). The Zune is on the large side, but comparable with other 30GB players, and most of the space is taken up by the screen. - Support. This is Microsoft, they won't vanish overnight - and as a software company, they'll be releasing regular updates.  Cons: - Only works with Windows right now. My Macbook in OSX mode doesn't even recognise it - so if you're just using OSX, you should definitely wait. There's a third party program that currently supports reading the Zune filesystem, but that's about it. Linux support probably won't take too long though. Creative players have the same problem, as I found out with the Zen Vision! - Syncing sucks. Unforunately it seems pretty much standard; the iPod does the same thing, though in both cases there are ways to circumvent it. I suspect it's a DRM related thing, but I don't understand why both Apple and MS believe I need to keep the full contents of my MP3 player on my computer. - DRM, DRM, DRM. Again, though, this is not just a Zune issue. Music from iTunes only works on iPods, music from MS Marketplace only works on Zune, and if you buy your songs elsewhere it probably won't work on either. Horribly confusing. If you have a large library of bought tracks, stick with whatever brand you're using. Personally I rip most of my music from my CDs; no DRM and it works on any player. - No support for using the Zune as a hard drive. There's an easy hack available, but native support should have been there (the Zen has it!) - No native podcast support. Maybe this will be added later, but it should have been there at the start. You can download podcasts via iTunes or third party programs, and just transfer the files across, but it shouldn't have to be that complicated. - The software is still new and needs work. Microsoft are at heart a software company though, so I expect frequent updates. I suspect they'll be better on this front than Creative. - File formats - I seem to have this problem with other players too. I'm never quite sure which player supports what video format. The Zune uses WMV and MP4 exclusively for video, but it's been easy to convert most of my videos with the built-in software. However, there are a few it just can't do. - Not many accessories yet, and what's out there is far too expensive! The  iPod has many more cool toys and skins. Then again, I don't need an iDog right now :-)   Generally, I'm very impressed with the Zune. It does everything I need out of the box - music and video playback, viewing photos, FM radio, music swapping, etc. The lack of cross-platform support is a problem for non-Windows users, and I'm not sure if that will ever be fixed. However, expect the Windows support to get better and better with new software releases. Also, I suspect (and hope) that the Zune won't fall prey to the endless variations and hardware updates of the iPod. I would rather see new firmware and software updates than have to buy a whole new player, and I have a feeling this is the route Microsoft will follow.   iPod and Creative fans - if you're looking for a new player, and don't have too much DRM protected music, see if you can put aside brand loyalty and give the Zune a try. To new buyers with Windows PCs - the Zune is an excellent choice, and I doubt you'll be disappointed.

<Title>Much better than anyone says
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player was doomed from the start by the Anti-Microsoft press who dismissed it out-of-hand without giving it a fair shot.  There are problems and quirks, for example the wireless sharing is useless.  Overall though it is a solid video and music player.  The controls are very intuitive.  Video playback is excellent quality.  Battery life is very good.  Recharges quickly.  Plays all my ripped CD's without issue.  It only took me about 20 minutes to get used to the navigation buttons.  All the buttons feel solid and comfortable. Center navigation button is much better than the iPod.  Like the bluish-green tinted cover on top of the black case.  Small enough without being too small.  I think some iPods are way too small (like they are making it smaller just because they can, not necessarily because it makes it any better).  The only thing that took awhile to get used to was volume vs. skip.  Sometimes I would skip a song when I wanted to increase the volume, or turn the volume up when I wanted to skip a song.  However, after 2-3 days it was not a problem anymore.   The more I use it the more I like it.  Everyone I showed it to likes it.

<Title>Great player, software it just slightly immature...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think the player is great!!! (5 stars) It's totally worth the money.   Screen: The screen in unbelievable. It's better than some laptop screens I've seen. Seriously, the screen looks just like it does in the picture. And it plays video really well. The screen is big enough to actually watch it without having to squint.  Sound: Perfect. You can't really add any effects, which would be nice, but it's sound is great.  Earbuds: suck. I have small ears I guess, but I couldn't get the damn things to stay in. They constantly fell out of my ears. But I think they are probably comparable to the ipod buds. (I have never owned an ipod so I can't be sure.) I finally went and bought a pair of sony earbuds that fit great. $(20)  Software: So/so. There are a few things I don't like about the software (I also have zune marketplace, which I'll talk about seperately below.) The biggest thing I don't like is that zune really wants you to have the music also on your computer. It doesn't like syncing without it. I tried it without and somehow ended up wiping everything off my zune. Another time, I had stuff on my computer I didn't have on my zune, and it wiped everything off my computer. Very strange. So, it's a bit rigid in that respect. What if you don't have 30 gig of space you can devote to music on your computer? That's not a small amount of space!!! Also, it lacks a few things that I was used to with winamp. For example, winamp could remove duplicates. Zune can't. Also, another weird thing is that if you don't delete stuff right, it will keep showing up again. For example, I download a song, play it, don't like it. If I delete it from the player, but not from my computer, it will keep showing up on my player everytime I sync. So, I have to delete it twice, both from my player and again from my library. Stupid. Also, the more playlists you have, the longer syncing takes because it takes a while for the zune to figure out that it's already on the player. What if you want to just play a song in the software using a playlist, but not copy it to the player. You can't do that. I'm sure the next rev of the software will take care of a lot of this, but everytime I use the software, it's seems a bit rigid. It also takes a little while to figure out where the advanced settings are.    All in all though, I love it.

<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was waiting for the perfect HDD MP3 player with built in radio and i think i found it.  Feels is great.  Screen is awesome!  Love watching movies on it.  Can get in almost 4 hours of straight movies!  I keep the screen on the dimmest setting and it is still way bright.    Bummer is i was in the a few airports over the holidays and was unable to pick up other Zune users, :-(.  Of course i keep my Wi-Fi off usually too so maybe i just missed someone.   Overall i am very happy with the device.  I like the fact i can customize the background.  I have 4 full length DVD's (converted to mp4, so only .7GB per), tons of pics and tons of music.  Interface is easy and smooth.   Installation of software went smooth, as compared to other users who said it fubard their machines.  Takes a little getting used to with syncing correctly and such but after a little bit works fine.  Very nice product.

<Content>I'm really disappointed with what appears to be misleading promotional material and packaging language which indicates that the Zune is compatible with Windows XP.  However, it is NOT compatible with Windows Media Player XP with 2002 or 2004 versions.  This should be made very clear.  While my temptation is to return the Zune for a refund, I've ordered a 2005 version of windows media player xp and hope that it works.  Wish me luck!

<Title>Love my Zune
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely love my Zune.  My husband gave it to me on Christmas.  He downloaded my baby boy's pictures to it so I now carry it in my purse like a photo album, and he downloaded a bunch of my favorite songs including our wedding song..."The Gift."    Not being very technologically minded I figured out how to use the friendly interface immediately, I even figured out how to download more songs and categorize them by what I plan to use the music for like exercising, relaxing, etcetera.    This is my first MP3, but only because my husband and I refuse to buy an Ipod product we just aren't MAC fans.  We are Microsoft people...we like their products and enjoy using the Zune with our X-Box 360.    The only downside is that I bought the Belkin athletic strap so that I could take my Zune to the gym.  The strap is great and the cover is made of a nice rubbery material that can be easily washed off...the only thing that I noticed was that the Zune wiggled a little on my arm as I worked out on the elliptical trainer, treadmill, and bike when I got over 55rpms.    Other than that I would still recommend a Zune to a friend with it storage capacity and beautiful screen I will be downloading my memories, videos, and music for many years to come.

<Title>Not for people without experience with Media Player
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was recently given the black Zune for my Birthday/Christmas present. It's great for me, but I think it's not the best for people like my mother. The Zune software isn't exactly beginner friendly. The software is almost the same as the new microsoft media player that I've noticed not alot of people have yet. (You'll notice that it's completely black with blue buttons and a completely different library layout). So if you're having problems with the software, you'll have the same with the updated version of the media player.   I happy to see that the zune software interfaces with the xbox, Windows Live IDs, Microsoft Passport accounts, and windows media player. What ever I do in the media player, like add music, edit track and playlist info, add album art, it'll automatically do the same in the zune software. this is where I draw my point. you have to find and set the zune software to do this. (Press F3, select the advanced tab, and select the option).    But for the zune itself, it's okay. One time I had an issue with it not coming on. (I had paused a movie and turned it off, I had to wait to plug it up to my computer and get out of the movie to get to respond again. Fortunately, it doesn't act this for music). Great sound, beutiful picture quality, great video quality (remember it depends on the quality of the video itself), smart radio (it pulls up the genre and motto of select radio stations), and I can't wait to be able to share music with other people.  The only thing that really sucks about this thing is that it doesn't play avi!! I've got so many movies and episodes of Heroes that I want to be able to carry with me!

<Title>I really WANTED to like it...
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear that I really wanted to like the Zune.  I am a microsoft girl.  I owned a mac once, but only for about 2 months before I cut my losses and sold it on ebay to replace it with a PC.  After doing a lot of research, I decided that I wanted a Zune as opposed to an ipod.  I am only mildly computer literate, and I've never had an mp3 player before.  I purchased the Zune and was really excited to get it home.  Unfortunately, my excitement ended almost as soon as I got it out of the box.  The software took forever to install.  Once it was up and running, a lot of my files wouldn't import.  The Zune pamphlets state that "most" of your iTunes files can be imported, however, they fail to state that no files that you purchased from iTunes will transfer.  If you have much of anything invested in iTunes downloads, this is bad news for you!  I didn't have a whole lot invested, so I started exploring the Zune marketplace.  Maybe I'm just really computer illiterate, but I couldn't find anything but music and music videos.  If you're someone who wants to use TV shows, movies, or even audiobooks, the Zune is not a very good choice.  Assuming that I just didn't know how to do it, I got my husband to mess around with it because he's much more computer literate than I am.  After about 2 hours of experimentation and research, we gave up.  I took my Zune back and exchanged it for the 30G iPod, which I had completely set up with everything in less than an hour.  It's not that the Zune is bad, it's just that if you have much invested in  iTunes, it's not worth it.  I also found the Zune software and marketplace to be pretty unfriendly.  Sorry, microsoft.  I have to go with apple on this one.  I have no doubt that it will only take another generation or two for them to top apple, but it's just not there yet.

<Title>Zune: A Comprehensive Review
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Alright, I've been using my Zune for well over a week now. I did research to ensure that my digital content would work with the Zune, and considered it relative to the 30gb Ipod, the rival to the Zune (as opposed to music only Ipods).  When it comes down to it, you have to consider what you want to use it for. If you want *only music* then you might be better off with an Ipod. If you want video too, then the Zune is probably a better choice.  Digital Content: Started with my music and video collection. I converted my Itunes songs to MP3 version. There are a variety of conversion programs that enable mass conversion. These programs also convert Itunes based video content such as TV shows or movies you might have purchased.  But for those who prefer free conversion methods, there is the option of ripping your music to CD and then burning to the hard drive to create MP3 files.  Windows Media Player will assist you with this.    The key here is that you should be free to use your songs on whichever player you want. Apple has refused to open up the Itunes format to other hardware devices, effectively locking Itunes users in unless they go through one of the above mentioned methods of conversion (which can either cost money to do or can be very time consuming if you have a large collection).  Zune Software: The biggest issue with the Zune has been the software. Microsoft (MS) released a number of fixes in a recent software update, including support for Windows Vista, which releases at the end of the month. One of the main goals of this release was to support smoother installation of the Zune software. This was a common problem mentioned in the earlier reviews of the Zune that has been addressed somewhat.  Because the software is new, there are some compatability issues still. I had a Windows XP Media Center 2002 PC, as mentioned by another user, and Zune will NOT install on that OS. It will work with most XP operating systems, but not that version.  I'm currently running a Windows XP MCE 2005 right now, and the Zune software installed easily on here. If you purchased a PC in the last two years, you should be fine.  In addition, it is worth noting that the Zune software shares media content with the XBOX 360. Essentially, your PC can act as an extended hard drive by storing hundreds of songs and videos which stream (wirelessly, assuming you have a router) to the 360 and play off of it, but don't need to actually be stored on the 360 hard drive. This is great if you like playing music during games or even just to play off of your TV stereo system.  The Zune software has a good number of options you can select, incouding what to stream to the 360 and how to handle the importing of videos and music. It will convert a small handful of video file formats into WMV, but the Zune itself, although it accepts some of these other formats (like MP4), again, will only actually play WMV format for video.  There are a number of converters to asssit you with this online.  They also have DVD burners which set up your DVD collection for viewing on your Zune screen. They set at the optimal 320X240 resolution and in WMV format.  The Zune Hardware: This is by far the strength of the Zune. For those who are knowledgeable enough to manage their file content, they can take advantage of what is probably the best hardware on the market. It offers more than any other single player.  Here are the key reasons: -Customizeable backgrounds -Simple to use D-pad with an enter button in the center (why would you want a click wheel when you can use the D-pad that most users have been using on controllers for the last two decades). -LARGER SCREEN (Common sense move for MS here. Why does the Ipod have all that extra room on the bottom to support the click wheel? MS took the extra space and turned it into space that can be used to watch movies and display album art) -FM Radio (The Creative Zen M comes with an FM radio also. The Ipod charges you extra for it. What's really cool is that it displays the genre and song information if the station supports that.)  The "doubleshot" design of the Zune is very cool too. It's best viewed in a daylight situation. For me, I have the Brown Zune which lets off a green glow around it. It's like a transparent outer case, in a sense. It is NOT an LED light, as some people have understood it. The Black Zune comes with the blue doubleshot, which I'm sure is really cool too.  Bonus Round: Two things that allow users to try out music without making any commitment. One is the WIFI sharing feature of the Zune. As you probably know, you get up to 3 plays in up to 3 days. People complain about the restriction, but it's something that no one else even offers. This can only be a positive for MS relative to other developers like Apple.  The second would be the Zune Subscription service. Many users enjoy a subscription, and this serves them well. MS currently offers a 14 day trial for the marketplace with the purchase of a Zune. Be aware that once a subscription is cancelled, any music taken under that subscription will no longer be useable. If you intend to keep an active subscription, then you have nothing to worry about.  Future outlook: Software problems are the only issues to point out. And as we all know, software can be upgraded and fixed over time. In fact, MS is known for supporting their products well after release.  The WIFI possibilities in particular are especially interesting, as MS might add WIFI purchases or adjust the restrictions on WIFI sharing between Zunes or WIFI synching with the PC.  Overall, it offers more on a per dollar basis than the equivalent Ipod. The softrware requires some getting used to and a bit of patience and technical experience at times. But in the end, even if MS never again updated the Zune software, it beats the current Itunes players on the market with the larger screen alone.  Feel free to ask some quesitons or assistane if you have or are considering buying one. As I actually own a Zune, unlike some other reviewers on here, I don't mind to assist.

<Title>I too wanted to like it.
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Zune for a gift. I was very excited, the Zune has a larger screen, it is thicker and more durable than the ipod and it has the radio tuner. After spending 2 days trying to download the software and many many phone calls to their technical support (which by the way is less than helpful) I decided to return it and get the 30gb ipod that was set up in less than 1/2 an hour. I love my ipod however I wish that the Zune was a lot easier to use and transfer my Grey's Anatomy episodes on. Tech support told me that it really is developed for mainly music right now and eventually in the future their marketplace will offer movies and tv shows. Unfortunately by the time that happens there will probably be a newer version of the Zune and this one would be absolete.

<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have found the Zune to be a rather easy product to use.  I have used my sisters iPod a few years ago and I found that it was easier for me to load my songs into the Zune then when I was loading songs into her iPod.  The only complaint that I have had with the Zune is that once during usage my "home" computer recognized my only Zune as being a Zune with a different computer as its home computer.  However, I think this may be because when I first hooked up the Zune to my computer, my computer was not hooked up to the Internet - the next time I hooked up the Zune to my laptop it was connected to the Internet.  Since that moment I have had no problems.    I like the big screen and the fact that it displays album art while the screen is on.  The sound is good and the menus are easy to manuever around.  Also, I have been able to take songs from my sisters iTunes playlist and play them on my Zune (however, not all of the songs that i tried).  Not really sure how that works.    Off topic, my car has an aux input and I can plug my Zune right into my deck and it sounds amazing!

<Title>An excellent product
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the Zune. I got the brown one (the case has a translucent exterior giving a doubleshot of green around the edge when viewed in the right light). I wanted something like this and pretty much knew I needed to have video.  When compared to the other choices I wanted to make sure I did not have to convert my library over (its 50% WMA and 50% MP3) and that it did decent video. I also wanted FM. The obvious choice was the Creative Zen Vision. Alas I am not the type to buy something expensive without first checking it out. I was never able to see one. No Brick and Mortar store carried one for me to look at. So I delayed for months before bying anything. Then I got an opportunity to play with the Zune. Here is what I liked.  Its a good form factor for me. I know people love their skinny iPods but for me that would encourage putting in places it will get bent and none of these devices do well with that! Also, I like the size of it because my hands are big and I have something to hold on to.  I like the big wide screen but don't be fooled, its still a 4:3 ratio and not 16:9. The best films to rip are fullscreen not wide screen. I've used the AVS DVDtoGO software for that. The picture quality is great. Very colorful and sharp. The size of the screen means my eyes can see it well.  The software is good. It takes a bit of getting used to. I was expecting to drag and drop files onto a file system but that isn't how the Zune works. You create a library and it synchronizes. You get a lot of options on how you want to view this library and you get a lot of options on how you create playlists. It took a while to figure out how to keep some files off the Zune (like screenshots for work that I had in My Pictures) but once you figure it out it makes sense.  The sound quality is excellent and the reception on the FM radio is also excellent! It uses RDS to get song information and station identification. The interface is very clean and easy to use.  Things that are missing that you should know about: The Zune cannot act as a USB hard drive. This is probably a big surprise to many. Also, the Zune cannot record either voice via microphone or its Digital FM signal.  I like the Zune quite a bit. Its easy to use and shows quality workmanship. There are some missing features and the software has a short learning curve but for me the combination of its advantages are a real bonus.

<Content>Wow, where to begin. First of all you can't use it as a portable hard drive. Second of all, in order to download music and videos from the zune marketplace you have to subscribe 15 bucks a month for music I can't even burn on a cd and if I stop a subscription all the music puchased from the marketplace will delete itself. Also Apple has more content on iTunes, almost a million more songs than the zune marketplace including countless movies, tv shows, podcasts, and games. Also, the software to sync the zune is faulty and has connection ploblems with the zune. Furthermore, no way Microsoft will ever challenge Apple in this area. The ipod just has too big of a fanbase for the zune to take on, that and iTunes is pretty much the industry standard. The zune is too soon and I feel sorry for anyone who got this hunk of donkey poo for Christmas.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I feal really sorry for the crap that the Zune has been getting. At first look the Zune is big,bulky, and dull looking. It also kind of has a small hard drive and the Zune software isnt as good as Itunes. The actual deivce itself is amazing. I have gotten 4.5 hours of VIDEO ONLY. Where the Ipod I tested would get around 2 hours. The screen is amazing. It plays movies EXCELLENT. The Zune will last 8 hours of music or 4.5 hours of video easy. Very impressive for a big screen. My opinion is the Zune is EXCELLENT for video and good for music. If you want only music, buy the Ipod Nano, if you want video and music by the Zune hands down. I will get the whole fight of the online thing out of the way... its a joke. Dont even bother with it. The Zune is good for music, movies, pictures, and FM Radio(HUGE PLUS). The sound quality is good and the size of the device isnt that big considering the screen size. Overall, buy this device if you want video as well as music.

Features lacked compared Ipod Zune cannot be used to copy data from your PC Zune doesnt have screen lock protection Calender is missing And offcourse the touch menu is amazing in ipod. I would rate this product 3 but no where near Ipod. Recent update: July 17th 2007 I hardly used not more than 8 time in 9 months but fully charged Zune goes down in 30 min while playing vedio but my ipod lasts much better despite its almost 1.4 years

<Title>Good mp3 player. Not perfect by any means.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I personally like my music in flac which I rip myself just how I like it and this is how I play it on my computer. To get it to play on my Zune I need to transcode it all overnight into mp3 which isn't even the best lossy format around (maybe it was 10 years ago) and copy it over using the proprietary software provided by Microsoft. The software is TERRIBLE, it's hard to use slow, crashes, and it's made by Microsoft (this is a bad thing in itself). After that I thought I could safely delete the mp3's from my computer as there is no need for them as I use flac on computer. BIG MISTAKE. Next time I go to add a new album I click "Start Sync" and all the music I had on the mp3 player disappeared!  One last bad note: NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK AS YET.  Although it does have its bad points there are a few good things as well for example the radio I use every day which is the main reason I didn't get an ipod. The user interface is well laid out and easy to use (surprisingly).  Overall I rate the Zune >= Ipod. Creative probably would have been a very close second. I urge everyone interested in buying an mp3 player to look at Creative's mp3 players before making their decision.

<Content>I bought the Zune for my 13 yr old son for Christmas.  He loves it.  The only problem was that the screen cracked within the first two days but Amazon blazed a replacement in three days.  The set up was awkward at first, typical Microsoft obtuseness, with circular registration errors (can't register that email address because it's already in use!!) but the second Zune was registered by my son, on his own, and that is a computer technology milestone.  We hope to see more Zune docking options as is availalble for iPods.  This product is better than iPod with the larger screen and more options.  We have iPod in the house to compare and we love the new Zune.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to love the Zune, heck i love my xbox 360, and i really wanted to love the Zune.  I opened the box and was extreamly happy at first.  Then after several hours i found myself listening to music off my wifes ipod and boxing the Zune back up.    Why might you ask..........  Simple  I already send quite a bit of money to Microsoft each year for Xbox live.  I flat out refuse to pay a monthly fee for something from Microsoft just for music.   Heck i dont download music all that often, and with itunes im not stuck paying a fee each month.  The screen isnt as big a deal as i thought it would be either though the backgrounds were really nice to have.    Bottom line while it was nice to have backgrounds and such it wasnt enough to warrent keeping it.  That said if you have the money to spend and you download music all the time this is a great alternative to the ipod.

<Title>worthless warranty
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>One week after Christmas my teenage son broke the screen on his Zune, he really wasn't abusing it, but none the less it broke. My call to Microsoft's warranty center was very frustrating, the very polite gentleman who was clearly in a foreign country and spoke very poor english informed me that this type of problem is not covered by the warranty and the cost to repair was essentially the cost of a new Zune. He didn't have to see it, he didn't have to ask any questions it appeared he had a set answer for just about everything and the impression I got was no matter what the problem the warranty didn't cover it. I saw the way it broke and the screen on these is quite fragile so be very careful with it, Bill Gates can't afford to fix it.

<Title>Nice start - not enough
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the Zune for a few weeks, just after they were released.  I have to say that the unit was a nice size, not too big and not too small.  The lack of any buttons anywhere took me by surprise, but after a while I got used to doing everything using the rocker-wheel and the two buttons on the front.  I really liked the interface, finding music was easy, scrolling up and down the songlist/albums/artists sped up the longer you held the button(s) down, you can go back and forth to switch from Albums to Artists to Songs to Playlist, etc.  The screen was a nice size, and I thought the video quality was good enough.  What I didn't like about the Zune involved 3 things.  1) you have to use the Zune software to synch music to the player (vice using WMP 10/11), 2) you can't play PlaysForSure music (essentially locking you into the MS Marketplace online store), and 3) would only play WMV video files, and the Zune sw didn't seem to auto-convert anything (unlike WMP 10/11).  One other note about the Zune sw.  After the initial sync with the player, it would no longer sync.  It would recognize the Zune and connect, but didn't seem to work.  I ended up having to install the Zune sw on my wife's computer and do all the syncs.  Not sure if it was a local issue or a more pervasive problem.  Btw, I returned the Zune and, since the Zune is made by Toshiba (with a few tweaks), I ended up purchasing a Toshiba MES60V instead which (for the most part) worked just like the Zune without the glitches and useless Wifi.  And it's a bit smaller but double the HD space (60GB).

<Title>Something to consider when deciding which music player you'd like
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a good start towards applying new concepts toward the portable music industry. Wireless sharing is an awesome concept, but it's ridiculous in application for 2 reasons:   1. The songs you share to other Zunes expire after 3 days or 3 plays. The Zune then remembers what song it was, and will not allow it to be retransferred. It doesn't matter if the files are not DRM protected. IT DOESN'T MATTER. Ridiculous.   2. With Apple holding a 72.5% market share as opposed to Microsoft's measly 13%.... how likely is it that you're even going to run into anyone who HAS a Zune that you can share with? Not very likely.   I'm not even going to get into the fiasco with the digital rights management that renders the Zune incompatible with Microsoft's OWN technology - PlaysForSure - or the fact that pretty much alone amidst drive-based players, the Zune cannot be used as a portable hard drive.   Learn about this product and its many shortcomings before deciding to purchase one. There is plenty of potential in the product, which may be rectified in further revisions, but as of now it's a very poor music player with limited real advantages and a sad multitude of "might-have-beens".

<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased 2 of these units for my 14yr old twins for Christmas. I had dowloaded the software earlier to see how it would work, Had no problems with the install in XP Home. This is the most reviewed product I have ever bought, lots of opinions from what seem to be Apple shills, that it is not very good.  It is good. Works as advertized. The music that you can download through the Zune market place is vast. I would like to see some video for download but that is coming and I have found a small free program that I can use for that.  The software only lets you have 2 Zunes assigned to it at one time on one computer. I found that I could use another computer to add another. As this product matures I understand that it can be software upgraded to do more. Read some of the forums to see what may be coming. Competive price, well made ect. I have no regrets that I bought the units.

<Title>Spend your dough on an iPod instead
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before you assume I'm some apple fanboy, let me just state first that this is my first mp3 player purchase ever.  I've never owned another mp3 player product.  I bought this item 2 days ago and I am considering returning it for the comparable 30GB video iPod.  First, I purchased this over my lunch break at work and tried to sync it with my work computer.  I am running windows Vista 64 and their software is not compatible with 64bit os's (c'mon MS...).  So I loaded it onto my laptop running regular windows xp and copied all of my music over.  4 hours later and 3 support phone calls, I determined their software does not work behind an internet firewall.  So I take the device home with no music on it.  Once I got home, I had to set up the software on my second pc because my main pc is loaded with xp64.  The biggest challenge was finding a way to get the music on my main pc to the device because my second pc did not have near enough hdd space to just copy all my music over.  I had to tweak xp to redirect the My Documents folder to point to my main pc over the network and basically fool the software to sync my music over the network.  Once I was done with that, I spent another few hours trying to set up my playlists and determine what I want synced.  Honestly, their software is mediocre at best.  I understand the need to make it easy for people to plug the device in and copy music effortlessly, but what about consumers like myself who want to selectively add music?  I have a vast collection of music and I do not want it all on the device.  I had to spend a lot of time configuring the software to sync the music I wanted.    So, almost 24 hours after I bought it, I finally had the music collection that I wanted synced to the device. I also converted a few of my video's and synced those to see how it would look playing through my xbox.  So I went to plug it into the xbox to play music and video through it and learned it needs a dashboard firmware update which you can only get through Xbox Live.  Well I don't have xbox live and I refuse to spend the money to put the thing on the internet just so I can use my zune with it.  I have no interest in using xbox live and I feel that microsoft should have included a disc or other means of updating the firmware without having to do it over their live service.  So frustrated, I take the thing and plug it back into my second pc to let it charge while I sleep.  I woke up this morning excited to take it to work and learned that for whatever reason, all of the music on the device had been erased.  Because it took nearly 4 hours to sync the first time (once I got the software issues straightened out) due to file format conversions, I had to leave it at home to sync again.  Another weird issue I had was that my car alarm seemed to reset the device whenever I'd disable it and get in the car...  So to recap - Their software is buggy and needs a lot of work.  They need to include more codecs to support more file formats.  They need an alternative method of updating the xbox 360's firmware for customers who do not use live.  Their software is not user-friendly at all.  Sure, if you want to sync every single music, video and picture file you have to the device, it's easy to use.  But if you don't want that, it's very cumbersome to selectively sync the media you want.  From what I have found, you cannot use it for any data other than media.  It's a 30GB hard drive...  I'd like to use it to store other data and not just media.  You cannot delete media from the device itself.  Why?  So honestly, for $250, spend your money on a tried and true product - The Apple iPod.

Pros - Big screen, radio, wifi(barley use), most of all its durable and  stable.   Cons - bulky(don't recommend for exercise), battery life (i tend to skip a whole lot so i'm usually lucky if it lasts me 6hrs. btw forget about watching movies. i would ratther have a smaller screen with a better battery life), not compatible with windows media player.

<Title>Don't believe the haters.
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't believe the haters, this a good, (although not spectacular), product. I got this for Christmas and wanted to give a thorough try before reviewing it. So far, it has been a good product that has performed exactly as advertised.  To start, I have never owned an IPOD, although I have bought 2 for my wife, (and she loves them), but I cannot personally see how the Apple product differs that significantly after discussing and comparing the items with my wife. The Zune has taken almost every postive Apple innovation and incorporated it into the Zune. The only real difference is the WiFi, (which I shut off immediately), that I have no interest in other than if I needed to interface with my home wireless network.  I have my entire CD collection on the device and have subscribed to the Zune music service enabling me to sample and add to my music collection. I had no problems with software setup, have experienced no issues with playback, syncing, etc. If you are reasonably computer literate, the Zune should pose no great hurdles for the average user.  I have especially liked the way the device integrates seamlessly into my wireless network, Xbox 360, and Windows Media Center software. I agree with the complaints about battery life. Turning off the WiFi helps, but you can also get the Belkin "TunePower" accessory to significantly increase usage time, although at significantly increased cost.  Bottom line, could the Zune be better? Yes, but then again, (gasp, here comes what some may consider sacrilege), so could the Ipod. Basically, it just comes down to the vagaries of personal preference and what you are comfortable with. If you are like me, a first time high end buyer with a focus on Windows PC and Windows Media Player Experience, the Zune should definitely be considered a viable option.  Don't believe all of the hysterical, biased reviews that loudly proclaim how terrible this product is. These extremist views, (as are most others- no matter the subject), are not based on facts but emotions. You are better off making a decision and a purchase based on solid, well reasoned information.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune 30 gb digital media player for my husband for Christmas as an upgrade from his iPod.  Unfortunately, no where in the information did it say we would have to update our Windows Media (even though our computer is only 2 years old).  This is going to cost us an additional $[...] on top of the price of the Zune.  Needless to say, it's now mid January and we still haven't updated our Windows Media, so he still can't use the Zune.  I wish Amazon had explained that before I purchased it or I would not have purchased it.

<Title>Great player w/ some bugs -- NOT good for a Mac user
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zune for christmas, and was pretty pleased with it, but unfortunately it just wasnt for me. Here's the major pros and cons  I saw with the device.   PROS:  - High quality large screen - Intuitive and elegant interface - Aesthetic hardware - Easy navigation + controls - Radio - Nice carrying case  CONS:  - Incredibly slow sync from Zune software (PC) to device --- Im not embellishing, probably 10 minutes for 100 songs.  - Zune software is hard to install, crashes intermittently, and very slow. - Zune Marketplace has very limited titles - Very hard to sync an entire iTunes library to Zune software - Almost impossible to sync iTunes library from Mac onto Zune software - Headphone jack is a tiny bit small  * My zune, which I believe might of had a defect for this to happen, skipped ALL THE TIME. Probably one of each 5 songs skipped at least once, and it often went over that.   * I was frustrated to tears trying to get my music from my iMac to my PC, using my 60 GB hard drive...  All in all, the Zune is a glorified version of the Gigabeat. Its interface is beautiful but may not be worth the trouble of syncing and using the Zune software. For now I am sticking to iPods, which I would say hardware wise are on-par with Zune (click wheel)-- but are an amazing relief when it comes to syncing and using iTunes.

<Title>Sad
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a zune. Impulse by that I regretted. It has a beautiful interface. Love that I can have my own backgrounds and the screen was wonderful. But I was calling tech support 10 mins after taking it out the box. It took over an hour to update because the software froze. Once I got it updated and start the software it crashed. I have over 6gb of song and it took 30 mins to get it all on. Trying to get video on was a horrible experience. I first converted it to wmv thinking then the software wouldn't have to. Wrong, I had to leave it on over night because even though the video was already in the correct format it still converted it.  I also have a 60g iPOD and it takes no where near as long. Last draw was the battery, if I got more than 3 hours out of it I was doing good. Thats just playing music with the wifi off. So I decide to stick to my iPOD i was gonna give it to my friend. All this happened within the first week so I was able to take it back and I got a Wii instead. Only good thing that came out of this

<Content>At first, the software would not load properly onto my puter which was a little frustrating, but after contacting a Zune technical support staff member, he quickly had me re-configure my computer to accept the software and away I could go. Since then, I'm still in a learning curve, but I enjoy the FM radio and the synchronized music transfer from my puter.

<Title>Zune better than Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the new 30mb Zune for my wife at christmas.  I did a lot of research before buying and compared the Microsoft Zune, Creative Zen Video:M, and Ipod Video.  In my opinion, both the Zen and Zune had much more to offer than the Ipod.  The Zune has a brilliant screen and an scratch resistent finish.  I didn't want to be forced to use Apple's music and video file types, which was the main reason for choosing the Zune.  It accepts standard MP3 and AVI formats and uses Windows Media Player 11 to organize the files.  It has limited wireless capability which is basically worthless unless you have someone else with a Zune to talk to.  Micorsoft should have had the wifi communicate with wireless networks with an internet browser like the Sony PSP.  It does have FM radio as well.  I just wish it had an integral FM transmitter so you could play it through your car stereo without dropping another 80 bucks on a car kit.

<Title>Zune or iPOD - how to choose?
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to get my wife a media player for Xmas.  I've owned one iPOD (a GenIII version, with a B/W display).  Naturally I looked at the new video iPOD, and read several supposedly un-biased reviews.  I also went to the Zune forums to read real user feedback.  Obviously it's limited, since the device is so new.  So...  Today Apple just announced it sold about a zillion iPODs last year (and iTunes crashed the day after Xmas due to all the traffic).  You'll find that the Apple owners/users tend to be a rather vocal bunch.  There is MUCH negative press against the Zune by the Apple faithful.  I'm an engineer, and view computers as tools and phones and other's gizmo's based upon slightly different criteria than many consumers might (I design consumer electronic products for a living).  Hopefully that means I'm not as biased as the Apple "fanboys" as they're known on the forums.  So - the bottom line:  If you don't have a HUGE library of purchased iTunes (i.e. Apple DRM protected) songs, take a serious look at the Zune.  My wife had NEVER used an MP3/media player before and finds the Zune user interface intuitive.  She quite likes the product overall (but has not used an iPOD for comparison).  The iTunes conversion process was fairly seamless for the 600+ songs I had on my iPOD (again, these were "ripped" from CD's not iTunes purchases so there were no DRM issues).  I loaded the Zune with over 8000 photos (which did take quite a while) as well.  That, in my opinion is where the Zune really shines compared to the iPOD!  I looked at both, side-by-side in Best Buy, and the MUCH larger (44% bigger) display on the Zune makes the device MUCH more suitable to view pictures.  The Zune is FAST too.  It plays music WHILE simultaneously playing a picture slideshow, all without missing a beat.  Unless Zune takes off (or Microsoft does something interesting with future updates), don't consider the "social" aspect in your decision (i.e. the built-in WiFi).  For now, I have it shut off to extend battery life.  Maybe someday my wife will be swapping pictures and songs on the train with other Zune-enabled commuters (wishful thinking on Microsoft's part).  Zune Pros: 1)	Excellent display for picture/movie viewing. 2)	Powerful hardware (processor and chipset) - ripe for "upgraded" features. 3)	Support from Microsoft.  Ok, some might consider this a "con", but Microsoft IS the largest software company in the world.  Look at what happened with the Xbox - nobody took it seriously in the beginning (and Microsoft lost buckets of money on it).  Microsoft kept plugging away, making refinements, and software updates.  Now the 2nd gen Xbox360 appears to be a pretty good product (I don't have one, so that's a 2nd hand opinion). Zune Cons: 1)	Unknown hardware reliability!  Ok, it's made by Toshiba, but the pictures online of the "innards" (yes, some brave soles have opened their Zunes) don't look all that good compared to the iPOD.  In tech. terms the Zune isn't nearly as integrated (again, it's a 1st gen. device).  If Zune's start dying after a few months the game will be over for Microsoft! 2)	PC software is pretty poor (again, 1st gen.) compared to iTunes.  It is PAINFULLY slow in converting pictures.  Since Microsoft chose to use their OWN server to get album information (i.e. NOT Gracenote as used by iTunes, and pretty much everybody else), much of the time album art/info. is simply not available, and/or the server is "busy".  This needs to be fixed before the Zune will appeal to the iPOD toting masses! 3)	Poor compatibility???  Well, actually the iPOD isn't exactly an "open" system.  It's just that since Apple owns 80% of the market, they can set the standards.   The Zune can probably play most any type of audio/video file you'd like (again, EXCEPT for iTunes DRM protected music) - you'll just have to go through the conversion process - for NOW! 4)	Inability to work as an external hard-disk.  Actually, from what I've seen on the Zune forums, there are "hacks" around that enable this functionality - BUT, I don't count those since it's not something the average user is going to do.  This is a STUPID oversight on the part of the Zune devl. team (if you guys read this PLEASE FIX IT ASAP)!  That said, the number of times I've actually used my iPOD as a hard drive can probably be counted on one hand!  As for some of the techie details:  In case you're wondering, Microsoft really doesn't "make" the hardware (the Zune is manufactured by Toshiba and is a derivative of their Gigabeat device).  Microsoft likely only spec'd the device and wrote the software (both for the PC host and the Zune itself).  In my opinion, Microsoft (under the leadership of their Xbox "guru") did a fantastic job in a VERY short amount of time in developing this product.  Naturally, it's NOT as mature (i.e. bug-free, fully "baked") as the iPOD (now on it's 5th generation of hardware).   I looked at the innards of both devices and determined, from a purely engineering standpoint, that the Zune's guts were more to my liking (with the exception of what looks to be questionable build quality).  Specifically the iPOD still uses a rather slow "brain" (made by a company called PortalPlayer - now owned by NVIDIA).  The Zune has quite a bit more HP "under the hood".  That may not mean anything in the short term.  In the long-run, the Zune may be able to do MUCH more than it can now, through software upgrades (Microsoft has released 3 so far).  Sadly, it appears that Mr. Jobs is too busy with his $600 iPhone to give iPOD user's the badly needed 6th gen. upgrade.  Apple has recently announced it will switch to Samsung for the "guts" of new iPODs (i.e. goodbye to the anemic PortalPlayer chips).  That might mean that the "new" iPOD will have many Zune-like features.  Then again, maybe it'll be a stripped-down iPhone (much more likely, in my opinion).  In any case, if there existed an iPOD with the Zune's large screen, AT THE SAME PRICE, I would probably have purchased that instead.  Since that unicorn doesn't yet exist, the Zune seems like the best bet - for now...

<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with the Zune Player itself, I find it easier to navigate than the Ipod, and has really good sound with a bigger screen for the video. The reason no 5 stars is the Zune software, it is not as user friendly as the Itunes, an example is the Playlist section, I would like a status bar which tells you immediately how many songs, size, and time totals are on the playlist. Right now you have to use the edit feature to find this out. But overall, an excellent product.

<Title>GREAT!!!.... Ipod killer??? not yet I think
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really love this mp3 player, it has all you need for play your media files. Easy to manage and cool interface. You can customize your wallpaper and in playback you see the album artwork on the background. The video quality is good on its wide screen. Personally I don't like the touch-wheel of the ipod, you have to get used to it to get more accurate. With the bottoms of Zune player you have better control.  Ipod killer??? not yet I think. Yeah is bigger than the ipod (not to much but is noticeable), heavier??? I don't notice it. Take knowledge that it has a bigger screen and built in Wi-fi. Is a new product, and don't expect too much accessories out there as the ipod has, but there are some cool stuff. As all Mp3 players, the earphones sucks, maybe you want to buy a better pair. Battery life???, is good about 4 hours of mp3 listening (I haven't tested with video playback yet, but obviously expect much less). I'm using the 14 day free trial Zune pass and is really good, all you can download, and if you want to play the music after the period ends you pay the affordable monthly fee of 14.99 bucks (for all you can eat???, I think is a good deal), I have found that 90% of the music is eligible to download without paying it (you have to pay some of them  or are not available). There are some downs I notice with Zune. The Wi-fi is restrictive, no other than play music, pictures and videos features (games, clock, contacts, etc), and no playsforsure compatibility (ironic isn't it???). Hopefully Microsoft will release some firmwares updates on the future regarding of this issues. Overall I think is a good gadget and I don't regret buying it. There is no point of fighting between the Ipod and Zune as many apple lovers do, so keep in mind you want to play your favorite media after all.

<Title>zune; easily navigable
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>well, i have to say, i have been nothing but happy with my zune.   set up was as easy as reading the dirrections; insert cd and then wait until it tells you to plug it in. ive heard that people have had problems wiht set up if your computer isnt updated to its most recent updates, but i run basic updating and had no problems with the set up whatsoever.  i love the fact that you name your zune. its endearing =D  overall my most favorite part of my zune is the operating system. the buttons are simple and make sence (unlike the ipod touchwheel that going around clockwise vs counter is up and down), and i find that the buttons are very accurate.   the system is very logical and easy to get the hang of. its very easy to navigate through the subcatagories.   the wireless is something i rarely use but is definatly a fun feature, especially for sharing pictures.   also i havent used the zune marketplace because i rip all my cds to my computer instead of buying mp3s...   as for the battery, i use my zune for 8 hours everyday at work and then often during my driving around at night. i charge it overnight every night and have had no issues with battery life. (i keep the wireless off)  for me, the zune is absolutly perfect and i have no complaints.

<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was excited to have an alternative to the iPod, but this is a poor designed product.   1) It syncs only half the time. My new Dell XPS system detects the Zune, but the Zune software doesn't. After rebooting it'll work. I updated the firmware, software etc, still nothing.   2) The Zune Marketplace software is looks simple, but it's slow to repond. I found albums dissapearing from my library for no reson. Adding files is very slow, and deleting songs and video is from the Zune doesn't work.  3) All videos must be converted and this s VERY SLOW. No drag/drop.  4) The Wifi feature is a joke. Not once have I used this feature because nobody has a Zune to share with.   5) No bookmarks for Audiobooks.  6) Doesn't sound as crisp as the iPod. I listened to the same track side by side and the Zune highs are muffled.   7) EQ doesn't EQ. It's either sizzle and boom or flat.

<Content>I really like the Zune.  Great interface, simple to navigate, I like the Zune software so much more than iTunes in that it's less controlling.  Will the Zune change your life and make everything better?  Probably not, but it's just an MP3 player and not your soul. It works as it should and plays music as it should and sounds good doing it.  I never thought I'd ever watch videos on a small player and the Zune has changed my mind on that (and my habits).  I've transferred many of my DVDs (using CuCuSofts program)to it and watch them all the time as I commute (via subway).

<Content>I've had my Zune since Christmas, and I absolutley love it! I wanted an ipod, but when you compare them to the Zune, the Zune wins hands down.  1) The Zune display is bigger and brighter. 2) The Zune case doesn't show every little finger print like the ipod does. 3) Zune has an FM tuner, ipod does't. I was surprised how great the FM is I've tried it in and out of the city, both with great results. 4) Share music wirelessly between Zune's.  Great sound quality, extra features and it works flawlessly. I think all the negitive reviews must be from Apple employees. The Zune is GREAT! Buy one, you'll love it too.

<Title>Beautiful Player
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was about 90% sold on an iPod, so close to purchasing it, when I evaluated the Zune's specs and found to to be superior.  So, I purchased it in Brown.  It looks great and feels great.  Controls are highly intuitive and easy to use even without looking at it while walking.  It has solid industrial design and the display is stunningly clear.  The ability to set my own background is great (Since I've got so many FF7 CDs on there, I have a picture of Aeris from the FF7-PS3 graphics test as my wallpaper right now-- she looks beautiful!), and the software is not as cumbersome for me to use as the other folks here, but I guess I'm not exactly grandma.  I've found it plays much nicer with laptops than desktops.  Also, it certainly helps if you follow the included directions to a T.  I nearly returned the thing to the store thinking it was defective, because I just decided to free-wheel my way through the initial installation.  Typical guy thing, I guess-- I generally don't read instruction manuals and such.  But here, it was critical.  Once done, I got all my music and pictures on in minutes, not hours.  Also enjoyed video quickly, too.  Seriously, I'm impressed with this device, and I say that as someone who started this skeptical of what Microsoft would do.  The only recommendation I give to Microsoft is to update the firmware and software to loosen some of the DRM restrictions.  Keep things too tight and half of users will keep away, and the other half will spend their time trying to find way to crack it.  The inability to use it as a hard drive is obviously a conscious decision on Microsoft's part to keep the DRM as locked-down as possible, but it cripples the device in a major way.  It's much better to have the device me a bit more insecure DRM-wise than to lock out a key device functionality.  Despite this, I enjoy my Zune, and I've already met others with one, and we're getting together and sharing music and other files.  It's certainly different from iPod, where if you all show up with one, you're listening to different music, while with a Zune, you're all hearing the same tunes.  The FM function is awesome, too.  I like listening to the radio from time to time to hear new music, and having the station call letters, plus the song title helps me pin down the song later to look into downloading.

<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recieved this as a birthday present, and I am really angry with microsoft. This has got to be the first and hopefully only mistake microsoft has made. The only things that make this better than an ipod is the bigger screen and the wireless zune to zune. I don't even know why microsoft made it so that it works on the same wireless b/g band as the typical wireless network. Also no one else I know of has one of these. It would be nice if I could sync with my wireless equipped laptop. The worst of all part is the interface. Microsoft has not released any of the connector specifications to car stereo manufacturers. I was forced to go to radioshack and buy a stereo analog cable. I had trouble driving with it because i had to reach over and take my eyes off the road just to change tracks, so I will just have to get along with my computer burning cd-rs with roxio. I really hate the fact that windows does not recognize it as a drive and it can only sync media from the cheezy software you have to install. I know apple bad-mouths pcs, but ipods are the best selling portable player, so they are doing something right. I will save up for an ipod and untill then, have stick with this piece of $#!^.

<Title>An Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just picked up this thing recently. The software does indeed take a bit to get use to. For me it seemed a little slow when its adding songs to the library but it is fast at syncing them. I synced 545 songs in 5 minutes and used up 3.25GB of space.   I supposse if you dont already have a well managed collection (id3 tags) then things could get hectic, but i didnt have any issues.   My only grip is the storage space is only 30GB. I have almost 10,000 mp3s that I have been aquiring for about 6 years and now I have to pick and choose which ones I want on it.  The interface is awesome and simple to use too. Video syncing is a slow process however.  Overall though I highly recommend the Zune

<Title>The Zune is fantastic!
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is an excellent mp3 player and well worth the price. The interface is exceptionally easy to use and intuitive. The 3 inch screen is fantastic for viewing videos and photos.  My boyfriend has the new 80g iPod, and we compared the two side by side. The 3 inch screen is really large compared to the iPod's. Titles are easier to read and the interface is easier to maneuver around. The Zune also has an FM transmitter. In order to get the same capability in the iPod you have to buy a bulky attachment. As I have never owned an iPod I did not have the desire to try and use the interface button as a scroll wheel, which iPod owners may be disappointed with. Problem - I don't know anyone else with a Zune so I have not been able to try the wireless feature, which does not connect to my computer. I bought the Zune with the home pack (charger, dock and remote). The home pack is well worth getting as you can just set the Zune in the dock and it charges. The remote is designed exactly like the Zune with the translucent black finish.  Also, the Brown color is beautiful. The edges "glow" green and is very visually dynamic. The Zune does not deserve any of the negative press that it has gotten.

<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a Mac user running windows on my Mac Book Pro and I chose to get the Zune to see for myself, which was better, plus, I never really liked my Ipod Video since I always thought it was too girly. The first thing I noticed was the packaging was spectacular, it wasn't just plain cardboard, it was so heavy duty, you could stand on the box without it being crushed.   The Zune video quality was twice as nice and easy to watch as that of my Ipod. The Zune Marketplace (I was kind of cautious because of the bad reviews it was getting) but i booted it up and got the Zune pass and it has been amazing, the software runs flawlessly on my Windows XP partition of my Mac Book and the Zune makes a flawless connection with the software. I always loved the Ipod, but I am a Zune person now.   It is really sad how people have been giving the zune such a bad reputation just because it is made by Microsoft. Most of these reviews are written by Ipod fans who never even owned a Zune. Also, Microsoft is not trying to compete with the shuffle or nano, so stop being so stupid by pointing out that the nano and the shuffle are ahead of it on the sales charts. The Zune is meant to compete with the Ipod Video 30gb and Microsoft only intended to get 10% of the Video Mp3 player market anyway.   As I said before, I am a diehard Mac fan and always will be, but the Zune is just better than its Ipod counterpart, it has more features, I can drop it from 2 feet off the ground without it breaking, and the screen is huge compared to my ipod video. People complain about how limited the Zune Wifi is, but Wifi is a feature that my Ipod Video doesn't have at all. I will continue to run my Zune on my Mac Book Pro with windows XP because I am not biased and the Zune is better than the Ipod 30 gb regardless of what any ipod fan (who doesn't own a zune) will say.   So, if you are considering whether to buy the Zune or the Ipod Video, but the Zune, it is flawless and a lot of the bad things people have been saying about it aren't true. I read one review where someone said that you can't set one song to repeat; false. I heard one review where they said the Zune software is buggy and does not connect well with the Zune; false. I heard one review where people say it is really heavy; ridiculous. Don't listen to biased opinions from people who don't own a zune and have nothing better to do with their lives than to make up stories about it.   It is an amazing product and I recommend it to everyone seeking a replacement for his or her Ipod Video. Remember, I am a diehard Mac fan, I really wanted to like the Ipod, but it was too feminine for me and it just turned into a fad...

<Title>Zune software is windows friendly
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have both iPod nano and June, and I have to say June software is much easier to use. It's very intuitive, just drag and drop. Unlike iTunes, Zune software allows you to create and name your playlists, which you could organize your Zune and very easy to navigate on the device.  I only have Zune for few days now, and I am very happy with it.

<Title>What a substandard piece of crap!!! Go away Zune!
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got the Zune for Christmas. Wanted an iPod, but what the heck, should not be much difference, eh? Oh, how wrong I was! Software was NOT easy to use, despite what some reviewers have said. Zune Marketplace sucks big ones. You need to prepay to buy points. Must buy points in dollar increments, but songs don't cost exact dollar amounts, so you end up with a few cents here & there that you won't be able to use fully until you buy a bunch of songs. I won't be around that long!  As for the Zune itself, it is clunky to use and looks like a toy. I've had enough of it. I bought myself an iPod and the Zune is on sale on Craigslist. Not one call on it. I guess others are smart enough to avoid it.   Do yourself a favor - buy the iPod. It is no more expensive, but it's built how a music player should be built, and the iTunes software and music store blow away Zune's!

<Title>The subscription rocks!!
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For those of you who are not planning to get your music from the those questionable file sharing programs, Zune is the answer.  Zune Marketplace has almost all the tracks you would want in their store, and for $14.99 per month, you have unlimited access to their songs for you computer and your player.  Apple I-Tunes does not have this subscription service.  At I-Tunes, you need to purchase each track for 99 cents.  I have already downloaded hundreds of songs from Zune and I am enjoying them on my player. It's like a new album every day, all for $14.99 per month.  The songs will only stay active if you keep subscribing, but you'll never need to buy another CD.  For me, that will save lots of money, and I get to try songs that I would probably never have purchased.  Everything about this has been easy - the software, the sync, the store, and the player itself.  I read other reviews about people's initial problems.  I say that as long as you have Windows XP on your home computer, you will have no problems.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Greatest player of all time.
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen clarity on the Zune is excellent. I like how the FM receiver is built-in and not an additional cost like some other mp3 players. The interface is easy to use and transferring files is a sinch. The only thing I think could make this better is to have the ability to hold data, and have a built in FM transmitter for the car.

<Title>a masterpiece
<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Finally an alternative to apple's effeminate, exorbitant, gimmicky, mod rock [...], trendy, nazi loving, nyc elitist, fagmotron that has been crammed down our throats by the advertising glitz of Madison Ave. as "chic" for the better part of 6 years. Regrettably, I actually owned an isheep before. But surprise surprise, software/hardware malfunction, who can tell, with apple's proprietary garbage and endless lust for ambiguously detailed electronics and machines.  The zune is slick without looking like "your friend the blonde afro-ed sunglasses at night silk scarf wearing woman who is a part-time graphic designer's" spaceship like the ifollow.  The screen is crisp AND scratch resistant, the interface is brilliant, as opposed to the labyrinthine tree offered by the ibuy, and the software is as streamlined as itunes.  And something that no one seems to be talking about, it sounds great. It's clear, the bass is there and there's no buzzing or chirping as with the iobey.  This is the product of choice if you're a true music enthusiast, an admirer of fine things, or if you want to destroy the tyrannically hip and fashion-over-substance grip apple has over our wasteful youth oriented culture.

<Title>Good Product, But Has room for improvement
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my zune because the Base Exchange was out of Ipod's after x-mas, and it looked interesting. So far I have had a good experience with it. The zunes sound quality is great, transitions between songs is very smooth. Video Looks great. The only downsides I've noticed are as follows: -Inability to do podcast's and convert AVI files to zune video. AVI files can be converted rather easily though, so its not a huge problem, but I'd like to see AVI and other video types supported. -Unable to sync with Windows Media Player. Personally I think this would solve alot of problems for microsoft right there. -battery life could use some work -transfers only last 3 days or three plays.  All in all The zune shows alot of potental. Hacks are already in the works. I see linix being ported to the zune, along with firm ware hacks, and bigger drive capacitys being worked into the small frame.  But Don't take my word for it. Try it for your self if you dare.

<Title>Most disapointing devise purchased  
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to get FM tuner, large screen for videos and MP3. The Zune appeared to be the best fit but as I tried to install the software on my Microsoft Media Center computer it would not run on either Media Center 2002 or 2004 but did run on the 5 year old Windows XP version, unfortunately all our media was on the new system. The kids received the iPod the same time I received the Zune, they were were up and in service within 1 hour the Zune took several days and one delay after another.  Battery life is a significant weakness, a full charge will not run 1.5 hours over 3 days for use during my workouts. The web site is a challenge to navigate and manage the media. The picture was clear and controls reasonalble to navigate. TiVo to go software would not interface with the system so none of my recorded movie could be used. Overall I was disapointed enough to return the product within 30 days.

<Content>I love the Zune!! I was going to buy this or the video iPod and I am very happy that I picked the Zune. Not only is the quality of the screen better, but it is also bigger. Plus you get the Wi-Fi, FM radio, and the new cool mp3 player that no one else has. Everywhere I go, I get so much attention to my Zune: people always tell me they like it but have never seen it before.

<Title>The best MP3 player
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Without a doubt this is the best MP3 + Video + Picture + FM player available in the market. The software is easy to use, it will download album art so it looks great while you are listening to music. Support MP3 and WMA. Videos must be converted to WMV, but you can load any video format into the Microsoft Windows Movie Maker (comes with XP and Vista) and convert it to wmv.  The only weakness and that is the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the battery. Three hours to fully charge it and lasts 3 to 4 hours listening to music. Tests says that can last to 14 hours, but that it is not true If you move forward, or backwards in your playlist and select things, and watch a video etc, the battery will run down very quickly. I hope Microsoft place a new battery with better performance for future versions.  Anyway is a great product, but get a travel charger so you can have the battery charge in condition.

<Title>Finally a better alternative to an iPod!
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had several MP3 players in the past but I never bought an iPod because of my past exposure to Apple's quality standards. So finally I was able to get a high capacity player when the Zune arrived.  The Zune is a bit bigger than an iPod, and it's a touch heavy for a shirt pocket, but the huge screen, superior resolution, and easy navigation are great. I travel a lot and I used to just play MP3's from my phone, but when you spend 14 to 18 hours in an airplane at a time, a phone simply doesn't do it especially if you want to have any battery left for calls when you arrive.  But the Zune stores enough tunes for all my trips.    As far as the mucis sharing goes, it's awesome.  Several people complained about the DRM restrictions. These people are the types to complain if hung with a brand new rope and complain for the sake of being noticed. At least you CAN share tunes. This is as good as it gets while still being legal.  Don't complain about the limited playback, complain about the DMCA if you want to complain.  The battery life is pretty good for a hard drive based player. I've run it for 7 hours before recharging it but it could have gone longer. I didn't run it flat.  The way the concave control disc is designed I can manipulate my volume and playback through my coatpocket.  This isn't so easy to do with a iPod as you can't feel the control wheel as well.   PROS *- Great screen in both size and resolution *- Easy navigation *- It's not manufactured by Apple *- Great integration with Media Play or the Zune software without being locked in to iTunes *- It's not an iPod *- You can share tunes *- The finish on it is smudge resistant  CONS *- It's a bit heavy *- Currently there is a lack of accessories but this is temporary  Overall I I'm very happy with my Zune, black of course!

<Title>Great Media Device, not for the technologically challenged
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this product for about a month now, i've filled it with all my pirated movies and music, it's wonderfully entertaining.  It was hard to find a decent free video converter because the zune only plays WMV format videos but the STOIK Video Converter 2 works well enough.  It's my first mp3 player, so i naturally love it, but i have to say, there's no advantage or disadvantage over my roomates 30 gig ipod.    The wifi feature may be only on this mp3 player, but  it's worthless right now, i've only even detected one other zune before ever and i live in a large city, half a block from a campus.  Plus it eats the battery to leave the wifi on so even if more people had zunes, nobody will have it on or be looking at their community options.  I enjoy the large screen, the feel and look of zune is nice too, very durable. CHARGES FULLY IN ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS!!!   However, There are SERIOUS installation issues.  I had to call microsoft and have someone walk me through ripping a black hole in my computer and pasting random lines into it.  Whatever it was, it worked. I tried for hours to get the software to work on my own and finally caved, and embarrassedly called them.    I consider myself somewhat computer savvy, and just installing this was a huge frustration.  If you experience this problem, don't waste your time, just call them.  No other problems.  In fact, since i have so much pirated mislabled music, the software was awesome, it relabled all my music correctly and recognized it, plus it added album art.  sweet stuff.  The headphones are awesome, magnetically sticking together to keep the cord from tangling when not in use. Plus they're not annoyngly white, like every single other persons ipod on campus.  They're black and don't annoyingly stand out against your clothing like ipod.  The EQ for music... is very sub par, but you only notice that after plugging it into your home stereo, which you can adjust to fit.  I'm very glad i took the risk and went with zune instead of ipod. BUT, If you're getting your mom or dad an mp3 player, get them an ipod, they can't deal with this.

<Title>Honest Review
<Date>Sun Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just spend a few minutes reviewing the so called "reviews" here and its obvious that the iPod crowd feels threatened so they just post a crap review and give the Zune one star.  The one star reviews are totally wrong.  Here is an honest assesment of the Zune.  I bought one if these for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas.  We unloaded it from the box and installed the software.  Zune requires Win XP or Vista to work.  If you dont have either of these operating systems contact the Zune toll free number for advice before buying the Zune.  Do Not Buy a Zune if you have an Apple computer.  I was so impressed with my daughters Zune I bought one for myself.   I'd recommend downloading the latest Zune software from the official Zune web site instead of using the included CD.  After the software is installed you are instructed to connect the Zune.  It performs a firmware update.  I think this is a great feature since it checks for updates regularly.  After the firmwear update you have the option to set up a Zune marketplace account.  You dont have to do this but you will need to if you want to buy songs from the Zune market place.  If all you want is to sync the music ripped from your CDs then you will not have to set up an account.  The next step is setting up a name for your Zune.  This is for the WiFi feature and so your computer recognizes your player.  After this housekeeping you are asked to set your sync options.  The default is for it to auto sync all the music on your computer.  You can set the software to auto sync photos and videos too but they are off by default.  These options can be changed later at any time.  If you leave them off you will have to manually sync the photos and video you want on the player.  I left them off since I didnt want all my photos synced.  I have just over 7GB of music on my computer. It took about10 minutes to do the initial sync.  I'm sure that this will vary depending on your computer.  I have read that some people have trouble having the computer detect the Zune when connected.  Microsoft recommends that you plug the sync cable into one of the USB ports on the back of your computer if you have a problem.  I didnt have any trouble.  The Zune Software is very similar to Windows Media Player 11.  You manage your music library from the software.  You also manage the music on your player via the software.  You must use the software to add and/or delete music, photos, and video from the player.  Once your files are on the player and it is fully charged you disconnect the player and its ready to go.  This thing couldnt be easier to use.  The controls are a 4 position "wheel" like switch with a center button.  There is a single button to the right and left of this main controller.  The wheel works as a selection navigator and the volume control.  The center button acts like the Select or Enter key.  The right button is the play/pause/on/off button.  The left button backs you out to the main menu either one step at a time or straight to the main menu if you hold it down.    The main menu is simple to understand.  The choices are Music, Videos, Pictures, Radio, Community, and Settings. Anyone that says the Zune is hard to use has never used it.  Music can be listed by album, artist, playlists, songs (titles), or genre.  Selections are listed in alphabetical order.  Photos are nested in  folders the same as you have them on your computer.  This is good and bad.  If youhave some logical order to your pictures you'll be fine.  If you have them hap hazzard on your computer they will be hap hazzard on the Zune.  I created a Zune Photos directory and then just loaded my photos in there in logical directories and it worked out fine.  I have also put a few videos on the Zune and they look great. Zune only supports WMV video format so if you have videos in another format you'll have to get a converter.  I did have a few problems with the Zune.  My daughters Zune needed the cable to be plugged into the back of the computer.  Mine did not.   The first Zune I recieved (the one I bought for myself) was defective and had to be returned.  The one I got as a replacement has worked flawlessly.  These were the only problems.  There are a few things I dont like about the Zune.   You can only delete files from the device using the software while the device is connected to your computer.   You cant move photos to folders you specify without using a program like windows explorer. You cant use music files you downloaded from a "Plays for Sure" music service, but you can convert your music files from iTunes.  I'm leaving alot out.  I really like this player.  Its fun and easy to use.  There are next to no instructions in the box but you shouldnt need any.  All you need to do is install the software, plug in the Zune when instructed to and then follow the onscreen instructions.  It was a piece of cake.  Hey.... If I could do it anyone can.  If you are considering the Zune go and test one before buying.  I dont know how this compares to an iPod video since I dont own one but I have used an iPod non video and the Zune is far superior.

<Title>Zune-Good
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune is a very good unit. I'll start with the pros: *The zune can hold much more than the Ipod *Has built in radio tuner *holds pictures *big screen and basically anything that's already on here CONS: *The program is sort of mediocre *The accessories are costly (But note the fact that the Zune is barely 1 year old) *The wi-fi capability has that three song restraint *Could have better button design (i.e. scrolling)  The battery life of the Zune could be better, but varies on the settings. Overall, off to a good start. For all the Ipod fans though:you have to remember, this is the FIRST GENERATION Zune. Until Microsoft gets more input from the public, it's not going to be perfect.But, I think they did a very good job for a first generation MP3 to be competing with the current Ipods. [...]

<Title>Don't let the biased review fool you, not perfect but not garbage either
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had no problems at all with the Zune. The Zune itself is not heavy, anyone who thinks this is too bulky to carry around needs to exercise more apparently. Its also not the ugliest mp3 out there. The Creative MP3 players especially the Zen's are far uglier than the Zune in my opinion. (Plus the gloss finish leaves fingerprints).  Had no trouble connecting the Zune to my computer was able to get up and running within minutes.  Takes some getting used to. But I was able to jump right in very quickly and this is my first mp3 player.  Fairly easy to manage your files if you turn off the auto-sync option. After you do that its basically a drag and drop and sync routine.  Its also apparent that many of the bad reviews are from a bunch of idiots who have no life who are obviously the lap dogs of Apple.

<Title>Zune is awesome!!!
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I was looking at Zune and the ipod I did a lot of research on both. I am not an apple person admittedly but I was leaning toward the ipod in the beginning. The more research I did the more I was starting to like Zune. I tried out both devices and I was now almost sold on zune. The controls were very intuitive and easy to use. I can not believe I am saying this but the graphics and screen (much larger when compared)are far superior (in general for graphics I think apple is better as do most). My decision was made easier by everyone I talked to that had an ipod liked Zune better. I love it. Yeah the battery(12-14 hrs) is not the best but I heard the same about the equivalent ipod 30G except for the nano (24 hrs) which does not have the memory. The radio is great(ipod lacks this feature) and honestly each time I pull zune out to change a song or whatever someone stops me and wants to see it. The wireless I have not really used as I have kept it turned off lately but that is a really awesome feature to have as more people buy zune. In Boston the electronics stores are saying it is easily the number 2 seller for MP3 players. There are a lot of bad reviews out there but as someone who was going to get and Ipod and did not I am very happy with zune. The marketplace is awesome and still developing but I like it better than itunes. The technology is only 3 months old so give it a little time and the fact zune can upgrade b/c it is microsoft is awesome. I highly recommend zune. Everyone and I mean every one of my friends that has an ipod and then checks out my zune and loves it.If you are looking around do some research and try both of them out, my guess is even if you are an apple guy you will find zune really cool. It is above all a personal decison but do not believe the bad press you would be passing up a gem!!

<Title>Buy Microsoft Stock, Zune will do for them what iPod did for Apple!
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yes, I really think this player is great...In fact, I just read the 5 or 6 reviews below mine, and they say it all...except for the few things I will add in here:  1-In my opinion, if you want to hear music on an MP3 player, the number one consideration should be the quality of sound which the player produces. Compared to the iPod, the Zune is clearer and crisper, more alive...In fact, the true test just may be that you can easily enjoy your music at a lower volume, because the clear sound penetrates you. I bought mine about one week ago, and have loaded up many GBs of 25 to 35 year old Grateful Dead concerts...even the most poorly recorded music sounds so beautiful on this player...enough...bottom line...it sounds B E T T E R than an iPod!  2-Battery life: about 5 reviews below this one a reviewer complained she only received 3 to 4 hours before it went dead. Ok, that is BIG consideration for me, because of past players I had...so in the week I owned it, i tested it from a full charge twice...I tried to listen to only music and not run down the batteries with pics or videos...but that's not totally possible unless you remain isolated...because you wind up showing off to others how sharp the pics and videos are on the 3" screen...but lets just say it was 95% music (15 mins or so of pics)...I got just over 10 hours before the player shut down...I am HAPPY...that works for me. Oh, don't be fooled by the gauge...when you have only one bar left, you still have about 4 hours to go (gauge not accurate, needs improvement).  3-Software...NEEDS improvement...But NOT on the player...the player is perfect...as in PUUUURRRRFECT! The software that you must use on your computer to do anything as far as adding deleting anything needs the improvement...BUT it's Microsoft, and just like their operating systems on a larger scale (i.e., Windows, duh), I am sure I will (I hope) get an update, and better yet, a total service pack...but it is managable...word of advice..take ADVANTAGE of free tech support...you can call them as long as you own the device for FREE...and NO wait before someone picks up.   4-I will write more another time, but this review is distracting me from this GD concert I am enjoying immensely...so, all I can say is that if you buy Zune, you will not regret it.

<Title>Good Player! But has room for improvement.
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this at Best Buy not knowing what it had to offer (other then it had music, pictures and videos.) Since I have so much feedback for this player, I've divided it into three sections. Good, Bad, and the Ugly.  Good: Great big screen, case is sturdy, interface and menu is easy to use. The music is very clear and along with the big screen to playing videos. Also has WiFi built it to send songs, pictures, and videos to other Zune holders. Software is OK, but I've never come across any software that is perfect.  Bad: Battery life could be ALOT better. Don't waste your time putting on full movies, because chances are you won't be able to finish them. WiFi is useless. Kills battery and useless unless you know or spot someone holding their Zune. Just leave it off (buzzkill for the battery if left on.) Until Microsoft creates another firmware update to allow Zune players to connect to the Internet (Zunes Marketplace more likely) to download music will give its WiFi more of a real use.  Ugly: We seem to see a lot of holes in Microsoft's products. Aside from poor battery life, useless WiFi, and 50% of the songs that are on the Zune's Marketplace can't even be shared yet, its overall rating it OK.  There is room for improvement, but only time will tell if this player can be the next Ipod killer (which its not right now, but in the near future it might.)

<Title>THE TAKE OVER!!!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Zune is great, Microsoft has done it again...I love the fact that the sound is so great. What sold me is that I didn't have to convert my MP3's to MP4a format etc...I loaded the software, and I was off. Like many of the other reviews the software needs alot of work.   My Pro's: 1. Great Sound  2. UP and Down stand for UP and Down, no circle motion to scroll thru you list!!! Thank you!!!! 3. Playlist function allows you to play hours upon hours of music. 4. The radio function Wow this was smart! I have gotten alot of use out of it already!  My Con's: 1. The Battery life as others have reviewed, is somewhat weak,  however I love that its usb powered, while at work my usb cable goes on and for hours the music bumps. 2. The Software...is kind of tricky to understand. At First!!! 3. The free pass to download music, you have to actually purchase the license to burn the actual files to disc, in case you want to share with others. 4. The Wireless function... 0 use for it now..  All in All this is a great MP3/Wma player, I am having a ball with this thing. If you want an alternative to the IPOD, you will not go wrong with this!!!MICROSTRONG IS COMING FOR YOU APPLE!!!! THE TAKE OVER!!!!

<Title>Great Media Player
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I agree with all of the positive comments about this product so I'm not going waste your time repeating what you've already heard.  I just wanted to comment on the battery life.  While not the longest battery life, I bought my Zune before my recent trip to Iraq and it lasted the whole way.  I know this may not mean much to you since I haven't told you my starting location but I will say that I spent over 12hrs in the air.  As with any mobile device, you have to practice good battery management.  Make sure to turn off the WiFi function, reduce the time that your backlight is on (I reduced mine to 5 secs, one was just too short), and avoid fliping through the menus if you don't have to.  I often use the hold function to prevent my backlight from coming on.  I use mine everyday while working anywhere from 8-14 hrs and mine does just fine.

<Title>ZUNE FREAKING RULES!!!!!! 10 STARS!!!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OH - MY - GOD!!! I love this thing like no other! This is the best thing I have *ever* bought! It's better than a new car, new computer, new mountain bike, etc. I agonized so much researching different MP3 players on Amazon, because I was afraid of getting stuck with the wrong one. If I had known how great Zune really is, I wouldn't have bothered. Zune is SPECTACULAR! The controls are great & perfect & very intuitive. The sound is GREAT & smooth once you connect good headphones. Then the sound is very enjoyable. The earphones it comes with sound scratchy and have very weak bass, but they work and you can use them if you are cheap or on a budget. I heard pretty much all mp3 players come with low quality earphones, so that's OK. The Zune itself is very high performance, and that's what counts. I am temporarily using my big, full-sized Sony headphones, which I bought for around $30 ten years ago. Zune sounds great with that. I am going to buy a Koss Portapro or a Grado SR-60 or something like that as my permanent, primary headphones to use with Zune. Those should sound really awesome! I might also get noise blocking earphones that stick inside your ear, because sometimes I need to block out noise around me. Probably the coolest and most impressive thing about Zune is the HUGE screen! It is crystal clear and the picture is so beautiful, bright and watchable. It makes videos really enjoyable, especially if they are high quality videos. It also makes the text on the menus really easy and pleasant to read. I just watched an Avril Lavine video of her song "Complicated" that I put on my Zune. It was SO great! The picture and sound were SO great! It rocked my world! The Zune is really a huge pleasure to use. It is so much fun! It's also fun to use the Zune software on the PC to add mp3's to your library and add album art for EVERY song, fix all the tags, and organize everything correctly. Most of the album art is downloaded automatically by the software, but sometimes you have to paste it manually. A copy of Photoshop is helpful for this purpose. So anyway, then you click a button to syncrhonize your library with your Zune, which means it uploads everything to your Zune, and then you get to play your MP3's on Zune and see the album art for every song. That's really cool! Also, you can easily find your songs on your Zune in lots of different ways: by artist, by album, by genre, and a few other ways. That's why you have to fix your MP3 tags and make sure they have the correct info. Officially they tell you that you need a high bandwidth internet connection like DSL to use the Zune software, but you can get by quite well with a dial-up modem. When I first installed the software, it took about 4 hours to download the software, firmware, and catalog. At the same time, I was charging my Zune's battery, so I didn't mind. I took a nap. But after that was done, I haven't had any more big downloads. Downloading album art doesn't take too long on a modem. The Zune software can also rip music from your CD's. The Zune comes with minimal documentation, which is enough to get you started, but if you want to know more, there are some things you'll have to find out by trial & error or read on the internet. This is the only thing that I would change. I think it should come with complete documentation. I have taken my Zune on long walks, and there wasn't any skipping or problems, so you don't have to worry about that. The FM radio is great too. It finds lots of stations easily and they sound excellent. You get to give your Zune its own individual name, which can be seen by other Zuners when you use the wi-fi. You can also view photos (jpg files) on your Zune and you can easily make any of them your Zune wallpaper, which you see when you use the menus. All the videos I had were in mpeg or divx format, so I had to download some software to convert them into wmv for the Zune. Then I was able to load them into my Zune.   Overall, I think Zune is the best & coolest mp3 player on the market. I think it is the optimum package of features. If you could spend a day or two with it, the decision to buy one would be a no-brainer. It is spectacular and wonderful. It is extremely useful and functional. I feel complete now that I have one. I am so happy I got this.

<Title>Zune... Nice Hardware, Bad Software
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune has a nice selection of music, and I like the way you can put pictures on it. I don't use the WiFi at all. I think that Microsoft had better make more things available for the Zune besides just music. It needs something like iTunes. If you are buying something the same price as a 30GB Ipod Video, you should get the same quality. Itunes has movies available. Microsoft needs this too to survive.   Is there a way to convert iTunes video files to the Zune?

<Content>My parents got me this thing for my birthday, I don't know what possessed them but I cant stand the thing. I am a mac user and microsoft does not support mac OS X so I went into my garage to dig out my old PC which has an inch of dust on it and away I went trying to install zune software, First I started using windows XP again and remembered why I switched to mac OS in the first place, I must have gotten 40 new hardware messages and software crashes along the way and in the end I gave up, I put the PC back in the garage and put the zune for sale on amazon since my parents did not give me the receipt from the zune so I was not able to return it, I guess PC people don't think iTunes is all that great,  but they should try it on a mac the way it was made to work in the first place. Well for now I'll stay with my 3rd gen ipod till the wide screen ipod comes out, now that will be a zune killer if the zune even exists by that time at all.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player - Review from 17 Year Old High School Music Lover
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune shortly after the Holiday season after living off my friends 5.5g iPods or my Ipod minis (which had far too short of a battery life for me to enjoy). My Zune is already loaded with 7000 songs and a few videos (and it runs quite smoothly). After having used both the players I can say without a doubt that the Zune is a better device than the rivaling 30gb 5.5g ipod. My friend who has the iPod I would use sometimes is now waiting for it to break so he can buy a Zune and we can share music.  HARDWARE Zune Versus Ipod -The Zune's 3" screen size is noticeably larger than ipod's 2.5" screen which makes movie watching far more pleasurable. (I'm ripping Season One of the Boondocks to it right now) -To add to that the Zune comes preloaded with about 10 music videos and 3 extreme sports clips whereas the Ipod comes with nothing (and from what I see in school, kids never actually do put video on their ipods) -The Zune's "D-Pad" touch is actually a lot easier to manipulate than the iPod's scroll wheel once you become accustomed. With iPod's scroll wheel I found myself passing songs and artists all the time and having to slowly scroll back. Witht he Zune you can just click one-space at a time if you need. -The Zune's interface blows the Ipod's away. You use the left-right controls to switch between artists, playlists, songs, etc. and the up-down controls to scroll. With the iPod you need to actually pree back and then scroll down to the menu you want and then load that menu. -You can customize Zune's background which is actually one of the reasons I choose to buy the Zune instead of the iPod. This makes my iPod using friends pretty jealous. -The style of the players are equally cool in my opinion but target different audiences. The Zune looks and feels very laidback with it's soft-plastic casing whereas the iPod has that shiney, sleek, and thin appeal. I happen to be a kind of grungy teenager though so the laid-back style suited me fine. -The Zune's wi-fi is more cool than it is practical. I've used it with one person in one of my classes at school and it was fun, but I only got to listen to one of the songs he sent me before I ran out of time. Even still, Zune has wi-fi, iPod doesn't. Even if it isn't strong it's still a one up. -The Zune has a radio-tuner that shows you details of the station and what you're listening to which is pretty cool (and I don't usually even listen to the radio) -Battery life is at least that of the iPod. I haven't really tested it but for what I need it's perfect. I use it in the car going to school, for about half the day, and on the drive home and it still has half it's charge. For video it could probably play about two full videos before dying. If you're looking for extended battery life the Belkin battery pack should work (although I can't say I have it). -Playback is smooth and transition time between menus is shorter than that of the iPod. -The Zune feels much more sturdy than the iPod and it's soft neoprene type plastic shell is far more scratch resistant than the iPod's shiney metalic finish (and what good is that finish if it's all scratched up?). -One annoying downside to the Zune is that it doesn't show you the time like iPod does. I find myself checking my Zune to see what time it is but then realize I can't. This isn't too bad though since I have a cellphone anyways with the time. I feel like most people do. Firmware updates may eventually bring a clock to the Zune -The Zune doesn't have games available like the iPod which is a little upsetting. I used to play Solitaire on my iPod mini's more than I listened to music. Maybe firmware updates will bring games about eventually too. -You can't listen to music while viewing pictures which is a little strange. Again, firmware updates are needed.  SOFTWARE Zune versus Itunes -The biggest fault of the Zune is that the Zune software itself is horrible. I still use itunes to play my music and I only use the Zune software to sync my Zune up. The Zune software has it's few upsides like keeping a universal playcount among music players and automatically uploading new music when it comes to your computer, but overall it seriously lacks what iTunes is capable of. -Zune software is horrifically slow next to iTunes. -Sync speed is about the same between Ipod and Zune. -The Zune store is pretty weak next to iTunes. It has a smaller music selection and movies are still not yet available for download. On the upside though, songs are 20 cents cheaper ($0.79) and you can get a "Zune Pass" that works somewhat like Rhapsody where you can download as much as you want to your Zune for a monthly fee of about $15 I think. -Although the Zune software is weak, it's important to keep in mind that Itunes software is on it's 7th version whereas the Zune software is still on versions 1.1. Updates to the software will come and eventually the Zune software won't be as weak.    OVERALL I give this five stars when really it's probably more of a 4.5 due to a few features that are lacking and weak software. The 5 stars are really to compensate for people's underrating of this device. This whole Apple craze took over and people forgot that Mac almost dissappeared fromt he market at one point and the iPod is what saved them. Microsoft has been the giant of computers for years and is obviously a trustworthly brand. The Zune and it's software are still devloping though and if that bothers you it may be wise to avoid the device. But overall I think that the device is still better than the 5.5g iPods and that firmware + software updates will eventually make the Zune the number one MP3 player if you don't already think it is.

<Title>Terrible experience
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are many things to say about Zune but four things come to front: 1. The Zune software is unbelievably a bad user experience. It has many bugs, many "features" that you will not be able to control (such stopping it to change the names of the files on your computer without asking you), you will be unable to load music into your device without screaming and pulling your hair, you will talk to a phone support unit who are learning and amazed themselves as to how bad the software is and they will be unable to address your problems.  The way the software works is so against common sense and computer using habit that you will never be able to learn what it does to your playlists.  You will have unbelivably hard time in putting video and/or pictures on your device.  It only syncs with your My Pictures folder.  Nothing else! Don't want some pictures in that folder to sync into Zune? Well, too bad, because Microsoft has the saying here, you don't!  2. The equalizer on the device itself is just useless and you experience nothing when you change the 5-preset equalizers. It's just plain sound.  3. The device has a nice sound quality even though there is no equalizer.   4. My advice? Well, I am not a fan of iPod because it has a bad audio quality even though you plug in good earphones.  If you want an mp3 player that has excellent quality, you would not buy an iPod.  But, you need to stay away from Zune, otherwise very painful days await you.  Try others like Creative Zen or Cowon.  I bought Zune and I very much regret that I did.

<Title>Easy-to-use, upgradeable, beautiful screen...
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought myself a Zune for my birthday back in November and love it. The screen is large and bright, and really shows off my album art. The body is rubbery and sturdy, and feels like you could drop-kick it and it would still keep playing. The software is very intuitive and makes it easy to maneuver through songs, artists, albums or playlists. The biggest selling point for me, though, was that the software is upgradeable; so, Microsoft can add new features (like games) for free, without your Zune becoming obsolete. And, finally, there's the wifi, which puts it head and shoulders over the others (including iPod). I don't know anyone who owns a Zune who's been disappointed. And most people who've seen mine have been impressed, especially with the large screen. Hope you like yours.

<Title>Great mp3/video unit. Why are so many people having soft ware isses?
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1st. The Zune is great for all the obvious reasons. Screen size, user interface, standard FM radio, and cool see through skin.   This is the new kid on the block and ever person that has seen me with mine loves it. Even my ipod only friends say the Zune is sweet. So if you're interested you can transfer all of your itunes over with no issues.  The clear skin extra sexy and gives it a mature look. The body is also scratch resistant. So it has the perfect amount steel and velvet for those who know what I'm talking about.  I have had no issues with the software. It integrated with my library of song that was on my HDD before my Zune software with no issues. It dose what it is supposed to do. I think people have issues with the ability to use a PC in the first place.  In all the Zune is worth every penny. The only advantage it has over the ipod is wifi and FM radio standard. And that is what pushed me to spend my money on it over the IPOD. But if you do not like radio and sharing with wifi.

<Title>THe best, or at least i think
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for christmas. it is pretty good. the wifi feature is a little shaky, you could be standing next to a person with a zune and the wifi is on both and it would say "NO zuners found" THe zune does freeze occasionally and may slow down quite a lot. overal it takes a bit to get used to holding. The zune software could be the worst thing ever though. it is a copy of wmp11 (media player). it is really slow and freezes up sometimes. (my computer can run vista but i dont plan on :)hehe ) the features are cool though. i got the "all you can eat" pas and i got over 5000 songs "free" legaly. you can even download entire genres inside the zune software. wow. its only $15/ month. But on itunes theres nothing like it. im not a fanboy of m$ or apple i have both the shuffle and zune, so i had tastes of both. many people are starting to get a zune. my advice: wait a few months. there will be a 2nd gen out that is better. and no the zune is not that thick. the zune is 1mm thicker and people are calling the zune a fatty, but the ipod 1st gen was just like that. give take 5 years and the zune will "kill" the iPod. if you really want to be fashionable get a Sony Vaio laptop that has a touchscreen and is only 5 inches big and have a computer the size on 2 or 3 zunes. way better.

<Title>New Zune
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Zune today. I had already downloaded the latest software and when I plugged it in it automatically did a firmware update. I've ripped some cd's and loaded a video and everything has been fairly simple and the sound and video quality are excellent. First, some anomalies (not really cons): It converted a video already in wmv format into wmv format, and it took a while doing it. The perfectly usable screen protector has writing on it making it unusable. The EQ is very subtle (I couldn't hear much difference) Pros: Great picture quality and good sound. Very simple setup Easy and intuitive navigation. Super easy and quick to get where you want to go. FM radio worked well and pulled in stations 30 plus miles away.  And, according to reports on the ultra reliable internet, Microsoft will be adding features via firmware updates. Very cool.  I've never used an Ipod so I can't compare, but I'm happy with the Zune.

<Title>MAJOR PROBLEMS BUT THEY WONT HONOR WARRANTY
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my husband a Zune for Christmas.  In January he finally got around to loading the music on it.  It worked for one day.  I took it back to Wall Mart in Layton, Utah where it was purchased.  They would not replace it because they have a 14 day return policy on electronics.  They told me the manufactures warranty would cover it.  After my husband tried several times to contact Zune and was on hold for over 15 minutes, he asked me to call them for repair instructions.  The Zune had been charging and I noticed a crack in the screen that was not there before.  It was never dropped and really never used but for a few hours. I called, 877-438-9863, the warranty number and told them the music would not work and that the screen had cracked.  The representative told me if you over charge it, it can crack the screen.  I ask him how would you know if it was over charged or just enough?  He put me on hold.  When he came back on, I was told that they could not fix the Zune for me because the screen was not under warranty.  I said fine just fix it so it plays the music.  I was put back on hold and a supervisor came on who told me they are not currently taking any Zune's back for repair if they have a problem not covered by the warranty (the screen).  So they will not fix what is covered by the warranty because of the screen. I have since called the numbers listed below and talked to as many supervisors as would talk to me and I am now waiting for another to call me back.  I don't expect to get the call.  The crazy thing is I ask one of the supervisors, supervisor, to give me a name of some company that could fix my Zune because they wouldn't.  I was told that he could not give me a name.  When I ask why he said "because if anyone else does the repair work then the warranty could not be honored".   You mean the one you are not currently honoring, Mr. Supervisor.  It sounds ridiculous but that is what he said! I would not buy a Zune.  Two Hundred and Fifty dollars is lot of money to spend for a product when the company will not honor its warranty.   800-936-5700 800-360-7561 888-673-8624 800-218-5617 800-642-7676

<Title>Better than I thought and Almost There
<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally bought this out of curiosity, thinking I could return it if I didn't like it.  I was intruiged by the wi-fi, and to see what kind of effort MS would put forward.  I bought mine after the first firmware release, so off the bat I didn't experience the software issues that others seem to.  I downloaded the latest from the zune web site (I do this with everything, the CD in the package is almost always dated). Hooked up my Zune and the music synced up.  The user interface on the device is the best out of all the MP3 players I have owned or used in the past, my Creative ZVM and Zen Xtra (own) and Ipod (used but not owned).  The large screen is tops for visibility (my ZVM is clearer but not overwhelmingly)and the up and down and side to side navigation was strange at first but now I love it.  Above all it sounds fantastic, better than the Ipod, and hair better than my Creatives.  Videos transfer with the Zune software easier than my ZVM, never used an Ipod for video, and I don't do a lot of video. On the down side, I haven't got to play with the Wi-Fi, but I haven't run into anyone I know with one, so sill interested but until it becomes more widespread I will wait.  Even more disappointing to me and this is mainly what cost it a star and keeps me from replacing my Creative Zen Vision M is lack of support for [...] and audio bookmarking. I like it enough to keep it and I am getting one for my wife, so I will probably end up testing the wi-fi shortly.  I will hope that Audible and MS will address the audio book thing in a firmware update coming soon.  Overall it was a great first shot for MicroSoft, but they shouldn't rest on this.

<Title>Love It, but the batterylife sucks
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this from my dad (whute), it's great. I love the screen and it's easy to use. I prefer the controls on it compared to Ipod. Only huge problem with it I have is the battery life. I listen to music a lot and every so often watch videos and the battery holds up for maybe atleast 4-6 hours. I plan on going on many trips in the near future that will be car trips longer then 4 hours, and I don't think it will hold up the whole time. The software is slightly confusing, but I got used to it fast. I used Window Media Player for my whole life, so for people who aren't fimilar with it miht get confused. I found also that once you load the software, you should reset your computer. It works so much better. I recomend getting this protect though. It's fabulous.    Also I haven't used the wifi thing yet. I probably won't.

<Title>Beautiful Product
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After finally dumping my very old iPod i chose to purchase the Zune. I couldnt say that the sound is much better than the iPod but the picture is very vibrant and I love how you can turn the Zune on its side to view landscape.  It makes the picture much bigger than the iPod.  The software did take a little getting used to and browsing the zune marketplace is kinda tricky.  It took a few minutes to figure out exactly what I was doing.  Once you get the hang of it it's every bit as easy as iTunes.  If you are trying to choose between this or the iPod I would recommend the Zune a hundred times over.  The features on it outweigh the iPod greatly and the fact it updates its software is a plus so you know it wont be outdated the day after you buy it.  If you purchase this, I promise you will love it!

<Title>ZUNE is no IPOD nor  ITUNE
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product is not "bad" but it is not all that great neither.  The sound is respectable, but I do not like the fact tht all the music on my hard drive was not synched, unlike the IPOD which synched all my music when I attached it to my MAC and my PC...  The IPOD transfer of files is much quicker also.  But, I do like the ABC order feature - when you scroll through the music selections a large letter shows up and you can easily identify the song, etc - this feature is good for visually challenged individuals.

<Title>Outstanding Device
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She took it back to college with her and she has become the music person at the dorm parties.  She shows up with her Zune, they hook it up to some speakers and rock the house.  My son has an Ipod and he thinks the Zune is cooler.  Great big screen, bigger than the Ipod.  I think once this thing starts to catch on a little more, Apple with have a real competitor.

<Title>A nonbiased review of the brown brick
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OKay, so there seems to be a buttload of people trying to pass this thing off as a dead-in-the-water attack on the I-pod before they have have even put their grimey little hands on it. Here's a fair and honest look at it from someone who has had both a mini and an Ipod video.  1. It's big and remarkably sturdy. Bigger than the Ipod Video. Bigger screen, bigger body and a thick protective cover about a millimeter thick all the way around. I feel I could drop this thing from a decent height and not be too worried about whether it would survive. It is not however heavy, and one can feel little weight difference between this and the Ipod video. It still fits in my jacket or jean's pocket easily though I can't carry anything else in there when I do.  2. The battery is good. It has lasted me through numerous 8 hour shifts at work with more than enough juice to get back to the apartment. My mini lasted at most 9 hours, so I think they are comparable.  3. The interface is great. Both the controls and the software on the Zune are awesome and very easy to use to navigate, faster even than the Apple Scroll Wheel. I like the extra bit of control of being able to up your volume just 1 notch without trying to be so precise on turning that apple wheel.This is very nice if you shake a lot or for working out.  4. The screen is flipping gorgeous! This part wins hands down. I always thought movies on an Ipod was stupid, but this widescreen format coupled with absolutely gorgeous colors is great for both music videos and TV shows. The Zune software can convert some video formats but not others, including mpeg and mp4. I also love that you can set any photo as your background and that it comes with its own themes.  5. The sound is good, but in reality this has a lot more to do with the quality you rip your mp3's at and little to do with the device itself. It does however have a nice set of earbuds that I think are shaped a bit better to comfortably fit and stay in your ear better than others. The device also has 7 equalizer settings.       6. Things apple doesn't have. The radio only gets two stations. THis is because they are the only ones within 70 mies (gotta love college towns in the middle of nowhere). They come in good and sound great, but yeah, I only get the two. Also, as very few people have bought these yet, I've yet to try the wi-fi with anyone else.   7. The synch software is a royal pain in the arse. This is definitley the only problem spot with the zune. This software is so blasted slow it's not even funny. It lags on my 3.2 ghz desktop and is a joke on my laptop. The converting is slow, the compiling of the library is horrendously slow, and the install itself took a rediculous amount of time. Add to that the synch is glitchy at times giving me a list of files the length of my arm that are called "errors" even though I deleted them through the software. I'm really hoping Microsoft gets up to speed and updates this thing.  8. Accesories: too expensive to even bother with. I just bought generics. Come on:$70 for a basic FM transmitter? $30 for a base and you still want me to pay $20 for the AV cord to connect it to my stereo? Get real Microsoft.  Overall it's a great product that I think, if people give it the chance, will give apple a run for the money. Ebay already has a slew of accesories for it and I think as more people buy them the software will improve and accesories will come down in price.

<Title>Still Needs Software Work
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Zune The Screen size is awesome The speed with which it finds album info etc. is so much faster than media player or i-tunes (which i do have) I like all the little things, like having your pictures as background wallpaper and the share option, but there are many moments where i see bugs that need to be worked out. First off we need movies and videos on the marketplace. Sometimes the software freezes up for no reason(my pc is brand new with top of the line components and no other programs freeze on it). I still think its better than the bland ipod but i would like to see the what this thing looks like in a year or 2. Oh and make sure you have some kind of broadband internet. My friend got one and he could barely get anything done with his dial up.

<Title>Zune can't be used as a portable harddrive.
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune can not be used as a portable harddrive like the Apple iPod can.  If Microsoft were to fix this via a firmware update then I would give the item four stars.  However, lacking that feature is a real negative when you consider nearly all other players have it.  Otherwise; I do enjoy the zune interface on the zune itself; it's fast and very clean and well organized.  The zune software for the PC could use some work to make it more user friendly; but it is better than iTunes.

Before the gift is presented, I installed a few of her favorite songs as well as some of her favorite pictures and tuned to her favorite FM radio station.  The software was easy to install and the unit easy to transfer songs, pictures, video clips.  Her birthday is Valintine's day and it's ready to go.  Love this Zune

<Title>It is not what it looks.
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the black zune when it came out because Windows is my favorite company.  It was performing really well except the battery life.  It's not that long.  Also the screen scratches easily. After a few months, I dropped my zune and boom, my zune died.  Although the zune looks really durable and strong, there's something on the bottom of the zune that breaks really easily, killing the whole thing.   $250 down the drain.  The best MP3 is probably the Zen.  I haven't heard any complaints from Zen customers.  The Ipod freezes frequently after a long time.

<Title>Mixed feelings
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1. The initial setup is tooooo slow, but after is up and running it works really good. 2. The synchronization is AWESOME, different than Ipod where all things need to be sync every single time Zune updates the device info and is very quick. 3. Cannot be used as a portable hard drive. :( 4. I purchased music in my office as a guest and I haven't found a way to get to my home where I have Zune set up permanently, therefore I have to separated music libraries (I also tried importing then trough a USB like I do with my Ipod and could not be done). 5. No videos in marketplace. 6. I am in Puerto Rico and the marketplace will not accept ANY credit card that doesn't have a US address, therefore you need to buy Zune pass prepaid cards in order to buy music and it's a hassle to go to the store every time you run out of points.    Overall I like Zune more than the Ipod because it is more user friendly.

<Title>I'd Rather Own An I-Pod
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yes, I'm sure someone will be offended that I'm not raving about the Zune. Truth be told, I'm not impressed.  Granted, the screen is great for videos - as long as they're in a format that Zune supports, which is, as far as I can tell - one, WMV.  Any other video format fails, which means that you the user have to convert MPG4 and AVI files to WMV in order to load them on your Zune.  Annoying.  Once loaded, however, the video plays great and looks even better.  The trade off is that the battery life is less than an I-Pod because the screen sucks so much juice in order to look so beautiful.  Just don't leave your charger too far away and you'll be ok.  As for everything else, the quickest summary is to say that it feels like it was rushed to market.  The controls and menus aren't as logical or easy to use as they coul be (ala I-Pod) and battery life hasn't been all that impressive.  I keep hoping that there's a software release soon that will make everything better, but after two months, I'm beginning to think that Microsoft thinks everything is honky dorry and they're leaving well-enough alone.  Sad, because it really could be so much more fun!  The biggest featue - the ability to share music with others in your vicinity via a wifi connection is great in concept, but lousy in implementation.  First, if you leave your wifi antenna on, your running time drops dramtically! Maybe even exponentially...I don't know, but it sure doesn't last long!  Secondly, you'd think that you'd be able to use the wifi to connect your desktop to share music, but no - that's an option that not available.  You might also think that wifi means that you connect to the internet and browse the web using that big beautful screen, but you'd be wrong.  Like I said earlier - it just feels like it was rushed to market to get something on the shelves before Christmas and now that it's out, well - you're on your own.  Another annoying feature, you can't load music directly onto the Zune, it HAS to go through Zune's software (which looks just like Window Media Player, but you can't use Windows Media Player - it won't recognize the Zune as a device.  Microsoft, what were you thinking?).  While most people alrady have Window Media Player, and may already be using its library to catalog their music files, now you have to load a look-alike software package and create a new library.  To top it off, the interface for the Zune player is more limiting for display options than those available in Windows Media Player.  If you're like me and spend quite a bit of time ensuring your MP3s have the correct tags, etc., you'll probably find that it's easier to sort and edit MP3 tags in Windows Media Player and then import the changes into Zune.  Can you spell annoying?  Here's the bottom line, if you're looking for a video player, get a Zune. The larger screen will make it worth your while...just don't try to watch two full length movies back to back without charging - you'll be sorry! If you are primarily looking for music - skip the Zune and pick up an iPod, you'll be much happier in the long run, I promise!

<Title>Zune = Toshiba. Software = Microsoft
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's so funny to read all the reviews here saying how awesome the Zune is. Microsoft is the best! Oh but the software needs a lot of work. I have a little factoid for all of you Microsoft fans, the Zune is made by Toshiba not Microsoft. That's why the hardware is nice. It's a Gigabeat. ONLY the software is brought to you by Microsoft. So it's no wonder that the only part of the whole experience to credit MS for is the substandard software. But hey, don't let the facts get in the way. And don't blame all the snickering iPhone users this summer for that fact that you fell for the Zune hype and bought 5-year late brick.  Now go buy Vista! It's got candy colored buttons!

<Title>Better than iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is great.  The sound is absolutely terrific, better than the iPod in my opinion.  I haven't really used the Zune store for much other than sync'ing my music, so I can't give any feedback on that part.  The one thing that people seem to complain about is that Zune doesn't have a scroll wheel, but that's the advantage of Zune.  The navigation is so much better.  Instead of clicking back 5 times, it has the twist across the top for navigation.  I love it, once again, Microsoft comes through with functionality instead of looking pretty like the Apple.

<Title>looking for a zune? read this first!!
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Recently i bought the zune.  my impression of the zune first off is it's pretty.  The profile is sweet and the external material(looks like frosted glass)  is functional- doesn't scratch easily- like the ipods.  i'd has a large 3 inch screen great picture and color- great for people store pics and movies- i on the other hand don't so the energy from the screen just wastes battery.  The battery life is average with the ipods, maybe a little better, certainly not better than the creative- still though relatively good with a three inch screen.  You can fine tune your viewing prefferences too- like back light brightness, time-out feature, and wireless.  the wireless feature is nice.  if you know someone with a zune or you commute on the subway. the soft ware is on par with itunes with subtle differences-  personally i like it better.  it comes with a free 14 day subscription-  you can download complete albums(of certain artists) right out the box.  the licensing for use of the songs you download is based on your subscription to zune- so in other words- when your subscription runs out- unless youv'e bought the song(s)- you'll have to renew to listen to downloaded material.  It also works with your xbox360- if your xbox is online you can update your system to recognize it.  and you can charge and play while you listen to your zune-on your 360!!  i like this compatibility.  my 360 isn't online however i don't always have acces to a computer- so if i need a charge its there.  the head phones are average- i think the travel kit among other things, offeres a good set- not to mention third party inner ear phones.  if you have a pc i recomend either a zune or creative( i own both) generally the creative gets better battery life, its better for the gym, not as bulky as the zune or ipod.  the micro photo screen is not usefull for photos at allso if you want to put pics on your mp3 don't bother, but is a bargain for people looking for just a music players( has a removable battery too, extremely helpfull). the thirty gig zen is great for pics and vids. its basically an ipod that works great with the pc(looks about the same aswell.  if you own a mac- stick with the ipod.  i've had friends experience problems using ipods with pc's and zunes with mac's.  not to say that it will occur- but its definately possible.  the creative soft ware is alright maybe on par with itunes- maybe a little less.  creative also works with windows media player, depending on how picky you are with software.  all in all they are all great mp3's it just depends what you are using it for really.

<Title>Very nice...with a little effort.
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zune for Christmas...almost 2 months ago, and I have to say I love it so far. At first though, it takes a little bit of effort to keep your songs in albums you want on your Zune. The software changes the song information to incorrect information sometimes, and takes it out of the album you already had it in the Zune. But you can turn the option to update song information off..did that no prob. Next, if you want to make sure every song stays in the same album folder...you have to make sure the song information for every song in that album is exactly the same, besides the title of the song of course. When you first get it and are learning this it is time consuming. Now if you have the patience and get through this, you'll enjoy your Zune. This is definitely something you need to learn to use before truly enjoying it. I've watched videos on it, the screen is great....though watching the videos drains the battery quicker, which by the way I don't think it's as long as they say....definitely less than 12 hours of listening. But I love it, it's easy to locate your music, photos, videos...the radio is unbelievable, I live in New York and was listening to a radio station from Chicago on it. My friend's wife has one, and she got signal from a radio station in Tokyo...wow!!! It's easy to navigate, the only thing that I really wasn't too fond of was the look...this thing is pretty ugly. I'll give that edge to Ipod, but that's about it. Which by the way reminds me, I've downloaded music into my Zune from CD, and the net, and haven't even used the Zune website yet. That goes to all you Itunes slaves ;)

<Title>Good, not Great
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bottom line, computer-side software is the major issue.  It's very buggy and not very user-friendly.  I consider myself a techie, and it took me some time to get used to the software interface because of all the bugs it has and finding work-arounds.  It's like the software puts you in handcuffs then expects you to have no problems using it.  Annoying bugs (I've found so far) include:  1. multiple syncs to add new music to Zune.  Example: download an .mp3, add that .mp3 to music folder, sync Zune, no new .mp3 added to Zune.  I usually have to select the "Sync Content" tab and drag/drop the new .mp3 for it to sync and add my new .mp3 to the Zune. 2. won't play .mp3s through computer.  Open up the software, click on the Zune song library, select song, click the "Play" button on the bottom of the screen, software will populate a list of 100+ songs, none of them being the one I wanted to play.  Even then, the songs do not play either through the computer or the Zune headphones. 3. won't play .mp3s on computer!  Sync Zune, go to Library/My Songs, select song, you won't be able to Play it through the Zune software. 4. Appoint just one folder for "sync folder," erase Zune, resync Zune, Zune will search entire computer for music instead of just searching that one folder, even adding music from folders that you specifically place on "ignore." 5. Connect Zune to an "other than main" computer with Zune software.  Zune software will ask you if you want to make that Zune the default Zune for that computer, if you do, it erases all information on the Zune (huh??).  **Note, I feel these are general bugs that many other users might also be experiencing.  Not all users might experience these same problems, mostly because the software it can break any number of ways, hence you can have have any number of bugs that do any number of different things.  (translation: don't trust the software!!!!)  General things I don't like about the Zune:  1. 30 gigs of storage and you can't use any of it to store files other than music/video/pictures.  The Zune has huge potential for data storage, or even having its own operating system, all wasted. 2. Accessories are way overpriced for offering nothing valuable.  See my "Zune Dock" review.  It seems like you also have to buy everything separately, too. 3. Watching videos dramatically reduces battery life due to really bright screen (see #5 for why this is a bad feature). 4. Lack of good accessories in general.  Car stereos can now play iPods directly, you'll have to wait for this feature with Zunes, along with other "good" accessories like a dock with speakers.  ;) 5. No A/C power.  It's totally dependent upon your sync cable hooking into a computer's USB drive, which means you have to turn on your computer just to recharge your Zune.  PG&E must have brokered that deal.  I've also had issues with leaving the Zune in the dock, turning off my computer at night, and the Zune's battery will be totally drained by morning. 6. Wi-Fi doesn't access local wireless networks, or even computers with wireless network cards. Another one that should have been a no-brainer.  Things that would make the Zune better:  1. Built-in speakers so you can pull the headphones out and let a bunch of people listen to it (see: Sony PSP) 2. longer battery life in general 3. A/C outlet for charging batteries (Again, this should have been a no-brainer, but Microsoft decided to follow Apple's bad example). 4. And of course: BETTER SOFTWARE!  The computer-side software is what kills this product.  Fortunately that can be fixed (and hopefully will be soon).  3 stars, simply because when you have the music on it, it works, and the video playback is way better than any other product out there.

<Title>A good starting point
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, so I have read a lot of reviews both for and against the Zune, so here is what i think of the Zune.  Before I start I have owned 3 other mp3 players, from Creative, Sony and Samsung, all have there strengths and their weaknesses. First impressions out of the box was it was a good looking media player, the finish was nice to hold, and not prone to fingerprints like the iPod.  The two tone colouring on the edges was a nice touch as well. So the first step of installing the software.  I had originally downloaded it from Microsofts Zune website, and I it seemed to take a long time to install (but that could have been me getting restless).  The software once installed was easy to use.  It is bascially Windows Media Player 11 with a few twists to it.  Still dont understand why MS went with a new piece of software.  Connecting the Zune to my laptop the first time was simple.  The Zune software started and found my Zune.  Went through the on screen setup wizard and named my Zune, after that was done the software updated my Zune no problems.  Synching music to it was straight forward.  As I like to choose what music I put on my Zune, I disabled the Auto-Synch and selected to synch to the ZUne manually.  As I add more tunes to my Music folder they are automatically added to My Library in the Zune software.  Even if I use a MP3 tag editor to adjust my MP3s these changes are also picked up by the Zune software.  As for transferring tunes to the Zune, it is by far the quickest I have ever seen.  My Samsung Media Player used WMP 11 to sycnh tunes from my laptop, and seemed to take longer than the Zune.  the 30GB hard drive is large enough to hold the music that I need when spending alot of time in airports when travelling, the sound quality is good, battery life is not as good as my Sony (12 hours compared to 30hours) but for a media player is acceptable.  As for playing music on the Zune through the computer, why would you want to do that?  The music is already on the computer.  So in conclusion The Zune is a great starting point, it may not look as pretty as people think the iPod looks, but its not a fashion parade Ok so its a Toshiba, but so what.  The iPod hard drive is made by someone else, but people dont rant and rave about that. Software works fine (yes I know microsoft have a bad rep when it comes to software), although it would have been better if it was compatible with WMP11.  All in all a good media player

<Title>I love it, but it is not an iPod killer.
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a Zune for 1 major reason: I have had two iPods that both died on me shortly after 1 year of ownership. I tried all the routes for disc recovery... to no avail. So the Zune....  I figured since it was a Zune, it would be more compatible with my PC than other devices... wrong! Let me say, first and foremost,that I have a decent PC running Windows Media Center 2002 edition. I try the Zune at work, the first day I get it, and it is sweet. I like the software, it runs faster that iTunes, and I like how it categories its songs, etc. It is not the most intuitive interface, though. But I am pleased. I play a video on the Zune, and sweet! Now that is an idea, play the video wide angle as it should be. Just takes a second to get used to the altered controls. The sound is terrrific also. I highly recommend the traveling case for the Zune, the earbud headphones in it are great. When I take the Zune, home, however, I learn that Zune software will ONLY OPERATE on windows OS products, 2005 or greater. Determined not to return it and get an iPod, I go buy Windows Vista... ... after installing Vista, I learn that my computer needs a better video card in order to run Vista better. And to better run the new video cards, I should upgrade my power supply... lol SO.. I upgrade my power supply to 650 watts...wow! And I get an ATI Radeon 1950 pro series.... all this $$ spent, but I will say it is pretty sweet.   I am saying all this just to let you know, that the Zune, like all other investments from Microsoft, may require some upgrades on your machine. BE aware. If you are like me, and like tweaking your PC all the time, then it should be fun for you.  I am greatly satisfied with the Zune's performance, overall. It plays fast, and I like the click wheel more than the scroll wheel. It responds quicker. The video quality on this device is fantastic... now if it will just last a couple years...  Also, don't leave this Zune charging unattended, overnight. The battery can overcharge and it will expand. As a result your screen will crack. And Microsoft wont exchange the item.

<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never really got into the "IPOD" or similar devices since my laptop was always with me.  I played with IPODs and other similar devices and quickly get rid of them.  Then came Zune... It looked cool not sterile like the others,  and it has a great screen (also bigger then the others)  and most important it worked great with my laptop (now running Vista!) I am travelling every week around the coutry, on planes or in my truck and my Zune is with me all the time,  it has family videos,  pictures and all my music.  My kids love to use it with speakers at night to fall asleep to, I have several kids tracks for them :-)   Now I have to get one for my son who is 8yo!

<Title>The Microsoft Zune
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There is much to be said about this product, there really is...  I believe that the zune has received a lot of, shall i say, undeserved criticism. First, The Software, Many have said it is just awful, oh how i beg to differ. Im not going to say it is great. But the term "awful" is just too harsh. Look at iTunes, its up to what, its 7.00 Generation right? That means that they have had AT LEAST 7 updates to their original iTunes concept. What's Zune Marketplace at? 1, number 1. Meaning that they have done no serious updates yet, i mean sure they have fixed a few bugs and glitches, thereby making it version 1.02 or something, but not officially "2". I for one, have successfully installed Zune Marketplace on a total of 2 computers, Zero problems. My main computer is a fairly old one, with it's processor clocking in at 2.6ghz and 768mb of RAM, but it is Running XP with ZMP (Zune Marketplace) with little or no lags. The second one i installed it on was a much newer desktop, with a processor clock spead of 2.2ghz, but it is one of those new Core Duo 2. and it has 2 gig's of RAM and running XP.   The software is basically a slimmer version of Windows Media Player 11 (WMP11) Its got the same "black" interface and it also shows the Album Art very nicely, may i add the fact that WMP11 and ZMP both automatically retrieve that album art for you on most or all of your songs, this Album Art is compatible with the Zune and when synced shows up clearly on the screen. There are a few downs to the software, for one, it doesnt support that many video formats, for example, you will not be able to play .avi, .vob, .mpg and a few others. it only accepts .mp4 or .wmv it will just refuse to play anything else. (one of the reasons this is a 4 star and not a 5)   So that is the software... another undeserved criticism that i feel is, well, undeserved (haha) is:   The Wi-Fi. Prior to my Zune purchase i read reviews that had listed Wi-Fi as a CON, meaning that it worsened the player. Here are some of my thoughts.   Think of the PSP (Sony's Playstation Portable) It has Wi-Fi, and it has from the get-go, and oh so many of purchased it and it is the "Cool" portable gaming system for most teenagers, as it has great graphic detail in its games and it plays music, video, and views photos as well as Wi-Fi. and so many people have bought it. Look this up if you want, as i know it is true. The PSP does NOT ALLOW YOU to send songs to other psp's, it only allows you to send photo's. (might I add that it does this really well) and to this day it still cannot send music or video to another PSP. If you can remember, and if you cant then look it up, the PSP started out with Wi-Fi, but you could not do ANYTHING with it except play with other PSP's and share Photo's. That was IT, no Internet Browser. But since then it has been updated. No, not the hardware, the Firmware (basically the PSP's operating system) this update is and was free and made it so that if you wanted the Latest and Greatest PSP you didnt have to buy a new one. all you had to do was update it. This is the SAME with the Zune, whenever Microsoft releases a new firmware for the zune, it will most likely have new features and bug/glitch fixes, yes, FOR FREE, all in good time. In my opinion, the only real difference than the Zune and the PSP (Software wise, not hardware) is that the zune starts off with Photo and Music Sharing, whereas the PSP was only Photo. Thumbs Up to the Zune!  Ok, i got off topic and for that im sorry, what i was trying to get to is that you cannot mark the Wi-Fi as a CON, as does it do any harm to you? You can just go to the settings menu and simply turn it off, no harm done.    At least the Zune offers it (unlike the ipod) so why mark it as a con? As i said before, the zune will be updated (firmware wise) and it will have exciting new features... all in good time.   What many people are failing to get is that this is the First Generation of the Zune. The ipod is up to 5, well, 5.5. I'll bet that the first ipod was not without its glitches. I got the zune for a few reasions,   for one, i wanted to support a newcomer as its always good to see what they have to offer instead of ignoring them.   Also, the zune has much more to offer, it has the same or at least comparable battery life as the iPod's (rated 14 hours (both of them) but i recieved an average of 10)   and the Zune also has Wi-Fi,   Radio (which by the way works great, it even displayed the Station's Name and the artist/song/year of what you are currently listening to)   and the biggest one for me was multi audio format support. It supports Apple's Own AAC Format (if you ever ripped one of your CD's with iTunes it will indeed work on the zune, but sadly, the purchased music WILL NOT) it also supports WMA, and MP3. It has a larger screen than the ipod's, and the OS (operating system) really uses it to display larger video and the Album Art really conquers the screen when playing music (in  a good way). It also is Scratch Proof, unlike the ipod. (one of the reasons i rated this a 4 star)  Really, the only bad things i can really say about the Zune is the Screen Quality, it has a larger screen than the ipod, but it has the same resolution (how many pixels are in the screen) it isnt noticeable at all, except when you are holding a zune and an iPod next to each other it is slightly noticeable. but it isn't like a deal-breaker factor here. also the screen can scratch up as well, as does the ipod. So heck, for 250 dollars (currently 235 on amazon) it is well worth the purchase and i would recommend it to anyone I know and many i don't even know. Please, feel free to comment as I would love to hear other's opinions about this product (weather it be complementing on my review, or complaining about my review, or just stating your opinion about the Zune). Thankyou for reading, if you did....

<Title>1 hour with my ZUNE caused 3 days on the phone with Tech Support!!!
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the ZUNE and was excited to come home and get it going. I put the disc in and started to install the software. When it asked me to plug in the ZUNE i did so and my computer froze completly. After restarting i finish installing the software (took FOREVER to complete) The media player was a nightmare. Slow choppy movement and constantly freezing for a few seconds. Not my computers fault (if thats what your thinking) it is just poor software. Well i realise that everytime i plug my zune into the computer, it locks the computer up. I tried getting online to check the zune HELP section and wait a minute...somehow ZUNE deleted my ethernet driver!?!?! It took 3 days and many hours on the phone and live tech chat to get my computer back to working properly. Needless to say i uninstalled ALL zune software and exchanged my zune for an ipod.

<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I installed the zune software, plugged in the zune when prompted, and the crap instantly hit the fan. Windows crashed, I couldnot restart the computer for the harddrives failed. I plugged them into my other pc to try and re assemble them and recover what data I could. Needless to say everything got instantly scrambled. I could not even retrieve Windows it's self! I lost All my files, games, my immaculate grade point avarage(I lost over 6 current large scale assgnments 3 of them due the very next day my excuse not accepted, i should have plugged the zune into her computer...) anyhooooooooo.... I was not too pleased with microsoft after that. Returned the zune and bought myself a brand new apple IPOD.

<Title>Zune is awesome
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is awesome and I am so happy I did not fall for the Ipod trend or hype. This small device is a joy to listen to. My words cannot describe how much I love this thing. It even comes with preloaded music and videos that if you don't like you can always delete. The Zune pass subscription is awesome if you can afford it. I have been missing the benefits of being a Zune pass member.  You can listen to full songs and albums to choose to put on your Zune at will. Love it, but be warned because once you cancel or stop paying your monthly subscription fee you lose all your songs and none of the files can be played on your Zune, so I recommend buying Zune gift cards to buy songs from the marketplace once in a while especially if you just rip and convert all your music like I do and it also maybe handy once Microsoft starts adding podcasts and movies to the Zune marketplace. Also I think Zune pass members can keep content from the Zune marketplace if you do not download much music and most of your content is comedy albums.

<Title>Pleased with Zune so far!
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Zune two weeks back. I am very pleased with the performance and feature set so far. The Zune software installed flawlessly on the new Vista operating system. I did not encounter any glitch so far as other Zune owner has experienced. The Sync operation is flawless and faster than the ipod (I currently own the first generation ipod nano). I like the radio features that also includes the remote data service feature. Pro: RDS, Wireless, any image can be set as background Con: No support for audio books that are DRM protected and can play in Windows media player Not as hip and sleek as ipod The battery drains very quickly.

<Title>ok, but not the best product
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my zune a couple days after Christmas and I was very excited to bring it home. When I finally got home me and my dad tried to install the software. It took us about four hours it was really really hard to figure out. I called zune customer service and waited for someone to come to the phone for about 25 minutes and when someone finally answered the phone they spoke about 1 word of English. we did in the end, get the software installed but it was very hard talking to that lady on the phone. About the product, it works pretty good for playing music except the zune software automatically put everything I had on itunes (I also have an ipod nano) onto my zune even my sisters song (which I didn't want. It also put every single picture on my computer (which some I didn't want) but, the product works great other than the battery runs out really fast but if you are like me and you skateboard (or do any other sports) I would recommend getting a thinner Mp3 player (the zune is really bulky).

<Title>Very Pleased!!!
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me say I have both an Ipod and now a Zune. I love it. So far i have not experienced any of the software problems listed on here. Everything works exactly as it's supposed to. The sound is great and the slightly larger screen seems to make a huge differance. Sure some of the features are over kill but when it boils down to it it's a music player just like the Ipod. The Ipod and the Zune are both great music players the extras on both are a bonus. I say if you want an Ipod get one. No one's holding a gun to all of you Zune haters to go and buy a Zune. But I have both and the Zune does exactly what it's supposed to do.

<Content>i've had my zune for about three weeks now. i got to say, it's pretty darn cool. but you're looking at my rating and going, "what?" read below and you'll find out.  CONS: well, it might just be my device, but i've been having problems with it ever since the day i got it. the software is really tricky, the battery life is practically NON-EXISTENT. freezes about half the time. if you're turned on by the wi-fi, don't even bother. no one even has a zune and even if they do, the sharing takes a long time and you can only have it for 3 days/plays. oh, and it's chunky. and it's not a scroll wheel (ie. ipod)  PROS: HUGE screen. pretty much scratch resistent. radio. video. pictures are good quality. good sound. the interface is cool.

<Title>Very Happy with the Microsoft Zune Player
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a Microsoft Zune 30-GB MP3 player last month and am very pleased with its performance, compact design, sound quality, battery life and ease of use.  I have used the Zune to listen to saved MP3 files, as well as its built-in FM radio, which has very good sound quality with FM radio stations with varying degrees of signal strength, including very weak ones.  One feature that I really like about the Zune's FM radio is that it displays the radio station's call letters, the station's format and current song information on the Zune display if the particular station that you are listening to transmits that digital information within its signal.  So, if you want to listen to a favorite FM radio program or music that you don't have saved on your Zune, you can always use its FM radio.  A feature that I very much like about the Zune when playing an MP3 file from an album is that the Zune displays the album's cover on its display.  In fact, when you are browsing through the music that you saved on your Zune, you can see each album's cover, which is shown as an icon next to the album name.  Of course, if the Zune's PC software was unable to recover the image for a particular album, then it will use a default album icon, but you have the option of using a different album image by supplying it directly to the Zune's PC software.  As for the Zune's PC software, I had absolutely no difficulties installing it on my PC, which uses the Microsoft Windows XP operation system.  Upon installing the software, it automatically checked for any updates from Microsoft, found the updates and updated both the PC software and the embedded Zune software with no problems.  It then found all of the music files that I already had on my PC that I had copied from CD's that I had purchased and synchronized the Zune with my own music collection.  The Zune's PC software is easy to use to copy CD's.  It's also very easy to then synchronize (copy) the new music files onto the Zune with only a few mouse drags & clicks.  The only occasional problem that I have found is that the Zune software will sometimes separate a song from the rest of the songs on a particular album.  When this happens, you'll see what appears to be two separate albums stored on the Zune; but this can be corrected by copying the misplaced song back with the rest of the original album's songs on the Zune's PC software followed by resynchronizing it with the Zune.  It's also easy to copy image and video files onto the Zune.  As for the Zune's battery life, Microsoft programmers were good in ensuring that battery life will be extended by automatically turning off the Zune's display when you are just listening to music or the radio.  If you change the volume or do something else with the Zune's menus, then the display will automatically come back on.  Of course, if you're watching a video or looking at images, this requires a higher sustained current draw on the battery, so the battery's charge won't last as long.  If you are planning to watch videos frequently on the Zune, then you might want to keep a charger or the Zune's computer cable with you so that you can keep the batteries charged.  I have listened to music stored on the Zune for many hours on a single charge.  Now, given that the Zune is still a relatively new product, there are probably a few bugs in its software as I have seen it inexplicably freeze (unable to turn on) as some other reviewers have mentioned, but I have not seen this condition last more than a minute.  Microsoft is probably working to solve this problem in a downloadable software update.  Hence, my overall rating for the Microsoft Zune is 4 out 5 stars as I very much enjoy using it.  Before you decide to purchase a Zune (or any other portable MP3 player), do some research to determine if some other manufacturer's MP3 player is more suitable in meeting your own individual needs, as there are quite a few manufacturers producing portable MP3 players. That's what I did.  A note for XBox 360 owners: you can share files  between the Zune and the XBox 360.  Also, if you have a registered XBox 360 online account, you can use that same account with your Zune.

<Title>Clean look with basic features
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>6 hours prior to writing this, I purchased the Microsoft Zune at a local Wal-Mart. Interestingly enough, I had gone to purchase a wireless laser mouse to replace the daily use of my laptop's nub. While waiting for a cashier to ring up my purchase, I saw the boxes of Zunes neatly stacked and locked from many a child's hand and the occasional electronics thief. My exact words were, "I think I want a Zune.". My question/statement was quickly replied with a curious, "Huh?" from the store clerk. I quickly regained composure and confidently said, "I want that grey Zune. Oh, it's Black." pointing at the display case.   I rushed home to carefully cut the tape along the edge and slowly pull out the inner box. From a first impression, the outside appearance I was definately impressed. Everything was neatly packed within the pockets and flaps. I installed the software and performed the firmware update. At first the entire Zune media program was a bit confusing, but after a couple minutes of random clickling, everything was okie dokies.   Music transfers were easy enough, although if you wanted to keep things organized, it'd take a bit more time to set up your playlists and such. Videos are pretty much the same. My only complaint was with the inablity to use the .avi format. I had to use a third-party program to convert the videos to either .mpeg or .wmv. The FM reciever is a nice feature with superb clarity and sound.   Lastly, I went back to Wal-Mart and purchased the Zune AV cables. Coincidentally, the same girl that helped me with the Zune purchase unlocked the case for me. She was like, "You were here earlier today weren't you?". Yeah, one of those..."Uhh, yeeaahh..." moments. So, that's pretty much it.   The 30 GB capacity is more than enough for practical use. Honestly...you don't need the ability to listen to thousands of songs while away from your computer... It's not that it's hard to navigate the menus or to add songs in neat playlists, rather it's the repetative process to load the songs, then create a playlist for them, followed by loading onto the device. Overall, it's a well made multimedia device with a simple interface for any user, new or expreienced.   *Edit* Returned the Zune and purchased the Cowon A2. Had all of the features wanted that weren't available in the Zune. The Cowon made the Zune and iPod Video look like a joke. Really.

<Title>Zune HAS promise
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a decent media player that has a few areas that need a lot of improvement.  First off, the wi-fi is worthless at the moment and should not be any reason to purchase the device.  As an mp3 player it really does a decent job which gives it a chance to survive in the mp3 player world.  Navigation is nice and in some terms a superior alternative to the iPod's.  Sound quality is on par with other media devices.  As an mp3 player it's off to a good start.  Now the unit as a whole leaves the user some things to be desired: more custom menus and functions, A CLOCK with alarm, sleep timer, etc., little extra features like games and contacts, calendar, etc.  Now what gives the 1G Zunes promise is updateable firmware which can lead to these features popping up on later updates (especially if the Zune users voice the need and want for additional features).  Overall, if you want to support another company besides Apple, be an early adopter, or want a Zune for some niche reason like fashion statement, get one.  I recommend anyone else to wait for improvements to kick in or pony up the same amount of money for a (currently superior) iPod.  The Zune is nice, the price for what you get just doesn't justify it yet.

<Title>There is room for improvement...
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Cowon iAudio X5 is pretty much standing on its last legs, so I decided to pick up a white Zune at Best Buy (I had some Reward Dollar coupons to blow, otherwise it would have been an Amazon purchase for sure).  Determined to get the full Zune experience I also decided to sign up to the Zune Marketplace via the Zune Pass, which is a subscription based music service with unlimited downloads as long as you remain a subscriber, at $14.95 a month. Yay for me!  Upon opening the box my initial impressions were 100% positive.  The overall design of the look and design of the player are what won me over the iPod--namely the larger screen, the scratch resistant finish, and a set of simple controls I am used to.  There is no touch sensitive wheel here, only a basic 4 way directional pad with center select button, a play/pause button and a back button, which works very similarly to other DMPs out there like the X5 and Toshiba Gigabeat. The music playing options are also pretty robust, from choosing playlists based on genre, artist, album, as well as both custom and downloadable playlists, which is a refreshing change from the tree-based X5 file interface.  The Zune works seamlessly with the Zune Player software, which is included on CD and is essentially a re-skinned Windows Media Player with Zune specific menu options, and a built in Zune Marketplace storefront.  The software itself seems stable enough, and the interface is very streamlined and simple to use.  No lockups as of yet synching and unsynching my Zune while running multiple programs on Windows XP MCE. I'm guessing software updates are fixing problems people have encountered earlier.  The Zune is, for the most part, your standard fare when it comes to MP3 players.  At $249 for 30GB it's middle-of the road in price and abilities.  Like most other DMPs, it is a fairly capable device that plays, WMA, MP3s, and non-protected AAC (a nice surprise) music files, and WMV, MPEG4 and H.264 coded videos. The size of the Zune is slightly larger than the latest iPods, but that is made up for by the beautiful and large 3" color screen with a 320x240 pixel resolution. Battery life averages out about 12 hours because of it.  The Zune also has some other pretty cool features that not too many people know about.  For one, having a built in FM Tuner is very nice (although not having FM recording like the X5 is a downer). Another touted feature of the Zune is that it is WiFi enabled -- unfortunately it is not very well implemented in its current state.  About the only thing you can do right now is wirelessly send songs along with a "three play license" to other Zunes. And honestly this is a lame feature.  Hopefully a Firmware upgrade will fully enable the Zune to shared media back and forth with a PC or 360 via WiFi.  Here's to hoping. Another great feature is how it works so seamlessly with an Xbox 360.  While you can't connect and share music via WiFi (yet), a quick USB hookup to the 360 and your Home Theater system means instant music with great quality through your home speakers.  Another interesting tidbit -- you can use Xbox Live Marketplace points to buy songs from the Zune Marketplace, and vice versa for Xbox Live content.  The Photo Viewer is very well done, and pictures show up nicely and in very good resolution on the Zune screen.  When I think of the Photo mode i am reminded of my friends and sister's wedding photos, and how great it would be if they all owned Zunes.  That way they can show me a slideshow that changes those wonderful photos every .5 seconds instead of having to flip through a deck of prints and ooh and ahh for 2 minutes before shuffling to the next one.  Video is also nice-looking on the Zune, but unlike the iPod there's not a lot of downloadable video content like TV shows and movies.  As a matter of fact, there is no video content on Zune Marketplace. For any other type of video you may have, however, it's very simple to convert, download and play them on a Zune using the included software.  And that's the major negative right now about the Zune -- content.  The Zune Marketplace is very promising especially from someone who is very open-minded and enthusiastic about music in general, and likes to listen to new material without prejudice. In this scenario Zune works extremely well.  For instance one day I had fancied listening to the latest dance/electronica music.  A quick look at the Zune Marketplace and they have a section of playlists where you can find stuff like this.  A simple click and I had downloaded "The Best Electronic 2006" featuring artists I had no idea existed.  But d***, the music was good. Microsoft has hit on something good here, for sure.  On the other hand, the content is not as nearly as robust as iTunes.   The other negative in my mind as a wannabe audiophile is that Zune does not support my two favorite formats, FLAC and OGG. True uncompressed like WAV is impractical, so having a good compromise like FLAC kept my ears happy.  Oh well, I guess 192 kbps MP3s will have to do.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with my new Zune.  It works very well as a music player, and as a photo and video viewer.  The interface is nice and clean both hardware and software-wise, and it's combination of compact size and large display make it a winner in my book.  I intend to hold onto it for awhile and am sure will serve its duty well as my main portable media player for the next couple of years. Hopefully its main shortcomings -- downloadable content and more robust WiFi, will be addressed by Microsoft in the upcoming months. A fully WiFi enabled Zune with killer content would make the Zune as easily attractive as any other player, iPod included.

<Content>Mine is in the mail. It's going to be fixed again. Most of the reviews here are full of it! They all sound like commercials!  If you really want to know what owning a zune is like before you buy it simply sort this list from worst to best by rating and read 10 or so of the more honest reviews.  I'd be surprised if this device does not generate a lawsuit or two before it fades into obscurity.

<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK. I am an ex-ipod owner. That's because I left the ipod era behind and decided to switch to the Zune. I did all the research possible. I downloaded and reconfigured the zune software. I updated the firmware and zune software itself. YOU HAVE TO BE A SUPER TECHIE TO WORK THE ZUNE AND ITS SOFTWARE. So...Unless you are a super techie genius that can master metatags and troubleshooting as well as operating a throughly confusing interface on the zune itself. Don't DO IT!!!  Yes, I am a techie so I am used to troubleshooting but the average user meaning most of you reading Should STAY AWAY FROM THE ZUNE!!!! Heed the warning.

<Title>Zune - some good and bad
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought the Zune with photo storage capability in mind and we love the size and quality of the Zune screen.  With a new Vista laptop, we decided to give the Zune a try rather than upgrading my much loved older iPod.  My husband, who is not a "techi", got the software loaded, music and photos ripped and downloaded with no trouble.  He loves it!  The Zune sound is great and the image quality is great (but I can't stop my fingers from trying to turn that non-existant trackwheel.)   The bad, for me, is that the Zune won't play Audible books, which we love. We've contacted both Zune and Audible so maybe that will be in a future upgrade. It took a while to realize we could play the movies from my little Sony camera (MOV), which my grandson loves, by editing them in the MS Windows Movie Maker.  Forget the earbuds that come with it and get something really good like the Bose earbuds.  And for most of us, forget the wi-fi transmittal of songs - a transmitted song can be played 3 times and then disappears, so it's just a gimmick.  The good is that for people who would like to keep things simple, the Zune looks and acts just like Microsoft Media 11.  That's a big plus for people who want to get going quickly with an MP3 media player. Most people don't know that music stored in iTunes is not compatible with Microsoft Media 11, so if you use an iPod, you won't be using your computer's Media 11 for your songs. With the Zune software, your music is compatible.  Great sound and image quality and a simple to use product are definitely good things.  Like everything else you buy, you just have to decide which aspect of the product is most important to you.  The Zune has some great features, but isn't perfect.

<Title>Got one as a gift (wish I could give it back)
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After having three ipods, I really wasn't looking for a Zune but a friend who likes Microsoft a lot bought me one for Christmas.  With friends like this I don't need enemies.  This product is terrible.  Buying music is a problem because you buy points that apply to the music and it's just not straight forward.    The sound quality of the player is adequate but otherwise it is a poor wannabe ipod.  The case is like it was made by tupperware and the software it  integrates with on the PC is crashprone and just flat out doesn't work.  Run don't walk away from the Zune!

<Title>No Better than iPod!
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was so excited when I got my new Zune in the mail.  I recently sold my iPod because it was so incompatible with Walmart music downloads (88 cents to iTunes 99!), windows media player, and all my other music software.  I decided to get a zune.  But it is huge! Very large design.  And it is no more compatible than iPod!!!  It will not work with any software other than zune.  No Windows Media Player, Musicmatch Jukebox, Walmart downloads, or anything else.  The ipod is much cooler looking, and is much smaller.  The zune's colors are boring compared to iPod's.  If you are trying to decide between two incompatible mp3 players - choose iPod!!!

<Title>Zune tastic
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my Zune. I bought another for my son. Great screen. Easy to use, holds plenty - I dont need to carry around more than 7500 songs. The Zune Marketplace works great and they have a lot of off-beat (no pun intended) titles.   I'd like to see movies become available but that's not a big issue for me. Just a nice thing to have.   The unit is durable and doesnt scratch. The premium ear buds are really great. I bought the accessory kit that includes them, along with the Altec-Lansing speaker system so I can listen without earphones. That also is a very good quality piece of equipment.

<Title>Nice but Deceptive
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a black 30 gb Microsoft Zune a week before Christmas at a local Costco store. I enjoyed the device for 3 and a half months with no complaints at all. In early March I was charging my device and returned to find a crack in the LCD screen due to a mechanical flaw. Me along with many other dissappointed Zune owners discovered that while charging, the Zune's battery starts to overheat and and the battery expands putting pressure on the LCD screen. The screen then cracks under the pressure. I called the Zune tech support and their reply was, "We cannot fix the crack in the LCD screen because it is not under warranty. We do not know any retailers that can fix your device." In a nutshell they told me that there is nothing they can do about it, it is not under warranty, and that they don't know where you can take it to be fixed. Apparantly I am not the only one to call regarding this problem and I would not recommend the Zune to anyone. You should wait for the second generation Zune so Microsoft can fix their problems or better yet buy a Sandisk Sansa or an Apple iPod. I am extremely disappointed.

<Title>A great start
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is a great start for other MP3 players to finally compete with the iPod series.  The Zune seems to directly compete with the iPod video (30 gb version, of course) in every aspect.  The iPod is better in some respects, but the Zune wins it for me.  Price: Zune is about $30 more than the iPod version in stores, but $20 cheaper online?! Most people reading this review are online buyers I'm sure.  I was one of the unfortunates that bought the Zune in stores when it hit the shelves.  Interface: The Zune is slightly better than the iPod in its interface.  The 'touch and twirl' features for scolling and volume control on the iPod lost it's novelty a long time ago.  You can do the same thing with the Zune on it's buttons.  The best thing I found that Zune is more customizable for it menu's (after the first basic teir), but customization is a catch 22 for non power users. But the best thing is that the Zune doesn't seem to lag when it's full like the iPod does.  Accessories: You have a far wider range of choice when it comes to accessorizing the iPod.  You can do all of the same things with Zune accessories, but the iPod has more choices such as manufacturer, size, and quality.  I had my iPod hooked to my truck so I could plug and play it on the go, and to my home theater system.  I can do the same with the Zune, and for a negligable difference in price.  I can see there being problems though, if you want to be different than your buddy.  There are dozens of docks for the iPod (though mostly for the nano), and only two (that I have found so far) for the Zune.  Support: Hands down Zune.  If your iPod has problems you better hope the customer service guy you talk to that day is in America and is having a good day, or else your out $240.  I have no true experience for myself with the Zune having a problem, so I'm going with the Microsoft CS reputation on this, who are by far the best people for technical problems (just don't bother them with software issues, they act like apple programmed windows or something).  Pictures: Zune has a bigger screen, so Zune wins this one, otherwise there is no real difference.  Video: Zune has a bigger screen and the video quality is better.  They both support video out.  Games: None for the Zune, iPod wins this.  Size: The iPod is thinner, but seems about the same weight as the Zune.  The Zune feels different than the iPod though when running or lifting weights.  If you run a treadmill you won't forget the Zune is there, that's for sure.  Some of the armbands for the zune out there rival the ones for the iPod for crappiness. If you want an Mp3 player for working out, get a Nano or some cheap $25 little thing, neither one of these cuts it.  Damage:  Some of us hate the iPod for one thing - scratches.  These things get scratched if you look at them wrong.  So you have to cover them up at all times or it looks like absolute crap.  The Zune isn't much better.  So if you really care how your iPod or Zune casing looks, it doesn't matter, because in order to keep it in premo condition you need to cover it up with some other case.  Software: This is the kicker for me.  Already there is third party software for the Zune that really allows users to take advantage of it's features.  iTunes Marketplace v. Zune Marketplace: They both have about the same pitfalls.  iTunes has proven it won't listen to customer feedback to improve it's software, Z Mktplce is new, so there is hope.  Wireless: Zune wins, because iPod simply doesn't have it.  The wireless feature is cool in another respect, because Zune owners are so few that walking down the street and finding another on wireless is like a secret handshake, and you simply have to meet the person.  Just look for the other guy staring down all the people with headphones, and scowling at the multitude of iPod users.  Battery: Close, but iPod lasts longer, even when the Zune wireless is off expect about 6-10 hrs depending on video usage, iPod isn't much better, but it's better. Wireless will destroy your music time.  But for me, battery doesn't matter too much, since I am never away from an outlet or truck for more than a few hours at a time.  All in all - Zune is better for me because it is the 'counter culture' of the Mp3 industry, it has more features, larger screen, and is better for power users.  The Zune should be the first in a long line of competition for the iPod, but I think the Zune will lag behind the far better established iPod for years to come.

<Title>So far, so good
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've read that 3 out of 4 mp3 players purchased are iPods, so I decided to rock the boat and try a Zune. So far, it does the job and I really like it. The software was easy to install- I downloaded it online before I bought the player and it imported all of my iTunes music and pictures automatically.   Like any other electronic, the battery life is way shorter when I am playing around with it (i.e. playing videos, sorting through pictures, and generally pushing a lot of buttons)- maybe three or four hours. However, if I'm just letting it play music, it lasts AT LEAST 8 to 9 hours.   The wireless feature is neat in theory, but pretty much useless because everyone has iPods. I never planned to use it. The only real gripe is that I can't adjust the music settings. There are just pre-set ones: rock, jazz, and so forth. Even this, though, is not a HUGE deal.   I gave it three stars because it is an average product; it does what it says it will, nothing more, nothing less. I happen to love it, but that's just me.

<Title>Looks and sounds great, complicated software, short battery life
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a little money to burn so I thought I'd pick up an .mp3 player with some decent space and the ability to play video on the go.  In the end I figured I would choose between the "Elephant in the room" Apple's iPod or Microsoft's Zune.  After all, Microsoft has a reputation for getting into technology and catching up in a hurry.  Just look at the xBox line and Windows mobile.  What really sold me on the Zune was the screen.  If I'm going to be showing people my home videos and downloading a DVD or two I like on it I might as well get something that will show it off well.  So I got the Zune.  The screen does do well.  My home videos look AWESOME after converting them for the Zune.  I even put a DVD on it but had to find 3rd party software to do that.  The screen has not let me down.  The sound is also pretty good.  I have another mp3 player by Rio and this does seem to make the music sound a bit better.  So I have no complaints there.  However, there are two shortcomings that really irk me.  The first is the software.  It is hard to believe that this is Microsoft because of the complexity involved in getting things to work.  Not to brag, but I do work within the technology field and I can make complicated software work, but even I struggled with this a bit.  My mother has an iPod and she has told me that making things work the way she wants couldn't be simpler.  I can't imagine trying to talk her through getting this to work properly.  It almost feels like an act of congress just to create a playlist.  This was designed for automatic updates so I hope Microsoft resolves this soon.  My player already got their latest release which added a few nice features and settings that were desperately needed from the first release.  But they still have a lot of catching up to do before I'd put this on par with the iPod.  My other gripe is the battery life.  I listen to my music while working but this doesn't even make it through an entire 8-hour workday without running dry.  That means that I get nothing for the commute home unless I buy some power pack.  But with such a low battery life I wish they had included an extra power cord for me to take to work.  And for over $200 they could have included some sort of carrying case.  What they have included doesn't have any functionality and is so small you have to squeeze the Zune into it.  There are no holes so once it is in this little bad you are not able to see the screen or navigate the menus.  It makes me wonder if any real thought was put into its release.  There are not a lot of accessories for this yet but I'm sure they are coming.  I won't fault them for that.  Wireless?  I think Microsoft was trying to find something to differentiate it from an iPod but I think most people (me included) basically shrugged with a "so what?"  If they wanted to be different how a voice recorder or an integrated digital camera.  My recommendations... if you need the video screen then go with the Zune and try to look past its unfriendly software.  The size of the screen is the only advantage this has over an iPod.  Otherwise, go with an iPod.  It is not only easier to use, but it costs the same and is more established and recognized through the industry.

<Title>Isn't it ironic...
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>...that people who want to be more 'indie', not following the flock are buying a product from Microsoft, the biggest computing company in the world?  Sometimes products succeed based on merit. The iPod, I am afraid, is just one of those examples. You may be fed up with how it looks, or that everyone has got one, but when something performs so well you might as well bite the bullet and get one. It isn't the hardest choice to make in the world. Kids in Africa are dying of starvation and disease whilst we debate the purchasing choice. Stop wasting your time and get on with it.  As for the Zune? It looks good, is built well, and sure, it has a bigger screen. What it doesn't have is iTunes. Nor better battery life. As for the wi-fi. It's a white herring. It didn't sound good in theory and is even worse in practice. Which, I'm afraid, brings us back to the iPod. Shame.

<Title>It's all about the sound...
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zune just after Christmas this year when everyone was showing up at work with their new iPods, Creative Zens, and other personal media players.  Feeling left out, I decided to go check out the market to see if I could find a product that would meet my needs as a consumer.  After a week of research and checking out the store displays, I decided to purchase the Zune player and I've been very satisfied with the product overall.  During my research, I found some bad reviews about syncing issues and battery life for the Zune player.  However, as I researched further into other products I found this was not uncommon for almost every player on the market, especially the iPod.  Although it stands to reason that the iPod would have more issues posted on the internet since it is the most popular personal media player.  So it came down to 3 players from which I decided to choose:  Apple iPod (30 gig), Creative Zen Vision M, and the Zune.  Each of these products had the feature set I was looking for and each was within a few dollars of the others in price.  So now it was time for the "taste test".  I went to my local electronics store where all 3 products were displayed and asked a sales associate to assist me.  As I handled each of the players, my first impression was that the Zune felt sturdy and well made.  It's thicker than the iPod and not quite as wide as the Zen, which felt just right in my hand.  I also preferred the flat black finish on the Zune player to the glossy black Zen or the "kitchen appliance" white of the iPod.    The OS and navigation on all of the players was easy to figure out with only a few differences between them.  While I like the wheel control of the iPod (probably it's best feature), both the Zune and Zen offered compensatory navigation methods to locate media within a large list of files.  The display on the iPod was a bit small compared to the other 2 players, but it was still quite readable.  Finally, with all things being even, it came down to the sound.  I plugged in a set of of inexpensive lightweight Sony headphones that I had brought to the store with me and listened to each product with the sample content on different preset EQ settings.  To me, the Zune had the best sound overall, which was the selling point.  The high end was crisp and clear while the low end was deep and rich, even on my cheap headphones.  Final thoughts:    So far I've been quite happy with the Zune player.  The battery life is good when listening to music but a bit short when viewing video content.  I like the album art display when browsing my music content and when playing.  The picture slide show features are a nice touch as well and provide a way for me to share my photos in a portable manner.    Also, Microsoft is working to update the features of the Zune through firmware updates.  So the feature set you see now could well get better as the product development progresses.  I'm personally hoping that Microsoft decides to support their own Plays-For-Sure technology to open the available online content and make it more competitive with the Zen.  Finally, if you purchase a Zune player, get a decent set of headphones.  The headphones shipped with the product do not do it justice.  This is Especially true if you're like me and you rip your CD collection to your player at a quality bit rate.  Pros: - Full rich sound - Easy content navigation - Large display - Photo slide show feature - Good battery life for playing music  Cons: - Headphones shipped with the product are substandard - Battery life severely shortened when viewing video content - Not currently Plays-For-Sure compatible

<Content>For the same price, you get better value from an iPod. Yes, the iPod has a slightly smaller screen. It also is thinner and has a longer lasting battery. When the screen is held up, the size isn't that big of a difference, and it's the same pixel resolution.   Microsoft is attempting to mimic the iPod ecosystem, but you can't just go out and buy a song for 99 cents. You have to buy it in points, and one point does not equal one penny. At least with the Wii point system, you don't get confused on how much money you've spent.   Sharing is so slow that there isn't much point. By the time you share a song with someone, you'd be better off just letting them borrow your Zune for three minutes.   Yeah, yeah. People think the iPod is overpriced and overhyped. I have to say that it really isn't. When you pick up and use an iPod, it screams quality. The Zune just does not.

<Content>Of course, the Zune will always be compared to the IPod. I had a 30 GB Ipod Video and now the Zune and I will have to give the edge to the Zune.  The screen size, quality and interface I find much better on the Zune than on the Ipod.  Also, the battery life on the Zune is much better in my day to day usage.  It is easy to use and the Zune software works as you'd expect it to.  True ,the iTunes store has more content, but the Zune Marketplace has a big catalog on its own -- however there is no videos available for purchase on the Zune Marketplace yet.  It'd be nice to see them add the Xbox Marketplace video catalog to the Zune.  I probably wouldn't buy video for my Zune, but it'd be nice to see.  The wifi sharing feature is very cool as well as I've been able to send a few pictures and share a few songs with my friends Zune.  It also works seemlessly with my Xbox 360.  Overall it's a nice product, and the built in FM receiver is a nice addition.  I like the iPod, but I am enjoying my Zune much better.

<Title>I tried to like it.
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So i picked this product up after my brother had an unfortunate accident with my 30g black iPod, i thought what the hell, i love Microsoft software, i might as well try some hardware.   i was really excited when i received the player, first of all the EXCELLENT packaging, its VERY well done, and now i see why they put so much effort into the packaging.  Upon taking the player out for the first time i was immediatly dissapointed with the size and build quality of the Zune, i mean if anything felt like cheap plastic this was it, i mean the screen is 10/10 i love the interface and cleartype font, also the ability to choose themes is pretty cool too. so i messed around with the pre-loaded content for a while and then decided to install the software and get going.  I am running Windows Vista Home Premium, well the included disc doesnt like that, wont install sodtware, so i have to go to the Zune homepage to download, no problem, i have a decent connection so its done in a few seconds, so i finally get through the install, and then im going through a prelimenary set of questions, "do you want to sync?", "do you want to add files to library?" etc. well i decided not to do this because i have about 12,000 songs so its kind of pick and choose for me. even though i chose not to sync or add files it ignored me and started syncing my files (all 12,000, and i know all of them wouldnt have fit) in alphabetical order, which wasnt bad becasue i figured ok ill just stop the sync, no dice, tried and tried, Zune software froze after about 4 program restarts i could finally stop it, then i wanted some more space so i tried to delete the pre-installed media, well i tried and it just hung and froze some more, so that was pretty much the last straw for me, i returned the Zune and picked up another 30gb black iPod and i was up and running with iTunes in about 5 minutes.  Other things i just couldnt stand: 1. WiFi, wow talk about battery drain and completley pointless. 2. i got a chance to check out the Zune marketplace, ehh not so much yet. 3. Clickwheel, enough said i just really love my clickwheel. 4. horrible EQ.  overall i really tried to like it but it was just too time consuming and cumbersome for me to keep a second longer, and please dont call me an Apple fanboy becasue i am completley opposite, and am 100% MS fanboy, trust me.

<Title>I really wanted to like this.
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After recently losing my 5th Gen iPod, I decided to go for a Zune.  Why I chose brown I do not know, it was ugly and I found myself wanting the white.  It is large and clunky compared to the iPod, but it had a nice solid feel, and the outside certainly felt as if it could survive without much scratching.  The screen was fantastic in size and image quality, the "click wheel" felt archaic when compared to the ipod's touch sensitive wheel.  The interface was a nice change, very intuitive, and I certainly loved being able to manipulate the background and color scheme. However, the ipod's software allows me to manipulate what files can transfer to my device and what can not by checking or unchecking a box.  This thing wanted to suck all my music files.  Overall, the iTunes software is much more sophisticated and simple. The software for this device was very unstable, and lacked much when compared to iTune's software.  This software would alter my unprotected mp4 video files so that I could use them, however, it would only do so when the zune was connected.  You, definately need a seperate piece of software, to convert video files, this is so for iTunes as well. At least with iTunes, had I not bought the third party software, I could have purchased a wide variety of video from their site.  Loading the Zune software was a nightmare and a half. This product felt half-baked, I expect, had I never had experience with the iPod i would have been happy, but because of previous experience, I felt, cheated. It has since been returned and I am now not using any portable, video, mp3 player.  I have an eight gig ipod that will hold me in check unitl either Microsoft or Apple come out with a nice handheld unit capable of widescreen video, I doubt very much that I will go after the iPod phone, it is only four gig  Sincerly Rob

<Content>WARNING: DON'T PURCHASE ZUNE IF YOU ARE RUNNING WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER 2003! I made this horrible mistake and soon realized that Microsoft has zero compatibility of the Zune to this OS and you need the software for it to work.  Other than that, it's been working fine, a little bulky and cumbesome but I knew that going into it.  It sounds great and the battery life is pretty good too.

<Content>I took a chance and bought the zune, and I have not been dissapointed. I recommend it to anyone in the market for a 30 GB media player. The user interface is brilliant and I love the customizable backround. My only concern is the battery life, which I think people will always be desiring more. I encourage more people to buy this and hey, maybe we'll run into each other and we can share songs via the wi-fi, which I haven't been able to do yet.

<Title>I guess it's not a disaster
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't want to come across too negative , so I want to mention a few things I like first.  1.  The larger screen size is a little better for video then the iPod's screen size.  Not night-and-day (if you actually compare the two it's not as dramatic as it looks) but there is a little difference in the Zune's favor.  2.  The bigger screen is nice, but the feature I liked a more was being able to customize your background image.  It's something that I'd love to be able to do with my iPod.  2.  The WiFi connectivity between Zunes was a clever idea.  3.  The FM tuner was a nice inclusion.  There are a whole bunch of issues that Microsoft has to address for the Zune's next release though.  1.  The unit's really big, both in size and weight.  Much bigger then the iPod and I'd be willing to bet, one of the largest and heaviest players on the market.  2. Although Apple's just as guilty on the same topic, first-party accessories for the Zune are outrageously expensive.  3.  There's only one 30 gig player capacity.  4.   The Zune won't work for subscription-based mp3 services such as Napster or Rhapsody.  If Microsoft's strategy was to go after companies like Creative (i.e. everyone not using an iPod), then to cut out customers who use these services is crazy.  Since the Zune's coming to the mp3 game so late, I thought Microsoft would have been doing themselves a HUGE favor by making the player as format-accessible as possible to as many potential customers as possible.  5.  While the Wi-Fi support may be a clever idea, it's almost as if Microsoft wasn't sure what they wanted to do with it.  I understand the licensing limitations behind the "three play or three day" rule, but I would have been more impressed if you could sync your Zune or wirelessly purchase music.  6.  This is where the iPod really flat-out smokes the Zune.  The Zune marketplace and it's confusing points-based system can't hold a candle to iTunes.  Zune's marketplace offers no podcasts, no video content, and has about half of the mp3 content that iTunes has (it's somewhere around 2 million vs just short of 4 million, last I checked).  This is probably something that, in time, will grow.  I flagged this as particularly important though, since (again) Microsoft is entering the game so late.  7.  Shock to nobody, but only Windows-based PCs are supported.  Anyone with a Mac will have to try ... any of the other players.  The Zune looks to be one of the only players that decided to support only one OS format.  Overall, the whole unit just feels "dated." As if it's five years late to the party.  I suppose, in terms of a first attempt, I'd rate it as "luke-warm."  If nothing else, it's as solid as it is unimpressive compared to the rest of the market.  The good news for fans is that none of the issues I mentioned aren't able to be corrected on the Zune's next version.  For right now though, I see the Zune as just being far too rough around the edges to justify a purchase.  Even if you didn't (for some reason) want the superior iPod, there are several other mp3 players that'll fit your needs at a better dollar value then the Zune will.

<Title>I love the Zune
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned two Creative Labs MP3 players (most recently the Zen Vision:M) and I can say that the Microsoft Zune is superior in almost every way.    Pros: - Well designed and constructed; solid feel, and has an exterior shell to prevent scratches and damage from drops. - Best looking video screen of any MP3 player, by far. - Sound quality is top notch - Zune Marketplace offers a subscription model, which I like (I add and delete songs all the time, I don't want to pay per song), and it works much better than Napster and similar services - Controls on the device are simple and work well - Built in FM radio - Wireless has potential - Works on Vista x64 without issues  Cons: - Wireless features leave a bit to be desired; I assume this will be corrected with future firmware updates. - Better EQ control would be nice  Overall this is a great MP3 player.  If you want an alternative to iPod, this one is far superior to the offerings from Creative Labs (and the Zune Marketplace software is a LOT better than Napster and similar services).

<Title>Zune
<Date>Sun Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try and avoid the zune vs i-pod debate.  However, it is almost impossible to not compare them.  I did a lot of research on both of them, and to me, it just comes down to preference.  Do your reserach, and you won't be dissapointed either way, so go with what you are comftorable with.    First off, this product is noticeably bigger than the ipod, but it fits nicer in the hand if you ask me.  It is heavier as well.  The screen is brilliant, and the menus are easy to navigate.  The screen and controls flip to widescreen when you view a video.  When listening to music, the album are takes up almost the whole screen, a nice touch.  Wireless is nice, but it is a novelty, you'll almost never use it.    The software works great for me, no problems there, and it syncs really fast.  It automatically updates album art, and you can paste any picture to take place of album art.  Videos and pics go on no problem.  I also use itunes to download free content, and put it onto my zune without problem.  The automatic updates are a nice feature as well.  Haven't tried the zune marketplace yet, but will update this review when I do.    If you have a speaker system with rca inputs, I would highly recommend the A/V bundle pack.    Can't wait to see the continued updates and see if they utilize the wireless better.  Unlike the i-pod (here I go doing what I said I wouldn't) the Zune has the ability to change with the updates.    Overall, great product, and I have not beed dissapointed yet.

<Title>the zune, better than an ipod......?
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>seriously i love just listening to people go back and fourth about mac and pc. il keep this plain and simple. PC is for gaming dont deny, its true. big deal you can run bootcamp on a mac but it will still never boast anywhere near the amount of gaming potential as a pc. Macs are awesome for music, pics, and graphic art. I ordered a zune because im sick of ipods specific formats. i have had 5 ipods now. they all suck the same. There is to much hype about them. I played with my friends zune one day and i simply loved it. no click wheel, but i can live without one. the display was amazing. still small but i wont go blind as fast from this one. the zune has a nicer build, you dont see any marks on it like smudge marks, finger prints, etc. its a bit bigger than the ipod, but it will be on my belt or in my pocket half the time so i dont care. i checked out the software which is almost identical to itunes. For you mac fanatics give the zune a chance instead of bad mouthing it. for you pc guys chill out with the anti mac junk. i own a pc desktop, and a mac laptop. so im neutral in the debate. but all and all im very satisfied and looking foward to my zune.

<Title>I tried them both and I like the Zune
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I'm one of the worst when it comes to decision making and I was torn between the Zune and the iPod. I figured the only thing I could do was to try them both. So, I bought the Zune at my local Wally World because they have a 15 day return policy. I fired it up, loaded my songs, and it worked as advertised. The only issue I had with it was that it didn't seem to charge fully even after leaving it plugged into the USB port overnight. A bit of Googling suggested that some front panel USB ports don't put out enough juice to fully charge. Sure enough, the back port on my PC did the trick. I actually like the Zune software. I don't buy songs through it so I can't comment on that part but for ripping and playing it works well.   After a few days, I saw that the Zune was being sold for $200 at Amazon. I tried to get WM to price match but they wouldn't so I returned it. $50 is $50 right? I was just about ready to order a new one when I hesitated and decided to go for the iPod. The thing that swayed me was the availability of all the iPod accessories - from cases, to docks, to car integration, etc. I worried that I would miss out on those things with the Zune.   The pod is very sleek, no question about it. I loaded up iTunes and began to sync my songs. That's when the fun began. I spent several hours convincing iTunes to get the proper album art for my albums. In many cases, I had to find the album at Amazon and paste the art into iTunes. I guess if the album is not in the iTunes store, iTunes won't find the artwork for it. The Zune software seems to try much harder to find the album and artwork. There's lots of little things I found I didn't like about iTunes. When you click in the search box to find a song or artist, the current selection isn't selected. So, you have to either backspace over the name or select it with a drag - except that it takes about 3 tries to get it to "sense" the drag and highlight the text. It's probably an Apple mannerism but it really bugged me. iTunes seems like a huge resource hog as well. When I was listening to songs through it and doing something else, like surfing in a browser, each time it got to a new song to play, my whole machine would just stop. I couldn't even scroll a page while iTunes was loading up a new song. Scrolling through albums was very choppy as well. My machine isn't a screamer but it's not a dog either.   Next, I tried to load some video onto the pod. Now, for the Zune, I grabbed a PhotoStory .wmv show that I slapped together and loaded it up. It looked OK but when I re-rendered at 320x240, it looked great. iTunes of course, won't even look at a WMV so I used Sony Vegas to render a .mov file. QuickTime played it fine but iTunes kinda choked on it - playing it very choppy. I didn't even bother to sync it to the iPod. I know there are conversion programs out there that will do it and maybe I'm just getting lazy but I just don't want to have to deal with it.   Finally, and this is probably modern design blasphemy, but I really don't like the iPod click wheel. I find it difficult to navigate to an item without going back and forth past it two or three times. Same thing with adjusting the volume with it. I just don't like the way it works. I like buttons that move one increment at a time or scroll by being held down.   So, I'm returning the iPod and getting a Zune. I just like it better. I like being able to customize the background. I like having the radio too. When I go to the gym I mostly listen to my songs but sometimes there is something on TV and my gym has the sound broadcast on FM frequencies. The Zune works great for getting the TV sound and not having to suffer through the Closed Captioning that is 15 seconds behind the picture.  The accessories part doesn't really bother me either. I really don't plan on buying many anyway so I don't think I'll really miss it.   So I'm off to buy the black Zune. Or maybe the white one... Oh crap!

<Content>I owned an iPod for 3 years, but it died recently. I decided to try the Zune, and I love it. The big, beautiful screen makes me want to watch movies on it.  Plus, the Zune Marketplace subscription is worth its weight in gold. I can download as many albums and songs as I like. It's well worth the money.  I'm a huge Zune fan after owning one for about 3 months. No problems with the hardware or software (I'm running it on Vista). Plus, I love how easy it is for Microsoft to upgrade the device via firmware updates. I see lots of exciting new features on the horizon.

Apparently other people are having the same problem as me reading the complaints in the internet. Even if i don't have this connectivity problem, I would still feel like beta tester for the Zune. You're gonna have problems if you reinstall Windows, reinstall Zune, or install the software on another computer. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! I regret buying this crap. Go for the Ipod or Sandisk Sansa.

I was looking forward to watching some video on this player during my downtime.     Alas, I spent 3 hours trying to make the device sync on the first night AND another 3 hours with customer support on day two. The customer support guy said it was all set finally, but five minutes after he hung up the phone the device refused to sync again! Thank goodness I didn't sell my Creative before puchasing this. I'm sticking with Creative until some significant improvements are made to the Zune and the installation software that comes with it.

<Title>So far, so good
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had my Zune for about a week now. So I'm not going to comment on reliablity or durability. Formerly I owned a 30gig Ipod and the quality was so poor that it had to be returned to Apple twice. The third time it broke it was no longer under warranty so it was time to buy something different.   As far as sound quality goes. The Zune sounds really good. It is very clear and crisp. The display is crystal clear, and quite large as well. The Zune software was very easy to use. In fact I had it fully set up with my computers entire library of songs synced to my Zune in less than 30 mins. The user interface is very simple to use everything is well laid out and easy to find. Accessories, like the iPods are a rip off. I guess we can't have everything.   As for the Zune marketplace. I've seen a lot of people complaining that you have to buy the microsoft points in order to purchase  songs from the Zune Marketplace. I tried the marketplace for the first time and it really wasn't that big of deal to have to buy points. It took  only took a minute. You can purchase 400 points for $5.00, 1200 points for $15.00, 2000 points for $25.00 or 4000 points for 50 dollars. The price of an individual song goes for 79 points. The price to download an entire album varied greatly from between 500 to 1200 points which I would assume is based on how popular and/or long an album is. As for the Zune pass. A pass costs either 14.99 for one month or 44.97 for 3 months. This allows you to download as many songs as you want from the Zune marketplace. Which is a really cool feature. The only downside is that the downloads are only yours for as long as you keep the subscription active.  The only thing I can't comment on yet is reliablity. I haven't had my Zune long enough to say. I will update this review if any problems arise. So far I'd have to say that I'm very happy with my Zune.

<Content>Here it is.. Before you read...know that i'm not trying to hate on the Zune. And I did buy a Zune but it was stolen out of my car, then i was given another one as a gift.  Pros- 3inch screen, Radio, WiFi idea  Cons- Cant play any music from Zune when connected to PC, When browsing through Zune you cant look at full song list of an artist(have to look through each separate album, so you cant use shuffle feature on a particular artist...which really kills...), Installation can be confusing(first time i installed it, it synced every song from my PC).  Overall: If you like to listen to music and watch movies on a 3inch screen, get this. If you just want to listen to music and watch a few music videos here and there, get an ipod.

<Title>Great Player, beats out the IPOD
<Date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player.  If you are a person who doesn't pirate it's affordable to get a subscription to zune marketplace which is only second in song selection to Itunes.  It costs 14.99 and you can sync as many and any songs you want. The headphones were impressive, I never would have thought that I could get such rich sound and even adequate bass from some tiny headphones - this is truly excellent. The 3" display is twice as big as IPOD's which makes it much easier to watch movies and tv shows. The screen and the body of the player do not show any fingerprints - a great thing compared to the IPOD. If you pirate music, then the Zune is still a great value, but if you don't pirate music then the zune is the best value because of the subscription feature.

Plug in the player, and drag the tracks (or albums) to the open space on the software window.  Press sync and the download is done.  with instant album information for ripped tracks, control of when and what you want from your collection into your Zune, and the capabilities to handle plenty of audio and video tracks, it will be a player you cannot help but enjoy.  Accessories that come with the player aren't cheap quality, and sound and picture are great quality.

<Content>I think the Zune is a fantastic mp3 player. It feels like it's not going to break every time that I hold it. The headphones that it comes with are good, and it even comes with a little cloth case for it. when I put my pictures onto this, the picture quality is beatuiful.  The radio works great, and its a nice bouns.  I kinda got confused on how to put my music on it, but I got around to it, and it has the album art when you are playing the song, a nice touch.  I like the navagation tool, it's not that spin wheel like the I-pod has, I think the I-pod wheel is to sensitive.  The marketplace is okay, I tryed to look up some artist, but they didn't have any of them, it's new, so hopefully it'll change in time. The screen is very nice and big, great for pictures. And there is no annoying thumb prints and the screen is barely getting scratched. You should buy this. =]  I was going to buy an I-pod, but it was more expensive than this, and I'm happy that I choose a Zune.

<Title>Don't believe what you read.
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was extremely apprehensive when it came time to swipe my card for this thing. Before buying a Zune, I went through MP3 players like toilet paper, my favorite being the ipod of course. I upgraded this time from a newer ipod video that found its way back to apple twice in my first month of ownership, and being bitter I decided to read up on the rival Zune.  First look of the thing, the flashy box threw me off and annoyed me. After looking it over, I was a bit concerned about the body itself, I've had various electronics made of the same plastic, that ended up with the plastic coating flaking off the body. This still worries me a bit.  In terms of menu options and abilities, I was disappointed when I removed it from the box the first time and began to use it for a bit. After I loaded the software, the firmware was upgraded revealing many more features. It still had a small amount of settings and options but it left little to be desired. I could set and customize just about everything I neeeded to.  The size of the screen is a huge benefit over other players, on screen size alone it trumps everything else I've owned. Video look absolutely great on it.  It has the best sound of any media player yet. Maybe it's just the 'cheap' headphones but I was impressed that I didn't need to spend more money on top of the price of the player to buy headphones just to make the sound better than par. Volume adjustment was a plus, a very wide range of volume settings which was very much different than other players with 10 or 15 levels of volume, of which 1 was too loud and 15 was just not loud enough.  Onto battery life. 14 hours it says. I'm also told I would have to encode all the music in 128kbps WMA to make the battery last longer - less processing power decoding = greater battery life. Using 192kbps and up mp3s, I drove with the device sitting on the passenger seat in my car, wireless off and backlight on 1s, and very light skipping of songs, I was able to hit 13 hours even. It makes me wonder what I can get out of the thing with actually using 128kbps WMAs, though the benefits of encoding your whole library to WMA to put on a music player outweigh any battery savings. Comparing this to the Cowon A2, I would hit a max of 12 hours of battery life when rated for 18 hours, which was VERY surprising seeing as I didn't touch the thing once while driving. Ipod video, rated for 20 hours and using the same MP3s encoded the same way, I could only manage 12 conservative hours. Results may vary, but I was surprised this did its rated battery life while other players varied in comparison.  Lastly, I bought it knowing I had to use the Zune software. I wondered why they bothered to write new software for it when they could have made it work with WMP11 and made my life much easier, so I wouldn't have to deal with multiple libraries and all the problems that come with running two similar media players. Then again, comparing it to other similar players, I remembered I had to do the same with the ipod, and in comparison the itunes software it's more intuitive and makes library management graphical and easy. There is the issue that scares most people away from the player, and its video support. There are very quick and easy to use utilities out there to encoding your movies into files of a usable format and size. I don't see this at all as an inconvenience, but it would be nice if the software supported more formats. The Zune software is all about marketing, with a quick and easily accessible online store embedded, and I can see why they decided to use it over WMP11. Then again, the itunes store is the same way. I see a tie here.  Its also very easy to make music files drag-and-droppable without worrying about encoding and DRM and all that, I had no problems whatsoever. I hate the idea of DRM but it didn't impede on any functionality here.  All in all, the Zune greatly surprised me. I would like to think this is the end of my search for a decent media player, but only time will tell. All I know is when I start having issues with this thing, I'll move on most likely and toss the zune behind me as I did the ipod, and find something even better.  Don't like it? Then "go take it back to the store and buy an ipod", as everyone else says.

<Title>IPOD CAN'T COMPARE TO THIS!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everything about the zune is better than the ipod.   First, it is better organized.  I can easily find the song I want to play.  Second,  THE SCREEN IS HUGE  Third, the sound is WAY better than the Ipod's Fourth, the Zune's version of "Itunes" automatically finds all songs, videos, and pictures on your computer and adds them to your library.  You don;t need to searh for them like Itunes...  Fifth - It has radio  sixth - You can wirelessly share music, pictures, and videos between zunes.   seventh - It looks cooler!

<Title>Great media player
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not someone that is hardcore ipod or hardcore microsoft.  I just wanted a good media player that was simple to use and that had plenty of features.  The Zune fits what I wanted perfectly.  There are several pros and cons to the Zune.  The screen is a great size.  The player appears to be a bit wide, but it's not that big of a deal and the weight is just about right.  I wish it came with some of the basic accessories, but it doesn't.  Instead you have to pay big bucks to buy a few extra necessary pieces (AC adapter for example).  You can use the included usb cable to charge it, but at some point you will want the AC adapter.  The battery life is good, but not perfect.  I would like to see some additional battery life out of it.  The controls are easy to use and the menu options are exactly what you need.  The menus aren't cluttered, but they provide just enough navigation.    You should definitely let the device upgrade its firmware when you first plug it in.  There have been several major updates.  The Zune software works just fine.  Overall, the software and device are simple to use, quick, and deliver exactly the content I want without a hassle.  I have been very pleased with my purchase.  I considered waiting for a second release of the Zune, but I decided to give this one a shot.  I'm glad I did.

<Content>I never write product reviews, but i was so happy with this. that i had to.  I just got the Zune a few days ago for my birthday.  I was sick of my 1GB mp3 players, and I wanted something that had more space, as I sure as heck didn't want an ipod! The Zune fit my needs perfectly! it's so awesome! the software is easy to get used to, and you can buy songs if from the marketplace using your live id (or xbox live account) and buy them with your microsoft points.  Other then that, you can even connect to other zune players, and they can send you songs!  -WMV files automatically convert to fit the screen, and the video playback is great! nice big screen.  -all the songs and album's you add have the album cover on it, and it looks nice on the screen.  -you can rip mp3 files with the zune software! they don't have to be wma.  buy it!

<Title>Not a bad piece of hardware
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was given a Zune as a gift, recently. This isn't the first MP3 player I've owned but it's the one with the largest capacity to store data that I've owned. Up front I'll tell you that I'm not a hardcore iPod junkie, nor am I an Apple kiss-butt. I believe in products that work. That being said I can see why people prefer the iPod over the Zune, though I will say that the Zune isn't deserving of some of the bashing I've read on these boards from people who believe it's cool to bash Microsoft products just because they were made by Microsoft.   The Good  1. The Zune has a large, bright LCD screen that can be easily seen in sunlight. Video and picture quality are good.  2. The sound quality is good. The factory earphones are adequate in delivering music though I have a pair of Philips earphones that are far superior and only cost $20. 3. The box includes a data cable you need for syncing. 4. The interface is super easy to use and it is easy to get around in the Zune environment and I've not had any of the music skipping problems with the 1.3 firmware that was automatically downloaded when I synced to my PC. 5. The unit itself feels solid when held, and slightly heavy though not too heavy. 6. The software loaded without a problem on my WinXP SP2 system and I had no problem syncing to the machine when connected to a USB port at the rear of the PC. I had all of my non-ITunes songs added to the player within minutes. 7. The Zune allows you to beam songs, pictures and movies to other Zune players in range.  For a first generation player, it gets the job done nicely and I look forward to seeing what generation 2 will bring.   The Not So Good  1. When I connected the Zune to a 4 port USB hub the PC didn't recognize it was there. I had to connect it to the back of the PC to a USB 2.0 port in order to get it to work. Maybe that's by design, though I'm not sure. Once I did this I had no syncing problems at all. 2. I've never found another Zune in range to share anything. Leaving the wireless on seems to drain the battery faster. I'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy the Zune (if that happens). 3. You can't buy music or movies wirelessly. 4. Although the Zune has wireless it is not compatible with your home or business wireless LAN.  5. You can't browse the internet with the Zune. 6. The Zune software has no problem getting your music onto the device, though the Zune Marketplace is vastly understocked compared to the ITunes music store.  7. The Zune cannot get music purchased through ITunes (this is nitpicky, I know, but would be so nice). There is a way to work around this - you can burn your ITunes songs to a disc and then turn around and rip the disc to the PC as MP3s and then import them to the Zune, which I would rather do than pay money to re-purchase music I've already bought once. 8. There's no way to re-organize files on your Zune once they are uploaded to the device. Say for example I want to throw a couple of pictures into a picture folder so that when I view my pics I don't have to scroll down forever and a day to see them. I have to delete the pic from the Zune through the PC software, add the pic to the folder I want and then sync the PC to the player. The folder had to have been added to the Zune library in order for the update to occur. 9. There's no way to change the orientation of photos or movies when viewed. I would like to be able to flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees to view them in portrait view instead of turning the player on its side to view in landscape mode. One reason why this is important is when I set one of my pics as my Zune background, I'd like to be able to see just how much of the pic will be cut off since the Zune doesn't resize the pic to fit. Oh yeah, that's another thing... 10. Pics used for the Zune background don't have an option to be re-sized to fit the screen.  What I Would Like to See Change on the Zune (more for Microsoft than anyone else)  1. Options for re-sizing pics to fit the Zune screen 2. Options for changing the orientation of pics and movies 3. The ability to organize my files in the Zune without having to delete the file and re-sync. I'd like to be able to do this from the player and from the software both. 4. Since I have to use the USB port on the back of my PC a longer sync cable would be nice. 5. Put the built-in wireless to good use. Slap in compact Internet Explorer and allow viewing of web pages and email! You don't need a keyboard to view read-only content like weather, news and sports and it would really add to the player's value 6. Allow the Zune to be able to buy music, pics and video without having to connect to the PC. Again, make use of the wireless capability of the Zune. 7. Do something about the Zune Marketplace - it just needs an overhaul. It needs additional music, movies and a definite bump in the cool factor.  8. Make it easier to customize the outside of the Zune. You did this with additional and customizeable faceplates for the XBox 360 - do the same for this player. If you hadn't noticed - individuality is in and is here to stay.

<Title>re: Absolutely terrible
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To celebrate the anniversary of our company, we thought we'd give all employees a gift.  Our Apple phobic IT guys nixed the Ipod as a choice, despite the CEO and CTO both owning and recommending them, so we went with the Zune.  Of the 50 we bought, 16 had to be exchanged for quality issues.  We've had issues with the drivers on the Vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the XP machines.  Several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones. We can't use them as data drives so they're not as useful as we'd like.  Finally, store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why DRM is applied to files if you share them.  Which reminds me, the wireless is half baked; too slow and we've had plenty of hang ups while trying to share. The end of the story is that the CEO is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle.  He has already said in no uncertain terms that when Apple ships a video ipod, the company will give those to make up for the Zune experience.

<Title>Alternate pick to Ipod
<Date>Sat Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money.

<Content>I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune.

<Title>Please don't Buy a Zune
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.

<Date>Tue Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am using my second zune, and is awesome. The first one got broken almost the day after I received it. Amazon did a good job replacing the item as quickly as possible.  Zen as a media player is great, especially the user interface...makes it so easy to navigate..the radio feature is also great..I usually turn it on and go to sleep...I guess the navigation is better than that of ipod..I am not a big ipod fan myself but navigation is zune is far easier...click wheel would make things more easier but i guess thats patented so microsoft cannot copy that from ipod...The screen is large but they should have had higher resolution..that would be great...but even with this resolution videos and pictures are of good quality  about the zune software...it has drawbacks but synchronizing songs is not that difficult..but not that great either...and I rather buy CDs than music online so I don't care whether they have thousand songs or a zillion songs..I just want their online music catalog to be updated so that I can get my media library tuned in for zune..I am not a big fan of managing music by itunes or media player or zune, softwares like foobar or mediamonkey can make life a lot easier to manage library..esp. when you have a massive one like me (60gb)...with constant updates zune software will get better  About the wireless feature, I can't find a soul around who has zune..so I don't really care about that...I have no comments on that  Zune has equalizer and have five or six different settings, which is a plus factor..it is user friendly since it is customizable to some extent   About the battery, I read in many reviews that it has poor battery, well with the new version of firewall this problem has been solved  Earphones of zune sucks...they didn't even fit my ear..I am using sony's earphone and bose headphones ...although zune's earphones looks cool and has metal so that you can stick the two earphones together....i have a question if microsoft people were aware that electricity and magnet can produce electromagnetic field whose fore can be harmful to the body...and esp. to a sensative part like brain...Until and unless I am not confirmed that this doesn't effect the brain..I AM NOT USING THEM  I had done my homework properly, my biggest competitive was zen vision M (reviews of this were far better than zune and even ipod, cnet even gave zen some title, product of the year or something) but I took risk by trusting microsoft (which is not a good bet), so far it has been working up to the expectation..sad part I have around .4 gb left     cheers

<Title>Zune a little tune with me
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Update:  My Zune is continuing to be a source of musical and video joy.  No complaints so far and I've loaded over 125 full albums to try out from my 14-day Zune Marketplace trial. My Zune came in handy when I was called for jury duty and put in the jury pool for the afternoon. Several sitting near me said they wished they had a Zune too as they watched videos with me and very patiently looked at the pictures of my children and grandchildren for the hours we were contained in the jury pool.  Still no complaints, only complete enjoyment.  [From April, 2007] I have ony had my Zune for a few weeks now, but I am thoroughly enjoying all of the features I've tried so far.  I still love my iPod, but after a freak accident with an open water bottle in my bag, the backlight on my iPod went out and could not be replaced without spending almost the equivalent of a new one. So I still listen to the music on my wonderful iPod, but the pictures have gone dark.    Back to the Zune. The instructions were simple enough. I went to the Zune site, inserted the codes that came with my device, then plugged the Zune into my laptop and off we went. I quickly downloaded tons of new albums then easily synchronized to my Zune and charged at the same time.  I haven't experienced any of the problems referenced by some of the other reviewers and my laptop works from Vista. I haven't listened or played with it 24-7, but after listening to several albums -- Dreamgirls, BeBe Winans, Chris Botti, Alison Krauss, Michael Hoppe, Stevie Wonder, and watched the preloaded videos and loaded many photos, the battery is holding a charge, but maybe a little less so than my iPod.  The Zune's controls are more easily manipulated than my iPod with the menu to locate music, videos, pictures, radio, community and settings. The videos and pictures are brilliant on this nice size screen. I have done a sound comparison, and as far as I can tell, there's nothing lacking in that department either.  I was excited about the added bonus of a radio and have used this feature a lot.  I have not used the tune sharing or community mode that allows you to pass songs back and forth. My son owns a Zune as well, so we will play with that feature soon and update this review.    So far I am extremely pleased with this cool present from my wonderful husband. I plan on using my iPod for all the older music I've collected over the years and switch back and forth between the two for now -- unless I feel benevolent and make it a gift to someone in the future.    - Victoria Austin

<Content>I bought this to show my kids that MS was better than Apple.  The kids had the last laugh. All sorts of problems. Returned the first one because it would not connect. The second one died in the middle of updating the software and never connected again. I returned the second one, and got an iPod, and ate some crow.  If it it had worked there are some features that I did not know about before I bought it that would have stopped me.  1. You can't use it as an external hard drive. Why is that? One of the reasons I wanted such a device was to bring files home from work.  2. While the second one was working, I tried sharing a file - it was slow and unreliable.  3. The MS music store has a poor selection, and you can't use other stores with it.  Also, I had hoped that Zune file would play else where - no dice.

<Title>Zune Rules
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first time I have ever written a review.  Zune is different than an Ipod.  I think it is better.  I have owned Ipods for many years, and finally I became tired of always needing a case, and scratches were a continuing problem.  Itunes may be a little better program than the Zune software.  But once you figure it out it is great.  The screen size is great.  The custimizing features are great, the controlls are more proficient than the Ipod (especially while running, or driving).  I can not count the times I have been trying to choose a song on the ipod and I keep skipping the track I want because the click wheel sucks.  Zune will only get better as Microsoft works the bugs out.

<Content>I've had the Zune since late last year and have been enjoying it.  The marketplace subscription is really nice as you can download all the music you want for only 15 bucks.  Transfering video is pretty easy as you can download a converter online for free.  Regular Zune firmware updates are coming down the pipeline that will add even more features.  I've already done the wireless music sharing a few times with some local people that have picked up the Zune.  Overall it's a great digital media player and one that I recommend over the IPOD based on the subscription marketplace service and the XBOX 360 integration that's in place and the features that are to come.  Don't listen to the IPOD lovers, this is a very nice device.

<Content>Let's face it, we live in an ipod world. Technically the Zune is superior to the 30GB ipod in every way. Unfortunatly the Zune software and marketplace leave alot to be desired. The firmware upgrades for the device are not comming fast enough. Good luck trying to find accessories readily available. I use my Zune every day and love it's performance, but come on Microsoft, unlock this beast's potential already. Until there is adaequate support, I would recommend to anyone looking for an MP3 player to buy a Zen.

<Title>The Best Player So Far
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is my 5th player.  My first was a D-Link several years ago.  The Zune is the best one yet, as one should expect.  The playback quality for music is excellent.  The video resolution is acceptable even when stretched to play on my 65" TV.  My ONLY complaint is about the Zune software, not the player.  Like iTunes, the Zune software is annoying, irritating, and does not let me have enough control, but it is a relatively small price to pay to use a player the quality of the Zune.  Also, the accessory kits were very useful.

<Title>Lived Up to All My Expectations
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Up front, I want to say that I have owned a number of MP3 players and have always avoided the iPod products for 3  reasons. The quality of the downloads from Itunes is not what it could be. ITunes is not offered as a subscription service. You can't download and install iTunes software with out also installing Quick Time. If you aren't pretty good technically with your PC, Quick Time makes a lot of changes to your PC with out asking permission.  With Microsoft's Zune, you also have to download software, but that's all you download.   As to the Zune unit itself, It performs exactly as advertised. 30GB of storage that should prove more than adequate for all but the most rampant audiophiles. Beautiful widescreen LCD panel. Straightforward and easy to use. Truly incredible sound. Synchronizes beautifully with your PC INCLUDING Windows Vista. Excellent battery life. The radio works exceedingly well.  To be completely upfront, I do not use the included headphones. I have a set of Shure E3C's that I have used with every MP3 player I have ever owned and I never use the included headphones of any MP3 player and I recommend that you do the same.  I expect Microsoft to both expand this product line and to update this unit with additional features.

<Title>Exactly what I expected
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a hard time deciding between a 30 Gig Ipod or a Zune.  I picked a Zune because I liked the FM radio and wireless connectivity, and I usually like to be different because everybody and their brother has an ipod.  But I really do not have any problems with this product, it is a great MP3/radio/picture/video player.  The only complaints I have is the lack of downloadable videos on the Zune Marketplace, and the lack of accessories for the Zune when compared to the Ipod.  But otherwise, it is a fantastic unit well worth your money.

I have photos on my player, all my music on one device. I think we'll all be digital eventually. Zune is definitely awesome. Much better than any other mp3 product.

<Title>Zune for a better world
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is now my third MP3 player.  I have enjoyed the features of all of them.  I know the big debate is Ipod or anything else. I am not rating anything but this product but will make comparisons to other products. This is quite a find for a new product.  I appreciate not having the click wheel that my Ipod has and I find the features to search through the menus a plus.  The addition of the FM receiver is a plus.  I was surprised by how much I use it.  It does pick stations fairly well.  I have not had any problems with using it.  The sound is amazingly good.  I purchased the Zune pack with the ear phones that are excellent, I would recommend getting that along with the Zune.  The video features are excellent.  They load fairly quickly for me.  I like features of sharing pictures and songs, I have only a few people to share with, but it is a nice feature and works. Grab on the Zune, my friends you will not be sorry.

<Title>BETTER THAN IPOD
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When it comes to my 30gb Zune, i have to say that im satisfied with it. From the quality of the videos, to the sound of the music. The videos are crystal clear, the sound is loud and crisp. The pictures are also crisp and clear. I think it's better than the IPOD because the menu has a much more, better display to it. It's not just the white background with the blue scroll bar. On the IPOD, if you slightly just press the scroll wheel by accident, not even with your hand, it'll lower the volume or fast forward the song when you don't intend to. The Zune doesn't have that problem. You just hold down the button and the songs scroll down slow at first, then fast showing the 1st letter of the song on the side as it scrolls. The only thing that i don't like about the Zune is the battery life. They say it's supposed to last 13 hours. But for me it only lasts about 4 hours, and thats only if you just listen to the songs without messing around with it. Watching videos will dramatically decrease the battery even more than just listening to music. I recommend buying a wall adapter for it. Besides that, i'm very happy with my Zune.

The Zune music service is great, loading music is fast, and video playback is stellar. Overall in my opinion an excellent product.

<Title>Simply incredible.
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned 3 iPods and several other MP3 players.   I was skeptical about the Zune but bought one when I gave my last iPod to my wife.   It has more features, better control panel and you don't have to worry about the stupid click wheel every time you put it in your pocket.  I love it.  I'm getting my wife one to get rid of the stupid iPod screwups with having to restore your library every 2 seconds and having issues with 2 or more mp3 players at once.   I recommend this to everyone when I have the chance.  I can't wait till the next gen.  I doubt very much that any bad ratings on this were actually from owners of the equipment.  More like ipod owners or lovers.  Everyone that I know who has one, loves it especially after using mine when they have an ipod.

<Content>The only problem I have with the mp3 player is that there are no  instructions what so ever. You are on your own trying to figure out how to download music or anything else on to the zune. As far as deleting their preloaded music and videos I'm still trying to figure it out, The sounds are great and it works great once you figure out how to operate it. I guess young kids would beable to figure it real quick but for us older folks its a new education. Some of you are wondering whats an old goat  buying a youngsters toy. Well I travel alot and like to listen to music and hear audio books when I'm waiting in the air and airports.

<Title>Is Zune for You?
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hesitant to buy the Zune. I had researched mp3 players for weeks, knowing I wanted anything but ipod, and was convinced a portable media player was the way to go as the Cowon A2 and Archos 604 had everything I could possibly want feature wise. So why did I end up getting a Zune which is no comparison to these players? Well the answer is: cost, size, weight, accessories you can touch and see because they're in tons of stores, and finally because I read some individuals successfully changed the hard drive to a 80+gb (a feature/size you can only find in the Archos 504 portable media player).   Yes this is a mp3 player and not a portable media player, I know. I might still one day get a Cowon or Archos portable media player, but Zune is a great substitute or possibly, distraction until then. My point is despite the lack of features, this mp3 player has a lot of potential- especially if you replace the 30gb hard drive for an 80gb.  Cons:  - you can only put music via the Windows Media Player like software Zune provides - the Zune marketplace or itune-like store (if you buy music online) is nowhere near its competitior - there is some serious limitations in allowed filetypes for videos (wmv,mp4) - the in the box accessories are pretty scarce as you only get the cloth pouch that is pretty useless except as a screen wiper, usb cord, cdrom with the mandatory software, earbuds, and quick instructions which you don't really need. I wish they included the home/wall/travel/(whatever name you wish to give it) ac adaptor, that would be nice. - ipod still has more accessories, better marketing, and player design customizablity (the player design itself, not the programing, I mean). - doesn't include the ability to read txt docs like the ipod. - no ability for a high capacity version unless you change out the drive yourself  pros: - although the other colors are currently limited to pink and brown (I'm excluding black and white), there already is more color choice than the ipod video which only comes in black and white. I also have read there currently is a limited edition orange Zune, Halo (as in the game) Zune, and soon to be released watermelon (red with green side tint) Zune.  - menu response and playback are great. - the landscape view of pictures and videos make viewing long video clips a lot more enjoyable. - 3" screen = less eye strain, although not as nice as a 4"+ portable media player would be. - simple and clean interface - tactile buttons for those who aren't into the ipod touchpad - album art is huge in a great way. The music playing interface looks much nicer in terms of design and layout than other mp3 player music playback screens. - has a radio, a very nice feature for when you're sick of your music (yeah right!) - ability to change your background to whatever image you want adds that bit of customizability that adds that special touch - it also has wifi ability to send pictures and music to another Zune (although you can only keep the song for 3 playbacks- the potential to grow is there though).  Overall, the Zune is still very young by comparison to its Apple competitor. For those who love the term ipod killer, this is no ipod killer. Ipod has been around longer and has much better marketing techniques (accessories, ads, commercials, online music store, etc.) Zune might one day be up to equally fight ipod for most popular mp3 player, but until then, Zune will just be known as the beautiful mp3 player with great playback and design on its way to fulfill its destiny.

<Content>I really like my Zune. There are lots of Apple fans who love to hate it, but frankly it does what it's asked to and it doesn't have any hidden defects. It's a solid product. The only complaint I have is the software. I'd much rather be able to drag-and-drop onto the player via windows than have some bloated 'management' software re-managing the music collection that's already managed the way I want it. Other than that, I love it.

<Date>Tue May 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Microsoft puts out its fighter again the popular Apple iPod. No contest. Unfortunally for Zune, the iPod wins. The only real thing the Zune has to keep it alive is a bigger screen, song sharing, and different colors besides black and white. None of these are really going to make a difference. And I agree when people say Microsoft made things irritating by using the points system to buy songs instead of 99 or 79 cent songs. Zune is nice if you are a hardcore fan of Microsoft and hate Apple. I bought a Zune because I wanted to be different than the whole iPod crowd but now I see why there is an iPod crowd. It is better. Sorry Microsoft, its a no go for this one.

<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>[Quick update: After 7-months of throwing a ton of music and video on the Zune, it still runs like a champ. Unlike an ipod that tends to slow down to user input (e.g. moving from song to song or generally navigating content), the Zune has shown no signs of this. I am assuming it is handling disk storage (fragmentation) better somehow. Also, I have gone running with it many times and it has yet to lockup (unlike every ipod I'vd owned). Downside: Microsoft hasn't really done anything interesting with their desktop software or the Zune's itself in 7-months. I still rip CDs using iTunes because it is far superior in controlling format.]  I have read very mixed reviews on the Zune (not just here on Amazon). Read enough and one can put the reviews into two categories: those folks that hate Microsoft regardless of the product and those who actually give unbiased reviews. Oh, and it's  beyond me why people are saying the wireless is a negative. It's there. If you use it, cool. If not, what's wrong with it? The Zune's limited (for now) wireless capability does not belong in a comparison with an iPod. And to talk about Zune being proprietary as if the iPod isn't (aside from no OSX version of software yet) is complete nonsense. They both are in certain ways, but not in ways making them unusable.  I bought a Zune and so far am extremely happy with it. I am not going to compare it to an iPod other than in two ways: the screen and the user interface. Both, in my opinion, are FAR superior to the iPod.  Now, keep in mind the Zune and it's companion software are less than a year old. There is much room for improvement and I imagine Mr. Softee is working on it.  Positives: + Great screen + Great user interface and navigation + Excellent battery life + Excellent exterior + Software upgradeable meaning as they add functionality, the firmware can be upgraded to be included in older models. + FM radio is great + Excellent playback quality both audio and video + Zune software automatically converts your songs to Zune format (also a negative see below) + Microsoft is listening to user feedback - very transparent blog out there + No locking up or freezing when exercising + Very fast movement from track to track, fast forward and rewind. Very responsive. + So far seems pretty rugged. I dropped a few feet while a video was playing, picked it up and it hadn't skipped a bit. This would have sent an iPod into a coma. Oh, and no scratches. + Since 'everyone' has an iPod, this is actually an attention-getter. Everyone wants to check it out.  Negatives: - Only available in 30GB - Zune software for Windows is definitely v1 - Zune software not available for Mac or Linux - No podcasts, video, audio books available in Zune marketplace (yet) - For video: synchronizing your MP4s or other media that isn't in the correct WMV format is VERY slow. It's also easy to tweak a setting that makes it very slow if you have in correct format, but the setting forces conversion: should warn the user. - Can't use as a hard drive (would be nice to throw files on it besides media) - Won't play older DRM versions (huh?) This is fixable though and hopefully Microsoft is listening to this one. - Relatively immature market for add-on products, but this is quickly improving.  Undecided: ~ $15/month subscription plan: all you can download  Bottom line: For $200, this is a great media player.

<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first Zune I got messed up after a few days...but amazon sent me a new one.  The large screen looks great, but it sucks the battery like no one's business. The syncing is SO slow for video. On the upside, it takes wmv's, do you don't have to pay a ton for an obscure converter for some crazy file-type.   So, here's the breakdown:  Pros: Radio tuner (!!) Nice settings - you can set a picture as your background. Also, it has country settings for the Radio Tuner, so it can work in other countries besides the USA. Huge screen, GREAT picture (For some of us, it's a pro that it is not an iPod) Non-scratchable case Feels very durable Wifi is neat (but rarely useful.)  Cons: Lower battery life (about 3-4hrs of video if wifi is off) No wall charger included Slow syncing for video Software is a bit clunky (but so is apple's)  4/5 stars - It has some things I don't like, but overall, I'm happy with it. And, as much as I will be flamed for it, I just did not want anything apple-related. (Plus they were more expensive)

<Title>I love it
<Date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start off by saying that the Zune will do everything an iPod will do and more. I'm pretty pleased with mine. There are a few technical issues about it that concern me a little, though.  Every once in a while, it decides to simply turn off while playing music, completely on its own. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take a minute or so before it would turn back on again. I bought a refurbished model, so I don't know if that is the cause.  I'm not a fan of the software that comes with it. I shouldn't have been surprised, but they give you an entire media player. The odd thing, though, is that it is just the newest version of Windows Media Player, except that it is colored differently and is designed to sync with a Zune only. It seems very unnecessary.  I shouldn't skip over the good points though. It has decent radio signal for an mp3 player (still don't know why they won't put one in an iPod), a good quality screen, and all of the other basic functions of an iPod. The only function it doesn't have that I wish it did was the ability to delete songs from the Zune itself (you have to sync it and delete it through the program).   Mine got beat up pretty quick though. You may want to invest in a case!

<Content>Can't get the unit to accept non-encrypted books on CD, older music CDs, nor can I watch unencrypted DVD titles. Seems a pity with that beautiful screen that you can't take it on travel and watch a few movies.  I alsmot never listen to music, but I do listen to books and lectures, and watch movies. Also, getting the files on this thing is a nightmare. Users can't just connect it and move the files over into their own folders.  The Zune is made for one thing. Buying and playing downloadable music. I'd reckon there should be a market for adults who want to walk and listen to music or lectures, or travel and watch a movie or two.  Just another example of Gate's way or the highway.

<Title>No tune with Zune
<Date>Sat Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a pink Zune for my daughter.  She was very excited the day it arrived and immediately unpackaged it and started to install the software.  Three days and two support calls later, the Zune software was loaded.  I had to disconnect my computer from the internet to successfully load the software.  The Zune 1.3 Firmware was never able to load. Very challenging. We eventually got the Zune working and loaded about 1300 tunes from her library.  That was easy.  The device worked for about a day after, when the display went black and would not restart.  Another call to Zune support and after 15 minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong, I came to the conclusion that there were too many issues with the product and decide to return it for a refund.  I would not recommend this product.

I thought this would be cool, especially the brown version (man it's expensive but if I get lucky there's one in a prize machine @ the mall) :) hard to tell, though, because it seems like people either get a superb quality one or a paperweight...this is, I think, what I need in a MP3: . easiness to use . at least 1GB capacity . ability to download CDs . i think it at least should not be UGLY . budget price (which this so does NOT HAVE, but i could get lucky with the prize machine:) . good if it has radio, but I don't need it somebody please help. By the way I am not biased towards any software companys...and the stars don't count cuz I don't even HAVE it.

<Title>Gave it shot, and am pleased after a week trial...
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm an Asian geek who loves electronics, so I had to try this thing out. Like many, I also own an iPod... but mine is a 40GB 4th gen WITHOUT video.  I've been craving a video and music player for a long time...  So after a few weeks of research, I finally saw that Best Buy had the Zune on sale for $199 ($50 less than a 30GB 5th gen iPod).  "Let's give it a shot" I thought, and with a total of $25 in Best Buy coupons, I went for it.  I figured for $175 before taxes, trying out the Zune was a no-brainer.  And after one week, I really like it.  Granted, I can't say that I've actually done a true Zune/iPod "taste test" because I don't have a video iPod with which to compare the Zune.  But I really love the larger screen (despite having to turn it sideways).    I'm not a big fan of how easily it is to scuff or scratch the metal backing and the plastic face of my iPod.  Even if placed in a case or silicone jacket (I've tried both) the darn thing still gets scuffed up because even the soft protective case can scuff it up up. So with the Zune, I'm glad the case is fairly scuff-and-scratch-free (I went on eBay to get a dirt-cheap scratch-proof cover for the scratchable screen).  I dig the Zune's buttons.  After owning an iPod for over 3 years, I was so used to a scrolling touchwheel that I initially didn't like the Zune buttons.  But with the Zune there's less overshooting selections... and if you hold the circular button down, your selection scrolls faster and without that arthritis-inducing spinning of your thumb!  With the lovely program DVDFab, I can convert DVDs to mp4s to watch on my new Zune! I love it!   In terms of sound quality, the Zune headphones sound much better than the iPod headphones.  Granted, I have Bose Triport headphones that I use with both, but if you're not a geek who spends over $100 on a better set of headphones than what comes with your player, then the spiffy Zune earbuds will please you more than the iPod tinny whites.  Do I still love my iPod?  Yes.  Do I love my new Zune?  Yes.  Am I nerd for owning 2 music players?  No.  I'm actually a nerd that owns 3 music players (since I also have an iPod Shuffle for when I exercise/run).  But when it comes to watching videos on a portable player that I take to work, I think the Zune has been a splendid choice.  I had no problems with loading the software. I had read previously that it takes a long time for the program and music on your computer to sync.  So just be patient with your Microsoft software.  In hindsight, I don't feel that it took much longer for the Zune to load and sync than it took the iPod and iTunes to load and sync.  Most of the complaints of the Zune software were made in November of 2006 with the initial firmware and Zune software versions.  Microsoft released better firmware and updates since then.  If you are thinking about getting a Zune, I say go for it!  I've had a great time with it so far.  If you like a really slick-looking player that you want to look shiny and scuff-free for a few days, then get an iPod --  but be ready to be bummed about your scuffed up player in a few days (or weeks if you're really careful).  I love the nigh-scuff-free Zune. I love my old video-less 4th gen iPod, too, but I think love my Zune more.  (At least until something better comes along and I buy that too.)  (I'm an addict -- I know.)  By the way, I only gave the Zune 4 stars -- but I'd probably give the same to a 5th gen iPod, too.  The Zune needs more work definitely, but it's fairly good-looking... the interface and menus are more artsy-looking and you can change the backgrounds to personalize it, and the video screen is bigger.  Plus, I like listening to the radio sometimes, so this player is all right with me.

<Content>Well after talking myself away from healthy skepticism relative a microsoft product - I have to admit I am quite pleased so far. Setup was easy if not a little slow (no progress bars to reassure something is still happening during long pauses in the initial configuration) and loading, syncing and maintaining this thing has been a breeze. Pleasantly surprised is a new microsoft feeling for me!

<Title>The only choice for high quality subscription music!
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Yes iTunes is a great software interface, and the iPod is sleeker/smaller, but for me it is all about the music.  I listen to tons of music and don't want to pay $1 per song when I can download unlimited tracks (and stream them through my XBOX 360 to my home stereo...playlists and all) for only $15/month.  I am now discovering new bands that I would have never plopped down $15/CD for, but when it doesn't cost any more, why not check them out...instantly?  If not for the Zune, I would have never heard what are now some of my favorite bands.  The Zune marketplace had some bugs in the beginning, but after some software updates, the service is now A+.  I love it...I haven't listened to my iPod in months.

<Title>Zune Review
<Date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned both an Ipod (2 years) and the Zune (1 year), and in my own opinion the Zune wins hands down.  The screen is bright, and is much better than the ipod.  I haven't had any problems with the software, it seems to work just as good as itunes.  The only downside to the Zune is that it only comes in 30 gig.  As far as durability goes...I have had a acrylic case on it since I bought it, I'm currently deployed to Iraq, and it has stood up to the harshest conditions, as I take it everywhere with me.

<Content>Great product, I love the Zune...It's a great mp3 player, however i ordered early shipping which did not work out, in fact i took longer than 7 days to receive my zune which was supposed to be in 3-5 day delivery. Amazon did offer to repay for the shipping charges, but i was still disapointed. But if you're reading this review to decide if you want to buy the Zune...Go for it. I definately like it better than the IPOD and its compatible with much more file types(WMA MPEG AVI, ECT

<Title>Zune in Iraq
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, I first started off with a 30g iPod. I bought it before I came to Iraq. When I got here I sold it for a Zune someone was selling. (He couldn't download the update out here, so it was useless to him).  First, I loved the idea of finally being different than everyone else. Everyone and their mother has an iPod now.   The first big plus to the Zune is the ability to apply a wallpaper. I love to customize things, so this appealed to me a lot.  Yes, it bigger, and blocker, but for someone like me (especially since I'm in the dessert) I want the durability. Its tough. If you like to play hard, this is the MP3 Player for you.   When watching Videos, its give you a "wide screen" affect by watching it sideways.   As for the Software. It was a pain for me to set up because the update had to be downloaded over a internet cafe, so yeah. Other than that, its set up like Windows Media Player. Very user friendly, very simple. Transfers are quick when syncing up too.  My overall opinion is: If you want to be different and try something new, go for the Zune. It did great for a 1st generation.

<Content>Ladies and Gentlemen Im pleased to announce that we have a new winner in the mp3 market and its the "Zune" from Microsoft. The device is so easy to use and the Zune software is great also. The only downside I have is that the battery lasts only 5 to 6 hours at the most. On the upside though the big screen is great when watching vids and I luv the feel of it, I luv holdin it in my hand. I would definitely give it my thumbs up.

<Title>I love the Zune...it's great!
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I was in the position of buying a new mp3 player, I had limited my choices down to the iPod video or Zune mp3 players.  A friend of mine, who is a mp3 specialist at Best Buy (who had already had an iPod video) strongly suggested that I get the Zune.  They knew nothing much about it but they supported it because it was basically the new thing on the block and cooler...but also because it had started being received better than the iPod, sparking interest in it versus the "household" iPod.  I must say this is true.  I have no real complaints about the Zune.  The only downfall to it (for me) is that unlike the iPod, there are no games on it.  However, the Zune can make up for that in other areas...such as the fact that it has FM radio  and a wireless shraing network (although mine has never really been of use, and I've heard this from others).  Also, you can personalize the menu with your own pictures or graphics.  Finally, the Zune has a bigger screen than the iPod video's and you turn it sideways to view videos...that's so cool!  I've had my Zune for awhile now, so I can't think of all the pros...and there are no cons for me.  Some users are so technical and too critical with the features of the Zune, being so concerned with such things as the "skip-time" between songs.  All of that is irrelevant!  An mp3 is a big advancement from "back in the day" when all people had were records!  Then they had to "shuffle" their own music by shuffling through all their records.  Anyways, a Zune is a great mp3 player.  I highly suggest it.  Buy a Zune!  Forget iPods!  P.S. I also bought my Zune to support Microsoft...some perspective customers may want to do the same.  :)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

<Title>A GREAT DEVICE!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ZUNE!!! yes... This device from microsoft is very excellent(Although they dont let you transfer protected files). I have both Video Ipod(30 gb) and Zune and compared them.. I didn't have any problems especially when installing the softwares and updating the firmwares.. I don't even know why people are having problems with those things... The screen is so bright and colorful, THE SOUND is great, yah!, Better than ipod... Im using a BOSE earphones and used them in both devices and i have to say that it sound better when i used it in my ZUNE device!! i have alot of friends who bought this device also, and im already VERY familiar with the ZUNE to ZUNE sharing, i always send them the new DLs i got especially pictures... IN CONCLUSION, this device is so advanced that if ur not very familiar with computers, it would make u work very hard. Also, if u have an old computer, don't expect that the software would work very FAST!!!! Furthermore, if ur new to computers or have less expertise with them, DONT BLAME the software or manufacturers that THEY STINK!!! because u yourself might be the one with the problem.... I LOVE this device and would continue to love it... GO ZUNE!!!!!

<Content>The Zune is a very nice unit. Only had it about a month but left it overnite to charge.  By morning it developed an internal cracked screen. Apparently from a overheated internal battery. I found this out by checking forums on the net since I thought it could have been dropped. Zune support will not tell you it overheated, only that its not covered for repair. Microsoft/Zune will not replace or repair the unit. Next time you watch TV, try imaging watching it with cracks running thru it, its not pleasant.  Carmen  Baldwinsville

<Title>Good, but not great.
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Zune's OS is really a version of Windows CE and the user interface reminds me of Media Center a little bit, which is OK, but the news of a possible linux version for the Zune is something to look forward to.  Pros: -Cheaper Cheaper than a 5.5 iPod.  It's perfect for someone who simply wants to hold a whole lot of mp3's without worrying too much about looks or paying too much.  Amazon's price is a great bargain. -FM Tuner I still listen to my local stations, and the best part is that the song title and artist shows up, so I can find out the name of a new song download it later on. -Wallpaper/Pictures The Zune software organizes the files into folders exactly as I have it in My Documents.  Much easier to find and replace the wallpapers. -Playlist Easier to stay organized and create customized lists than an 5.5 iPod, even when not connected to the computer. -Sound Definitely louder than video iPods.  At least for me. -Battery Charging Surprisingly quick the first time around.  Didn't take the three hours I thought it would. -File formats Does convert mp4 into wmv automatically for videos.  Cons: -Buttons Not a true click wheel as in an iPod.  Nothing is marked except Play/Pause and Back buttons.  Takes a little getting used to. -Software Installation Several installation problems including multiple Zunes showing up under Device Manager, not detecting the Zune the first time, and not being able to delete empty playlists from the device.  The software was probably the most frustrating part of the experience.  But it uses less memory when running on my computer than iTunes, and I didn't have any problems upgrading the firmware once I got it working. -Headphones The packaged ones are uncomfortable and sound terrible.  Bought a pair of Koss instead.  Haven't tried the A/V out or wireless sharing features yet.  Has potential to be a strong standalone mp3 player, for the price, without the need for all the bells and whistles like xbox connectivity or wireless sharing.  But it would be great to have apps like an ebook reader or internet browser for use with wifi networks.

<Title>A Worthy iPod Competitor
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the quest for an mp3 player that is compatible with my needs and listening style, I've owned a number of them over the years. I started with the now-defunct Rio, multiple iRiver models, and two different generations of iPods (2nd and 5th). Now I've added a 30gb black Zune to that list. Clearly each model that I've owned has had it's own share of positives and negatives. The most user friendly up until this point have easily been the iPod models, however the Zune has stepped up to compete as a viable challenger to the iPod supremacy despite it being only a first generation Microsoft offering.    The Zune has a lot going for it, however most of the big positives have already been pioneered by the iPod - user friendliness, an online marketplace, an array of accessories, sizable storage capacity, and a vibrant color display being good examples. Seeing as how they are now almost expected by all mp3 player users, it was wise of Microsoft to step up and provide them. Some may say that the Zune is "ripping off" the iPod, but it's worth considering that most of these things are now staples of the industry. If a company were to not provide them, I imagine that the player wouldn't be received well.    However, the Zune also expands into a few new areas with the addition of Wi-Fi, a widescreen display, and some aspects of customizability. The widescreen display seems huge in comparison to the iPod's and the image quality doesn't suffer in the slightest. The colors are vibrant, the pictures are sharp, and videos are smooth. While I've never been much of a video-watcher on my mp3 player, it's nice to know that the capability is there. Currently, the Wi-Fi is virtually useless unless you have a friend with a Zune. I don't, so I've been unable to test the wireless capabilities. As most reviewers have noted, I'm hoping that Microsoft will expand the Wi-Fi capabilities in the future, perhaps to include Zune marketplace access direct from the Zune itself, or perhaps a rudimentary web browser.    The Zune's customizability was a considerable selling point with me. I like the fact that you're not forced into using a bland user interface (like the iPod). Backgrounds can be changed and the interface itself is much more glamorous and is generally practical. There are some hiccups, such as the inconvenient placement of the EQ settings, but for the most part it's a piece of cake to find what I want.    Meanwhile, the Zune architecture is much more conducive to user-modification. While the iPod is practically a hermetically-sealed brick, the Zune can be easily opened and most of the internal components are modular. With a mild to moderate investment, it's possible to expand the Zune capacity to 60, 80, 100, or even 120 gigabytes. This allows the Zune to compete with or exceed the storage specifications of the mighty iPod. It's also possible to add an extended life battery for an additional 30-45 minutes of play time. However, I wouldn't recommend doing such modifications yourself unless you have a decent amount of electronics experience and a proper set of instructions.    Music sounds crisp and clear on the Zune. Both mp3's and the FM radio sound fine (as good as FM radio can sound). It can also be turned up quite loud. While I tend to keep my music at a lower volume, I can see how even the most demanding listener could be appeased. However, I highly recommend that you purchase aftermarket headphones. The ones that come with the Zune are woefully insufficient. I had a problem with the plug on mine, which led to static in my music and the left earbud would sometimes fade out. I also find them to be uncomfortable in my ears, but that could be more of a personal issue. Once I switched over to my favorite pair of Sony earbuds, all problems vanished. My music sounded excellent.    It should also be mentioned that the carrying case that is included in the Zune box is ridiculous. I suggest getting a more protective and user-friendly case, such as the DLO Folio or Belkin Acrylic case. Thankfully, the Zune is not nearly as fragile as the iPod. The body is solid and feels "rubberized." It seems much more resistant to minor body wear and doesn't show many fingerprints. You'll still want to guard the screen though. If nothing else, you may want to get an adhesive screen protector.    As you can see, the Zune may have a lower price point than the iPod, but there can be significant amount investment after the initial purchase. This seems to be the norm with most electronics these days, but you'll probably want to consider a carrying case, new headphones, and an AC adapter if you don't want to plug your Zune into the computer to recharge it.    Finally, there's the case of the Zune software and Zune marketplace. If the Zune has a downfall, this is it. When comparing Zune to iTunes, there is no contest. iTunes is far smarter and much slicker. I can't help but feel that the Zune software is "clunky." While I haven't had any sync problems and my mp3 files have transferred without a hitch, I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday music player. If you're looking to sit at your computer and listen to your music, use iTunes or Winamp. The Zune fails to offer a feature like iTunes' Party Shuffle, the marketplace selection is stark, and file management is obscenely horrific.    When I first installed the Zune software, it proceeded to (without prompting me) search my entire computer and catalog just about every music, sound, video, and picture file. Once I had everything set up, I had to go back, empty out my entire library, reconfigure the folders in which the Zune will search for files, and then recompile my library. Is "annoying" a strong enough word? Hardly. However, I'm willing to lighten the weight of this negative because the software is something that will evolve with the Zune. Microsoft will probably fix the problems, add new features, and slowly increase the marketplace offerings. I hope.    Overall, the Zune is a solid 1st-generation music player. It handles the music and video end of things very well, the large screen looks great, the control scheme is well done, and the possibility of extensive customization is refreshing. However, the lack of quality software hurts it, along with the sub-par accessories (earbuds & carrying bag) included in the box. But, if you're sick of your iPod, don't care for Apple, or just want to be different than the faceless mass of iPod devotees, then the Zune is worth your consideration.

<Content>This product is garbage! Even ask Microsoft as they published in the Chicago Tribune that they are not supporting this product. That would be why no one at Zune CS is willing to do anything to satisfy a Zune customer. They through it back at Amazon and Amazon is willing to take it back for 70% of what you paid for it. I lost $30 on Zunes website for downloads and now Amazon will stand to make $75. I would suggest IPOD for Sure! By the way their CS is not in the US...from the sounds of it. That's my opinion....
