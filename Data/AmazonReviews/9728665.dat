<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Save your money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it quit working 3 weeks later. First it started turning off for no reason, we changed the batteries, no better. Now it won't turn on and stay on for longer than 2 seconds. What a piece of crap!!!!!!!! Zero stars.

<Title>Cheap plastic leads to shoddy product
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We expected this item to be at least as good as the older Creative MuVo TX we've had for over a year, but we were wrong. The cheap plastic on this Creative Nano MP3 player leads to two drawbacks we experienced within the first 3 weeks we owned it: 1) The tiny plastic clip that holds the battery cover in place easily breaks off, and it takes weeks to get a replacement cover from Creative. 2) Even when it's inside the plastic case (which you have to buy separately), the unit turns off, loses its settings, or forgets what song it was playing when it experiences light impact, such as dropping 3 inches onto a table.   We never had any of these problems with other MP3 players we've had for over a year.  The Creative MuVo TX is a much sturdier product, and it even has a better cover.  This product was a waste of my money.  It gets 2 stars because the software is very easy to use.

<Title>creative MP3 players not for Mac users
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I was shopping for our kids x-mas presents here on Amazon I thought an inexpensive MP3 player would fit the bill. Checking out the literature and reviews nothing indicated there would be compatiblity problems with Apple products. We purchased two Zen nanos only to find out the ugly truth, not only do MP3 players work only with Microsoft products, only ipods work with Apple products.

<Title>A Great Value
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old. She loves music, but she was tired of lugging around her CD player & CD collection anytime we took a trip. Only one disappointment: At the time Amazon had the wrong features listed in the description, so I thought it had line-in recording capabilities... it doesn't. If you just need a good basic mp3 player you can't go wrong with this one. It has survived quite a few drops and a good bit of banging around, as it belongs to a young kid. We have had NO PROBLEMS of any type with this player that sees daily use. It is easy to load/manage songs on this player as well. The provided software is easy to use and install. We have loaded music from Napster, music match, and personal CDs with out a hitch. Battery life is as good or better than promised. Creative builds a good product that bridges the gap between the cheap-junk players and the Almighty Ipod. 512k is enough memory for quite a few songs, but some may opt for a bigger capacity. Like I said before, if you want a quality, easy to use player at a fair price this may be the one.

<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We just got ours so don't know about longevity but it is very cute and much smaller than an ipod.  I bought it for my daughter to take on a school trip to Europe and wanted a player that was inexpensive and used batteries.  This one came with an armband but not a neckband.  We had some problems getting our PC (Windows XP) to recognize the device.  It seemed to need Windows Media 10 to work and we also had to load the enclosed software.  Now it works fine.  It seems to easily convert songs from cds that we had stored originally on itunes with no problems.  My daughter loves it.  Now I am getting one for her sister and myself.  The 1GB is now the price we paid for the 512 MB so we are getting those.

<Title>Hopefully Helpful........
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me save you some time... if your player starts shutting down, tech support will tell you it's a DRM thing and that you have to use a specific program to transfer files, that you have to upgrade the firmware and drivers off of their site. It all works pretty well, although a clumsy process... but if you want your unit to continue to function properly, you need an older driver. Try to find this version: ZenNanoPlus_PCFW_LF_1_10_03 (it's the version before the current one, so it's bound to be floating around out there somewhere... just keep looking or demand it from Creative) - I just reformatted and flashed my firmware using this version and it now works just fine. GOOD LUCK!!! [..]  I should also mention that this would be the PERFECT player if:  1) the little tooth on the battery compartment sliding door didn't break off so EASILY.  2) The firmware wasn't sush a mess (they blame record labels and DRM restrictions...)  3) and the recording quality was something better than, like about 32 kHz wav. 192 mp3 would be better.  Otherwise I LOVE the unit and the ease of operation.

<Title>I love it!!!
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't have anything to compare this to because it's my first MP3 player.  However, I am surprised at just how much I love it.  It is so easy to use and very small and light so it can fit in your pocket.  It was extremely easy to download the music and figure out how to organize music folders.  It holds just about what is advertised which is approximately 200 - 250 songs.  However, I am sure the length of each song will determine how many can actually fit on this MP3 player.  The price was great - $50.  If you are a person who loves the radio, then get the Nano Plus.  Otherwise, this is a great player for someone who wants ease of use and does not have more than 250 songs in their collection of favorite music.

The construction is very flimsy, and if you do your research before purchasing you will find that this is not an uncommon problem.

<Content>This player is small and fits in my pocket.   The sound is really good (althougth I prefer using my own headphones because the ones that come with it are not very comfortable).  Operating the menu is a little difficult (it is a wheel) and sometimes you get in the wrong place because you didn't turn it just right.    Battery life seems to be pretty good.  Overall, I am happy to have a player, so I am happy with it.

<Title>Cant beat it for the price.
<Date>Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>-Very simple to use.  Sound quality is A+.    -Earbuds have the best sound for earbuds of those type, but usually too large for most women I find (try Creative's EP-360).   -Comes with a neck strap, armband or carring case sold seperatly.  -Case is hard plastic.  At this time I feel you would have to be very careless to break the battery covering or any part of it.  The battery covering slides in and out with ease.    -My 1st two batteries did last about 18 hours.  Easy to use with audible.com and Window Media player.    -Compaired to other players in the same price range, this is the best bang for your buck.

<Title>Battery cover comes off, then battery falls out!  Creative offers little to help!
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with Lewis...but lets be accurate.  The battery backing doesn't actually brake.  It just falls off when you least expect it, and it's so small, you don't feel it, so there's no telling where the cover lands.  Going thru Creative is a JOKE!  I already got a free battery cover replacement, but within a month, THAT fell off too!  I contacted Creative, and they said it's going to cost this time.  Now, I'm expected to pay approximately $20 to get another cover (with shipping)!  I told them that this is NOT an uncommon problem, and directed them to several different sites that discuss this problem (with still no solution), and that's where the conversation ended.  I REALLY wish I hadn't bought this one.  I guess I should have done my research, but I purchased it when it first came out, so it wouldn't have done any good.  What a joke!  Stay away from this product, unless you want to lose battery covers and batteries over and over.  That becomes expensive, especially if you are taking the economical way and using rechargable batteries!  STAY AWAY!  AVOID!

<Title>Satisfying for a limited period.
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this product for almost a year untill it broke down. Once it fell and hit the ground and disintegrated on two pieces,  so I glued them together and then worked fine for couple months untill sweat penetrated into its guts and made the wire that connects battery with main green plate corosive so it disconnected. We tried to repair it but no go it's finished. It's true that I've been using it mostly for running, gym and biking so it was constantly wet of sweat so probably today would still work if I wouldn't use it for sports but I've bought it for that purpose. PROS: - small and quite thin - one AAA battery lasts for about 18 hours - simple menu and a lot of functions (FM radio also) - very good sound for electronic music but not with original headphones   those are crap - it looks nicer than competition  CONS: - cheap plastic - problems with battery cover - cheap and clumzy scroll wheel - too short interval of display light - made in China

<Title>Creative ZEN Nano 'minus'
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Nano sucks. 4 hrs and 2 calls to tech suppoert and the unit still will not be recognized by my computer. One of the Tech support help points was to use one of the USB ports on the BACK of the computer rather than the front (not in the instructions). They say that the ports on the back of computers are more capable that those on the front (?). I asked them why they would design a device - with a 6 inch cable - that required you to crawl under your desk to plug it in each time, when there is a perfectly good port (that works for every other plug-in device I have) on the front? All I got was a sheepish, 'yeah, I know' from the techie. Still did not work on the rear port. Then they wanted me to go in and do some monkey work with the computer's register. Forget it. It goes back. It's like buying a radio for your car and then being told you need to work on the transmission to get the radio to turn on. What a piece of crap.  Amazon should have an option to rate '0 stars'.

<Title>on par with sandisk sansa series
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this player looks cooler than the sansa series, and seems to crash/have errors less, but:  - it lacks a lock button - the display only shows the song title and track time and battery life (the sansas show much more info) - the "wheel button" feels cheesy like it could break and doesn't make control any easier - the headphones are more uncomfortable and fall out for me (i think they are too big, and i have a big head)  overall, i'd say it has a much better value than an ipod, but about the same value as the sansas.

<Title>Agree pro and con
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Every one is right.  Good mp3 player, needs better headphones.  I bought my first mp3 it is the MuVo, which was bigger but provided a soft belt clip holder that also fitted over th battery cover.  It also the main part of the player detached from the battery holder with a bulit in usb adapter, very good, did not have to go through all the cords I have for other stuff. I have been very happy with that one.  I bought the creative nano plus form staples for my grandaughter last Christmas they sent me the nano instead of sending it back I decided to keep it and get the correct zen nano plus which could transferr direct from cd player, the main reason I ordered it.  Well to cut it short, my grandaughter lost the battery cover so I was going to take the one off mine and I noticed it was really loose, i'm sure it would have lost too.  If you really want this player all you need to do is get a holder for it or the cheapest fix is to put a piece of tape on it.  The thing is cheap but you get what you pay for.  I paid about $70, thats a lot cheaper Than $300 for an IPOD!

<Title>Great features, poor construction
<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this player for the incredible list of features for the price.  The line recording is great, the interface is good, radio with recording is a great plus, the built-in mike is a nice touch, and everything fits into a tiny little plastic case the size of a package of trident gum.  The features are all well thought out, although the mic is very quiet and really could not be used to record something like a lecture.  I would love to try hooking up a nice mic and small preamp through the line in, as I'm sure it would sound much, much better.  You can record in 128 or 160 kbps mp3 through this input.  The 160 kbps sounds great.  The computer software is decent.  The reason I gave this unit a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is because they obviously skimped on materials to keep the cost down.  The plastic looks great, but it scratches incredibly easily (I think I would recommend getting white instead of black for this reason), the button, which look  like they should be made of metal, are unsubstantial silver-painted plastic, and the battery cover appears very prone to breakage.  I expected real metal buttons (like a cell phone) and a more substantial plastic casing, or even metal casing (I would be willing to pay an extra $10-$20 for these better materials -- I mean, it wouldn't require much seeing how small the thing is!)  The plastic scrolling wheel is a bit hard to move side-to-side at times.  I use the included rubbery belt-clip case-thing all the time to protect the unit.  It makes it feel more substantial and protects from any big scratches.  The headphones are made of much better quality material, fit nicely in the ears, and sound pretty good, but they buzz whenever the backlight on the unit comes on, and they also crackle a little between songs.  I generally leave the backlight off to save battery, anyway.  Again, this does not happen with most other headphones when plugged into the unit.  So, if you can live with these physical design flaws, this MP3 player rules.  If it's going to bother you (Like it does with me), probably go elsewhere.

<Title>Kinetic interface amazing
<Date>Tue May 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got a prototype model from Creative Asia to test out. Will submit full online review soon. The construction is a bit shoddy and same headphone problem as the Micro exists but the size cannot be beat (about the same width and height as the Shuffle but half as wide). The most amazing aspect is the so-called "kinetic interface" -- the ability to strap this onto your arm and then just control the device through gestures. The gestures for play, ff, rw and stop were fine but I think I irked a few people when I tried making the gesture for "pause" while running. The idea is great and it works really well but I think Creative might want to rethink this.

<Content>I love my Creative Nano it has a wonderful list of features for its small size. I like to pick on my friends who have iPods and tell them that I also have Radio, a voice recorder and mp3 encoder and I paid less than they did. I was tempted to give it 5 stars, but I think the casing is a bit to delicate for standard use, the black cover scratched very easily and there isn't much you can do to remove the scratches. Also the batter cover broke after one month of usage. The good thing is that I called Creative support to see if they had replacements and they offered to replace the whole unit. I haven't seen the new iPod, bur I think that with the Creative Nano you get your moneys worth.

<Title>Great for Runners and Athletes
<Date>Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you want an mp3 player for exercise, this is a good player. For exercise, flash memory is definitely the way to go. Unless you are fairly stationary on an exercise bike or other equipment, I've found that even anti-skip hard drive players tend to bounce around when I'm running or exercising. The buttons on the Zen Nano are a bit small, but the small size is also an advantage, because I can easily slip the player into a pocket--no need for armbands like with other players. It is easy to use and has excellent sound quality.

<Title>A decent mp3 player
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a new Zen Nano a few months ago.  I mostly use it to listen to while walking around the campus.  The ear buds that came with it are horrible to use, in my opinion.  They fit very poorly and the audio seems to switch sides sometimes...but most people will tell you that no matter what you buy, the included headphones are never that good.  I immediately bought a $20 pair of headphones, and then I was fairly happy.  Although I am still planning on buying even better headphones later, maybe some Seinnheiser HD202's which I bet would sound great with this player.   Anyways, after a while you get used to using the controls and pushing the buttons with one hand, which is nice.  The black case does get noticeably scratched up over time, it did come with a little plastic "sleeve" but it's an ugly looking semi-transparent white rubber thing.  It makes me think of a condom for my player, so I never used it.  If you don't mind it getting scratched up, then I say, forget using the weird included holder.  These past few weeks I've noticed that my player has been taking longer to turn off, which is done by holding down the play button.  The past few days, it won't actually turn off at all.  I have to open the battery cover and pull the battery out to turn it off, which is a little inconvenient.  I haven't read about this happening to anyone else, so I just might be unlucky.  I would say that for the price, it's a really nice player, (...) I do wish I had saved up a little more and purchased the 1 gig one though, since I like to have a lot of musical choices to pick from.  This model can hold about 6 or so albums at about 192kbps, which is CD quality audio.

<Title>Be careful which version you buy, Nano v Nano Plus
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This one is the Nano model.  The product description is inaccurate.  It does not come with FM receiver, belt clip/protective case, or armband.  The Nano Plus which is approx $35 more does come with these features.  I was very disappointed after receiving my shipment, but Amazon was able to work with me to resolve my issue.  Other than that, I just started using it and it is very easy to load songs, and the sound quality is great.  Not sure why so many people complain about the ear buds.  The materials used do seem a little cheap.  Scrolling thru the menus and options seems realtively easy considering there is limited space to put buttons.  Overall, good product if you do not need an FM radio, belt clip, or armband.  Otherwise, there may be better options for you.

<Title>Great For Anyone's First Mp3 Player
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this for christmas and It's my best christmas present I have. It's very nice, looks nice, and plays nice. Down Below I have written a Pros and Cons list that I hope will help.   Pros: - Battery Life Is Great - You can record random things onto the Mp3 from the microphone - The volume is very loud and very low ( in other words, good range of volume) - There is a thing called "EQ" Which makes you choose the way it sounds or you can make your own way - The backlight is great - The Mp3 comes with a cord to transferre the songs - Only four buttons - Very fast to download a CD of songs (about 5 minutes) - Has 16 different functions to personalize it any way you want - On, Off, Play, Pause is all one button (that's a plus) - Smaller than an ipod (I think's thats obvious though) - Size of half my finger and I have about a 1 and a 1/2 inch finger - You can learn how to use the whole thing in about 40 minutes if your really interested in it - It tells what version it is, how many MB (Mega Bites) you have on it, how many you have left, and how many songs you have on there - The songs are alphbitized and so aren't the albums, so if you want to switch to an album that start with an N and your at one that starts with a D or something.   Cons: - My Battery Casing has already broken and is being held with tape for the time being until I call the company - The Mp3 will get scratched easily   All in all, the only reason I gave it a 4 is because the construction of it is cruddy (just the platic, not the chips or wires or anything). It took about 3 minutes to install. The only things I recomend is it does get tiring to manually type in the information on the Mp3 so you should register for some thing that will atuomatically put the information on for you. I hoped this helped and sorry for any typo's!

<Title>Easy to use, holds a good deal of music
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Zen Nano as a Christmas gift, and I already love it.  The system is extremely easy to work with; I never even had to look at the User Manual to figure out how to build playlists and move songs around on my player.  I saw another review that refers to manually typing the information into the player.  If you are using Windows Media, you won't have to do that; the only information I've had to type are the names of my playlists.  Windows Media recognizes and lists the song titles, and the info syncs right to the player.  My only complaint with this player is that it is it didn't come with an armband; Creative makes one, but they are currently out of stock (hopefully only for another week).  There is a neckcord that works okay, but I use the player when weightlifting and it can get in the way.  That's a small price to pay for a terrific player, though, and you can't beat the value.  Some people note that they would buy the 1Gb player if they had it to over, but I don't mind the 512Mb - I get sick of the playlists anyway, and changing the mix is part of the fun.  Overall, a highly recommended product.

When I upgrade my car stereo, I'll buy an iPod, simply because you can plug in and control directly from stereo head unit.
