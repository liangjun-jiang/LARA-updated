<Title>Superb sound ... Very lightweighted.. Succesfully designed
<Date>Mon Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this player 1 week ago.PC Software (MPIO Manager 2) need to be upgraded with latest version from MPIO's website. Realplayer plug-in works well (realplayer upgrade needed for ripping sound quality over 96kbps ..its free) . Easy navigation (also via Remote Control), understandable menus and very good sound.I recommend it.

<Title>Best Bang For Your Buck
<Date>Wed Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This player is the best i have ever had i switched to this player from the Nike player an that thing was a piece of JUNK.  i use this player everyday when i am at school the software is very user friendly and to operate is just as simple.  This thing runs off 1 AA Battery and i have been using it everyday for  2 1/2 weeks now and the Battery bar is still full.  Great sound great features higly recommend.

<Title>Pretty good mp3 player
<Date>Fri Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This Mp3 player comes with just a ton of different little features. The ability to record the ability to hear FM radio and the ability to record FM radio. Also the 7 different EQ settings works great. The little remote is very convenient and overall I love the size, extras and abilities of this mp3 player. The only thing I dont like is the volume is a bit underpowered. They work well with earbuds but not headphones or headsets. So make sure to get the mp3 player with a set of ear buds. I got the panasonic RP-HV28 and they make it sound a lot better.

<Title>Buyer Beware
<Date>Tue Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have a different MP3 from this company, but I need to warn anybody considering a purchase from Digitalway.  My MP3 failed within 6 weeks - customer service is impossible to get a hold of, even more difficult to understand than the User Manual, and unwilling to send the return/repair forms.  The 120 day warranty is worthless.

<Title>looks very nice but it is useless
<Date>Sat Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought it because it looked nice and because it uses Smart Cards, but it is a flop. The menu is impossible to navigate, the manual not helpful at all, and the software that comes with it is basically useless. The manufacturer does not offer the patches required to make it work with Windows XP. The letters on the screen are hard to read. Good sound and the FM radio included is a good feature, but it is not worth the hassle of going through the installation. The buttons are confusing, too many functions in too few buttons. The remote control is even harder to use.After trying to instal it in a brand-new laptop I gave up and had to return it. Why not paying a bit more and getting a hard drive memory MP3 player with several GB that will allow one to store tons of music...that's what I did and bought a Zen NX Jukebox with 20 GB. I transferred all the music I  had in my 7 128 MB SmartCards and still have over 17 GB to go!

<Title>Very Poor Customer Service
<Date>Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased an FD100 for my son as a Christmas present.  The remote stopped working, probably due to a broken wire.  I sent an e-mail to the Digitalway customer service...no response.  I called customer service and they said they would send a return authorization number in an e-mail...never received the e-mail.  I called several times over the next few weeks and no one answered the phone.  When I finally reached another customer service representative, the person said the remote (accessory) was not covered under the warranty.  That's a pretty poor policy.  Because it took so long to get this answer, I can no longer return the item to Amazon.  DON'T BUY DIGITALWAY PRODUCTS.

<Title>mad nice mp3 player
<Date>Sat Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this is a beautiful mp3 player.  simply beautiful.  the backlights on the body and remote control are outstanding.  the 128 megabytes gave me a lot of room for lots of music.  the sleek, silver, futurisic design rocks.  overall, there is nothing wrong with this

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Sat Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This mp3 player functioned without any problems when I first got it. But after two months all of my files got erased even though both the player and program said my memory had been taken up. I had to format the internal memory, and reupload my files. The files would often freeze whenever I tried to upload them or delete them from the player. This player is a hassle to maintain.

<Title>It's great
<Date>Thu Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This mp3 player is great!!  It looks better than I thought.  The manual doesn't help though.  That is the only thing that sucks.  You could make playlists too - I didn't know this until I made a playlist.  It comes with downloading software - .99 per song.
