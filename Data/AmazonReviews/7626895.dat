<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am pleased with my purchase.  I listen mainly to XM music so it doesn't matter that its not live.  I plug it in at night to recharge and record and I take it to work in the morning and play it through the radio there with and fm transmitter.  I can get all the latest music downloaded.  The charge is great and the memory is great.  Its very easy to use.

<Title>Great For XM kinda Okay for MP3
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When i first got this device it was okay with it i liked that it can record XM which i find really awesome. But if you are a Subscription music fan (napster,Yahoo places like that) then here is the down side to this product. If this product supported subscription based music it would of gotten all 5 stars but it got a 4 but overall Sound Quality is great menues are great battery life is awesome memory is awesome but the MP3 with subscription music *point fingers down* not good. Hopes that Samsung will release a Firmware update to support Subscription music cause i don't wanna wait for a song that i want to listen to play on XM so that i can record it so 4 Stars!

<Title>Annoying automatic cutoff pause between every XM song in playback!
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player has what to me is a fatal flaw: when playing back recorded XM content, the player creates an automatic couple of seconds of silence between every song. This break is even more annoying because it seems to not be an inserted space (a couple of seconds of dead air if you will) added between tracks, but rather is done ON TOP of the recording. In other words, the last few notes of every single song and the first few notes of the next song get cut off always. This is more jarring than you would imagine, especially since like most radio stations, XM's songs play back-to-back (ie: the next song is played on the station as the previous song fades away). This is the normal continuous music mix we expect from normal radio listening but the player adds a very noticeable break that cuts off the songs on both ends. This is actually even worse a problem during spoken moments like the station IDs or announcements. In other words, instead of hearing "This is Fred on 44", the player will instead play "is is Fred on fo" cutting off the message. Another example is instead of playing the well-known jingle "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem", you only hear "rican Top 40 with Casey K". It is just ridiculous and ruins the entire listening experience. There seems to be no way around this flaw either. It might be less of a problem for listeners of classical or other programming that normally has silence in between each song, but for those who listen to pop or rock or dance radio, this is really terrible, as bad as if a DJ totally messes up the transition between songs on the dancefloor- what we like to call a "trainwreck" of music.

<Title>Review of Nexus 25 XM Ready Radio
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent product and provides perfect receiption. HOWEVER - I did not learn until I received the product that it required the receiver be placed in a south-facing window in order to pick up the satellite's signal.  There is a 25 foot cord provided to reach into another room but that could be very inconveneint.

<Title>Good value for the money
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A lot of people don't realize that this really does work as a stand-alone MP3 player.  I have never had XM radio, and don't yet plan on paying for it, but I have the memory completely filled up with all my favorite songs and use it all the time.  Very easy to figure out how to work all the options (I have yet to be able to figure out how to use my husband's ipod). One note - if you're not using it for XM radio don't bother with the installation disk.  I have never used it - I just plug it into my computer through the USB where it becomes a new hard drive.  Then I just copy and paste my songs to it's assigned hard drive letter.  Tell the computer to safely remove that number, disconnect and your on your way. Now, I said good value for the money - I didn't pay anything for this, but i would say it is easily worth the equivalent 12 hour MP3 player.

<Title>Inexpensive and works.
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This receiver was dirt cheap for my 3rd xm radio, mounted it on my motorcyle using ram mounts. Worked flawlessly on my last trip of 1800 miles. I have a Delphi and Pioneer so I find the needed passport module a little odd in that it creates xtra bulk when mounting in vehicles. One reviewer wrote that the nexus cuts off songs you have recorded, leaving space between songs, this is very true and somewhat annoying! But for the money I can live with it. Car kits are expensive so shop e-bay for deals!!

<Title>One thing to know before you buy......
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You must have a window that faces south in order to receive a signal. I live in an apartment that has windows only facing north and east and I can not get a signal and therefore this product is worthless to me. So check to make sure you have access to a south window or somewhere to mount the antenna to face south that also is not blocked by trees or tall structures.  Good Luck!

<Title>I'm really happy with this thing
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like it! This is my second XM radio. Thought I would share some thoughts about this gizmo. First became aware of this particular radio several weeks ago - saw an ad for one in the local newspaper (one of the big name department stores after-Christmas sales). Price was what initially caught my eye (about the same as what I paid here at Amazon). Almost didn't buy this as from what I read about it seemed to say that you had to sign up with Napster and XM. Turns out you don't have to sign up with Napster.  Highlights of my initial experiences so far:  What was in the `box': radio + battery, earbuds, dock/cradle unit, power transformer, XM antenna, remote control, soft plastic carrying case/holster, RCA audio cable, USB cable, and Instructions / software CD (Napster)  First thing I noticed was that the antenna / power transformer was the same as my existing XM radio (roady xt), so I quickly disconnected my one radio's cradle and hooked up this new one. Popped the battery into the radio and was good to go.  Setting up a second account on the XM site was a matter of a couple mouse clicks and in ten minutes the radio was active (course that cost another $100 or so).  Figuring out how to use the radio was a snap. Menu system is very intuitive. The remote for this unit is almost the exact copy of the one for my other radio - the old remote even worked with this new unit.  Now for what this gizmo does. Well for one it lets you listen to XM radio (duh), but it also lets you record XM radio. Think of this device as an audio VCR. When listening to the radio - you can record the song you are currently listening to simply by pressing the record button on the remote - the unit records just the one song and records the title / artist information too. You can also record the whole channel as well if you want - and each song recorded during that session is a separate item - each with it own title that you can scroll though. And like a VCR, you can set the unit to come on at a certain time / date and record a program / channel.  You can also load your own audio files (MP3s) - either via the Napster software or directly. Like a lot of MP3 players, when you hook the unit up to your computer via the USB cable - it appears as a drive. Just be aware that the unit comes with the memory partitioned into two separate areas - one for the XM content and one for music files (MP3s). The unit I bought was the 25 which has a total of 512MB of memory - out of the box this is split 50/50 with 256MB (half) available for MP3s, the other half holds about 12.5 hours of recorded XM content. You can reconfigure the percentages, and even make it 100% XM (for 25 hours of space for recorded content).  Disconnecting the player from the base disconnects it from the XM antenna - so you don't get to access `live' XM radio - just the stuff that you recorded and whatever MP3 files you have loaded. The player has its own rechargeable battery and I used mine today at work all day long and the battery indicator only dropped a little bit. Player charges while in the base.  All in all, I'm really happy with this thing.

<Title>Great little mp3/xm receiver/recorder for the money!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he's been thrilled with it so far!  He'd asked for an mp3 player and I wanted to get him a good one, but when I started researching and discovered that he could have both an XM radio receiver for his car and an mp3 player, I was sold. NOTE: You  have to buy the car kit separately -- I got one through Amazon for $50.  I  was just about ready to purchase the Pioneer version, which was running about $180, when I found this one on sale for $40!  As noted in other reviews, recording from XM has some minor irritations, such as sometimes  getting the last few seconds of a previous song/interview before the thing you want to record and sometimes the last seconds of your song/interview get cut off, but hubby says the fact that you can start recording something up to 45 seconds after it starts and get the whole thing makes up for it.  Works great as an XM receiver and the FM modulator works well, too.  Remote buttons sometimes don't work and it has the annoying habit of turning on when you drop it in its cradle, but my husband has been happy with it overall.  Great 3-in-1 device for the price!

<Title>My New Walking/Travel Buddy
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had orignally purchased the Pioneer Inno, but I returned it after I learned that the FM Modulator ability would be limited to use in a car dock with the first firmware update.  To me, that wasn't going to justify the cost of that product.    Having said that, I have had XM in my home for a few years now, and I love it.  So, when I found out that the NeXus 25 would let you record from XM to play back later, as well as recieve live XM in it's home dock, I decided that would be a much better match.  The NeXus 25 costs about half the price that the Inno did.  I find it easy to schedule recordings, and the one-touch record button is very useful.  I also like the fact that you can partition the memory of the unit so that you can record 50% XM content and 50% of your own MP3's.  It is because of this feature that I have retired my portable CD player when I go out walking.  I'm really looking forward to taking it on the family vacation this year, and turning it on when we hit the dead spots (you know, the parts of the trip where the only thing you can find on the radio is static!)!!

<Title>Great portable XM radio
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent a couple months looking at portable XM radios in search of one to meet my needs.  I eventually chose this device and I've been more than happy with my decision.  My needs were fairly simple.  I needed to be able to listen to new music daily from within the concrete installation that is my workplace, and be capable of delivering it for the duration of my day.  I also wanted to listen to it in my car or through a stereo.  I had no interest in playing MP3, nor did I care about online functionality or interface with my computer.  The NeXus has met every one of my requirements(with the purchase of the car/FM transmitter), and has done so exceptionally.  The radio will only play live XM when it's in the cradle.  This seemed strange at first, but made sense as I got familiar with XM and it's capabilities.  The decoder is separate from the radio(likely to keep the radio itself small), which I imagine is needed to recieve the signal.  You must plug the decoder into the cradle along with the radio to play live XM.  Also due to the relative weakness of the XM signal, the antenna needs to be long.  These factors are likely the reason for only having recorded content on the go.    The menus on the device are fairly intuitive, though not entirely elegant.  You can navigate by artist, by recording session, or with a flat list of songs for your recorded content.  Live XM will allow you to navigate through stations naturally.  There is also additional functionality that I have yet to use that seems to allow you to keep an eye out for certain artists.  Navigation from the device is fairly simple, using the arrows on the face to move around, and the middle XM button to select.  The remote is more robust in functionality, but is less intuitive in spots.  The remote is also fairly weak, and the display on the radio itself is small. This limits the distance you can be from the radio when using it and making the remote a little on the useless side.  Battery life for the radio is very good, and has performed better than advertised for me.  I get over 8 hours of continuous play from a full charge.  I haven't run the battery completely dead yet, but it lasts my entire work day and still has a bar or two left when I plug it into the cradle in my car on my way home.  Charging time seems to be very quick as well.  Storage is very good, though it doesn't sound impressive with only 512MB.  You can partition the drive into 50% MP3 and 50% XM or 100% XM.  I have opted for 100% XM, as I am sick of my MP3 collection.  I currently have over 200 songs on my XM player, 8 of which are 30 minute segments, and one which plays slightly over an hour and a half.  Assuming the average track is 4 minutes, that puts my current load at about 17 - 18 hours of recorded content.  The device itself is put together well.  It small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, and is about a half an inch thick.  That makes it about the size of your average flip phone - which is easily pocketable.  The earbuds that come with it are not good quality, and are uncomfortable.  I already had a pair of higher quality earbuds that replaced those.  The music quality is decent.  I'm no audiophile, so if it doesn't sound crunchy, or like it's playing in a can I'm happy.  The other pieces like the audio cables and the carrying clip thing are of average to below average quality, but get the job done.  All in all I'm totally satisfied with the NeXus 25, and have recommended it to friends who are in the market for a portable XM radio.

<Title>A well-designed product
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The modular design of this system was unusual to me initally, but I soon realized how nifty it really is.  I purchased the receiver (includes home dock) and the car kit at a very attractive price and have not looked back.  Likes: 1. I can record several hours of music and listen later when I'm indoors, working in the yard or otherwise in a poor reception setting. The tracks are individually tagged with Artist and Title info (like MP3). 2. The player is small, and I can clip it to my belt or slip it in my pocket. 3. When listening to recorded tracks, I can skip those I don't like.  That's a big deal! 4.Sound quality of MP3 tracks is great.  The radio tracks are, well, satellite radio.  Which is to say tolerably compressed.  Satellite radio in general is more about quantity, than quality.   5.The battery is removable. 6.The receiver module (Passport) can be plugged into other XM2GO products so that additional subscriptions are not required.  I'm waithing for someone to offer a boom box that accepts the Passport. 7. If I hear a song in the car that I like, I can record it on the fly, including the beginning of the track. 8. Big bang for the buck.  Dislikes: 1. The Napster interface software is a little clunky. 2. Would like to be able to segregate and listen to recorded tracks by channel number without creating a playlist. This is a minor quibble.  This is a great product.  Potential buyers are strongly advised to go ahead and get the car kit.  Bundled pricing is usually very good.

<Title>If you like Tivo and XM radio then you'll like this player.
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First things first: this is NOT a portable XM radio. It can only receive live XM broadcasts when docked with the included cradle and satellite antenna. But you can connect this to your stereo and listen without earplugs. But the best feature is the ability to record XM radio for later playback--just live Tivo.   So at home you can listen through your stereo speakers, and then if you're  away from home it acts just like an iPOD. This is better than the current portable XM radios since with those you cannot predict what kind of signal strength you'll get when on the go. The menu system is great, although the buttons are small. You can record any channel at any time, and build your own playlists. Everything you need comes included in the box except for the car kit, which is a separate purchase. For the price this device delivers everything I expected. I'm even thinking about buying another one!

<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received it as a gift and am very happy with it. I record overnight in the dock and replay at work during the day.  Pros:   Several EQ settings.   Great antenna sensitivity (through an outside wall w/ vinyl siding).   Battery life 75% after two workdays.   Good menu system and intuitive controls.  Cons:   Display is small and hard to see from farther than arms length so the included remote control seems like a waste.   Recorded song quality is not great but that's only noticable when playing back through a stereo (and may not be the fault of the unit).   The clock stops during power off if not docked so the time display in the upper right corner is never accurate.   Limited song info available.

<Title>A portable player with an endless library
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Firstly, understand what this player is NOT. It is not a receiver that will allow you to receive Live XM broadcasts when you're out walking around. for that try the Samsung Helix.  What it IS, however, is a very good portable player that also has the ability to record ANY XM channel for playback (the player must be docked to record). What this effectively does is allow you to have a near-endless library of songs or talk shows, etc. that you can play on your device.  I love and have an iPod, but part of the problem is that I'm stuck listening to the songs that I have in my library. What the Nexus does is allow you to record various XM channels - then you can sort back through the songs and play the ones you like - very cool. You can still use it like an iPod as well and put music from your library onto the Nexus as well.  As for the functionality of the device, it's small but has a good build quality and fairly easy to use (albeit not as intuitive as the Ipod). The screen is monochrome with a blue backlight.  This unit also utilizes the XM Passport Mini-Tuner, which allows you to use one XM subscription on any Passport-ready hardware such as a factory-ready stereo unit, home tuner, etc. This is a big savings - perviously you had to purchase a new subscription for each separate XM device. Now with the Passport, you can have 1 subscription and simply take the small Passport chip with you and plug it in.  Overall, a very useful device and certainly a very good buy for the money.
