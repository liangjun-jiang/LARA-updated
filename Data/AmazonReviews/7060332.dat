<Title>I think JWin may be reading my mind ...

<Content>... because I've been wanting a boombox with a radio that can play mp3 CD-Rs & CD-RWs, SD cards and hook up to my mp3 player. The sound is as you would expect from a product at this price.  The only things I would tweak is to make the display show artist, song and album titles. Currently, it only shows the track number. And, how about an alarm clock?  So JWin, I'm sending telepathic messages to you ...

<Content>not a bad box for the price but no were the sound quality of my old AWIA 926 but also no were the price either.  But sadly the first one would not read mp3 cds so I returned it and amazon proved once again to be a great company as they automaticly picked up the reurn ship cost with out question  and now waiting for the replacment

<Content>I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this product.  The sound from the speakers was of very poor quality and I returned the product to Amazon.  I am however very much pleased with the way the return was handled by Amazon.  Very professional and quite satisfying.

<Title>This device sux
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got one of these awhile  back and been having trouble ever since. More then 80% of the time it won't read my CD or a CD with mp3's on it. So as a last resort I put in a usb flash drive. Well it reads the small drive like a 256 mega bytes but it can't read my 2 gig flash drive. I bought this machine for work so I wanted a long playing device but forget it. I hate it.
