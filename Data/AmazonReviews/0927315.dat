<Title>Good features, great price,  works good for a light user
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a CD buyer by heart, and MP3 players are just toys for me when I'm traveling or my wife is working out.  This MP3 player has so far done it all for me.  It holds around 500 mp3's, and I prefer to use the MP3 file format exclusively.  All of my mp3's have worked so far, wheather I have made them, or downloaded them from a sharesite.  The sound is not that bad, I didn't expect much from the sound, but I'm pleasently surprised. The customizable equalizer works reasonably well.  Even if this player does have issues, I purchased the extended warranty for 2 years, replacement garunteed under normal use conditions, so i'll keep replacing it with the same or equivelent.  This is on sale at a big chain store this week, worth picking up for a travel unit, but not as the be all, end all of an avid MP3 downloader user.    Only con-this did not come with an armband, but it's not to expensive to pick up a clip/band.  Worth a shot, I think you will like it.  It is on sale at a big chain store this week (9-10-9/16 2006) for 90 dollars.  not bad.  I even had a coupon

<Title>Great Value player, plays most everything, Nice color screen
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I also have the M230 512mb model from sandisk. It has been a nice addition to my gadgit collection.  This model is a big step up to 2 gigabytes and a color screen, but maintains most of the same features as my other player. This model also features a build in FM receiver, which is nice for days you want to list to the radio or news.  This player uses windows media player 9 to load mp3 files to the device, but you can also drag and drop if preferred.  As far as battery life, to new to tell. I see a prior reveiwer had problems with battery life in this model, but you can controll the length the backlight stays on, as well as a power save setting that will shut the player off after a set amount of time of inactivity, good if you use the player at night at bedtime.  I know on the other player of mine, I got around 12 hours of life, but with the color screen this may use a bit more.  This model, as well as the others, does have a neat little equalizer setting to it, and the earbuds acutally deliver a good sound.  So as a MP3 player, this is a great value. Again, does not play Itunes, but their are plenty of other services that it does play.

<Title>Not as Thin as It Looks
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The photos of this product are misleading.  This product is described as "ultra-thin", however it's actually almost an inch thick.  That makes it nearly three times thicker than an ipod nano.  The photos don't show the rear, which has a rounded shape to accomodate the AAA battery.

<Title>Good unit for the price!
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned three other Sandisk MP3 players and had no problems with any of them. Some of the issues in other reviews here can be solved by reading the manual.  Simply set to MSC mode and the player acts just like a removeable hard drive when connected via USB. Very simple to transfer or delete songs etc.  The 2Gb is reasonably good capacity... in fact, great capacity considering the price. The FM radio works fine, although a little trickier to navigate than some older sandisk models. Color screen is good, although a little too small to be practicable to view photos on. The song title can also take a little too long to scroll fully.   I had no trouble with sound quality or crackling or clipping at start of song. Sound quality is fine! Battery life also seems good for me. I have even ran some el cheapo batteries with it and had good life up to the stated specs (although this depends on how much you press buttons and have the screen lit up).   Voice recorder is handy, although I find I don't use it too much, your mileage may vary though. As a basic MP3 player and radio, I find it hard to beat given the price tag. I have no issues with size of the unit. Sure its not as thin as an Ipod Nano, but it takes one AAA battery which you can get anywhere. No need to have a power point to recharge.  I think some people expect perfection for a budget price!

<Title>Don't buy this one
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player last Friday, and was quite disappointed with it.  I loaded some pictures on it, but they were so small, I don't think that anyone could see them.  I do have to say that the sound is good on this.  I have other Sandisk players and once you set the radio presets, you didn't have to go through every number on the dial.  With this player you have to press it and go through every station to get to the one you want.  I called Sandisk to ask them about it.  They were very helpful and even went and got a plyer to try and figure it out.  He said that this player didn't have that like my other ones.  I ened up returning this because I do listen to a lot of radio, and I didn't want to be flipping and pressing the buttons that many times.  I ended up getting the m250 (I think).  It also has 2GB, and you can preset the radio stations, which is a must for me.  For around the same price, don't get this one, go for the m250.

You'll be glad to know that 9x2x7 is the box it comes in.  The player itself is 3.1"W x 1.4"H x 0.9"D  Hello, Amazon, are you listening?

<Title>Hangs when starting up
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purschased this item and it seemed to work well, after a month it refuses to start up, just shows the SanDisk screen and does not move further. I tried replacing the AAA battery, but still did not work. Also the Sandisk site does not have any firmware upgrade for C150 model. Anyways before we can upgrade the firmware we have to set the player in the USB->MSC mode or something like that. When I cannot start the player how can I put it any of the modes via the Menu ? I will try for a refund / exchange

<Content>I ordered 2 of the Sansa c150 MP# players to give one as a gift. Mine has performed perfectly (other then the fact that the earplugs that come with it are too big to fit in ones ears). I forsaw this as a problem and ordered Koss earplugs to use and they are great. The gift c150 would not hold a charge and ran through batteries. I am awaiting my refund. Apparently it is hit or miss w/ this item because I read reviews that had similar issues.

<Content>I bought this player for my 10 y.o. daughter for X-mas. She finds it easy to use and uses it often! We are still using the 1st. battery that I installed in it so the batteries last a long time. It uses a AA battery which makes it convenient. It would be nice if the player charged the battery when connected to a computer but this is not a big deal.  I synced it using Windows Media Player which was intuitive once I learned the program (I am new into mp3 players).  A good little player that fits our needs for right now.

<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My player is great, easily fits into my pocket, great for "on the go".  Granted, it's not an Ipod.  But sound is great (I'm going to use clipon headphones because I just don't like buds).  The only thing I'd like is an easier way to make playlists, and better fast forward.  However, for what I paid, it's perfect.  Haven't used the FM or recording feature yet, but am glad they're available as well.    A key decision in purchasing this player is the fact that it runs on one AAA battery, so that if you're on the road it's always easy to obtain new juice.  So far, battery life is just fine.

<Title>Not exactly what I was looking for...
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I primarily purchased the product for recording lectures and it did not work well. The Mp3 recorder records the lecture, afterwards, recording is really bad. Sometimes it doesn't record at all or it erases the file or there is an error. In addition, the volume/sound quality is bad. Not loud enough. In the end, you need the software to transfer files, takes forever to figure out what to do. My brothers bought Mp3 player called Matchspeed (red color), good price and it worked great. Best player we ever had, 3 times louder then scan disk and the best thing, no software needed to transfer files. Just drag he items into the folder, thats all to it. And it records great. I hope this advice will help saving everybody's time.

This player has solved all those problems in a tiny space by making the viewing window much larger.  You can just use Windows Media Player or the software that comes with this Sansa.  The sound (both fm radio and mp3) is good. For anyone who likes a very small MP3 player this is perfect.

<Content>"Sleek and ultra-thin" in the description here is a huge stretch.  This mp3 player is anything but ultra-thin.  Yes, it's compact, but it is far from thin.  They also advertise that it will show album art while songs are playing - what they don't tell you is that this feature only works with the pre-loaded songs that come already on the player, and that sandisk gives you absolutely no instructions in the included literature, or in the user's manual (which is not included - you have to go to their website to download it) on how to use album art.  I tried for a couple of hours, on my own, and following the instructions of sandisk's tech support people, and the feature simply does not work.

<Title>Mediocre in all ways...
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The most important thing about this unit is that the audio quality is medicore at best.  The little unit just does not put out much power, and the bass tends to distort.  Note that I am using the same headphones that I was with my last unit, and RCA (which broke), and the RCA sounded much better with more volume.  Second thing is the way this thing organizes the music.  It goes strictly by the tags in the MP3 files.  Don't even bother organizing your files into directories, as you cannot choose to play only one directory.  This does give you a lot of power if you are the type of person who makes sure that the tags are organized in your collection.  However, one of my favorite artists is sometimes listed as "Echoing Green, The" and in other places as "Echoing Green".  So I cannot choose to shuffle their songs even though they are all in the same directory.  Also, this unit uses a power-hungry color LCD screen.  I suppose this is useful for showing pictures, but this is a feature that I don't need.  Because of this, the LCD goes blank after a few seconds.  In order to even see what song is playing, you have to hit some buttons.  Finally, no type of arm band or belt clip was included in my package.  The only thing that I got was a neck strap.  On the plus side, it does work, it gets decent battery life (if you leave the LCD off), holds 2G, and you should be able to find it for a decent price if you watch the sales.

<Content>I wish someone had told me about this player before I bought not one, but 3 of them. The controls are awkward, the screen is just terrible - even indoors it's hard to see. Selected menu items look identical to all the others - there is no contrast or color difference at all (well, there is, the background color changes from very light blue to very very light blue). Worst of all, the one I kept for myself only works out of one channel, and it's not even 4 months old. I put on Simon and Garfunkel, and get only Garfunkel. They're better together.

<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because it was on sale for a great price. Now I know why it was so cheap. The sound quality was horrible. In order to hear with the headphones, I had to turn the volume to the max. What's worse was when the player was hooked to my car stereo: even when both the player and the stereo were turned up all the way, I still couldn't hear very well. In addition to the poor sound quality, the buttons were not very responsive, as I would have to push them 3 or 4 times before anything would happen. To top it all off, two weeks after my purchase, the player stopped working all together (would power off as soon as it was turned on). So I bought the Sansa Clip Micro Player--much much better all around!

<Title>Problems not often explained with these
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall it does what it is supposed to do: play music. The sound quality is neither bad or exceptional and a few issues with the device may crop up. I received this product during the holidays of `06 and I've already had to replace the earphones twice--which already, regardless were taken care of and treated carefully. The volume doesn't go up very high and music can be difficult or impossible to hear in public places--stores, on the street, and rather quiet places where people are just talking normally. Scratches will develop on the face of the plastic shell over time, it's unavoidable, and will obstruct the view of the screen to an extent.   The software is pretty basic, albeit a little difficult to use.  Using the player itself can become a hassle. I have yet to figure out how to manage and rename songs, or for that matter find them. The player has its own ideas about organization and titles. At times it resembles trying to find a needle in a haystack, particularly if you want a certain song. The alphabetical listing is odd. If you add full albums, I've found that it will add numbers in front of the titles and therefore get shuffled around in a nonsensical manner.  Finding an artist presents itself with its own problems. Often one artist will be split with 2+ names and the songs will be scattered under all of them--making you check all of them for whatever song or playlist you want.  The deletion is done on the computer as is the sorting--if you can find a way to manage it. The recorder on the machine is unforgiving with mistakes. If you record something and later realize that you have an emergency lecture or whatnot, you're out of luck if you already have the space filled. It doesn't seem to matter much anyway--you need to be under supreme conditions to catch anything clearly. Radio clarity however is quite nice and I tend to use it more than listen to the 400+ songs housed there.  In regards to the pictures...the screen is so small that it's completely worthless and space wasting to house them to view. Transferring files however and you won't have a problem.  The worst aspect of this product however is the battery life. One AAA battery and at best you have a few hours of power for the player. The rate it goes through them is phenomenal. I've found I've even spent roughly $30 in batteries during a month--almost the price of the player itself. It truly is terrible. 15 hours of power is an absurdly exaggerated claim. So unless you can afford hundreds of batteries, the player is quite worthless owning. The amount spent on the AAAs will quickly become more expensive than a more pricely player---which might be wise to get instead of this, if price is an issue.  But for its credit--It does play songs and I have yet for a song to skip, even when jogging. The color screen is nice and I'd assume the 2GB is attractive and eyecatching for something this cheap. And yes, the capability is a plus. But the player has been poorly designed, thought out, and is quite frankly a time and money sucker. So please be warned and think out the decision before investing in one of these.

<Title>Good Player for the price
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A good little player for the price. I bought it primarily for music and for books I download from the library to be used during running/exercise and commuting. It has worked well and holds more material than I need for this purpose. I would buy it again  Favorable: 2GB storage, simple controls, up and running out of the box in minutes, works great for what I want it to do.  Gripes: Minimal really considering $40 price: The on/off switch in the corner has no plastic guard around it to prevent accidental pressure from turning it on. If I pitch this in my briefcase something typically turns it on. Volume - not quite enough if in a noisy background (prop commuter aircraft primarily - larger quieter jets - fine). Small Screen - no point in loading photos really.

<Title>Good , but not best
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This works and is a good product.  The biggest problem for me is that it does not have a bookmarking feature, which is essential for books on tape.  FOr that reason, I'd go with a "Zen" type, or a more expensive Sansa model.

<Title>Great device but...
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great mp3 player.  The play time per AAA battery is between 12-15 hours which is outstanding in my book.  It also has the ability to display photos and has an internal FM radio.  Playlists can be created with the Rhapsody software included but the included instructions should be better for creating the playlists.  Also, when I tried to create a third playlist, one of the previous playlists didn't work.  Whether that means only two customer-created playlists are possible, I don't know.  I liked it so much that I purchased a second one.  I will use this device for music while walking or running, listening to audio books, and playing music in my car (with one of those gadgets that substitutes for cassette with the mini plug on the end) in the cassette player.

<Title>Frozen after a week
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this player and it was great for about a week and then it froze when I turned it on. The company that sells it, TIGERDIRECT, has not responded to my emails so I went directly to SanDisk. SanDisk gave me a promt response and sent me a label to return the product with free shiping. Another bad thing about this player is that it organizes your music in it's own way and has trouble figuring out artists even if you have the artists name on the song.

<Title>Great Value For The Money!
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my c150 from JR Music World for 49.95 plus 6.95 shipping. Being an audiophile, I'm a little disappointed in the sound quality, not that it's bad, it just doesn't equal my iRiver T30 or my HP 5700 PDA for clarity, both of which cost more so the old adage, "you get what you pay for" applies here. I love the navigations on this unit; very easy to select songs, settings, FM radio. One thing to note is that right out of the box the unit is configured in the settings for "normal" volume range. I point this out because I think many who have bought this probably thought the audio level it puts out is too low. When selecting the "high" volume range, suddenly there is more than enough level for any situation. The earphones that come with the unit are good, but I have very sensitive ears (skin) which can not tolerate this type. After 20 minutes of these in my ears I'm in painful agony. I always end up using a different set of earphones like the Sennheiser CX300 which have a soft insert and great sound. Given the price, I think it deserves 4 stars.

<Title>U get what you pay for
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are looking for the 2GB storage for a great price you got it. It has a cheesy little screen but did kinda surprise me with the amount of features it has. Even though its definately meant to be their lower end item. Go for a Philips GoGear if you want great value and features. But go for IPOD if you want to be like everyone else.

<Title>yays and nays...
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i have the Sansa Sandisk m240 1gb mp3 player. in comparison to this one, it plays WMAs better. this little c150 only like mp3 files. otherwise it either won't play WMAs or will categorize them alphabetically, which is a hassle.   the screen going off after a set amount of time is nice, because it saves up on battery power. but i find no need to have the picture feature. it just takes up battery power. at least i have the option of whether or not i put pictures on this player.   sounds is fine, almost like the m240.   i find that this will be nice for the moment, until i can afford to by one of the models that has an expansion slot.   all in all, i find that i like Sansa mp3 players better than others, like Apple's iPod, because of a use of battery more than anything else. i always keep one with me, so at least i know i will always have the ability to listen to my music.
