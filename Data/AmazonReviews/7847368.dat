<Content>Just wanted something to record singing practice, it overmodulates easily, but on the otherhand it makes  great spyware. You can leave it recording with the endcap off & everyone thinks it's just a flashdrive ~ fool your friends ~ yuk, hyuk.I say that because it won't shut off after 3 minutes like the manual says. There are other quirky behaviors and I'm glad I bought the extended warrany 'cause it will probably go back, but for now, I'm still interested in this strange little beasty.  
<Overall>3
