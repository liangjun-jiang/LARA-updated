<Title>Three hard disk failures-definitely buy the extended warranty
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue.  I have taken care of all of them.  They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare.  That's definitely worth it.  If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod.  At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes.  It would take too much time to switch.

<Title>Next Generation Brag Book & More
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Was I ever surprised when my husband purchased this nifty photo iPod for me as a birthday present when they first came out on the market.  Being the techno wizard that he is, he thought it would be fun for me to have not only almost all of my music collection at my fingertips, but to also be able to enjoy many of our family photographs as well.    I'm sorry to say that I don't have any tips for loading all your pictures on because I let my husband play with that part since he's so good at it. But I doubt that I would have had a problem with it either.    As with all iPod products, a case is a necessity to keep it from getting scratched.   I initially had a skin for mine, but wasn't completely happy with that set up.  My bonus daughter gave me a wonderful turquoise leather flip case that allows easy access to the wheel and an unobstructed view of the screen.   With all the other in depth reviews here, I won't go into a lot of the specifics of the technology, except to say that it seems there would be a better way to navigate through to find particular songs or artists or albums.  But whoever thought 10 years ago, we would be able to have this cool device in the first place?  So I'm grateful for what it does do - gives me hours of pleasure listening to all my favorite music and browsing through my photograph collection up close and personal with the easy click and twirl of my fingers or thumb.  I now call my fun new toy "Mimi's Next Generation Brag Book" because while other mothers and grandmothers whip out their photo albums from their handbags to brag on their Johnny and Susie, I whip out my cool new iPod Photo and twirl my thumb around and find extensive files of family photos from weddings and vacations to pictures of our new grandchildren.    Unfortunately, not long ago, I was carrying my iPod in my bag when I threw in a bottle of water without the cap being screwed on properly.  When I discovered the mess in my bag later that day, my iPod was wet, and somehow the inside of the screen was showing moisture.  We dried it out completely -- in a low temp oven -- yes, we did.  The files were intact and the music still played beautifully, but the pictures couldn't be seen clearly because there was no backlight now.  After sending it off to the factory, we received a message that the backlight was damaged.  Replacing that part would have just about paid for a new one, so we opted not to get it repaired.    I still love listening to this iPod and haven't experienced any other problems.  The music comes through beautifully and transports me to another realm when I'm plugged in.    - Victoria Austin ("MiMi" to Sam & Laryn)

<Title>It's about the iPod, stupid...
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just ignore the simpleton from June 12, 2005 who talked about the iPod charger being incompatible with overseas 220v.  Like your laptop, all you need is a cheap adaptor to plug it into the wall socket.  There's absolutely no risk of damaging a US spec iPod if you travel outside the country - I`ve done it plenty of times.  On the other hand, taking your iPod on vacation without your charger is a tad foolish - hardly Apple's fault!  I'm often discouraged to see people who post reviews on Amazon that are more to do with their own shortcomings rather than the product itself.  The 60GB Photo is my 2nd iPod.  Yes it's a little expensive, but I use it daily and find it to be a first rate MP3 player.

<Title>The BEST way to travel with pics and sounds!!
<Date>Mon Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased my iPod Photo for the express reason of taking it to Europe along with my digital camera, my girlfriend has dig cam also. This was our first trip abroad and 14 days in Italy we knew that we would be taking tons of pics and I didn't want to lug around my laptop, so I looked around and decided to get the 60 gig version. Before we left I added over 30 hrs of music, not much for some but more than enough for me. We ended up taking more than 2700 pics over that week and half and the iPod took them all in with no problems. I purchased Apples camera connector, $29? and the world travel adapter kit from Apple also, the travel adaptors allow you to simply change the style of plug that is on the power adaptor that comes with your iPod or your laptop for that matter, the cool thing is you don't need a power converter for your Apple products, just pop off the plug replace it with the one for the part of the world you are going to and you're set. With no problems I was able to plug it in and charge it all over Italy, and download all our pics from both cameras. So instead of having to keep an eye on a big bag with a laptop and worry about it being stolen I was able to keep my camera and my iPod in a fanny pack and I never had a worry. For those of you out there with high end digital cameras and you don't want to pack a laptop this is the way to go, Plenty of space for even large files. As for those folks that find the controls difficult all I can think is that they don't understand simple file formating and higherarchy.  One last thing, you can also use your iPod as an external hard drive to copy and transfer any files you want from one computer to another, and it's drive is big enough for anyone. I couldn't be happier, and like the engraving on the back of my iPod states "Travel is the Best Revenge"

<Content>I've used the iPod 60GB as a travel hard drive that I use to store digital images.  I found it to be very fast with the optional fire wire connection cable and very stable--it always works and had no difficulty taking 30 Gigs of images.  It's noiseless, had excellent design features, and is powered through the comptuer--another words 'invisible' when it should be.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product.

<Title>Finally a MP3 Player to Hold my Entire Collection!
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod series has gained an incredibly loyal following over the years. With the release of the iPod Photo 60 gig, Apple has created a machine that can hold entire music collections - and more.  For those of us who remember the days of giant 128mb MP3 players, to have a 60 gig small hand-held is just amazing. It is barely the size of a pack of cigarettes. The case is white plastic on the front and SHINY silver metal on the back, which will scratch in about .2 seconds unless you're careful. Be sure to buy a protector immediately.  Exercise enthusiasts will note that there ARE moving parts inside here - you can feel it buzz slightly when you do some file operations. It is more akin to a CD player than to a radio. If you are riding an exercise bike, this will be no problem. If you're jogging, that's another issue entirely. Active people should stick with flash memory style systems with no moving parts. Of course the funny part of this is that the commercials all show iPod users dancing around like maniacs.  You might wonder just how you could fill up 60 gig of space legally. Being a musician and friends of many musicians, I of course HIGHLY encourage you to pay for all of your music. It's only 99 cents a song - and you are helping to keep musicians fed and promoted. In any case, the iPod makes it easy to store what you've got. I can get about 3,000 songs in 10 gig. For a youngster just getting started in the work world, this might be a high achievement in CD ownership. But for most adults that I know, especially adults in a relationship, it is easy to have 300+ CDs in the house. You collect them over the years, as your musical interests change and new bands come out. This iPod finally lets you put all your music in one place and hit SHUFFLE. It is really cool to play music for days and days and have it all be different.  The photo aspect is really neat, too. The screen is 220 x 176 which gives you a nice resolution for most photos. There are hundreds of applications for this. You can carry photos of family and friends. You can carry photos of birds for birdwatching. You can carry trip photos. You can carry poison ivy identification photos when you camp. True, a very detailed image (say a class photo with 500 people in it) is going to be too tiny to see. But a nice well-done photo (say a Titmouse on a branch) will be perfect for your needs.  The interface is really easy to use and needs no manual. You slide up and down to choose an item, and click to accept it. There's a clock, calendar, contact manager, and fun games. I really like the 'music quiz' where it plays a snippet of one of your songs and makes you guess which one it is. Since you obviously loaded all the songs onto your iPod you would think this would be easy - but if you have a large library, it can be amazingly hard!  Best of all, recent price drops have made this all-around favorite surprisingly affordable. If you've got a decently sized collection of CDs, and some photos you'd love to carry with you, I highly recommend this device. It's well worth the price.

<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got my Ipod Photo 60GB 1 week ago from [...] Have been playing with it since.I love it. Box contains: - Ipod photo 60, AC Adapter and USB cable for charging/connect. Bought:  -Ipod Case - Belkin Sports Skin($12.54) @ walmart store..cheapest at the best price...other cases with same silicone were ridiculously $29.99 and up...! - Apple Audio-video cable from Apple Store...(other cables dont work, tried it. Bestbuy, Target and CircuitCity had not heard of this cable..can u believe it...Bestbuy said 3 yrs. they have not heard it...take our audio cables instead...no video..anyway!). - Apple camera connector @ Amazon - Car Cassette adapter @ Amazon (later found walmart has it cheaper!) - Griffin Ear Jams @ Amazon...(Apple headphones are useless without this!...you need this!) Hope this helps any one trying to decide on an MP3 player. And oh yes...No other MP3 player comes close to the simplicity and ease of use of Ipod....researched a lot of mp3 players....the only close runner-up was Toshiba Gigabeat....but realized later that an Ipod is after all an Ipod... About Podcasting and Ipods - a combination made in heaven. All in all love it!.

<Title>best yet for audible.books
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I was looking for a compatible mp3 player for my audible book downloads, it was months of looking.  I, of course, knew that the ipod could do it, but it was way out of my price range. I bought a rio player, it was not good enuff.  I bought a dell juke box, I LOVED it and still do, but found out that it couldn't do audible books (I have about 300 of them).  Then I got Nomad Zen Xtra. Now that was very nice unit and I liked it,  but I couldn't get very many books stored on it.  After having spent so much money on these devices I thought  "Why not get an ipod?".  So I looked at the selections of ipods and their reviews.  The photo ipod has the least negative reviews and contained lots of storage space. Also on Amazon it was cheaper.  The reviews are correct as to the problems and I have sworn several times at my ipod, but all in all with PATIENCE (sorry lousey in spelling)the ipod works fine. The music sounds good and the books come across great. One of the features I love is that you can speed up the narration without distorting the sound.  I can listen to a 6 hour book in approximately 4 hours for example.  You have to be very gentle with it and be well acquainted with the different menues. It has been a learning experience with me, and continues to be.  Best advice when the device seems dead (blank screen) and nothing revives it hold the "menu" key and center button down for 7 sec or more until apple design shows up. The instructions tell you to do it and you will find it most useful.  To reinterate: 1) best not for young children 2) best not for impatience people 3) excellent for audiophiles 4) design is perfect for holding 5) excellent for walking and running  Blair

<Title>Music Great ... Photos Contacts well sort of
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>True to its promise it is a great music player and the itunes software is intuitive and makes it easy to create playlists.  The enclosed earbuds are so-so - but it does work as promised, and in my case needed a large chunk of the 60GB though in total between photos and music using about 26GB - so unless you own 500+ cd's 60GB may be more than you need.  The photo bit works as promised but while the screen is sharp the pictures seem a tad fuzzy to me, and while the concept of a slideshow is nice not really using it that much.  Also haven't used the TV slideshow feature which would probably make me like the photo bit more.  I think there is a way to store the whole photo file not just a cut down version - so it becomes sort of a backup.  But I have too many photos to do that for.  I also bought it to store my contacts/calendar - and they make it sound easy.  Well perhaps for MAC users - but for a PC user regardless of my trying to use Palm Desktop or Outlook the contact feature doesn't seem to work and the process is horribly explained - just plain awful.  Also one note of caution - if you are going to carry it around in bag or pocket probably worth getting a cover/case.  Almost immediately I noticed a small scratch on the screen - I was obviously not being careful enough.  Unless you treat with kid gloves - get a cover.

<Title>Very happy with iPod Photo
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I selected the 60 GB iPod Photo mainly because I listen to a lot of [...]books. Also, the idea of loading all of my digital photos on a portable device was appealing. The audio books that I had previously downloaded for my Audible Otis player worked fine when loaded onto the iPod using iTunes for Windows. I also love the access to Podcasts from iTunes. Viewing pictures on the iPod screen is not too impressive, but when viewed on my 56" TV they are very bright and sharp. Playing music with the slide show is a nice feature. I found that it is necessary to use Photoshop Album to organize the pictures before downloading on to the iPod. Copying files directly from folders did not work very well since they are all deleted and reloaded any time you make a change. With Album, only the changes are downloaded. The camera adaptor from Apple worked fine with my Panasonic FZ10 camera USB cable. The photos are stored in a file on the iPod disk for copying to your computer. The photos from the camera can be viewed on the iPod screen, but they cannot be displayed on a TV until they are imported from the PC using iTunes. I currently have about 938 songs and 4663 pictures on the iPod using about 8 GB of storage. The only problem I encountered during the initial setup was the requirement to update the system to the Windows format. It was necessary to reboot my computer after this to get iTunes to recognize the iPod. Also, I have noticed that the iPod has reset itself a few times and one time I had to force a reset after it stopped responding. The rewind button does not seem work reliably with the Audible books and it often loses the bookmark when I return to continue listening. Overall, I am very happy with the iPod Photo.

<Title>Great deal
<Date>Mon Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 60 gb ipod photo about 4 months ago, and I have been loving it ever since.  I not only use it as a portable player, but use it in my car so that I never have to buy or burn a cd ever again.  I also got an fm tuner so that when I'm at my house, or at a party, I can listen to any song on any radio.    I also have loaded pictures on it, and they look great.  All you do is hook it up to any tv with output jacks and your ready to go.  You can make slide shows on there through your computer and put songs to them.  I have seen people spend a lot of money for slide shows with music on them for weddings and many other things.  The quality that you have is better than any vhs that amy company could make.  It is dvd quality.  I think that if you are debating whether to get this or some other brand, I would go for the ipod.  Now they have a 40 gb ipod photo, just in case you don't think that you will need this much space.

<Title>Great, not Perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Yeah, its an iPod." Then you get to boast about the 60 GB and that wears thin pretty fast. But you have to admit its a damn good looking player. You've read the millions of reviews so I'll only bore you with my thoughts:  $450 and no case? The dock may have been low on the list of usefulness, but come on Apple... this thing scratches if you look at it hard. So the REAL price of this player is more like $490 after you get the required case.  It takes a day to get used to the controls. My wife was so frustrated she tossed it aside and never looked back. The controls are simplified to the point of complexity. Menu is power on (but not power off, that's Play/Pause) but its also back... You get used to it, but I wouldn't sell it as a feature.  The EQ is worthless. I found that ROCK works best and everything else sounds muffled or distorted. It's also a pain to browse EQ settings for the currently playing song. You have to navigate back a couple of menus then into settings then spin down to EQ. After selecting an EQ setting, you drop back to the settings menu. If you don't like that EQ setting, you have to go back into the EQ menu and start the dance all over. Why cant the EQ settings apply live as I spin down them? The song will end before you have time to try them all...  Everyone loves the touch wheel and so do I until you realize you don't remember the group, you have 7800 songs and the one you are looking for begins with a "Z". After about 15 fast laps around the touch wheel it does accelerate, but I wish there was a faster way...  The battery life for me is pretty much as Apple stated. I am concerned that sometime next year after the warranty expires the battery will go poof and die. Apple hasn't done a good job making people like me feel better about the longevity of an iPod. Still, I did take a chance.  I like the Album art when playing. When I used to play CD's (or god bless - my vinyl), I would always have the cover there with me to look at. Something feels more natural having it displayed.   All in all, if you can convince yourself that a portable music player should cost $450/$490 then this is definitely one of the best ones to get, even with its quirks.

<Title>The truth for prospective buyers
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife bought me this for my birthday.  I noticed that some of my cds were deteriorating, and wanted to digitize my library.  My friends raved about this gizmo so she obliged me.  Here is the whole story.  This is a marvelous invention, one actually fortunate consequence of our technology mania outside of the medical field.  That being said, it has flaws.  To use Apples Lossless Encoder which recreates cd quality sound, you will not get anywhere near 15,000 songs, more like 4-6000 max.  Next, ITunes sucks.  Pardon my crassness, but you need to have a mirror version of what is on your IPod on your pc for maximum enjoyment, ease of organization, auto-synch, or other benefits extolled by Apple.  In short, if you have a huge library and would like to digitize and preserve the master copies in storage, take this into account.  Itunes must be a revelation if you have a mini or a shuffle, but if you are condidering an IPod this large, it gets unwieldy.  I had to buy a 100 gig external hardrive to send the music too (since I will probably get a new pc soon and don't feel like transferring the songs).  I am sure that any 5 year old or high school student can provide a go around or a better way to use technology, but if you are an audio-nut but not a computer-nut, this gadget is as close to perfect as it gets.

<Content>I bought my iPod Photo 60GB last week and it gave me a lot of problems from the start.   I charged the battery for over 5 hrs until fully charged and 5 mins later the ipod was telling me to charge again saying the battery was empty.  I got a new replacement within 3 days and charge the battery to full.  The next day I was listening to my ipod for almost 2hrs & 15 mins and the battery icon was down to red meaning the battery was almost empty.  This didn't make me happy at all when the ipod was suppose to last anywhere from 12-15 hrs.  I will return the 2nd ipod I got from Amazon.  Too bad....I really wanted to keep it, but with the battery trouble....I'm returning it.

<Title>Unacceptible
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My music collection spans well over 5000 songs, very close to 6000. The ID3 tags in my collection are an utter mess.  Some songs are from Japan and their ID3 tags have the original kanji for their title/artist/album.  Some of the artist tags are mispelled, which makes an extra entry in the artist list which makes lists longer and finding specific songs harder.  Some songs just don't have any tags in the artist/album field at all.  For a library as large as mine, I use a broad genre>artist>album nested format, which means I never have to look at more than 50 choices at a time and I can use any folder manipulation to make broad changes instead of having to find id3 tag editors and correcting each and every file.  Unfortunately, I have to abandon all of this and spend countless hours fixing all 3000 or so incorrect tags if I want to get any usefulness out of my ipod. Singles, normally stored away in their own folder just for such, instead add an extra entry to the artist or album lists just for one or two songs.  To add icing on the cake, there doesn't seem to be any meaningful manipulation of the music library possible with the ipod itself.  If you messed up a playlist, you're stuck with it until you can get to a computer.  There's an "on the go" playlist that can be built with the ipod itself, but that's about the extent of its usefulness.  It'd otherwise be a nice, stylish and compact player, but there's no way to make use of 60 gigs with an interface this clunky.

<Content>The Ipod is great only when you are being around your house or the car. What about people, who are going camping, or flying overseas (the charger is not compatible with 220V) The battery is not removable!!!   I went on vacation and forgot my charger. Boy was I disappointed especially finding out that I didn't charge the unit before I left.  Apple did not make the battery removable at least I could buy an extra one, like Treo 650 a cell phone and MP3 player. After a year or two the rechargeable battery needs to be replaced with the new one by sending the unit to Apple. Is Apple moving back to 30 years old technology??? I am sure that a lot of people thinking about it, but they are still buying Ipods because of the marketing and good sound of the unit.

<Title>Warning about the Ipod
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I started to get an error that state that Itunes can't read to or write form the Disk meaning the Ipod itself. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. This was very upsetting to me as I have had this item for less than a year. I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not. So, this is a warning to all Ipod owners of this potential problem.

<Title>iScratch: Tale of ipod woe.  Caveat Empor!
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, after wanting an Ipod for years, and years, and scrimping up enough money to afford the $550 price tag (because you can't have *just the ipod* - you need the dock, the warranty, and a radio converter as well for the car), I received this unit on March 13th.  This is the fifth generation IPOD, the biggest seller Apple has, and the subject of so many glowing reviews it's hard to find one that isn't.  However, my experience was one that countered everything I had read.  An experience that brought me to the deepest darkest layers of consumer disappointment, and I checked - it wasn't buyers remorse.  These units are pretty.  Actually, they're gorgeous.  The controls are a little weird, but once you get used to it, it does make sense (there is no "stop", only " for pause and > for play, in one button.  Overall, I'm impressed by the product design.  What amazed me however was that my ipod arrived with a scratch on it.  No kidding.  Just a small one, below the wheel.    But that wasn't the half of it.  I own a nice car.  It has expensive leather seats.  I put the ipod face down in my car, which was clean, and drove to the store.  Upon arrival, about 10 minutes later, I picked it up, and saw a glistening on the surface.  This short trip has given this $400 mp3 player, the king of it's product category, a nice even layer of scratches all across the surface.  After more research on Google (a search for "my ipod is scratched" reveals class action lawsuits), I discovered that my dream device does, in fact, suffer from an achilles heel - it scratches easier and faster than a hip-hop DJ in NYC.  And not just little scratches either.  Some of these were annoying, high visibility scratches.  Now, what I want to know is, "Why does a $400 top-of-the-line, 5th generation (5th!) mp3 player scratch?  Especially when my $50 TIMEX watch, which also has a plastic cover, most especially does not, and has not after 2 years of active lifestyle battering.  How can a company that creates such magical devices leave such an important detail unhandled?  To Apples credit, after I explained that I wasn't as much dissatisfied as profoundly disappointed, they eventually did give me an RMA number for a return.  But it was only after three calls, a couple of emails, and the generosity of one exceptionally nice woman that it happened.  Overall, my experience with the Ipod was of profound disappointment.  I would highly recommend staying away from this device unless you're willing to watch it's quality degrade steadily and rapidly.    Beyond the scratching, which is insane for a fifth generation product by any company, the product was an excellent mp3 player.    I hope Apple gets it together, because I definitely expected better from the company.

<Title>Do Not Buy iPods
<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned two iPods.  The original that came out a several years back, and now one of these new 60GB Photo iPods.  I had repeated problems witht he first one.  I had to have it REPLACED 3 times before the warranty expired, then it continued to degrade, and wascompletely useless with in 2 years of the original purchase date.  After a while, I was told by sales associates at the Apple stores how much the product had improved, and they assured me that the problems I had experienced previously were rectified, so I tried another one.  I have had mine less than a year and absolutely hate it.  It is nothing but problems.  The same problems as previously do exist, although to a lesser degree, BUT there are at least ten new problems from the one I had previously.  I will never buy an iPod again.  The product is cheaply engineered and made, and is not worth the extreme price tag.  I would only value it at $50, as that is how long it will last.

<Title>iPod is an excellent and elegant tool
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This (60 Gb iPod Photo) is my second iPod (the first, a G4 40Gb was pickpocketed from my napsack in the NYC subway - beware) and I've had it over a year.  Looking over the spate of recent negative reviews here prompted me to respond.  Most of the shrieking pans and drooling raves are divorced from reality.  I think it's important to point out that iPod is a tool and only a tool - a portable music player - a compact digital device with much in common with a laptop computer.  It is highly configurable and the user has many choices about how to encode music - which affects the final results a great deal.    1) About scratching.  The front of the iPod is shiny plastic. You'll need to put it in a protective case.  There is an extremely lively aftermarket.  I bought a nice silicon case with a compliant plastic panel that covers the display for $12 on Ebay.  It does the trick and a year later my iPod looks like new if I take it out of the case.  A protective case must be considered manditory for an iPod.  That's it - now get over it.  2) All hard drive based devices of any kind - iPods included -  have limited G-force tolerance.  If you jog, it will go into protection - (the music stops and unit appears paused until you hit "play" again).  If you drop it while it's running, you might kill it - or cause disk damage that will require a reformat.  If you want a player for jogging or sporting (skiing, skateboarding etc...) buy a Nano or a shuffle or competing solid state player.  Memory chips have no moving parts and don't suffer these limitations.  They just have the size limitation.  3) All electronic devices are subject to RF interference - especially digital devices.  The iPod has a nice metal body shield, but it can crash when taken near power lines, radio transmitters etc...  4) Sonically all MP3 players will vary in quality based on how much encryption you choose to use.  For best sound use a high bit rate (192K or above).  Apple offers proprietary schemes that offer higher performance.  Competing open standards exist for just about every format Apple has cooked up.  Is this skeevy of Apple?  Perhaps.  It's similar to what Microsoft did on computers.  Love it or hate it - it's part of the whole Apple experience.  I use Apple's lossless compression and it works seamlessly with iTunes and yields wonderful high quality rips.  Are they portable with any other deivce than the iPod?  No.  Do they work with any software other than iTunes?  No.  Am I complaining?  Not yet!  I personally think the iTunes software is the best software and the iPod is the best player.  Down the road if the proprietary format limits me from doing something I want to do I might start complaining.  Life is full of compromises and choices.  5) You must turn off equalization if you care about sound quality.  Sadly this is true of every portable digital player currently extant in the world.  I was expecting better with Apple - but it's not so.  Every single equalization setting introduces audible distortion that ruins the experience for an audiophile like me.  With EQ set to off I get wonderful sound.    6) About reliability and dealing with broken players - portable electronics take a lot of abuse.  Laptops have shorter warranty periods than desktops because rapidly spinning hard drives don't tolerate motion well.  This is exactly the situation in the ipod.  It's a tough environment for a hard drive.  There is a lively after-market for hard drive replacement services.  Ambitious folks can buy cheap replacement hard drives on the open market and fix/upgrade their iPods.  Sure you'll scratch the case getting it open - but it's better than a dead iPod.  Battery life issues - same situation.  If you like to tinker you can do this for little cost.  If you are paying for the service it becomes more justifiable to just buy a new unit.  Is this cost effective?  Nope.  But if you become addicted to the wonderfuly lifestyle of having one of these players - you'll do it.  7) Audible distortion of the Photo iPod becasue of the video jack?  Maybe on early units.  I have one and don't have any audible distortion when the EQ is off.  This unit sounds noticeably better than my 40GB G4 iPod did.  It has better battery life too.  8) What about music services?  It's a totally personal opinion - but I don't recommend buying music on iTunes or any other service.  They all pretty much use relatively severe mp3 compression.  Buy the CDs and get full resolution.  Then rip at your choice of compression.  That way you have a full backup and you get all the music you pay for.  I also feel that music appreciation sometimes takes time.  There are many songs on albums that I didn't initally like, but grew to love over time simply because I had them because they were on the album with some more accessible hit.  If we only buy the hits - we never get to know the more difficult songs and we end up shallower.  I'll confess I'm a dyed in the wool audiophile - the kind who hangs sonex on his walls and puts specially made sound reflecting pillows on his ceiling.  I'm also, like a lot of audiophiles, opposed to digital equipment in general and prefer the warmer fuller sound of analog sources (like my very tricked out turntable).  That being said - the system that shows you the most is the one you use most often - and for me that is the portable.  For years I had high-end cassette tape walkmen, then portable CD players of various stripes.  The iPod completely blows away all previous portables by a WIDE margin.  The iPod sounds way better than most stand-alone CD players - the sonics are comparable to a really good DVD player playing CDs.  This is a killer sounding portable when used with lossless compression, and etymotic ER-6 headphones.  It has better resolution than my big rig (Rocksan Xerxes turntable, Audio Research pre and amp, and ProAc Repsonse speakers).  Granted this is digital - so the highs are more brittle and there's less warmth and depth.  This is highly dependent on source material.  Recent recordings by good engineers sound great - through the headphones or played on a stereo system with a good cord via a line out from the cradle.   I get around 1500 songs - about 135 albums worth on my 60gb.  The iPod is high enough sonically that it can function as my test source for critical listening of back-end components or sharing music with audiophile friends at their house (on their big rigs).  This "library" aspect is the biggest feature of the iPod - and is really life changing.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  My main complaint with the iPod is with the headphones.  The included headphones are not adequate for musically satisfying listening.  I recommend Grado or Etymotic headphones (even the bottom of the line ones).  You don't need a separate headphone amp - unless you source material is unusually low volume.  "Earbud" type phones are all garbage - avoid them like the plague.  Other than that - I'm a really happy camper with the iPod!

<Title>The return of the master...
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was the next logical step in the evolution of the iPod: a color screen. While this was an expected step, most rumor sites were predicting the latest incarnation of Apple's market leading music player to bridge into video, which was saved for the full-blown fifth gen iPod. Instead, Apple opted for a simple addition to take advantage of the color screen and its capabilities. You can also display images on an external monitor should you decide you want to go that route...  Out of the box, you get the iPod, the docking station, 1394 (FireWire) and USB 2.0 cables, A/V adapter cable, ear buds, carrying sack, and a case with belt clip and power adapter. We would have liked slightly longer connection cables, since the 3.5 ft. cables are stretched to their limits if your tower is placed under a desk. Also, the power adapter has to be used with the FireWire cable. We would have liked both USB and FireWire ports for charging on the road (not all laptops have FireWire ports). The carrying sack is largely useless. The material feels low quality, and the functionality is the same as the case with belt clip. While it may provide slightly better scratch protection, we recommend that users buy a third party case.  One of the unique features, and a major selling point for the iPod photo, is the availability of a 60GB version. Even if you don't want to take advantage of the photo capabilities, there are simply no other players as small as the iPod photo and with this amount of storage capacity.  I was able to fill the full 60GB in close to 4 hours using the FireWire connection; not bad at all. Battery life is advertised at 15 hours however we were able to get close to 10 with the volume cranked up 3/4 of the way.  The photo functionality adds a new level of flexibility. Users can display slideshows to music, browse thumbnails and with the purchase of a third party add on, plug their camera's flash memory in to the iPod photo to offload pictures. In addition, color album art images appear in the Now Playing screen. We can see some die hard shutterbugs really taking advantage of the photo storage features, but curiously missing is support for the RAW picture format. While this won't be a concern to most people, we expect to see it in a future update with Apple's recent inclusion of the format in their iPhoto software. Photo synchronization is handled by Adobe Photoshop Album. Rather than add a slew of ports to the industrial design marvel, video output is handled by a single adapter cord, consisting of composite video out and stereo RCA leads. The dock also sports a s-video output and a stereo headphone jack.   Music playback quality is great. Most of our test MP3s were encoded at 320Kbps and sounded far superior to similar iRiver products. One sound quality gripe I had was the lack of deeper bass. Some sites have posted ways around this problem, but they require transcoding the MP3s and lowering the volume by 30-40%. I used the stock ear buds, and found them on par with other bundled ear buds, which is to average. Audiophiles will want to use their own set of head phones. I tested the sound quality with the Shure E2Cs, Sennheiser HD580s and Bose QuietComfort headphones. The iPod had no problem driving any of them, although the QuietComfort had to be switched to the Hi volume mode. There have been complaints in the past about a humming while the drive is accessed. I held the unit while it fetched data, and could hear no artifacts. I would like to see a user configurable equalizer, although there are plenty of EQ settings to choose from.  The user interface followed the tried and true iPod interface that hasn't changed significantly since the first generation. I would still like the display to show more information about the music files playing, such as bit rate, graphical EQ, and perhaps next song title optional for tech-heads, myself included. Also, quicker access to the shuffle feature and EQ settings would be a plus, as well as an option to keep the backlight on when docked.  I had two issues with the iPod photo. The first was the increase in width. The iPod Photo is slightly thicker than the 40GB 4G iPod, which is slightly thicker than the 20GB iPod, rendering most third party cases and add on docks useless. My second problem was with the iTunes software. While I loved the easy browsing, filtering, and playlist creation, there were several technical issues. My iPod would never stop displaying the "Do Not Disconnect" screen when iPod photo was plugged in or if the computer was restarted. For some reason, opening and closing iTunes fixed this. Just a minor point, though.  Overall, the iPod photo is an all around great performer. The sound quality is first rate, the battery performance is excellent, and the storage capacity mammoth. While the ability to make slideshows won't appeal to every one, the color screen and higher capacity model will draw many people to this miniscule music marvel. Windows users should prepare to encounter some minor software issues, but most are well documented. iTunes is a breeze to use and offers great music organization features as well as the easiest playlist creation you can ask for.

<Title>Good mp3 player
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my iPod with photo for about 18 months.  I purchased it at best buy and purchased their extended warranty, which I would not normally do, and I'm very glad I did this time.  About a month ago it gave me the iPod 'sick face'.  Apparently the hard drive went bad.  I baby my electronics, and I see no reason why it should have failed.  I took it back to best buy and they replaced the hard drive under my warranty for free and mailed it back to me in about a week.  Works fine now.  Overall, I would say that it is a good player, but as with anything that has a hard drive, it's rather delicate.  Take good care of it, and buy a warranty anyway.  The 60 GB model isn't enormous, but can be a bit bulkey in your pocket.  It sounds great, but the headphones that Apple ships with the iPod are terrible, unless you like elevator music.  Battery life is tolerable, but comparing that my cell phone lasts longer than my iPod on a single charge, I think that Apple could work the power management a little more.  The only other problem I can see is the price of it.  Very expensive, in comparison to other devices with comparable features.  My 1-5 ratings: Features: 4 Look and size: 5 Durability: 3 Capacity for size: 4 Battery Life: 3.5 Audio Quality: 5 Additional accessories: 3 Price: 2 Overall rating: 3.7

<Title>Best Product EVER!!!!
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>To be my first encounter with an Apple Product, the experience is the best. From picture resolution to sound quality - five stars are not enough. If you have a presentation or just want to record your pictures to a DVD, just need to plug in (must buy the cable but is only $19.00) and burn your pictures along with the music you like. Bore and want to do more than listen to music - IT COME WITH GAMES!!!! A little bit in price but it can be use in many ways... as a hard disk, music load, picture manage, etc....   My only critic is to the program that came with the iPod. If you don't have an Apple Machine, does not give you the biggest range to manage your music in terms of how you will like to see it in the screen, specially if is downloaded from the net... but very easy to use... If you are going for it, aim for the 60GB.

<Title>Make sure you get the protection plan!
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just a heads up to whoever is buying an iPod.  Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan into the cost of the iPod.  If your iPod fails after the warranty expires (mine failed two weeks after the end of the warranty period), it is essentially worthless.  Apple's only service option is to send them the failed unit and $255 + tax and they will send you a USED (no guarantee it is even refurbished) replacement with a 90 day warranty.  In other words you are far better off just buying a new one when the old one fails.  Makes the $60 protection plan sound really good.

The full color screen has decent resolution and makes for a handy, portable photo album.  I also am starting to experiment with it's use as a storage unit for photoshop documents.  If you have a need for multi-purpose unit, this is the one for you.  My only caveat would be to the buyer seeking purely a music player; you probably don't need this one, you could most likely settle for a smaller, cheaper model.

<Content>Hi everyone!  I'm living proof that you really can get an ipod for free.  Not here to market my links though, on to my review!   This thing has changed my life.  I added the iTrip to it so now I can play through any stereo equipped with a radio (including my shower radio!).  The battery life has been great. I only need to charge it every other day and I listen to it all day at work and sometimes when I'm sleeping.   If I could make one suggestion - when you're listning to a song and press menu - artist - I'd prefer it to land on the artist you are currently listening to.  That's my only gripe - when you fill up your ipod (and mine's close) it can be a pain to scroll through all of the artists when you hear something on random that you like!    Any questions - IM me: WinterGetsMe   Thanks and vote for my review!

<Title>What a complete utter disaster!
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading all the reviews and thinking towards the future with a fourth generation I-Pod, I personally felt that I was making the ultimate choice in MP3 quality!  In addition, I paid for the genre to be loaded on this electronic marvel...So, all toll it was a significant investment, very significant!    I have had it for three weeks and the unit froze completely.  With all 300 songs lost and the investment gone!  It performed great for three weeks!  What a disaster of unequalled proportion!  Luckily, I had not yet reached the thirty days yet, but the songs and genre were all lost.  Luckily again, I used a company that stored all my songs on a hard drive and it can be reloaded again for the second time, more expense.  So, in short do I feel comfortable transferring all my cd's to this I-Pod - NOPE - - -   Just make sure when using I-Tunes that you create a library and back everything up on a hard drive or you will be as frustrated as I am.  Many have not taken the time to back up music files thinking that their I-Pod would have more resilliance!!!!

<Title>practical tool for presenters, photographers and music junkies
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple advertises the 60GB model as able to hold 15,000 songs - this is (as they state) based on a 4 minute average per song. Most people retort, "I'll never have 15,000 songs!" This may be true, but you can still quickly fill up this puppy.  I have fewer than 5,000 audio files on my 60GB and it those files take up over 32GB of space. The reason? I have thousands of songs, but I have hundreds of spoken word files (lectures, etc.), and a few dozen audio books and foreign language instruction audio files.  I also got the Griffin Technologies iTalk (also available here on Amazon) so I can record interviews or "notes to self" on the fly with my iPod. So, not only will it store your audio, it can also record new audio when you're miles away from your computer.  All iPods from the Shuffle on up to this 60GB are hot swappable hard drives. You can attach this to any PC or Mac and drag-n-drop files onto your iPod for portable storage.  These hard drives don't spin as fast as a typical portable hard drive, so you don't want to run applications from it, but as storage devices, the iPod rocks!  For a digital photographer, the usefulness cannot be understated. I bought a Belkin card reader (also available from Amazon) to plug into my iPod Photo. Now, when I'm shooting an event, I can have one of my CF cards downloading onto my iPod in full resolution while I'm using the other card to take photos and can swap these out all day long. I've done this before with my iBook, but an iPod is much easier to carry around and this 60GB iPod trumps the 30GB drive on my 12" iBook!  Travelling for business and need to do a powerpoint presentation? Why schlep a computer and an EnFocus machine when you can just bring your iPod Photo and a matching doc and AV cables?  You can make slides into JPG files and put them into an album on your iPhoto. You can select different wipes and transitions and using the dock, you can connect to any TV using an S-Video and audio splitter cable, using your iPod as the "remote" or you can attach a remote to the iPod and have a wireless remote.  Now that the iPod (and iTunes) supports podcasting and cool features like speeding through an audio file to specific spot and speeding up or slowing down audio books without changing the pitch.  My less than perfect rating is for a number of reasons:  1.) Why there is no power adapter included is beyond me. People travel with their iPods and not everyone wants to travel with their computer, too, just to charge their iPods. 2.) No longer including the dock is a real mistake - especially on the iPod Photo. 3.) No longer includes a free case, either... and it is slim-pickin's to find a case that will fit the 60GB. It's easy to find cases that will fit the 20GB model, but there are few classy cases to select from for the 60GB model. The iPods scratch when you blink too fast in front of them - they need a case for protection! 4.) No video support. This is just ridiculous. If it can support wipes & transitions, it should be able to handle video. If the Mac is indeed the digital hub that Jobs claims it is, let's prove it! I can create movies w/ iMovie, but why can't I carry them with me to show them off?  Apple seriously needs to come out with a video capable model. I was an early adapter... I bought the first 5GB iPod years ago when it too, was $400. From that first day of ownership, I have been telling my friends that Apple needs to turn it into a phone/PDA. Apple created the first PDA, the Newton - it's time to put that technology back into our hands.   I love my iPod, but the line needs some improvements.

<Content>I've got 1400 songs, 3300 photos, and a bunch of podcasts on it so far and that adds up to only 10GB.  The remaining space might come in handy if I decide to enable disk mode and start using it as an external harddrive.  Being able to see the album art (which I copy from Amazon's site) is a cool feature.      Warning:  You will spend a lot of money on accessories.  It is addictive.  I've bought the Marware Sport Convertible case, a firewire PC card for my laptop, a firewire cable, and I am going to buy custom made ear buds (~$75) from my friendly neighborhood audiologist.  The ear buds that it comes with don't stay in when I run.  I think I'm going to need something to play it in my car too.  Bad:  iPod only comes with a USB cable.  My laptop only has USB 1.1 ports, which work but are really slow.  I bought a USB 2.0 PC card.  Doesn't work at all with the iPod.  Apple's discussion boards have a lot of people that are having similar issues.  Luckily my PC card also has a firewire port.  I had to buy a firewire cable though.  It works great.

<Content>I like carrying my photos around with me.  And it does the job well.  However, in order to display the photos to a TV/monitor (to truly get the maximum viewing pleasure), you'll need to cough up another $20 for the A/V cable.  At least the iPod has this feature - some other photo-capable MP3 players I've researched could only display on the native display.  Still, you would think Apple couple throw this in - seriously, how much does it cost to manufacture these things, 5 stinking bucks or so?  And other photo/MP3 players have more features, such as built-in voice recorders, FM radio, and user accessible batteries.  Ultimately, I wanted the ability to output the photos, which I'm glad I did.  Also, some minor glitches in playback - every so often another song from another playlist would mysteriously "hiccup" on for a split second, and then continue with the selected playlist.  Rare, but it happens.

<Content>It's a good item, the only problem is that it gets scratched verry easy. Amazon should recomend a though skin guard at the time of purchase.
