<Product Name>Creative Zen Nano 512MB Red
<Title>Awesome and doesn't break like Ipods
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 12 year old daughter teased me when I purchased this "Ipod knock-off" as she called it, but I am the one laughing now.  She is on her second Ipod (and is ready to purchase a third because the second one doesn't work now either), and my Zen Nano just plays and plays. I have never had the "freezing" problems that she has. The LCD screen is small, but then again you are paying less than half of the price of an Ipod and you know that going in.  It holds more songs than I know and it never breaks. LOVE IT!  
<Overall>5
