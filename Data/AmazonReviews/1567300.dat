<Title>Highly recommed!
<Date>Sun Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>My husband bought me the Panasonic SV-SD50 awhile ago.  I love it! First of all, it is extremely small so I can easily put it in my pocket when I work out. Sound quality is excellent and the headphones that come with it are really good.  Most headphones that come with products are not worth anything, but these are pretty good. Do not know anything about customer service on this product - have not had to use it.  I have had no problems with it at all.  The Panasonic SV-SD50 is a good mp3 player in my opinion.

<Title>Pros and Cons
<Date>Wed Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a cool little gadget. The pros are that it is small, very powerful for it's size and great looking. The cons are that it only works with RealONE, the unit is way too light making it rather flimsy (so don't ever drop it). There is not belt clip or anything so it's either in your pocket or around your neck (ugh).

<Title>Im a transformed man...
<Date>Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Well, I must say that it took me a while before I decided to switch over to the mp3 player. I have about 6 gig's worth of music on my computer and it was about time to because I have about 500 burnt CD's that I lose track of...Anyways, this mp3 thing is quite revolutionary, and by the rapid decline of prices, it will become the new music media for the next generation. First I have to say that they state the size of this thing, but that does not do it justice. It is so small and light. I have showed it to most of my(cd listening) friends, and I nor they could believe how small it was. It has been a month now and I could not be more pleased. It is nothing short of revolutionary. And I do not work for Panasonic. But one of the main reasons I bought it was because of their past performance with me. I own a few panasonic devices. I even have a home stereo from them that survived an apt. fire(except for the cd player-ironic?), and it still sounds wonderful. Panasonic seems to have competitve prices and keeps putting out quality products. This player also comes with a separate SDMMC Card drive ( for all those that dont understand all the new terminology-compactflash-smartmedia-etc., picture a very small floppy disc-postage stamp size-that holds 30 times more data than an old floppy-wow!!) and<br>a 64 meg SDMMC card.The sound is great, but buy some good quality sony headphones and sound becomes exceptional. When I run or ride my bike I am basically in another dimension while I blast my music (cheesy line but true), and the AAA battery has lasted more than 3 weeks at loud levels. There are only two drawbacks to this miracle of a music player. The Software-Real One attempts to monopolize your system upon installation, feel free to ask me questions on how to avoid this-and it only comes with a neck strap. This player would be more than perfect with a beltclip or an arm strap, and a radio tuner. But hopefully that will be in next year's model! And one more thing, I dont know why there is almost no advertising for MP3 players at local electronics stores with over 100 on the market. Perhaps because of the whole controversy of copyright infringement and ease of file trading with MP3's. ...

<Title>Pretty Good Product!!
<Date>Fri Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I received this as a Christmas gift and had doubts about its claims. I did have problems with the installation of RealOne. It seemed to have seriously slowed down my system initially but 8 hrs later I had it working like a charm. It automatically converts your CD WAV files into AAC format but I especially like the WMA format at 128kbps. Sound quality is great! It looks great and above all is easy to use. The only downside is the neon transcolored looking neck strap. I'm a bit embarrassed to wear this thing to the gym. So I'll have to buy an aftermarket arm strapped case. It comes with 64MB SD media. The larger sized disks are pricing so I'll wait until the price drops. Overall, it is definitely a good value I recommend it.

<Title>Like it - but don't like the RealOne software
<Date>Wed Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really like this unit - but find it incredible that I have to use RealOne software (read &quot;AdWare&quot;)to transfer my tunes.<br>Sound is great, unit is small, love the &quot;hold&quot; button feature.<p>Just lose RealOne and it would be so much better.

<Title>Very Good player; absolutely appalling software
<Date>Thu May 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The sound quality is excellent, the player works beautifully and it's easy to use. BUT getting your music onto the memory card is painful. You can ONLY do it with RealOne's software - you can't drag and drop an mp3 file to the card. The RealOne software is buggy, slow and takes over your PC. It took a good deal of time to reset my PC back to how it should work with the music file associations as I like it and adverts removed.<p>Using RealOne is a pain. It frequently fails to transfer the music, giving unhelpful error messages so you have to keep clicking the &quot;transfer&quot; button until eventually it succeeds in transferring the music over. And when you get a new memory card, formatting it takes forever because RealOne keeps failing. You have to click &quot;format&quot; over and over until eventually it works.<p>At first, I thought it was a problem with my PC but if you check out the online forums, you'll find the problems I mention are common.
