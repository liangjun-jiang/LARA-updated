<Content>I did not purchase this unit, but I had recently purchased a similar Coby 20gb player over the internet.  I received the unit not working, and after hassling with the company that I purchased it from, I returned it to Coby directly.  After months of waiting for a replacement, that one didn't work either.  It was a beautiful product, but the packageing did not make the machine work. I never got Coby to return phone calls to return the second unit. I will not purchase any Coby product again. Buyer beware!!!
