<Title>Best portable music player I've owned
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, the Cowon D2 is for people who like technical gadgets, and will enjoy fiddling with sound settings, playlists, etc.  It really works best as a music player--it will play a wide variety of formats, including FLAC (lossless) and OGG files, which provides better sound (for a given file size) than the MP3 format.  It has a bright, realistic tone, but the built-in equalizer, Mach3bass enhancement, and other sound settings allow you to modify the sound considerably.    It also plays video well, although because of the small screen you probably don't want to watch feature-length movies on it.  It works well as a voice recorder; I record meetings on a regular basis.    The FM radio works well, but with a weak station signal you must arrange the player carefully and not move it.    It can store your pictures and the display looks great, but this function isn't as well-implemented.  It takes awhile to move from one picture to the next.  You can only zoom in two fixed zoom levels.  Pros:  Expandability (SD card), fantastic sound, drag-and-drop file management in Windows, good video playback.  Cons:  Although the stock earbuds are better than those provided by many other makers of portable players, you'll probably want to pick up better headphones.  Learning to convert your videos to play on the D2 can be intimidating (though not impossible).

<Title>Easy to Use, Great to Listen To!

<Content>I'm a 46 year old mom who decided to buy myself an MP3 player as a Christmas present from my family to me! I've never before owned one but my sons own IPODS...  I spent several weeks researching various MP3 players to see which got the best reviews, etc. I was especially looking for a product with an FM radio, one which had a good battery life, and overall one which would be pleasant looking and durable. I also wanted one which could charge using either the USB port on the computer or an AC adapter.  I finally decided on this COWON D2 and I couldn't be happier! I purchased the red one and absolutely love it!  It is extremely easy for me, a non-techy person, to load songs and pictures on it, and it's easy to navigate and find just what I'm looking for.  My teenage children and their friends have all commented on what a great MP3 player I have, and needless to say, some have said they wished they had something like mine rather than their IPODs! I would definitely recommend this COWON D-2 to anyone searching for an MP3 player.

<Title>Really Great Little Player!!
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is truly a great little player, about the size of a deck of cards. I use it as music player only, so I can't comment on the video functions. The Cowon D2 has the best sound by far of all the MP 3 players I own. Get rid of the stock earbuds and get a nice set of earbuds. The touch screen is a bit of a novelty, but it functions well. I also like the fact that I can use an SD card for expansion. Very good product! I see this great little player is discounted now. Buy! Buy! Buy!
