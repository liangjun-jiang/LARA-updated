<Title>GREAT MP3 player!!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had one of these for 10 months and I love it! I use it often and it has never given me any problems! Great sound and user friendly. My daughter has an ipod. Although the Zen Nano I have is not as powerful, I still prefer it. If you don't want to shuck out the money for an ipod, don't buy one of the cheap MP3 players. I would highly reccommend the Zen Nano!

<Title>Great  MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for well over a year and still love it. I have taken it boating, camping, shopping, bike riding, hiking, and it still works. I also have gotten it wet twice. I am rough on things, as you can see. I liked it so much, I bought one for my husband and daughter.  It has all the features more expensive MP3 players have, except bigger screen, but cost a lot less. My daughter likes the radio. I just like to take mine shopping so I can ignore all the "Mom, can I get...".My husband uses his at work, and enjoys having all his music. I would reccomend it. It is a great buy.

<Title>My new best friend, but for how long?
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this about 2 weeks now, and I'm really happy with it.  I was able to use all the advertised features within minutes of opening it up.  I also downloaded all my music using the drag-and-drop feature which is a must-have if you don't want some proprietary software converting all your files and then deleting them (I've had this happen!)  Most of the files I have are ripped from CD using software for the Zen Stone since I had some problems finding anything simple for the Zen Nano Plus. The radio is better than the one in my car, and recording both the radio and lectures is very straightforward.  There's only one minor problem with this player (for the price) and that's it's shoddy case.  Don't get me wrong, it's the right size and heft, but within one day the plastic crevices were caked in dust and it looked like the two halves are trying their hardest to split apart.  I might have to duck tape it together because I want this player to last me at least a couple years.

<Title>Few complaints for this economic MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my Zen Nano over a year ago from an overstock-type site for around 35 dollars.  I can't recall exactly but it may have been an open-box return, which might explain the only problem I have had with it (see below).  Having tried other zen players, an old Muvo flash-drive player, and after sampling several different ipods, I have found this to be the best option, as well as the cheapest. The functionality is something unrivaled in most players I've tried.  It includes line-in recording so that you don't actually need a computer to load it.  An FM tuner, with admittedly limited reception, works in a pinch if I need to walk to the store in the middle of a football game.  It has a small microphone that is useful for note-taking, though not much else. These lesser functions are somewhat basic but do not detract from its main function of music playback, which works excellently.  The sound quality is every bit as good as any player I've tried, as long as you are willing to pay out for some more expensive earbuds(sony EX51s are nice but break relatively quickly) than the ones included, which are the same quality as the tinny pieces of junk you would get with an ipod. The player's operating softare includes playlist organization, mp3 encoding (which I've never used), and even a basic equalizer with presets which helps when I change audio inputs from my over-bassed Koss Sparkplug earbuds to my home stereo. I should note that some have complained that there is no gapless playback on this player, which is true although I'm not even sure gapless playback is possible with Mp3s, as they don't usually contain that sort of information (I could be wrong). The interface may provide some problems for those who are less familiar with computers like the elderly or perhaps those who simply don't have the dexterity for smallish buttons (for instance: the very very obese) but I found the interface perfectly comprehensible and transparent, including a faux-scroll wheel, an on/off/play/pause button, and two dedicated volume buttons. The only problem I have found with the player, which may be because I did not buy it new, is that the battery case cover on mine broke fairly soon after I bought it, making it very easy for it to fall off in my pocket.  This is not a huge problem, as it comes with a belt-clip plastic case I can put over it, preventing the battery from falling out.  The downside is that it increases the size of the player by about a third, but this is minimal in my opinion as the player is already a little smaller than the average disposable cigarette lighter. For what I paid for this player, I would still be happy with my purchase if it died completely tomorrow.  It outlasted the more expensive earbuds I purchased for it, and if you are willing to pay the extra money it costs at Amazon, you can return it for a new one if it is DOA, as plenty of electronics are.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player, and I mainly got for listening to audio books and lectures. It plays well and has a long battery life. I haven't had any problems with the device.  The things I don't like are the ear pieces, which are definitely too big, and the fact that it is hard to navigate through the different audio files on the player. And, for some reason, when I download a book consisting of several chapters, it jumbles up the chapters on the player. I need to go back and put them in order with the firmware before detaching it from the pc, so if I forget to do it and take off with my player, I'm screwed as it would be very difficult to locate the chapters in sequence when I am away from my computer.   The above are little gripes that I can live with, ergo the 4 stars.  So, I'd recommend it. For the money, definitely worth it. Hope this helps.

<Title>30+ Albums on 1Gb Nano Plus
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really, really like this Nano. It is small, the file transfer is easy and fast, the sound is great (I have a high end hi-fi, yet am happy to use the lower bit rates to fit on more songs when I travel, 30+ Albums at 64Kb WMA). The battery life is good and I personally really like being able to change batteries half way though a trip away from home or at the office, without having to worry about a charger.   Things are a few things that annoyed me slightly. There is always a small gap and click between songs. It is also difficult to set the record levels when using the 'line in' facility to get a decent volume, yet avoid quite bad distortion.   Overall I highly recommend the Nano Player

<Title>Great player for jogging
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to use a bulky mp3 cd player on my jogs.  After researching mp3 players and what I wanted to use them for, I decided on the zen nano plus.  Apple's equivilent would be the Shuffle, NOT the ipod nano as MANY misunderstand.  Here's why this player beats the shuffle in so many ways: -Price -FM Radio + radio recording! -Built in mic and line-in recording to mp3!  (96,128,192kbps selectable rates) -A DISPLAY -a BACKLIT display -Preset & Customizable EQ -Removable battery (AAA) -Does shuffle come with belt clip/arm band? (really, i don't know) -Mass storage device when plugged into USB. -MS Plays for Sure -Using WMP 10 and Sync, it auto-creates artist/album folders on the device. -About half the size of a pack of Big Red gum (it is really small)   Shuffle pros: Itunes (which i love, but WMP is catching up).

<Title>There are better options
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a Sandisk 1G MP3 player and I am pretty satisfied with it. I got it for five dollars less than this, and though I have returned it twice--once for a better price and once because the headphones shorted out--I think it's better than Creative Zen, which my friend owns. Hers has tiny buttons and an inefficient scroll wheel. If you're looking for a well-priced, easy to use mp3 player, go with the Sandisk m240 models.

<Title>Do NOT buy creative Zen nano
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one a couple of weeks ago on amazon and got a very very bad experience with creative zen nano. I had one sandisk e240 before and I have been using it for more than 6 months and I got no problem with it at all. It still looks like brand-new. Since my wife wants to have one mp3, I though we should try a different brand and then bought one creative zen nano. Nighmare follows. Zen nano is really like a small cheap gadget. The cons from my experience are 1) The battery cover broke within only two weeks.  2) The surface is easily scratchable.  3) No sleep timer included. 4) The lock function is build-in within the software, instead of a direct mechnical switch like in Sandisk. 5) The LCD window is too small. 6) The sound of pressing buttons is too loud and sounds like cheap toys.  A lot of people mention that the custom service of creative is very bad. This is not case for sandisk. The first mp3 I have is sandisk 1gb mp3 player (not e240 series). The firmware brokes once; I just send it back to sandisk and got replacement within 2 weeks without paying any fees. Although both brands are made in China, Sandisk obvisouly has much better design and quality control.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had an I-Pod shuffle and this is so much better!!!  You pay less for it and you get a voice recorder and fm tuner.  I also like the drag and drop ease of moving files to this player.  I-tunes is okay but I work on many different computers and I don't like having to install I-tunes all of the time.  Don't forget that this doubles as a flash drive too!  If you like a lot of bells and whistles as far as buttons go, do not buy this product.  There is one button that turns the player on/off, plays/pause.  Then there is a volume up button and volume down.  The only other thing is a scroll wheel that navigates through songs and the menu.  This is a very tiny player!  Also, do be careful with the battery cover.  It is small and can break.  I haven't had a problem but I have been careful with it.  All in all I love it!

<Title>Great little player for the price
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of online research before I purchased an MP3 player.  I was initially going to buy a SanDisk e200, but the store didn't stock it.  The salesman convinced me this little Zen Nano for 1/3 the price of the SanDisk would be very user friendly.  He was so right!  I was ripping songs from my CD's in no time after loading the software. I only want some music (FM radio on here is great, too!) and don't want to carry around a big CD player.  Don't care that there's no color LCD screen with pictures.  Highly recommended if you're just looking for something small to hold lots of music.  Sound is great, but might buy different eye buds...these are a little large.  I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a player with with features I don't really need.

<Title>Just what I wanted!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first digital player, and I love it.  I have had ZERO problems with it in the first three weeks or so of owning it, and have never opened the manual or installed any software.  I am able to download music from my PC, and books from NetLibrary with no problems.  I have also stored a bit of data on it with no ill effects.  The FM radio receiver is as good as that in my CD player--receives most stations as long as the headphone cable is extended.  Battery life seems fine to me (listened to an entire book, plus music and FM on the included Duracell). I can't vouch for the headphones, as I bought in-ear passive noise-reducing phones to go with it.

<Title>Decent mp3 player for the price!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Today I received my Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus 1GB.  I decided to purchase an mp3 player because I work out at the gym and was tired of running with a bulky cd player that skipped if I didn't hold it while running.  So, I started looking at mp3 players.  I am a big music person and have well over 12,000 files of mp3s on my home computer.  It seemed I would have to buy a costly mp3 just to hold a good portion of my collection on an mp3 player.  I checked out the Ipods, Sandisk and Creative Labs mp3 players.  I did A TON OF RESEARCH ON THESE PRODUCTS.  The end result?  There are bad experiences from reviewers with each brand and every model.  I decided to not throw away hundreds of dollars on a piece of techology that would potentially have an issue.  If you don't care about playing and watching video but just want a compact mp3 player to listen to a handful of music albums on -- this one seems to be the best.  I tried it out in the gym today and it was great.  It is the size and weight of a tiny package of gum (the kind with 5 pieces).  I held it in my hand while running since I don't trust technology to be dangling off my body, however, this one does come with an armband and waist clip!    Pros: +Comes with waist clip, armband, basic headphones, line-in cable, and usb cable. +Lightweight, has screen with optional backlight. +COST!  Save yourself some money! +Customer Service (I called with a question and was put on with a live body in minutes!) +FM Radio +Record audio!  Cons: -For working out, there is a lot of extra cord on the headphones. -Directions.  The set of directions that comes with this is really poor.  It gives no real direction on how to work the software and vague in some areas with how to use it.  I figured out everything through trial and error. -The case that it comes with doesn't actually cover the screen, which stinks because I don't want to worry about scratching it!   In summary, I couldn't find one mp3 player that didn't have an unhappy bunch reviewing each brand and model.  This one is working out so far.  If there isn't a great flawless mp3 player on the market then why waste so much money on an Ipod?  (I didn't talk about spec's in this review because you can learn that from Amazon's description.  You read reviews to read others experiences.)

<Title>Very Reliable For the Price
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Nano Plus is a very reliable mp3 player-- the sound is crisp, it plays smoothly, you can record on it as well as listen to FM and AM radio, and all for a very reasonable price.  Although it is not specifically compatible with iTunes, what I do is burn my playlist onto a disk, and then rip that onto my mp3 player.  When you first hook it up to your computer, it installs everything you'll need-- help, a way to rip audio CDs onto your player, as well as much more. My only complaint is that the ear buds which come with this player are VERY cheap, and uncomfortable.  I recommend you buy a new pair or use old headphones, instead of using their's. Other than that, I highly recommend this mp3 player.  Much better, I think, than any, more expensive player.  A great deal for you money!

<Title>Transparent technology
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted a device like this; something that I could plug into my computer and access just like a thumb drive. When I took it out of the package, there was a CD that came with it, but as I looked at the CD and the standard USB jack in the side, I thought "I'll just plug it in and see what happens." That's what I did, and I was able to drop a few folders on it and listen to music immediately. I never installed the software. In this case Windows XP didn't have a problem with drivers or anything.  More things need to be like this. iTunes and the other software interfaces that are required by other players are a hindrance. Proprietary cables should be banned, as far as I'm concerned. This simple unit uses a USB cable and a headphone jack, and that's all you need. You can put it in your pocket without discomfort. It's solid state (no spinning disk harddrive) so the risk of damage to the unit is minimal.  The battery doesn't last long, and there is no hardware to run this off a car charger as far as I've found. I am irritated that to use this in the car, I must have at least three separate wires going from this to that, which is very annoying, and I'm still running down the battery. I've yet to find a cigarette-lighter mounted FM transmitter with a "line-in" jack all consoldiated into a single unit. This would rid my car of these dumb wires all over the place. Since the screen is small, you have to fiddle with it while driving which is a pain, but to be expected for something this small.  Until I find something better, I'll stick with this quick and easy MP3 solution.

<Title>It's still tickin'
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player 2 years ago and am still loving it! Once you get the hang of operating it (I am not tech savvy and it didn't take too long) it is very easy. My 5 year old has no problem using this player either. She has her own folder on my player so that she can be just like her big sis. The only problem I have is that to find a particular song, you either skip through every song until you find the one you are looking for or go to the menu and search through the folders.  Loading it up is simple...just copy and paste! If you copy a song and paste it, you just get that song (songs are named in the player the same as on the computer when pasting). If you copy and paste a folder, then the same folder is on the player.  I bought one of these players for my 14 yr old daughter 1 year ago. She uses hers more than I do and she still loves it! Unlike my daughter, I could not stand the earbuds that came with this player. They were very uncomfortable in my ears. If they stayed in, they hurt but most of the time they would fall out anyway. I purchased Sony Soft Earbuds - White Model #: SON   MDREX71SLAW from Circuit City for about $50. On the expensive side, but very definitely worth every penny. I could not get them away from my boyfriend, so I bought him a pair as well. I also just purchased the Creative TravelDock 900 Docking Speaker for this player to listen to at work. I have not received it yet though. Over all I believe you cannot go wrong with this player and have recommended it to anyone looking to buy a mp3 player.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am addicted to audio books (in mp3 format) so I've got to have an mp3 player.  I have been using this little gem for about half a year now and I'm more than happy with it. I had been using a Samsung YEPP YP-F1X 512 MB mp3 player (which I was also happy with), but I lost it. I decided I needed more memory than my old unit so the Creative Zen Nano Plus was my choice.  What I love about it (in no particular order): ~ The track will start off where it was stopped. Awesome feature for audio books. ~ Size. Fits in any pocket. ~ Storage. 1 GB is enough to hold two or three books, depending on the size of the books. ~ Can be used as a flash drive. ~ The scrolling. Fast-forwarding and rewinding gets incrementally faster the longer the scroller is pressed. This is a great feature for audio books. ~ The "lock" function. When a track is playing, the mp3 player can be locked so that when buttons on the player are pressed the track is not interrupted. This is a great feature for audio books.  Why it's *almost* perfect: ~ I miss the clip on my old mp3 player that allowed me to attach the player to my clothing. If I don't have any pockets I put the Zen Nano in a cell phone holder that has a clip, but that adds bulk and looks stupid. ~ I seem to go through a lot of batteries. I have been keeping track and, on the average, I replace the battery about every four weeks. I wish it could charge via the USB cable like my previous unit.  The worst thing about it: ~ When the battery is almost drained, the player sometimes loses the ability to scroll and will sometimes not start the track where it was stopped. This means I end up putting in a new battery even though there is still a little bit of juice in the old battery.   I would buy this mp3 player again if I needed another one. In fact, I am going to get one for my brother for Christmas this year. And some batteries.

<Title>DO NOT BUY - stops working after a few months.
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>do not buy this product!  Ignore the 5-star rating - that's from a few months ago.  Immediately after receiving this, I wrote a great review when it was working...  however, once the warranty ran out, the product stopped working!  with fresh new batteries, the player will not even turn on anymore - the screen flashes the logo and starts to turn on then shuts off after a split second.  occasionally if i hold the power button for about 10 minutes, it will finally turn on, but then if I'm listening to music and go to adjust the volume or skip to another song - any button I touch, turns it off and then it will not turn back on.  of course since companies don't care about the customer anymore, most companies, including creative, don't back their product after 90 days, which turns out to be about the life span of this product.  if you don't mind paying $70 for a disposable mp3 player that will only last three months, go ahead, but if you are looking for something that will last longer than three months, look elsewhere.

<Title>Just About Perfect!
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For me, the most important feature of an mp3 player is sound quality. This is where this player really shines. It is simply one of the best sounding mp3 players on the market, with very little background noise and distortion. Warmth, resolution, detail, and clarity allow your music to be engaging and very enjoyable. Play a track with a high-bitrate and this player will blow you away! I previously owned a heavy, 20GB hard-disc drive player made by Apple. The drawbacks were the weight and extremely short battery life (3 hours of play on a good day). This baby is so small, light and unobtrusive that you don't think twice about taking it everywhere you go. Buy 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and you're good to go. Oh yeah, by the way....  the price is right. You can't find a better mp3 player for under $70 bucks!!!

<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this little player!  I bought it specifically for the gym, and it is perfect for that purpose.  I also bought the pricey $99 Bose in-ear headphones which make this player sound fantastic.  However, the included earbuds are probably adequate for most people.    PROS:  takes standard AAA battery; line-in jack for direct recording of non-digital sources such as LP's and cassettes; 5-band EQ with presets; FM tuner with presets; microphone; very good sound.  CONS:  none after 2 months of daily use.  The package I purchased contained everything you will likely need including AAA battery, armband, beltclip, & headphones.  This is my first MP3 player.  I was a little afraid of buying one, or wasting my money on a cheap piece of junk.  However, this player truly met all of my requirements, and exceeded my overall expectations.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  If you have never owned an MP3 player before, and are looking for a player to use at the gym, this inexpensive but impressive little player should delight you!

<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After checking quite a few MP3 player reviews, I decided to buy this one, since the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and because I like its size and look. I found it very easy to install and use. I get songs from emusic and their files move easily and quickly into the player. I also used the software to encode from a CD, no sweat; both the player and the software are easy to figure out. I organize the songs into folders and change the titles ( abbreviate+ give a number to the track)to be able to locate the tracks quickly. Most important to me, as the other reviewers say, it sounds great ( I encode at 220 b/s,  gladly sacrificing quantity to quality). I bought the extended warranty, just in case, but it doesn't seem flimsy. It's probably a good idea to be gentle with the buttons and battery cover, though. The radio sounds good too and catches a lot of stations, a nice addition ( just wish it had AM too). The earbuds are large but sound good. The problem with the backlight making a sound must have been fixed, I didn't notice any, good, I wouldn't want to disable it, it looks cool and is useful. I'm looking forward to hours of musical pleasure with this pretty object.

<Content>This was a great Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter. She loves it! It uses only one AAA battery, which lasts quite a while (she started using it on Christmas morning and still has the same battery in today a week and a half later with daily use). It has an FM radio function, shows you what you are playing, how much time is used, etc. It is full of features and the price is great too. I would highly recommend this item for those of you looking for something small, easy to use, durable, and fun. As for the loading of songs, she picked it up in about 5 minutes, it was no problem. This one is supposed to hold about 500 songs, she is still nowhere close to that many. Well worth the price, a great deal!

<Title>Very nice little player.
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered these for my nieces as Christmas gifts and they were thrilled. So thrilled, I decided to get one for myself. It came with an armband, (not a neck strap as the site may specify) and has a stero connector cable, USB cable, battery, and earbuds (the standard kind that are a little big, not the kind that mold into your ears), and a rubbery case that has a belt clip on it. Really cool - great for the money. I installed the software, connected it to my PC with the included USB cable and about 150 of my mp3s went on it in 5 minutes. It was so easy it practically sucked them off like a vacuum! The kids report they hooked theirs up to their personal CD players and it took the music right off their cds! Super easy to use. Now, for the best part. I don't always care to listen to my player with the earphones, so I purchased a $10 cassette adapter that is marketed for the iPod, but has the standard 3.5 mm stero adapter. Cool, now I can play it in my car instead of burning a mix CD. I also purchased the iFish and right now my player is plugged into it and it's next to my computer, wiggling, dancing and fuctioning as a great dock. Worked out great when I reinstalled windows the other day and had to restar my PC after every new driver installation. I highly recommend this player to anyone. It does not support play lists like some other players do, but when you transfer files to it, just change the name of them to the order you want them to play in, or as I do, just separate them into folders and skip easily back and forth between folders of music. One AAA battery will last you 15-20 hours - incredible!

<Content>I have the 512M Creative Zen so now I'm getting the 1G.  I'm dumping my Sony player with its losy software and my iriver with its hard to use controls.  All I want is a simple player that I can plug in like a jump drive, move over my MP3s from my computer and play and that is what the Creative Zen does very well.

<Title>just right for me
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought one of these for my son for Christmas-I ended up using it tons when I run. Wanted to "test drive" one before getting my own. He insisted I get my own-which I did. The software is easy to use. The device also records live music-he uses that feature [himself performing], I do not. He also rips from his portable CD player to the device. I like to rip cd's from the laptop. 1GB is plenty large enough for my uses. I did swap out supplied ear buds-but only did so because I'm a runner-the supplied ones do work well for other common use. Battery life seems to be fine. i did notice that "boot up" time has lengthened with more folders of tunes-but not a big deal. The battery cover has a very delicate tab that seems to break if one does not carefully re-insert-no big deal for me as I just tape it. The entire device is housed in a soft/rubbery clip cover anyway, so it's not even a cosmetic issue. Lot of features for the bucks, I'd recommend it.

<Content>The tone quality is very good and it is easy to load music and operate. I have owned two of these for less than one year and my wife and I use them daily at the gym.  The biggest problem is the battery cover which has a tab that is extremely flimsy.  No help from the manufacturer unless you want to spend dollars for another battery cover.  I have replaced 3 of them and will never buy another one due to this problem and the lack of service concern by the manufacturer.

<Title>My daughter loves it!!
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 12 yr old was asking for an ipod and a friend told me to check out the mp3 players, which were similar and cost less. I checked around and found this one. I chose this one because my daughter has alot of cd's and this player allows recording of music directly from the cd's through the computer. The downloading feature is also easy to use. My daughter no longer has to carry her cd walkman and cd case everywhere, just this small mp3 player in her pocket. Also she enjoys the radio feature as her cd walkman did not have this feature. The downside is the batteries don't last long, so we invested in rechargable AAA batteries. Other than that she no longer thought about the ipod after getting this!

<Title>Very easy to use
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> This is my first mp3 player and so far I am very pleased with this product. The fact that it uses an AAA battery means that you don't have to put an adaptor in your backpack. If you want to travel light, it is a good advantage over other players which usually don't come with this option. The sound quality is very good. The software is very intuitive to use. I remember that my cousin had to spend long hours to learn how to manage the software iPod comes with so I was a little woried about it. But I did not even have to read the booklet to use the software. You can easily add, delete and reorganize the music.    Initially I thought that this player doesnot have enough volume. Then I realize that the jackphone was loose and you have to push it hard for it to go all the way in. Then I had such a high volume that I will probably use it in half volume most of the time.     The only negative comment I have is that transfering music is a little slower than I expected.

<Title>Great Product but no instructions
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The MP3 player itself was great, it gets 5 stars.  The earphones that come with it were extremely uncomfortable for my 11 yr old son whom I purchased the NANO PLUS for.  I replaced them with Marshallow earplugs from Walmart that a friend suggested as very comfortable.  They were.  They're made by JVC, I think, or SONY.  If you are somewhat electronically savvy you will figure out how to use this MP3 player, but the directions it comes with are pretty much non-existent and the website directions do not apply specifically to this product but to the CREATIVE products which are newer.  I think the player was well worth the price.  I'm having fun loading CD's onto it.  I also tried to use it as a voice recorder, and that works great too.

<Content>This is (was) a great player.  Then I let the battery go dead (fell  asleep on the train), then it would not turn back on with a new battery.  So I had Amazon replace it (they did so very promptly) and this one again worked great.  After several batteries (which I didn't let go dead) I got curious and thought I would try letting one go all the way flat.  Sure enough, it won't turn back on.  I found that if I "upgrade" the firmware, I can get it back to working, but I am returning it.  Too bad, as I was in love with it.

<Title>STEAL THIS BOOK
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here's the deal guys & gals: I can't find anything wrong with this thing:  the thing is cheap, light, comes with all the accessories you need, requires no external software for Windows or MAC and has higher sound quality than most Apple players like I-pod.    Any problems I read in other people's reviews were uninformed and incorrect.  I purchased this player from Amazon.com for only like $60 with free shipping, about a month ago, and I use it with $9 Sony headphones with ear-clips that I bought at Best Buy, because I prefer those to normal ear buds, like the ones it comes with.  CONS: The only downside is that if you want to carry around more than 1GB of music and/or files at one time, you should get a bigger creative labs player.  This is no problem for me because I am a professional songwriter and singer, and I'm always changing out the music I listen to.  I can find no other downside... I guess another potential downside is that if you want to use Apple's .aac/mp4 format you have to first burn them on to audio CD's and convert them to .mp3 or .wma files.  (Note: this problem exists with EVERY legal mp3 player on the market)   PROS: POWER--You don't have to charge it...Uses a AAA battery and lasts about a month with heavy, daily use.  When you are hooked up to a computer the USB powers to save your battery.  Plus, it has plenty of options like backlight, power-save, and contrast settings to further the life of the battery  EASE OF USE/SHARING FILES: Look, all you do is hook it up with the provided USB2 cable and you import/export files like an external drive or folder.  You can share music with your friends, or even use it as a flash drive for school or work.  It creates menus (or you might call them 'playlists') according to the folders that you create on the thing.  I always name mine '[artist] - [album (year)]'.  BUILT IN ENCODING UP TO 160 KPS:  and this works extremely well (contrary to ignorant reviews I've read) if you set the levels correctly out of your source.  I have been using it to rip mp3's of VINYL right out of the headphone jack of my home stereo tuner and they sound @#$% GREAT!  It even comes with the line in cable you need to do this.  FM RADIO, VOICE RECORDING, ETC:  all these other features work great.  The radio gets great reception and you can even rip mp3's off the radio (although you should realize that these will be significantly lower quality than if you rip from the line in jack).  SOUND QUALITY: Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this thing operates at 20Hz to 20kHz which is the approximate maximum hearing threshold of the human ears... I-pod and other players are actually lower quality than this, I believe.  It also runs at 44.1k which means you get no sound degradation if you rip mp3s at 256k from a CD.  Need I say more... buy some of these before the price goes up or they take them off the market.  jb

<Title>Nice device and fast response
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: This device is good, little and I saw it was easy to use.   Possible to use three levels of carpets Awesone sound. Perfect voice record capability Excelent software to "autofit" the MP3 to WMA files and save space. Now with "autofit" I can have in the ZEN near to 550 songs in WMA at 96 btps. Good WEB site for support (software and upgrades)  Cons: -The casing is plastic and seems no to be very resistent.   -The software is suceptible to be losen or affected.  I recomment prior to record music inside the ZED,  format the device utilizing the ZEN explorer (included in the CD). -Once mi device suddenly did not operate. It turn off with new battery. I had to install the new firmware and format it. The problem was solved.

<Title>Wonderfully small, easy to use.
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll try not to repeat what everyone else have mentioned.  Some of the things I have noticed about this MP3 player early on: (1) The display is easy to read for a somewhat small display.  (2) Has an equalizer.  (3) Comes with a lot of accessories like arm band, earphones, line-in cable, rubber case w/ belt clip. (4) Quite a bit of software which I have yet to know what they do. (5) A NiMH rechargable AAA battery will last around 8 hours. Your mileage may vary. (6) Without reading the manual, I was able to manage around the vast menu selection.  It was a very well laid out GUI. (7) I considered strongly the color of the Nano before I bought it.  Once I got the damn thing, it was so tiny, color didn't matter anymore.

<Content>I own a Creative Muvo 256MB and still enjoying it to date.  When I saw the more compact Creative Zen nano plus 1 GB (and the price just keeps coming down!), I decided to order one and was pleasantly surprised! The sound quality is awesome ( I even compared it head to head with iPOD nano with its earphones--I think the ZEN has a better sound!) It is very small, light and came with a silicon case and armband which is just perfect for working out. I have no problems with it so far. In fairness to iPOD nano, iPOD has better and larger graphics but more pricey. Bottom line is, MP3 players are mainly audio players, hence the looks should be secondary.  I have recommended the ZEN nano to all my coworkers and to order thru Amazon, couldn't be simpler than that!

<Title>Great once you learn how to use it.
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Zen Nano Plus but the booklet that comes with it is a joke. ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE USERS GUIDE FROM THE CREATIVE LABS WEB SITE! Once you have read the users guide the Zen Nano is a joy to use and a real value. To me, the Creative labs software and "wizard" are difficult to learn. I just used windows "explore" to set up a folder on the MP3 player for each singer, then used Microsoft Media Player to rip the songs from my CDs, then dragged and dropped them into the appropriate folders on the MP3.  Even the Creative Labs User Guide doesn't talk about folders much.  If you don't set up folders, I assume all your songs land in one big pile on the MP3 player. Once you have set up folders and copied the songs into them, when you are playing music the Zen Nano lets you easily swithch from folder to folder, or you can use shuffle mode. The controls on the player are very diverse and flexible. The biggest reason I bought the Zen Nano is that it uses standard "AAA" batteries, unlike the IPOD, which must be connected to your computer to recharge (unless they have changed it recently). I travel a lot and just take a few extra batteris with me.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I needed simple drag and drop, with a FM radio and a battery that didn't require me hook up the usb.  I also wanted at least 1GB and didn't want to spend $100.  Enter the Creative Zen Nano Plus!  I've used Creative products over the years and never had problems with their quality... this TINY mp3 player is no different. It's small and plastic, but transfers files quickly and effortlessly. I read the short book that came with it and within ten minutes of opening the package I was listening to music files I'd transfered from my computer.  I will be getting new earphones for it (the phones are a bit too large for my ears), but the sound quality improved once I discovered the EQ settings and there's volume left to spare!

<Title>A solid, convenient player
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the small size of this player - it's about the size of a pack of gum (between a 5 and 25 pack).  I purchased it mainly because of the recording feature.  It has a built in mic and you can also attach a line-in recording source.  The built in mic has decent quality and records individual mp3 files so you can download them to your computer for archiving.   Upsides: Nice drag-and-drop transfer of files.  You don't have to use any annoying proprietary software.  Relatively good recording quality.  Decent interface.  Wonderfully small size.  Good battery life.  Downsides:  The line-in jack is not a standard size.  It looks like a 1/16th inch jack and comes with an adapter cord to make it compatible with an 1/8th  inch jack.  Then, if you want to plug in an RCA or mic source, you'd have to have even more converters.  I haven't even attempted to do so yet so I'm not sure how the quality is.  I hope to use it at some point for remote podcasts.  You have to use a separate cord to interface with a PC.  The older version of this player (which I almost bought) allowed you to plug directly into USB (meaning there was a male USB connector built into the device.  I really would like this feature because it would allow you to plug the device into remote computers without having to carry around the little adapter cord.

<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this item for Christmas last year.  I loved it!  It was a good MP3 player for the money. Then, last week I went to use it and the sound was all distorted.  I went to the Zen website to troubleshoot it and went to try their suggestions but whenever I connected the Zen to my computer, the computer locked up.  As soon as I removed the Zen from the computer, it was fine.  So, I was unable to troubleshoot.  So I tried to turn on my Zen to check settings.  Now it won't even turn on.  I went back to the Zen website to contact Customer service.  They wanted me to pay a nonrefundable $25 just to get a return number, with no guarantees that they could fix the problem.  There was no phone number to contact them, or anyway to contact them via email.  When a company makes themselves inaccessible like that, I have to wonder why.  Don't settle for the Zen.

<Title>Good hardware poor user interface
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was wondering why ipods commanded such premium prices until I got a Creative Nano 1GB.  I like its small size and the sound quality is satisfactory.  I intended to use it to listen to books ripped from cds.  So each book should be a directory under which there are directories for the disks.  Under each disk directory there are tracks.  This is no sweat for ipod to handle but stretches the Creative's ability since it does not really understand the concept of directory trees.  Well, it pretends to understand one flat layer of directories but I can tell it is faking that, being a computer programmer myself.  As the result, strange things happen when you actually have layers of directories.  Although I have figured out how to cope in some cases, I wish I had got an ipod instead.  So if you just want to play some songs this is good enough but if you want any organization of the content, ipod is a better choice.

A great player for running/working out with excellent sound quality and durability. Love the drag and drop feature for loading on files and that no proprietary software is required. Also like being able to use AAA batteries. I just rubber band one on the side along with the extra headphone cord (also good for catching the player when it gets dropped -- rubber band holds headphone cord in place so player does not hit ground -- a cheap effective accessory). I also like the FM radio.

One problem I have with earbuds is they are usually too big my ears... so I went to the local hearing aid store and had some custom earmolds made that fit onto the buds --now the sound is really terrific because it is going directly into my ear without any background noise. And since the molds fit into my ear canals, the buds will never "fall" out; if I ever have to replace the earbuds, the customs come off and will go onto the new ones easily (most earbuds are about the same size).  Storage? --1GB is perfect size! You can store a ton of music on this baby--it takes forever to listen to it all! I have 35 Christmas CDs--loaded them all and still had room for more. Christmas is over, with drag and drop, exchanging genre was a snap!  Bought each of my teenagers one for Christmas and they are thrilled!  Love the replaceable batteries.  Recharging is great if you are near a recharger when the batts go out--but that's not a problem with this jewel. (Who needs iPod with all of its proprietary issues!)  I don't think it will, but even if it has to be replaced in a couple of years for whatever reason, I didn't spend a fortune to begin with, so it was money well spent. I would definitely buy another one. Creative has always made good products, so I am really glad I got this one. But first and foremost--the sound is awesome!!  [...]

<Title>It works for my kids- I want one too!
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My mother bought these for my kids ( a 5.5 boy and a 2.5 girl) for Christmas this year.  She bought them so that the kids could each listen to their own story tapes and/or music and we parents could either listen to news programs or our own music on the car radio or enjoy adult conversation.  We have three sets of grandparents that all live 3-6 hours away so long car trips are frequent!  I am NOT a techno person.  So, I was very nervous about getting into these.  I did a fair amount of research and decided the Zen Nano was the best balance of value, storage capacity and ease of use for my kids and me.  They have proven easy to use and durable.  I can even "rip" CD's to my computer and then "synch" them to the mp3 player with no problem using Windows Media Player.  It really is easy!  They've worked out great.  The controls are not fancy but are fairly intuitive.  And my kids are generally happy with just turning them on and listening to one album or story all the way through.  If you turn it off, it does pick back up where you left off which is great.  Neither of my kids can read well enough to get to the album they are looking for anyway.  By the time they can, they'll probably be using the controls with more ease than I do!  They were given a set of conventional headphones because we didn't think earbuds would be a good choice for this age range.  We were also gifted a charger and set of rechargeable batteries.  The batteries only last for a few days during heavy use.  In short, I couldn't be happier with this product.  We've ony had it for about two weeks but already they are indispensible.  It saves us a LOT of arguing over what to listen to in the car AND at home.  I actually came online so that I could buy a third one for myself!  Now I can record all of those NPR podcasts that I never get to listen to at home.  I will buy a car tape-deck adaptor and can listen to my favorite shows anytime I take a (rare, but precious) car ride alone!

<Title>Good for kids
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this unit and was surprised that it only allows you to skip through the songs forward and backwards. I might have missed some other options, but I don't think so. I got this for a 10 year old and she doesn't seem to mind, but if you are looking for the ability to play songs by artist, album, or any other grouping, I could not figure out how to do it.  It works well other than that. It's basically a thumb drive and you can drag and drop (cut and paste) songs on here easily.  It comes with a rubber case to help protect it, ok head phones and a USB cord. My XP found it and installed it quickly with any additional software. It does come with software, but I didn't even look at it.  If you want something more intelligent, then the one gig Sandisk with the 1 gig memory slot works very well, for under $100. [...]

<Content>This mp3 player has good features but with little instructions provided, it is nearly impossible to use.  So far, we have only been able to download a few songs and those were songs already on my computer and has not allowed us to download purchased songs yet.    The buttons are also a challenge to use.  I still haven't figured them out and given the time involved in doing so I probably never will.    I am disappointed in the ease of use for this product.

<Title>Best purchase I've made in some time!
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a 40GB Creative Labs Zen Xtra MP3 player from Christmas a year ago, but that big thing (although it's a great vacation device) sits at home now that I have my 1GB Zen Nano Plus!  Super light-weight, durable, and great battery life, I take this thing with me almost everywhere - to the gym, in the car (which came with an 1/8" auxilliary input for devices just like this), and lounging near the pool.  1GB doesn't sound like much, but it's plenty of room to store all your favorite "current playlist" songs and then some.  If it gets full, just delete some of the stuff you don't like as much.  Two cons (but not worth marking down a star):  1.  Get a different set of earbuds.  The ones that come with the unit just don't cut it.  I got a pair of $20 KOSS earbuds from a popular retailer and they've been great.  2.  There was a high-pitched noise whenever the blue LED backlight came on (i.e. whenever you skipped to the next song, etc).  Thankfully, there's an option to turn off the backlight permanently (which also saves on battery life), without which I would have had to return the unit because I couldn't have put up with it.  Note: I did return the unit once thinking it was defective because of the high-pitched tone, but apparently all the units have this same problem.  I lived with it because I don't mind having the backlight off permanently.

<Title>Overall a great purchase.
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought Creative Zen Nano Plus upon the recommendation of my brother who is pretty savvy when it comes to technology.  It is the smallest MP3 player on the market that I am aware of and seems to be reasonably priced.  I love that it comes with the arm band; great for exercising.  I'd have liked there to be a bit more memory; 500 songs sounds like a lot but it fills up fast and also you may not even get that many if the song file is a larger one.  I was able to fit about 250 songs.  Despite that one little drawback I am satisfied and must say that as my first purchase it is a great one overall.  Would like to compare to the iPod Nano; the iPod Nano has 4 times the space but it also costs almost $200 more.  It may be worth it for a longer term investment.

<Title>A Bargain for the Number of Options
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a bit apprehensive when I bought this MP3 player but the Creative Zen Nano Plus exceeded all of my expectations. The sound quality is great. The earphones are loud at even when set the lowest levels. No, the earphones aren't the most comfortable thing in the world, but they're easily replaceable. Really, I think people like to complain about the earphones because there's nothing really wrong with the player so they're searching for things to criticize.   The software (not needed) took minutes to install, and loading my CDs was simple and even faster. You can choose how to name the tracks on your CDs when you load them as well (i.e. No., artist, title, or a combination of all three) The player also works like a flash drive and if you just have random mp3 tracks on your computer, you can simply drag and drop them into your player. The only thing is that you need a UBS cable to connect your player to your computer (cable is provided). Songs are also easily deleted. You can either do this on your computer or on the player itself.   Another great option is that the number of different shuffle options available. You can shuffle within a folder, or shuffle between folders, shuffle with no repeat, shuffle with repeat, etc.  I haven't used them all but they're definitely there. No, you can't do playlists but I didn't really find it necessary. The absence of the ability to use playlists is another very small flaw in the MP3 player which can be easily overlooked. Really, if you want a "playlist" just put all the songs you want in a folder and listen to the folder only!  You can organize your songs into folders. I haven't used many sub-folders, but you can organize your songs within subfolders. I mainly have folders for different artists and subfolders of albums from that artist within that folder. Then I just have a folder for miscelaneous songs. This structure has worked great for me, especially considering all the playing options that are on the player.   The FM radio rocks. I love having the option of listening to the radio instead of just listening to my music. The reception indoors is decent - about as good as a radio in the same room. I've only tried the option of recording from the radio once or twice but it worked great when I did. It's a cool option if there's some radio program or song you want to record for future listenings.  For all you college students, concert junkies, conference goers, etc., the Creative Zen Nano Plus has a microphone so you can record lectures, songs, and anything else you can think of with your MP3 player. I think the player picks up sound pretty decently over large distances. Of course, the closer/louder the sound, the better the sound quality. Great added option though.  I haven't used this option but you can also transfer straight from your portable CD player to your MP3 player without using your computer using a line-in cable (provided). The only downfall is that the files will be generically named (XXX0001.mp3). But that can be easily changed the next time you are on your computer.  The player also comes with a AAA battery which lasts quite a while for such a small battery. Don't ask me for the exact number of hours it lasts because I don't keep track of how long I listen to the player for every battery used but I can tell you that the small battery has some serious juice. In addition, replaceable batteries are much better than using rechargeable batteries because rechargeable batteries do not work after about a year of constant use.  The player came with a wrist band which I didn't find all that impressive but it's there if you want to use it. The Nano did have a tiny hole at one end to be used with lanyards if you do not want to use the wrist band. The player does NOT come with a lanyard but I had an extra one laying around so I use that instead. I did like the case it came with so it prevents scratching or any other wear and tear on the surface. The case also has a clip if you want to clip to your clothing.   Overall, great buy considering the price. The only two extremely minor flaws was the earphones are uncomfortable and playlists aren't an option. This greatly outweighs the cool options available like FM radio, microphone, price, works like a flash drive, etc. I give it 4 1/2 stars!!!

<Title>Cheap construction, good features
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little MP3 player is based on flash memory instead of a hard drive. Compared to hard drives which eventually die, an MP3 player based on flash memory is a longer-lasting investment. The Nano Plus is loaded with features such as one gigabyte of storage for music or other files, an FM radio, a built in mic and various recording functions. Like most consumer grade MP3 players such as the iPod, the Nano Plus cannot play albums without gaps in between the tracks. Audiophiles who carefully encode their albums using gapless-capable formats may want to avoid this player and seek out high-end players such as Rio Karma. Firmware upgrades could eventually give gapless playback capability to the Nano Plus. Sadly, with all its amazing features the Nano Plus is cheaply built from flimsy plastic. From a design perspective the Nano Plus looks like it could have been engineered by Homer Simpson. It has an odd navigation system that ultimately does get the job done. The overall sound quality is decent--as good or better than any iPod but a far cry from the likes of Cowon iAudio. Dragging music onto the device is simple and requires no special software besides basic storage drivers. It shows up like a regular drive. With only the drivers installed from the Creative web site you can avoid using the included CD. It comes with a soft rubber case which is very useful for protecting this delicate toy from destruction. Be extremely careful if you plan to use the Zen Nano Plus while excerising. A single AAA battery keeps it playing for up to 18 hours. Considering the battery is easily replaceable you could potentially own this device for many many years without it needing service or replacement.

<Title>Awesome!!!  No matter what else you own, GET THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My review can be summed up in one sentence: You can get a BUNCH of songs on this VERY SMALL player and play them for a VERY LONG TIME!  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's, the m230, m240, and m250, and I only gave them 4 stars.  Without a doubt, the Creative Zen Nano get's 5 stars.  It's that good.  It doesn't have all the cool cache' of the iPod nano, but it is without question the most optimized little player I have had the pleasure to review.    Creative has been in the MP3 player business for a LONG time.  Their early offerings came up against a market that wasn't fully matured and able to handle the higher end devices they produced.  Apple stole their thunder and has overshadowed everybody with the iPod.  Creative's higher capacity devices are still too large to compete on portability.  It's funny the way things work out.  If not for Creative, Apple wouldn't have ever had a market to introduce the iPod into.  The Creative Zen Nano is lighter than the competition, and is actually much smaller than the iPod Shuffle.  Unlike the shuffle, however, you can actually see your track names!  The little LCD isn't high resolution, but it's perfect for a player this size.    The controls are simple but effective.  A 2 way toggle wheel let's you forward or reverse from song to song.  There's a play / pause button on the front panel and forward & reverse buttons on the side by the toggle wheel.  Other than a headphone jack and a line in jack, the unit has a USB B port and the battery panel.  That's it.  I think these controls are the best possible for the form factor.  The only potential negative is that they might be on the small size for somebody with larger fingers.  What about sound?  The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo.  As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds.  I've yet to use a pair of standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.  I will say that the armstrap could have been better designed.  Also, this unit definitely does not have the power output of the iPod Nano, and as such may not be loud enough for those who really love to blast it.  But as a result, the power consumption is the best I've seen.  I've gone over a week on a single AAA battery!  For those needing more space, the Zen Nano doesn't have larger storage options. This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Even with a HUGE music collection, I can get a great deal of music on here and take it with me everywhere.  The price isn't a give-away, and this unit won't make it through battle, but it strikes a good enough balance to meet your needs for a long long time to come.  Highly recommended.  Pros -  - great stereo sound - nice capacity - ridiculous battery life!!! - light-weight  - FM tuner ( though it's just average ) - voice recording  - Direct line-in recording!!!! ( for those without a PC ) - ergonomic design  - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible   - USB 2.0 connectivity  - replaceable battery!!!   Cons  - smallish buttons - Average shuffle feature - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled ) - some song transfer issues on older computers  - not enough size options - no slot expansion   (...)

<Title>Good product
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Sure I know there are fancier mp3 players out there, but I think this one is ideal for the price. I have had no problems loading the songs or using the device at all. I have only had it for a few months, but can find no fault with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the memory could only store about 200 songs as opposed to the 500 songs advertised. The ear buds also did not fit my ears too well, but this probably would be a problem with any ear buds as they all seem to be the same size. This was easily solved with a different kind of head phone set that I purchased for under $20. In conclusion, this is a good mp3 player to buy as long as you don't have a need to download too many cd's. I am happy with it.

<Title>Adequate MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this Zen Nano Plus after careful consideration, because I wanted a player that could play WMA files, and which had line-in and radio capability.   Unfortunately, I couldn't get the line-in capability to work well -- there were frequent scratching noises in the background whether I was recording from a computer or a CD/radio.   The radio didn't work well inside my gym either, although it may have just been my gym.  Another problem is the lower upper-bound for the sound levels. The volume doesn't go up as high as is often necessary to hear inside a noisy place, like a gym.  All, in all, I wish I had bought an iPod. I have heard horror stories about the fragility of those devises, which you may wish to consider. I know that my nano, which is usually kept in a small digicam case, has been dropped before, and it still works.   So, the end of the story is that this is an adequate player, but don't buy it because of the radio or line-in features, and don't buy it if you listen to your music at higher volumes.

<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall I'm pleased with the Zen Nano Plus.  Pros:  - considerably smaller than most other players  - comes with armband and belt clip holder; armband is good for exercising  - uses one AAA battery, and it seems to last a long time  - easy to drag and drop to add music  Cons:   - I could not get this to work with Yahoo! Music Unlimited "To Go" service, despite a claim on Creative's web page that it would work.  The unit is Windows "Plays For Sure" compatible, but maybe Yahoo Music is not.  I tried updating the firmware and drivers but still was unable to transfer subscription songs to the player via Yahoo Music Engine.  - Small display, but usable  - navigation with the scroll wheel is a bit cumbersome  - supplied headphones are just ok

<Title>nice sound, but easily scratched
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice little player.  1 gigabyte is enough to hold 18-20 albums or so, which makes a nice playlist.  Because it has USB 2, it loads quickly.  The sound is quite nice, but the included earbuds are too large and very rough.  You'll want to replace them, but since this is such an inexpensive player the cost isn't an issue.  Beware that the default load order in this player is alphabetical by song title.  Be sure to use the included media organizer software to change the default and play the songs in album order.  I found that the case, while very good looking, is soft.  The clear cover over the LCD panel is easily scratched, which could prove to be a problem.  I just cut down a screen protector from my PDA and applied it to the LCD.  Problem solved.  You can't go wrong for the price.

<Title>Waste of money.
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted an mp3 player since my sister got her ipod, but I really didn't want to settle for ipod. My mom picked this one out for me instead, and I hated it!   The first day I got it, the part that keeps that battery in snapped. I was alright with it at first since if I put it in the clear clip on holder, it didn't come off. But the belt clip wasn't made to securely hold that thing.  I carried it around at work a lot, and since the belt clip wasn't secure, it'd randomly fall off my belt loop and crash on the floor. The FIRST time it did this, the player snapped in half and the blue casing came off. Also the volume buttons fell out. I managed to piece it back together, but it happened several more times. Eventually, I had no more buttons left and couldn't even turn the thing on.  It was a nice little mp3 player, but had too many bad things about it to enjoy.  Pro's for me: -Being able to play & record radio -Small enough to fit in my purse & such -Idle shut off -Very easy to put songs on & take songs off. Was never a fan of itunes, so the drag&drop method was nice.  Cons: -Would rather it had a rechargable built in battery. I could've bought the most expensive ipod by now just by the amount of money I had to spend on batteries for this! -High pitched buzzing noise that accompanies backlight -Shuffle mode sucks, tends to play the same songs everytime I switch it to shuffle -Takes a while to skip through songs -Scratched easily -Not durable at all, dropped it once & it broke.

<Content>After reading all the rave reviews this item received, I thought it was going to be so much better than it actually was. It doesn't hold nearly 500 songs like the description reads. It holds less than 200 of my music. The shuffle feature sucks if you have lots of songs in one folder. It will play the same song four times in one sitting, while skipping tons of other songs! When I found that it wasn't playing some of my songs, I had to dump songs from several different folders into a root folder just to hear them played. You get what you pay for. I would rather have spent twice as much to get a better MP3 player.

<Content>I purchased three of these from Amazon for Christmas gifts. Three months later one is defective. Because I purchased these in November, Amazon tells me I am over the 30 day return policy and will do nothing about it. They count the thirty day policy from the time of purchase even when it is obvious this was a Christmas gift because I bought three of them. Forget dealing with Creative (the manufacturer)...they tell you to return it to the place of purchase because they have so may hidden charges, even under warranty, that it will cost more to send it to them than the original cost. Any local store would have replaced this without question. Shame on Amazon.

It holds more songs than I can listen to in an afternoon and I have no trouble loading them and deleting them when I want a change.   I love the FM radio that the competition doesn't have and plenty of stations come in loud and clear and it's very easy to record them.  I use the built in digital recorder all the time to record meetings and classes. I slip this into a pocket or clip it on the front of my bra and it's so small I forget it's there. Later it's easy to transfer what I recorded to the computer and burn it to a CD if I want.  It uses one regular old AAA battery and not something special that can't be found or has to be sent to the factory to be changed.  I've had mine 6 months and no problems.  I love it!!

<Title>Love this thing!
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my CZN for over a year and still love it! Works exactly as it should, and even became a valuable tool when I need to move large files between various computers. My only (minor) complaints are: the flimsy battery door (it's not the worst thing in the world if you lose it if it breaks, but I didn't want to tape up my player), the so-so software (not that you actually need to use it of course) and the size (didn't realize how quickly 1gig could fill up, though that's no fault of the player). If this player somehow broke in the end (I've dropped it several times and still good, though I keep it in the included rubber case 24/7), I'd replace it in an instant. This product has made me want to consider other Creative MP3 players as an option for a higher capacity player.

<Title>Jogging Partner
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a hard drive based player.  This was not a replacement for that.  I wanted a small flash drive type player that I could take with me jogging.  I love this player.  All the features perform well. NO moving parts so no skipping music.  I can even listen to FM if I want to.  This player is so small that I dont even notice it in my pocket when running.  I did replace the stock headphones with some "sport neckband" type headphones.  Earbuds tend to fall out when running.  The user interface is pretty easy to use.  This is my new running partner

<Title>Great Style, Size, & Functions
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano Plus could be mistaken for a cigarette lighter.  Perfect size for walking around your neighborhood, but if you travel alot for long periods of time, you might want something 4GB and up.  This easily fits into your jeans pocket so you're more likely to carry it around than a 30GB iPod which reminds me of the Palm V I discarded because I didn't want to carry a man purse to hold it.  ;) The trick is to encode in Windows Media format (WMA) instead of MP3.  I converted my 192kps mp3s using WMA VBR 50 setting and you cannot hear much of a difference.  But the file size now is just half of the mp3 file size, so I can fit about 340 songs on it.  BTW, the player only has 980MB usable space, which peeved me to no end (same scam that hard drive makers got sued over). This player has no playlist function and will play songs alphabetically according to file name (not imbedded ID tag).  You can separate song files into file folders and use that as a simple playlist.  For audio books, you should just label your chapters "author - book - ch 01 - title.mp3" to get them to play in order.  Also, re-encode your audiobook files using mono setting.  It'll reduce your file size by half and save you lots of space. I really love everything about this player.  It does scratch easily though.  They give you a rubber case, but it doubles the thickness.  However, it fits nicely in a metal Altoids mints case.  :)

<Title>Very Good MP3 Player - but is it right for you?
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would have given Creative Zen Nano Plus (abbreviated "CZNP") 5 stars, except for two small deficiences: it does not have gapless playback (see #4 below), and the build quality and controls are kind of cheap (see #9 below).  Assuming it lasts, it seems a very good unit for the money.  Here's why I bought mine.  0. Do I want to make a fashion statement with my choice of MP3 player?  Some people will only buy a trendy iPod.  Buying a lesser-known unit like CZNP makes a different fashion statement, especially since you can choose from 12 colors.  I prefer function over form, but CZNP offers some of each.  1. Do I want more than just sound?  The CZNP is a basic MP3 player, FM Radio, and recorder.  It has a simple monochrome display and controls that make it a good choice for playing music, podcasts, and ebooks, and listening to local radio stations.  It can record from the built-in mike or radio, or from a line input, which may be handy at times.  Some players can play videos, show pictures, etc, and cost a lot more because of the required color screen and larger memory.  I don't need these things and prefer not to spend the money needed to get them.  2. Will I be listening to mostly music or mostly spoken content?  When you switch off a unit while it is playing, or pause it and it turns off automatically after awhile, some units will resume at the beginning of the current track, and others (e.g. CZNP) resume exactly where you left off.  If you are playing music, you usually prefer to start the song over again.  For ebooks or long podcasts, I need to resume where it was turned off (like CZNP does), because it is hard to fast-advance back to where you were.  3. What kind of accessories can I get?  Creative has a set of speakers tailored to the CZNP, and there are many generic accessories that will work with it.  By comparison, there are entire catalogs of accessories tailored for optimal use with an iPod (and may not work with others).  I have what I need, but pine for some things available for iPod only.  4. How convenient is it to use?  MP3 players vary considerably on how easy they are to use.  The iPod is famous for ease of use, though it does not do everything I want to do.  The CZNP has relatively cheap controls that work well enough, and does what I want.  You don't have to be a computer whiz to use it or its software.  5. How long will it last?  On Amazon, click the link "See all 109 customer reviews", then look for the dropdown "Show:" and choose "Lowest review first" and click the Go button.  There are a number of reports from people who had problems with their CZNP, some bad enough to throw it away.  Some are real problems, others might be a lack of understanding how to use the player.    Despite these complaints, the average review is high.  You'll find about the same mix of reviews for most players.  I decided to take a chance.  My unit will be well-cared for.  If I have a problem, I'll update this review.  6. Can the battery be replaced?  CZNP uses an AAA battery which is said to last for 15 hours and can be changed easily.  The iPod Nano has a rechargeable battery that is not designed to be replaced, which means the iPod Nano becomes landfill when the battery no longer takes a charge in a couple of years. There will be millions of iPods being thrown away simply because the owner cannot make them continue to work, which has an impact on the environment.  There are now battery replacement kits for iPod, with tools and instructions, so this concern is lessened for DIY people, but most won't bother.  7. How does it sound?  The CZNP sounds very good to when when I use good earphones like Koss "The Plug", or when plugged into a stereo.    The free headphones you get with it won't give you the best sound, and you should not judge the player on how it sounds with them.  Go buy quality earphones for any new player, as this will make a huge improvement in your enjoyment at relatively low cost.  8. Does the player use flash memory or hard-disk for storage?  CZNP uses flash-memory.  Flash memory is more expensive per MB/GB than hard disk memory, and flash memory players are smaller than hard disk players.  I would not want a hard disk, which I think is too heavy and too fragile for a portable player.  Get a hard disk player if you want to carry a lot of content, but make sure you have a backup.  Get a flash memory player if you want to hold the content you will listen to today or this week.  9. Does the player have enough memory?  I think I can have 12-16 hours of MP3 music at highest quality on the CZNP 1GB player, or podcasts (lower quality) up to 32 hours.  With that much space I can have some new or favorite albums left on the player, and have plenty of room for content that changes (like podcasts).  If you don't use a computer regularly, you might want more memory, maybe even a hard disk.  10. Does the player support gapless playback between tracks?  Some albums have music that flows continously from one track to the next.  Examples: Radiohead "OK Computer", Dandy Warhols, Moody Blues.  The listening experience is disrupted if the tracks have a gap as the player switches from one track to another.  I don't know of any portable MP3 player that offers gapless playback (without Rockbox), though it's bound to come.  The CZNP has a brief gap with no clicks, but it is still somewhat disruptive.  One solution is to rip the album as one continuous track.  The Rockbox open-source technology essentially replaces the firmware on your player, and it features gapless playback.  It is supported on a few players, including some iPods, but not CZNP.  11. Does the player require proprietary software or hardware?  CZNP includes software, but it can work like a USB drive, so you can manage content with Explorer / Finder if you want to.  All connectors are industry standard (though the 3/32" stero line input is less common).  As I understand it, iPod can only load music using iTunes, and other players require software supplied with the unit, or with Windows.  The iPod and others also use proprietary connectors, replacing a lost cable is more expensive.  I would not be happy with such restrictions. Open standards promote flexibility and interoperability.  For me, at a minimum, the player needs to look like a USB drive when I connect it to the computer, so that I can load it by dragging files to the player's file system, and the CZNP does that.  I want to have a program automatically create a custom listening program of various short podcasts that play in a particular order to support Radio on Demand, and I want that to happen by simply connecting the device to the computer, with no keyboard or mouse interaction involved.  I have not found such a program, and may have to write it, but I can do that if I want to.  With an iPod I have no choice but to use iTunes (or replace the firmware with Rockbox).  12. Is the player file-based or tag-based?  The CZNP is file-based: it can play songs in alphabetical order for a given folder.  (It also has shuttle, etc.)  I tried the SanDisk Sansa, but returned it because all content is organized and played on the basis of tags, exclusively.  While my music has tags correctly set to play the way I wanted, podcasts don't use tags consistently enough to play them in a particular order that I chose.  With the CZNP you can at least control the order by putting a sequence number at the beginning of each filename.  Tag-based probably have some advantages over file-based, but only if all of the content you want to play is properly tagged.

<Title>VERY FRAGILE--LOVED IT AT FIRST--DOESN'T LAST!!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Purchased the Zen Nano Plus on 09/10/2005 & loved it! It was great for the gym, running, even did voice recordings of my Dad telling family stories--great features/functionality. I liked the whole package. About 2 weeks ago, I found an almost imperceptible crack in the housing next to the headphone jack. Now, I've been very, very careful with this player over the last year--it's always in its little gel case & I never let anyone else touch it. I contacted Creative customer support, and they pretty much told me to go away. Even though I was still within the 1-year warranty, they wanted $25 USD along with the Zen Nano Plus for repair costs---then they told me they might need more $$$ during the repair process, and I would have to come up with it. I did the math---I paid approx. $150 USD for the Nano last year at this time---now, you can find it online for under $70. I was not about to PAY them for the privilege of repairing an item still under warranty. I am more than disappointed. I don't have buckets of $$$ so I can't just run out & buy another MP3 player. The Nano now has a rubber band tightly wound around its middle so the crack won't get larger & the case won't fall off. This defect was NOT due to "normal wear & tear"---this just shouldn't have happened--PERIOD. If I were you, I wouldn't buy a Creative product unless you also purchase an extended warranty from them or from the merchant. Next time, it'll be an iPod or from another company that appreciates its customer base.

<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Player started shutting itself off just after the actual 90 day warranty period. Good sounding player for the money, but very demanding with the proprietary software. The only way to get it to work now, until my new purchase arrives, is to bang it on a table top. Then after some undetermined period, it will shut itself off again.

<Title>Full of Bugs - Pass for now
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a Creative fan. I have a Jukebox 3 and a MuVo TX FM which I lost and wanted to replace. I purchased a Zen Nano Plus 1GB and it was glitchy. It showed up in my device manager and after 5 min in explorer but it was never accessible.   I'm no dummy (BSEE) and spent about 5 hrs trying to get this USB device to work with no luck. I suggest you visit the creative interactive support site as see for your self the number of people having problems with this particular mp3 player.  I returned mine to Amazon and went and purchased another MuVo TX FM. Plugged it in and it works fine.   Maybe Creative will fix the bugs with this thing but until they do its hit or miss. Some people have no problems and other have problems that can be fixed with good support (another hit or miss) and still others like myself have players that just will not work. Good luck, D

<Title>A perfect MP3 player--size, sound, or durability
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have researched more than a dozen sites and MP3 players before going for this one. The first thing that struck me was the user reviews. Everywhere it has more than or equal to 4 stars. But there are also one or two stars from some users. From my personal experience with CREATIVE music stuff and this awesome mp3 player, I think that most of the negative reviews are driven by malice and by rival companies/people associated with them. Before highlighting the pros and cons of this item, let me make a point here. One thing what amazes me is that this item is SO much in demand that it has been selling like hot cakes since its inception. I am still waiting for my office depot order placed on Sept 14. Inference? This item is the BEST MP3 in terms of demand, cost, and performance. I have owned SANSA M230, and my room mate owns SANSA E140. Both are good, but don't come anywhere close to this CREATIVE Nano plus. Before I begin to appear as a CREATIVE employee myself, let me outline the pros and cons of this MP3 Player.      PROS: awesome sound. I wanted a decent MP3 player with great sound, simple to use, and decent radio. This MP3 gives you that. I listen to songs by keeping the volume LESS THAN HALF of what is given and, trust me, it is still loud.         The radio is great with 32 presets (more than 32 actually because the stations are like '89..89.5...90....90.5....91) So, you can see that it receives more signals that u can imagine. The voice is crystal clear and doesn't shake when in a car or riding a bike (the radio is a bit shaky in SANSA E140)        I was quite apprehensive about the LCD by looking at the reviews all over the net. BUT, once and for all, there is absolutely NO problem with the LCD (I have read numerous reviews complaining that aspect of it). Now, come on. If someone has sight problems, I can understand that. But someone with normal eyesight (I DON'T have 20-20) can read the text that scrolls across the monocrome LCD. Even the battery indicator (three bars) is easily visible.         As for the operation, it is pretty simple. Two buttons on the side are for increasing and decreasing the volume. A scrolling wheel for browsing thru the menus is visible just beside the volume buttons. All you have to do is scroll it once with your thumb to jump a track. That's it. However, if you want to go to settings, equalizers, etc., press the scroll button and the different menus pop up. They are arranged horizontally. So, to hop from one to the other, use the scrolling wheel. It is that simple. Most importantly, you can delete a track you don't like even while you are listening to it!!!   I haven't tried the recording feature of this MP3 player, so I cannot comment on that. But, personally, I am not sure how much I will use that feature.   CONS: the ONLY thing I see as a con is the earbuds. I agree with most other reviewers in this. They are bigger than what you can think. Don't get me wrong; they are CREATIVE earbuds. So, the sound quality is outstanding. But, my ear hurts after half an hour of listening to music. It is like working out in a gym for the first week: if you can see through the pain of the initial period, then everything settles down. I have got used to the earbuds, but I would recommending buying smaller ear buds for extra comfort.    Now, for other bits of information about this MP3 Player. The AMAZON box came with belt clip, arm band, CD, Line out cable, USB cable, one AAA battery. That is pretty much complete package as far as a normal user is concerned. And, ONE VERY IMPORTANT thing: I have read everywhere that how it is difficult to transfer files to and from the MP3 Player. But, with our natural curiosity and counter-institutional nature, we tend to trust ourselves with some things that we shouldn't. The CD hasn't been manufactured for nothing. When CREATIVE says install it on your computer, do it. It takes only 37mb space on your comp. I am an electronic freak and can safely claim to know some things about computers. I use Object Dock, Style XP, etc. to jazz up my computer and know how to format computers, etc. So, if you cannot transfer files from this CREATIVE Nano, then the problem is with you and NOT the player.    My last observation here would be this: if anyone is apprehensive about buying this after reading negative reviews elsewhere, it's your loss. ABOVE ALL, think of this: if this MP3 player had really sucked, it wouldn't have got consistently 4 stars all over and wouldn't have been so frequently out of stock. P.S...IT'S BEEN EXACTLY ONE MONTH SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND HENCE WOULD LIKE TO TELL INTERESTED BUYERS MORE ABOUT THIS ITEM. This is the BEST MP3 player you can have (it is even better than other editions of CREATIVE). The reason is this: only the NANO PLUS give you a radio in this price range. The other ZEN V series nearest to this price range ($79.99) doesn't have a radio. The next edition that has a radio costs around $150 or more. Anyways, this Mp3 player's radio is loud...really LOUD. You have to reduce the usual volume to listen to the radio. And signal of the radio is crystal clear. I stay in a two bedroom apartment and when I close my door, I sill get good signal. Now for the battery life. I listen to music atleast 3 hrs everyday and have only spent 3 Energizer AAA batteries. Also, this playe can hold more than 220 songs (as reported by many online pro reviews). It all depends how well can you compress your song(s): for example, a 112 bit-rate song will obviously hold less space than 128 bit-rate song. I have exactly 209 songs (including Hindi and English) and have more than 200MB of space left in the player. I used the CREATIVE Audigy song compressor system that came with my DELL Laptop. But you can find other compressing softwares in the market. This Nano also has a "Jazz" category in the menu that changes the listening experience (I did not notice it before). Also, there are equalizers to customize how you listen. So, all in all, touchwood, this is a great MP3 player for an even greater price!!!

The mp3 player uses 1 AA battery every 9-10 hours... which makes it ideal for car rides and even walks.

<Content>I have a Creative Zen V which I really love for running. I bought the Nano Plus because I was going on a week-long bike ride with no way to recharge thru a computer. Really like the fact that the Nano runs on regular batteries and I haven't had to change them often. I wanted to be able to listen to FM radio at night on the trip. That worked out well. The radio reception isn't always the greatest but it is pretty good for strong stations. I'm very pleased with the Nano--great value for the money.

<Title>Loved It Til It Died
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had my Zen Nano Plus 1 GB for eight months when it conked out on me.  Gave me a "no music" message on the screen, and I was thereafter unable to delete the music that my computer still identified as being on there.  Worse, instead of offering to help me get the unit replaced, Creative customer support keeps asking me to do things that are irrelevant and/or impossible to get the player working again.  In other words, if your Creative breaks within the warranty period, don't count on getting a replacement unit sent your way.  Pros  - Size - Ease of Setup and File Transfer - Battery Life  Cons  - Tech Support - Reliability - AAA instead of Lithium Ion Battery

<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Nano Plus for approximately 2 months.  There have been no problems and it has exceeded my expectations.  I can hear no sound quality differences between this player and my wife's 60gb Ipod.  And contrary to some other reviews, I find navigating simple and easy.  (I even like the supplied earphones.)  For me, the best feature is the line-in recording.  I have been able to digitize, with acceptable results, some personal tape recordings from many years ago.  I used the headphone jack from my cassette player and it took some trial and error to get the right levels of volume, bass, and treble being fed into the Nano Plus, but it worked and I'm happy.  For the money, one can't go wrong with this purchase.

<Title>Warranty Warning
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product comes with 90 day warranty and 1 year limited warranty.  If you want a copy of the warranty, it's on the installation disc. My player quit functioning after about 4 months.  The limited warranty is almost worthless because Creative charges your credit card in order to allow you to talk with customer service.  E-mail support is free.  They require the model #, which is not printed on the product or on the documentation.  The model # is on their website, but Creative makes it difficult to obtain support.  Creative sends form email instructing you to update the firmware.  Before updating firmware you must back-up your music.  The firmware update also removes the FM recording feature.  It did not fix my player.  Creative charges a fee for diagnosis and handling plus any added labor costs to fix the player.  Bottom line, if your player breaks down after 90 days, it is probably not worth the time and money to obtain warranty service.  I will not buy another product from Creative Labs.  Even if I have to pay more, my next mp3 player will be from a more reasponsible company.

<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this Creative Zen Nano 1G player for my 9 year old daughter.  She loves music and I thought this would be a great gift, which it IS!  It has room for 500 songs, and the sound is wonderful.  It's SO easy to upload songs onto it... you just drag and drop and that's it!  I borrowed it to use at work, and now I want one for myself!

<Title>The Zen Nano is Amazing!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had bought the Zen Nano as a christmas gift since the Ipod is so restrictive.  The other thing that initially sold me on the zen is that it can receive and record FM stations.  Once I started using the nano I bought one for myself and sold my ipod on ebay.  The sound quality on the OEM headphones are amazing for what you pay.  The menus are easy enough for my wife that is technology impaired to have no problem working them.  And last but not the least the battery life on it is amazing.  I listen to it for about 4 to 8 hours a day on and off, so far I've used 1 battery in the last week.  Amazing player, I did my history on all the mp3 players and it turned out to be worth it.

<Title>Great for kids!! (and for me too) 
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a good but inexpensive MP3 Player, that included a FM radio, voice recorder, and software to create Playlists.  The sound seroiusly is amazing, and it's small and fits perfect into pockets. I bought it for him for Christmas and almost kept it myself!! I have an Ipod and the sound is just as good. The only reason reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of five, is because I am comparing it to an ipod, that has bigger screen and easier to navigate. But other than that, it is just as good as an ipod.

<Title>Great Player for the $$
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my daughter for Christmas.  Even though there are newer models with greater amounts of storage, we selected this player for the combination of 1GB of storage,FM radio, and value for the $$.  This player is a big hit with our daughter.  The controls are small, and the dual function controls are a bit tricky to use at first, but after a short time the navigation through the player's menu is pretty easy and intuitive.   The FM tuner seems to pick up channels clearly, and the sound quality of the earphones is pretty good as well.

<Title>Good for a first time user or kids
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this particular mp3 player because I have Windows ME on my computer, and didn't feel like spending lots of cash to update my operating system to try a new gadget. (This is the first mp3 player I've ever owned.) It was the only mp3 player (other than RCA) that supported any o/s older than Windows XP!  That being said, it would have been nice to know somewhere in the manual that came with it, that I could not load the bundled software. And that I didn't need it anyhow! Their manual could be better, I think.  I am not totally computer-illiterate. I do know about files and folders. And creating folders to group songs (albums) into could be much easier. Windows Media Player won't let me create playlists on my portable device. So I have to create them like it's a removable drive. I complained to Creative about it, and they told me to use their software. Too bad I can't load it onto my computer since I have Windows ME.  Also, playing songs in the order they are on an album (such as in Phantom of the Opera or Les Miserables) doesn't happen unless you add a 2-digit track number before the song title (file name) which in the grand scheme of things isn't too terrible, just time consuming. Otherwise, it plays the songs alphabetically.  Creative's customer support could be better. They give standardized answers, and refer to you their "Knowledge Base" fixes for stuff. I had already checked their "Knowledge Base" for answers and couldn't find what I was looking for. So I emailed their customer support, and they just referred me to the same page of their "Knowledge Base" that didn't answer my question in the first place. Frustrating to say the least.  The wheel for surfing thru the menu on the player is a little touchy. But other than that, the controls seem to be just fine. I do see the battery cover breaking the first time I drop it, so I'm trying to be extra careful. The earbuds are a bit big. If I used it while excercising, I'd probably want ones that fit better, but exercise is a four-letter word for me, so it's not that big a problem. I also can't justify paying $25 for earbuds for an mp3 player that was only $64.  It seems like I'm not saying anything good about this particular mp3 player, but I really do like it overall. I would have given it 5 stars if not for all of the things I mentioned above. It really is pretty easy to use, and I'll probably get one for my 6-year old for his birthday. He doesn't care what order songs are in, and by the time he wants to group them into folders and such, he'll probably know more about how to do it than I do.  I'd definitely recommend it.

<Content>Unfortunately for me, I bought this MP3 player at a neighborhood store and got a 256 MB for this same price.  Fortunately for me, I'm now trading up for the 1G ... the one I should have bought all along.  Giving the other one away to some newbie.  I love the product, otherwise I definitely would not buy it again.  The size, the performance, the features ... It's perfect in my opinion.

<Content>When I got this I was surprised how small it was.  It was east to copy music from my computer and it plays pretty good.  Make sure though that you always have the best electronic batteries available, they do go bad pretty fast.  I used this on my trip that was 8 hours long and it was nice.  Music plays pretty well too.  For the price, it was well worth it.  Not to costly.

<Title>GREAT!
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got an orange 512MB one from another online site about a year ago.  I have treated it rather badly.  It has been to Turkey and Egypt with me, gotten crushed in my purse, dropped, bounced, and tossed.  It just keeps on going.  Now, sometimes when it drops, it opens up along the sides just a bit - I push it all back together and everything's fine.  Sometimes the battery door will pop off when it drops, no problem - put it back together it just keeps going.  There was a point where it needed new firmware, but CREATIVE's customer service is definitely up to par,  directions were very simple, and it was soon running again.  (I  think it was a complication from my Audible.com audiobooks.)  Very easy to use, and if you are (hypothetically) driving while it's plugged into your car stereo, and you want to change the volume, or flip to the next file, there's no need to look at it to handle the controls, as they are very intuitive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

<Content>This Nano is, basically, a good value.  It holds a lot of songs and is very easy to use.  It has the capability to record voice messages and listen to FM radio in addition to downloaded songs.  The "case integrity" is poor.  The battery cover broke the first time I put batteries in.  Duct tape now holds it in place.  The ear "buds" that were included were W-A-Y too big to fit in my ears, so it cost an extra $25 for new headphones.

<Title>High Quality at a low price
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just purchased mine about 3 wks ago. I love it. Sure there are 2 or 3 minor things that could have been improved, but for the price and the amount of songs and the other features, it is a great buy. I recommend the cheaper (wireless) version of the car adaptor. I have listened to it with other ear buds (one set of which were my wife's I-Pod ear buds) and the quality sound of the one's that come with this product are by far superior. But the cheap foam on the outside eventually comes off. Recommend if you eventually replace them, buy quality rather than cheaper earbuds. If I am ever able to fill this thing up (keeps going and going!), I will buy another as my #2 and see how many CD's and downloads I can fit into it!

<Title>A nifty little device, but...
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First impressions were good. Drag-and-drop upload is a breeze. Plug in the earphones, turn on the player, and the music begins. The sound is fine.  After a while, you'll probably want to change a menu setting or two, maybe go from alphabetical play to shuffle play. The menu interface is not great, but for most users this probably is no big deal.  I went for shuffle play, and for a while all seemed well. But as I kept adding songs, it became clear that something was wrong. The new songs never got played. In the end, I had about 300 songs, and never heard more than about 50 of them.   Before asking for help, I decided to load the latest firmware into the Zen. The result was sudden death. Do NOT try to download firmware into your Zen. The Zen has no separate loader; the firmware just tries to load itself, and if this for any reason fails, you're almost literally up the creek without a paddle. In the computer software business, this is called "unprofessional code". You can take it from me, I've done embedded programming (including a lot of loaders) for longer than I care to remember.  It took a few e-mail exchanges, but eventually I got a return authorization from Creative and mailed in the player. (I think the post office charged me $2.08.) Considering the technical quality of the firmware, I had pretty much written off the thing. However, in ten days or so, a new Zen arrived. I uploaded the gigabyte, and the shuffle seems OK. Obviously Creative has a serious firmware problem, and the technical support may come across as a little grumpy, but they try. Not very smartly: fixing the loader should take no more than a few days, and would probably put an end to most of the returns.  To sum it up: if you stay away from firmware operations, and don't need the menu very often, the Zen is a nifty little device for you. My guess (a little uncertain) is that you will not have my shuffle problem. If you do, you could try reloading all your music from your hard disk, in one operation.

<Title>Size &  portability, LCD screen, ease of music transfer, and intuitive menu make this the flash player to own
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player to use exclusively at the gym, and it's completely perfect for that application.  So perfect, in fact, that I've found myself using it at home, in the car, on walks around the neighborhood, and perhaps most enjoyably, on the ski slopes.  It's small, light, and super easy to use.  If you're like me, you're probably comparing this player to the iPod Shuffle before you buy and in my opinion, the Zen Nano wins hands down.  Sure, the Shuffle is trendy and the advertised colors are more readily available, but it doesn't have an LCD screen (the general idea being that it shuffles your music and surprises you with the next song).  I guess that's fine, unless you really want to listen to the songs on that new album you just bought in the order that the artist intended.  With the Shuffle, you'd be forwarding through each song until you found the one you want, whereas with the Zen Nano, it's very simple to select a specific album or playlist.  Don't get me wrong, I dig the idea of shuffle, and with the Zen Nano you can be surprised song after song by simply selecting either the "shuffle once" or "shuffle repeat" play mode, either of which shuffle all the songs you have stored on your player.  Other play modes include alphabetical, repeat track, repeat all, repeat folder, track once, shuffle folder, and normal.  The Zen Nano comes in three capacities - 1 GB, 512 MB, and 256 MB.  I considered buying the 512 MB but found the 1 GB version at Circuit City for only $10 more so I ran with it and I'm glad I did.  The advertised capacity for the 1 GB version on Creative's website is 500 songs based on 4 minutes per song at 64 kbps WMA encoding, but if you want to hear your tunes at a better sound quality, don't expect to get more than about 260 songs on there.  I was able to load 20 complete albums onto mine for a total of 255 songs at 128 kbps WMA encoding, and I have 8.21 MB free space left.  I admit, I experienced a tinge of disappointment when it wouldn't let me add album #21, but that was short-lived considering that 20 albums is more than enough music to keep me satisfied for a couple hours at the gym or even a full day on the slopes.  Plus it's super easy to remove music and load new music onto it.  I installed the software that came with it, but I don't even use it.  The Nano Plus works seamlessly with Windows Media Player.  Simply connect your player to your computer using the included USB cable and you'll be dragging and dropping new music into your player in mere moments.  Pretty cool.  The Zen Nano is powered by one AAA battery.  Some people may prefer a player that can be recharged when it's connected to a computer, but I didn't really care either way.  I will say that after using it for a while, I like the idea of being able to simply carry an extra battery or two with me and pop a new one in when necessary.  As far as battery life, the advertised life is "up to 18 hours of continuous playback."  I haven't had mine long enough to need to replace the battery yet, but so far my Zen Nano has been on my hip for 6 trips to the gym, a couple walks around the neighborhood, a few brief car rides, and a full day on the ski slopes.  I also played with it for a couple hours the day that I got it just loading music onto it and exploring its features.  Speaking of features, the Zen Nano has some cool ones, most notably a built-in FM tuner.  Being a satellite convert, I couldn't care less about FM radio, but it is nice to be able to tune to the FM frequency that the gym TVs broadcast on.  There's also this neat little feature where you can flip the orientation of the LCD screen.  That may sound goofy, but I've found that I like the text facing one direction when the player's on my hip, and the opposite direction when it's plugged into the auxiliary input in my car.  There's a voice recorder feature that I have not and probably will not ever use, so I can't comment on that except to say that it's there.  There's also a line-in option where you can record to your player directly from an outside source such as a CD player.  I haven't played with this yet, but I do like the fact that I can potentially connect my player to my satellite radio receiver and record radio programming to listen to later.  The Zen Nano Plus comes with a sports armband and rubbery carrying case.  I used the armband a couple times and it's not uncomfortable, but I've found that I personally like wearing the player on my hip.  The rubbery case that comes with it has a clip on the back so it easily and securely clips to the waistband of your shorts or pants.  Seems like it would also protect the player pretty well in the event of a drop.  Like most other things in this world, the Zen Nano is not without flaws, but it's very close to perfect.  The earbuds that come with it are crap, so unless you already own a pair that you like, figure a new set of headphones into your spending budget.  I highly recommend the "in ear" headphones that seem to be all the rage right now.  The pair I bought came with three different sizes of interchangeable buds which I really appreciate because I use the smallest ones.  When I was doing my research I read several complaints about the player making a buzzing sound when the LCD display is lit up.  I have not experienced that with mine, so maybe Creative addressed this issue.  Even so, an easy fix would be to turn the light off, which I did anyway simply to conserve battery life.  I also read that when ripping music, users had to manually type in a two digit prefix ahead of the song title (01, 02, 03, etc...) in order for the player to play the songs in the order that they're listed on the CD.  I thought that would be annoying if I had to do that, but I found that Windows Media Player 11 does this automatically.  I also read some complaints about Creative's customer service/support, or lack thereof.  The only comment I can make related to that is that I've owned several Creative products and haven't yet had to deal with their customer service.  Finally, this might sound ridiculous, but my biggest complaint when I was shopping for my player is that Creative advertises that this thing comes in 10 different colors, but I was only able to find a 1 GB player that came packaged with the armband and carrying case in one color - dark blue.  Not the end of the world, but I would have preferred a different color had it been more readily available.  All in all, I've been extremely pleased with my Zen Nano Plus.  Its small size and portability, and the fact that it has an LCD screen to make selecting specific songs or albums more convenient were what originally won me over.  But its intuitive menu, ease of transferring music, and battery life have ultimately convinced me that I made a great purchase.

<Content>Pluses: Great Sound, great battery life, voice recording is clear, storing music to it is as easy as drag and drop - you do not need the software that came with it.  Minuses: I accidentally dropped mine less than 3 feet from the floor (imagine coat pocket to floor distance) with its protective casing on - and now the battery cover does not snap back into place. Also FM reception is very poor - there is no reception even on the 2nd floor of a 3-story building.

<Title>Among the fields of MP3's... the Zen Nano stand basically equal.
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With 93 customer reviews, I somehow doubt I will write anything that hasn't been said at one point or another.  But what I feel I have to offer as a reviewer is real life experiece of the Nano during a day at the farm... quite literally.  The biggest advantages of flash-memory players are light weight, small size and robust design.  In my proffesional life I spend much of my time either on a tractor or doing physical work that is too often rather dirty.  And, as my cell phone can attest, I make no effort to go easy on my gear.  The Nano has numerous advantages going into this arena.  It it made of tough resiliant plastic and has a semi-thick crystal screen.  The buttons are small but well recessed so they don't spend all their time getting caught/crushed or mangled.  Only the thumb wheel seems likely to be damaged and it is about equal to anything I have owned so I still have no complaints.  More over, the Nano, unlike some more expensive MP3 devices, uses an AAA battery, which is a great boon when work goes long and I am far away from my computer.  Rather than being left with 18oz of worthless MP3 player on battery discharge, I slap in a new battery and keep going.  Now here are the problems.  The Nano is small... that I said.  But it is also SMALL.  The buttons, the plugs and the display are small.  The battery panel is small.  Even the included cord is small.  About the only things not small are the rather low quality ear buds with that near worthless felt cover that comes off within hours of use.  Added pain comes in the form of the belt clip for the Nano.  It is a rubbery clear and overly flexible cover that fails to protect the player from anything but falling straight down... and even then the Nano could still come to harm.  Also, the protective belt clip hold the Nano only on the back and one side, meaning it can easily become dislodged despite the sticky nature of the rubber.  Worst of all, it does nothing to protect the player from the dirt and grime that tends to find its way into my pocket and in fact focuses it near the audio in jack.  Despite all this, my Nano has survived several months and I expect it toi last longer still... baring my losing of it.  Although it has shortcomings, those I have illuminated and those in other reviews... the Nano is a well-built and inexpensive MP3 player that I have come to respect.

The rubber cover adds a quarter inch to each dimension, and gives a secure clip for clipping the unit onto a pocket or a thin belt.  It also comes with an elastic arm-strap so you can clip strap the unit to your arm.  Also supplied are a USB cable, and a line-in audio cable.  The rubber cover doesn't prevent access to anything other than the battery compartment.  You can even hook up the USB cable, or the line-in cable, without removing the device from the rubber cover.  The unit can't really be operated with gloves on, except perhaps for the play/pause button and the volume buttons.  Pros:  Great sound.  Given good earphones, you'll be happy with the sound. Great display, with a great backlight (I don't get any weird sound with the light on, as another reviewer reported). Great UI.  Very easy to use.  Just enough features without too many. Great battery life. REPLACEABLE battery!  I use NiMH rechargeable AAA batts, and they work great. Auto off if left in pause mode (can be disabled). Acts like a plain-old thumbdrive.  No special PC software needed.  Will store any file (regardless of whether it is a playable sound file). Saves your place when it shuts off.  Great for lectures/audiobooks. Four audio classes: Normal music files from your computer (mp3/wma), FM Radio, ADPCM Recordings (made with the internal mic, or from the FM Radio), and Encoded files (mp3s recorded from the line-in jack). Lots of play modes: Normal (alphabetical by file path including folder name and file name), A-B repeat, track repeat, repeat all, repeat folder, play track then stop, shuffle repeat, shuffle once, shuffle folder.  Cons: Shuffle mode re-initializes whenever the unit turns on.  So, for example, if you are shuffling a 16 song album, and you've played 8 songs so far, shutting off the unit will forget which 8 songs have already been played. No support for playlists.  Normal play is in alphabetical order of the file path.  So make the track number be the first 2 digits of the filename. Voice recording (using the internal mic) is a 32kbps ADPCM WAV file.  It's mono, with 8000 samples a second, so 4kHz is the highest frequency it will record.   FM recording is a 128kbps ADPCM WAV file.  It's stereo, with 16000 samples a second.  So 8khz is the highest frequency you'll hear. ONLY by sending sound into the line-input will you be able to create MP3 files with the Zen Nano Plus. There's no input for an external stereo mic.  You must amplify your mic to line-level and send the signal in that way.  Conveniently, most headphone outputs from cassette recorders or MD recorders suffice.  Just send your mic through your old recorder, and plug the Zen Nano Plus (using the supplied cable) into the old recorder's headphone output.  This is clunky, but it does work.  Of course, better preamps and mics will give you better sound.  The sound of the resulting mp3 file is good, but not as good as if you'd created it on your computer (the mp3 compressor is running off a single AAA battery -- give it a break!).  All around, the Zen Nano Plus 1GB is a great unit with a fantastic feature set for the price.  I'm extremely happy with mine.

<Title>Does the job it's meant to
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST OF ALL THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A NECKSTRAP!!! There is a misprint above, it comes with an armband - not a neckstrap. I was aware of this so it's fine with me but thought I would warn others.   In regards to the product itself I read all the professional reviews and this was basically tied with the ipod shuffle for best sound quality in the flash player category. If you are an audiophile looking for perfect sound you should get something more robust, because the sound in these small players can be slightly muddy. How to correct this? As with all portable players you need to toss the headphones that come with it. The Creative headphones are average and aren't really made to stay in the ear during workouts or running. If you are considering purchasing an ipod shuffle they will tell you the same thing - default headphones are always cheap. There's a huge difference in sound quality if you upgrade them to something better so it's highly recommended you do this.   I bought the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones for this purpose. They sound great and stay in place while running. For walking around or light house-work I also bought the Sennheiser PX 100's which have even better sound and are more comfortable for longer use.   The armband that comes with this is great and you don't have to pay extra for it like you would with an ipod. I also own an older 256mb version of this product. It received alot of abuse but still works fine. It also comes with a rubber housing so if you bang your arm against the wall it won't break. Operating the unit is a no brainer, you just attach the USB cable to the player and your computer. It then acts as a hard drive which Windows will automatically read. A little window will pop up asking if you want to open files in the removal disk. Then, all you have to do is drag and drop your MP3 files and you are set. It comes with a CD with software but it's not really necessary. The software does have an owners manual that is much better than the written documentation that comes in the box so you may want to install it anyway.   A prior reviewer complained you could not put songs in folders. This is not true. You can organize your songs in folders on your computer then simply drop them into the player. When you want to change folders during use just press in the wheel and select "skip folder." You can then rotate the wheel to the folder you want. There are many options available, for example you can set it to play random songs or you can play them in order. If you like to play folders in order you may want to put a number in front of each folder or it will play them in alphabetical order.   There are several equilizer presets such as classical, jazz, rock, or custom. I set mine to normal because I read that you lose a little sound quality to distortion if you use a preset. Battery life is good, I didn't count the hours of use but it lasted quite a long time and the batteries are small and cheap so is not a large concern. I wish however the armband had a small slot in it to hold an extra battery. It's a bummer to run out of juice while on the trail or in the gym but that's a picky complaint.   There are other goodies as well such as FM radio, microphone to record voice and even mp3 encoding capability but I have not tried them out. I only use as an mp3 player.   The bottom line is that if you are looking for a player to take with you to the gym then look no further. It has good sound, good battery life, good options, good armband, and is easy to use. What more do you want?

<Title>Does the job
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hey, it's cheap, it's reliable - what more do you need? It's not a fancy I-Pod, but if all you need is something functional that stores and plays music, this may be it. The sound quality is good. It's tiny and lightweight so you can use it while exercising. I hook it with a cable to my car's music player so that I never run out of music on long trips. It's powered by an AAA battery that lasts pretty long (although I wish I could recharge the unit). The software is intuitive and easy to use. The display is small and hard to read, but that's why it's inexpensive. Another minor irritation is that you have to press the "on" switch for several seconds before it turns on. Overall, a good deal for the money.

<Title>No reset button, Nano Plus died
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've used the Nano intermittantly.  I use my big Creative Zen player (30 gig) most of the time, and I'm very happy with it.  I joined a gym and wanted a smaller player to listen to while excercising, thus the Creative Zen Nano Plus.  Originally I had no problems.  However, recently I unplugged the device after syncing it to my computer.  Since then the Nano will not turn on.  Changing the battery hasn't made a difference.  No screen display at all.  I haven't been able to find a reset button, and the manual doesn't mention one.  Darn it anyway.  I liked it while it worked.

<Title>Best Unit I've Tried for Listening to Radio Talk Show Files
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought the Zen Nano Plus, and am thrilled with it.  It has pretty much everything I've been looking for, to suit my narrow purposes (listening to downloaded radio talk shows and other speech-based programs; plan to also use audio books in the future).  I've found no other unit of comparable price and size that meets all my requirements.  The BEST part, for me, is the fact that it will scroll backward or forward through a track quickly, AND it will "resume" where you left off. I haven't found any other machine in its class that will do BOTH.  Here's my rundown:  Pros:    1. Uses a single AAA battery, not a proprietary one you have to recharge.  Otherwise, if you're away from home and the battery runs dead, you're out of luck until you can get back to the charger.  This is important for long flights, use around town, etc.  (I never leave home without one of these babies any more; having my radio shows or other downloaded programs makes waiting in the grocery store line downright pleasant!)   2. RESUME function: Turning the machine back on after being switched off "resumes" from where you left off within a track.  Great for audio books, lectures, sermons, or recorded radio programs.  (Note: It does NOT "bookmark," meaning it does not allow you to insert marks into a track so that you can easily get back to several different points, but I don't think any of the flash-based mp3 players have that feature.  At least I haven't found one that does.)   3.  You can set the machine to play the tracks in all kinds of ways, the one most important to me being that you can set it to play just one track and then shut itself off (great for going to sleep).   4.  It's tiny.  The only machine I've ever owned where the earbuds plus cord = more square mass than the unit.   5.  FAST SCROLL: If you hold the scroll button to FF or Reverse, it moves faster and faster through the track the longer you hold it.  This is a really important feature for my use, because occasionally I hit the scroll button the wrong way and get sent back to the beginning of the track, which for me can be more than an hour long.  With my old Sandisk unit, it used to take me several minutes to scroll through a whole track; now it can be done much faster.   6.  Transfers my longer radio show files reasonably fast, using Windows Explorer drag-n-drop function.  I did have to install the software to get my late-model Dell notebook computer (XP) to recognize the unit, though.   7.  Nice looking.  As if most people care.  It feels cheap, but looks expensive.  I'm sure I would like these types of units better if they didn't feel like they were completely empty.  But they're all like that.   Cons:    1.  Because of its miniature size, the buttons are very small, but I have small fingers, so it's not much of an issue to me.  Could be a problem for bigger hands, though.   2.  Battery lid is flimsy, hard to get open, and will probably break soon.  Good reason #135 to buy the extended warranty.     3.  LOCK feature is not handy; you have to do some scroll/select functions to make use of it.   If you're on the go a lot, with the unit in your pocket, this can be a useful feature if not too cumbersome to get to.  4.  Unit takes 4-5 seconds to power up.  No big deal, but it's the longest of any I've tried.   All in all, a great little machine.  I just got it, so can't speak to its durability, but in my experience none of these types of units last very long.  My advice: buy the longest instant-replacement warranty you can, on whichever unit you choose, and get it in a store near you rather than online, where you'd have to send it back.

<Title>lot of features in small package
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned a Zen Nano for a couple of months and it has been a fun little gadget. I was surprised to find the FM radio tuner to be reasonably sensitive for something with no external antenna, it pulls in a lot of stations. It turns out that you don't have to even bother installing the software CD that comes with it onto your computer. When you plug the Nano into a USB port it looks just like a flash drive, you can see it in Windows Explorer and simply copy songs directly onto it and manipulate the files any way you want. That's very handy. You can delete songs from it using the jog wheel if you get tired of them. Sound quality is good, battery life is also good.  I do wish the display was a little larger. You need good eyesight to be able to see what icons are selected as you scroll through the functions with the jog wheel. I also wish I could switch from "play songs" mode to "FM tuner" mode with one button instead of scrolling through functions with the jog wheel.  I am noticing that a lot of MP3 players are coming out now that have similar features, I wonder how they compare with this one. For example you can get a Xtatix Pocket Candy player with 2GB RAM, FM tuner, etc for about the same price.

<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With all the hype around MP3 players, it always seems to be a choice between the Ipod, and everything else. Not everything else seems to actually deliver. That is definitely what I found ou with Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus MP3 players. Although the player is very lightweight and convient in price, I just ish I could say that for the player on its own. This MP3 player doesn't really work with my Windows XP laptop computer, although it did wih my previous Windows ME edition operating system. I was very dissapointed. Although the player handles well wthin the software it delivers, where you can burn music, and convert your files into MP3, windows media, or traditional wav formats, the zan nano plus, sadly misses out on files you download from sites like rhapsody, and musicmatch.   All in all, I absolutly recommend this purchase, only for the software, not te MP3 player on its own, because it malfunctioned on my computer. Instead, try another MP3 player like the Ipod, or something that really can work on music downloads.  Price: C  Convience: D  Easy To Operate: D  Software: B-  Overall: D+

<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Reliable, easy to use and many features  The Creative Zen Nano Plus with 1 gig memory has proven to be an excellent MP3 Player.  I did what most people suggested and turned off the backlight and replaced the bud earphones.  Without the light the single AAA battery lasts an amazingly long time--at least 20 hours.  The Creative software is simple and makes it easy to load and manage the files from your computer.  I found the simple controls on the Zen fairly easy to learn and use.  The unit's small size, that fact that is has both a microphone and radio receiver makes it an excellent all-purpose portable electronic device.  I did a lot of research comparing MP3 players before buying the Zen and so far it has met or exceeded the high ratings it has received.

<Title>MP-Do - Great player at great price
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great player at a great price. It's target niche is in the size and price factor of the Ipod Shuffle, Sandisk M Series, and others. In comparison, to the perennial industry fave, the Zen Nano Plus offers comparable storage, compatibility with online retailers using MP3, WMA, or WMA DRM Plays For Sure files, the ease of direct file drag-n-drop compatibility (i.e. no need to use cumbersome interface software like iTunes or the like), FM radio tuner, and Creative support and service peace-of-mind.  Concerning Michael Lerner's MPDon't Review: The ipod does not play Rhapsody or Musicmatch files but only tunes imported solely through its cumbersome iTunes interface for conversion to its proprietary format prior to storage on the player. All the other issues identified are tied to a specific's user hardware and or configuration which could prove as problematic for the Ipod (and the reviewer does not indicate if an ipod was purchased or not and if the same compatibility issues arose or not).

<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is amazing in terms of quality and value. For a mere $65, I have managed to fit over 600 songs, and I also have used it as a backup for some files when I was having computer issues. I have had this product for about 8 months and it is still going strong. I have ran in rain, snow, etc... and it hasn't gone faulty on me. The only issue I take with it is that the battery cover is flimsy, and it will not latch any more. The solution is simply to keep the rubbery cover that the player comes with and it keeps everything in place. Other than that, this by far beats the competition out there. Unlike iTunes or any other junk player, it is not intrusive and it does not change the format of your music library or force you to install ridiculous software. I love this product!

<Content>This is a very good deal for the money.  Everything comes in the box, ready to go.  You get a decent armband and it has a radio function.  Includes a halfway decent skin and earphones...even the first battery.  I love it - except for my situation.  I bought it for my wife's birthday, thinking I could add her onto my subscription through Napster-to-go.  WRONG!  It doesn't have that capability.  It has great sound, and the functions are easily interpreted, so it's great for all of it's other functions, just not the one I bought it for.  It DOES work with Napster, just not the subscription portion.  Since it was advertised that way, I kind of felt that Creative was deceptive, but it's my fault for not going to the next level of reasoning I guess.  Anyway, great product for all other functions.  Nuff said.

<Content>Yes it's small...but that's exactly what I love about this player. It easly fits inside of the palm of your hand or in your t-shirt pocket or in you work-out shorts...perfectly! The sound you get out of the ear-buds (included) is amazing!...very good highs & lows...especially when it's set to "rock" on the equallzer. It has many options...you can easily "dial" into whatever you what on the thumb control. very good volume controls too and you can see the whatever your doing on the display. Surprisingly you can see everything quite clearly on the small display. The FM tuner work well too...lots of "pre-saves". I haven't used every option on the MP3 player yet (there's alot), but I very satisfied with what I've tried so far. It would be nice to have more memory on this player but then again I didn't want to pay over $50 for a 1 GB player w/ a FM tuner and so many other features. I highly recommend the Creative Zen Nano Plus Player.

<Title>Itsy-Bitsy, Teeny-Weeny, Little Blue mp3 Player
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really love this little gadget. I have no interest in spending the mega bucks for an iPod, but I wanted an mp3 player to take with me when I fly, and for walking, etc.       I scanned numerous products and reviews before I settled on the Zen Nano. It seemed to have everything I was looking for, including pretty good user reviews and a good price for what you get.     What you get: A really versatile mp3 player that's smaller than a Zippo cigarette lighter. My family couldn't believe how eensy it is. But that makes it easy to transport in a purse or backpack. An armband is included, but I don't use it.     The Nano has flash memory, which means the user can save music files on it, or with the USB cable, use it for storage as a flash drive. Flash memory is super-stable, so that's a plus if someone needs it in that capacity.     1GB of memory will hold about 500 songs, which is plenty for most people. The Nano also has a voice recorder and an FM tuner which works very well.     It will not, absolutely will not skip.     I haven't had any problems with the battery compartment cover, but forewarned is forearmed. I am very careful when changing the batteries. I get about 10 hours from a AAA alkaline.     It's a feature with all these sorts of players, but be careful how you name the song files when you load them up. All the tracks labeled "01" will play first, in alphabetical order. There are ways to get around this, but bottom line: if you want all your album tracks to play in sequence, pay attention to the file names.    Cons: Cannot scroll from one album to the next, only between tracks. The instruction manual could also use some work.    No accessories available. I'd like another cover for it, but so far, Creative Labs hasn't offered one.    Naturally, the earphones are blah. I like the blue around the ear version by Sony, myself, and these are what I use.    Still, these are small things, and not enough to drop a star. This is a fine little player that does the main thing I want it to do: play my favorite music. I happily give it 5 stars and tell the Creative folks they've done a good job.

<Content>This thing is great! It's easy to use, uses replacable batteries, holds an enormous amount of music, and works great in the car with a Belkin FM Transmitter. I don't use CDs in the car any more - I can load what I want on here and avoid all the CD-in-the-car issues. Perhaps the greatest part of all is that you don't have to use Apple's software - just copy files in mp3 format in windows explorer and you're in business!   I don't have a single complaint. What I don't understand is how iPod comes off as being so great when it's so pricey, you can't replace the batteries, and you have to use special (Apple) software (I tried it and it took over my computer).  About the Belkin FM Transmitter - mine came without a cigarette lighter plug adapter. I got parts from WalMart and Radio Shack and put one together for about $3.

<Content>Positives:  Over all a very good product for the money.  Sound quality is exceptional. Very convenient.  FM radio receives better than my stereo boombox!  I like the inclusion of the many accesories.  I also like the back light, voice recorder, EQ, etc. features. Definitely a keeper.  My wife loves it.  Neutral: When recording songs from a CD player via "line-in" using MP3 encoding, the sound quality (like other systems) is noticeably diminished.

<Content>This is perfect for my needs. I mostly listen to books on tape downloaded off audible on this, and it will hold a bookmark where I left off even if I listen to something else on the player. It's so great! The battery life is just as advertised, 16+ hours, or a whole book! And it even keeps the bookmark even if you let the battery die. 5 stars all the way!

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a well designed product. I  don't use the headphones which came with it, I have a pair of better quality headphones and the sound when playing MP3s is very good, better than the Sony Walkman CD player I used to use to listen to music.  It's very easy to use. I like that you can just drag and drop files onto the Zen without having to install any special software. The controls are also easy to figure out. I previously had a SanDisk mp3 player and it was hard to navigate through the menus because it was never obvious which button you needed to press. Other good features are that it plays the songs in order of file name (unlike the SanDisk I had) and if you power off and power on it will resume where you left off. I like that it uses a standard AAA battery.

<Content>I bought this for my 12 year old son, he started to use it without reading the instructions within a few minutes. He is just a regular kid, but the device is so easy to operate he did not need to read the instrcutions. (I told him to read it anyway to get the full benefit of the device) He said it is way better than his friends ipod. I recommend it to everyone.

<Content>I can't say more than my header.  This little baby is easy to use, handy, and so far pretty durable.  As a heads up though if you are looking to buy this product do keep in mind that it is only 1 GB, which may be smaller than you think, unless you turn down the quality of the files you put on your player.    Otherwise an amazing product and for most people that 1 GB will be enough.

<Title>Great device, but user manual sucks
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my nano for about a day.  The music sounds great with the ear buds, and even better with my headphones.  For the price, the machine is great, plus I like making the statement that I'm not a slave to fashion a la ipod.  I have large fingers, so the controls are a little hard to use for me, but like when I first used a mouse, practice helps a lot.  I have figured out that, like a mouse, the speed in which you press (ie:  "click") the control wheel is critical.  The FM radio works OK, but reception does suffer when indoors.  My only complaint is the user's manual is terrible.  It provides the basics only, and does not give step-by-step instructions.  I had hoped for an expanded user's manual on Creative's web page, but it appears all their energy was spent on selling their products, and not after purchase support.  I have also purchased one of their sound cards before, and the user guide was about the same, in other words, hope you figure it out yourself.

<Title>Wow! - Great Value
<Date>Wed Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Nano was a Christmas gift.  I wanted to have some time with it before I wrote a review.  I did a lot of comparing before I put this on my Christmas list.  I am very impressed with the size, sound quality, and ease of use.  I originally put 10 albums on it and yesterday added 6 more.  It will probably hold another 5 or so albums.  Since it is only 1 gig I will start rotating out music when it fills up.  I tried the Creative software and was not very impressed.  I am using Windows media player 11 and meshes very well with the Zen.  I considered an Apple Nano but the Zen won out because of the built in FM radio and of course the price.  I originally thought I would need to upgrade the headphones but these are more than satisfactory.  I am hearing a lot of back-round stuff in the music that never stood out before.  Some songs sound so much better, I think I am hearing them for the first time.  Some people complained that they did not like the play back options, I am very happy with them.  You can go into the folder menu and each album is listed.  Albums can be played in original order, random within each album, and random for the whole library.  I also use the included accessories a lot.  The Zen came with an armband and a protective silicone case.  This is probably the best $60 gift that I got in along time.

<Content>This player does everything I need in a mobile music device. The storage capacity could be greater but it holds about 19 complete cd's of music. The original headphones leave a lot to be desired so I replaced them with a Phillips set that will stay in my ears while working. These headphones increased my battery life 3 fold due to not needing so much volume. I thoroughly enjoy this player, it seems to be durable as it has hit the concrete floor twice at my work and was unaffected.

<Content>If you're very very very careful, this might work for you.  But if you need something durable that will last, look elsewhere.  I really like the menu layout of this player, and for now it works great.  But the scrolling button is very cheap plastic and seems like it won't last long.  Sometimes it catches.  I've already broken the dust cover where the usb cable is inserted.  The plastic piece that holds the battery in seems very cheap too; I don't expect it will last long.

<Title>A great little MP3 player and voice recorder
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use my MP3 player mostly for listening to audiobooks. I was looking for a player that would allow me to stop at any point and resume quickly. This unit fits the bill perfectly. While there are no bookmarks, you don't need them. It's better. All you do is shut it off. When you turn it back on it starts where you left off. Perfect for my needs.  The software allows you to quickly put each track in order by putting a tag in front of each track. Very quickly and easily. You don't do it manually.  In addition, you can easily make voice recordings. I find the sound great. Of course, the sound in any MP3 player is only as good as the headset or earphones. The phones that come with the unit have a good crisp sound but I don't like plugs in my ears as I have keen hearing and they hurt my ears. So I use a headset that fits over my ears. You have to search for phones that sound good to you. Of course, the ones that come with the player may satisfy you just fine. They are decent.  I did call support three times and got right through. Their support is pretty good. The manual and help that comes with the unit and in the software is not good or complete. And the software takes a bit of learning. I had to use several different software applications to get going. But once you get used to the software it's pretty easy to use.  This is an inexpensive player and wonderful for you audio book listeners. To me 1gig is a lot of space. For some of you it isn't much at all. So consider your needs before you buy. I get all I need from this player and hopefully will have it a long time. Before this I used a RIO 500, which shows you how long I tend to use a player.  Oh, it does have an FM radio. I don't use that but it is a nice feature. I wanted something basic and this fits the bill.  I highly recommend the Zen Nano Plus.

<Content>After having no success with a Sandisk Sansa C240 (see my review of that) we decided to go for Creative.  We should have just done it to begin with as I've owned nothing but Creative and iRiver in the MP3 market (Nomad Jukebox, Creative Zen Vision) and they all are fantastic.  No problems at all.  EVER.  The first thing you notice about this is it feels solid.  This little player while light, has a good weight.  It sounds great and comes with an armband.  That's right, comes with an armband.  That will save you $25 right there.  If you workout, look no further.  This is the MP3 player for you.  Very tiny buttons and a somewhat confusing interface to work through keep it at just under a 5 star rating.

<Title>Recording Lectures
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since no one has talked in detail abt recording capabilities of the player, I shall talk mostly abt it. It records in ADPCM (not the usual Wav) in 4 bit , but is not as bad as 4 bit wav . I use it for recording lectures, if the prof speaks LOUD and clear it does a decent job but if the prof speaks too fast or too soft, then the recording will not be very clear, (with loads of noise) I would also suggest using a free tool like wavepad [...] to do amplification and denoising.  The verdict: As an amateur tool it is fine, but if u want professional lecture recorder, look at better options, but i have to say it does help me do better at class.  P.S : I havent used any recorder before, take my advice with a pinch of salt.  P.P.S : Personal memos / conversation/ meetings workout perfect.  4 stars because of the noise

<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this a replaced mp3 player as (un)fortunately I have too much burned music in WMA format. Unlike two of my earlier players, this has the 'plays for sure' tag on it which ensures that purchased music will play correctly. The 1gb memeory I thought was hugely big, but I've got about 240 songs on it and it's pretty full....now maybe I should have gone to 2gb?! Battery life is great. It says 17 hours or so, and it may be that or better. The small size is great and the exercise strap is key for a runner. No regrets on the $70 or so that I paid for this (dec 2006).

<Title>Thoughtless interface, poor documentation, useless web site
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>On the plus side, the sound is good.  The documentation is the worst I have ever seen:  it doesn't even cover the menus and icons that appear in the product's screen.  The web site is no better at basic information, and stingy on any other details.  After much experimentation and digging through online help, sparse web info, and other user's blogs, I discovered that the device plays tracks in alphabetical order only.  Creating playlists does not help.  You must rename the track files according to the order you want, and create a folder on the device for each playlist or album.  The software helps somewhat by renaming files with the track number as a prefix, but this prevents intermixing tracks from different albums in any playlist.  Then forget about changing the order later, unless you want to manually rename each track file.  A tree of folders can be created on the device using the software, but nothing in the player's interface supports this type of access.  An A to the sound engineers, C to the interface designers, D to the webmaster, and F to the documentation writers.

<Title>Perfect for the money.
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: Very inexpensive for those of us who don't want to sell our souls just to buy an MP3 player. It has everything I need in a very small package. I don't need 40 gigs of storage, I can live with ONLY 240 songs. Also, it takes a AAA battery rather then having to recharge it through a PC USB port, so you can replace the battery when you might be away from your computer. And most important: Sound quality. It's absolutly GREAT. I love it- it is very crisp sounding- and the custom equalizer is awosme.  Cons: It IS mostly plastic. Now although nothing has broken yet, it does make it feel a little fragile. Also, needing to replace the battery can be bad as well as good.  Overall: I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an alternative to an Ipod. It may be a bit of an underdog, but the sound is still great.

I have also noticed that it does take a long time to load the player.  However, if you are like me and leave the same playlists on the player for a few weeks at a time this isn't a big deal.

There's more than just iPods out there folks... and I like my Zen far better than any iPod.  the interface is awesome and simple  Because iPods have a special battery that wear out after a certain time, they require mailing it to the manufacturer and getting it refurbished.  On top of this, iTunes puts protection on every song making it so you can't listen to your music on anything else but an iPod, so if your iPod breaks, or you lose it, or the battery wears out [which it does, and you have to mail it in to get it refurbished] you have no choice but to get another iPod if you want all your music, if you buy a zune, none of your iPod music will play on it, and vice versa.  that's why I said screw the iPod, and the Zune... i'm getting a Zen, beyotch

<Title>Good Player For The Price-- With Cautions
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this player for a little over three months.  That is significant, as you will see.  It is an exceptionally full-featured player for the price, with line-in recording, autoscan FM radio settings, voice recording, etc.  Sound quality is good and it is easy to set up and load with music using Windows Media Player or the included software.  Battery life was also satisfactory.  That said, there are some cautions that a potential buyer should be aware of:  Being somewhat ham-handed, I found the scroll-wheel mechanism extremely difficult to use to advance songs and access menus.  If at all possible, you should try this feature out before you buy it to see whether it is something you can live with.    You should also be aware that the LCD display only shows the title of the song being played and does not include artist or album information.  The player offers no means of organizing the music that you've uploaded on it or creating playlists, so you must do that before loading by organizing your music into folders.  I didn't see that as a big deal when I bought this, but it was my first player and as time went on, I found it to be an annoyance.  Finally, and here is where the three months becomes significant, Creative Labs limits its labor warranty to only 90 days.  Mine failed after 100 days.  Customer service was very prompt and courteous, but there is a minimum "non-refundable US $25.00 diagnostics and handling fee" for them to even look at it.  To me, paying 50% of the original cost to have something repaired is not a good value.  I spent an additional $15 and bought a Sandisk M240 which is less full-featured, but overcomes most of the negatives that I noted with Zen Nano Plus.  I am delighted so far, but we'll see how it goes and I will post a review of that when I've had a little more experience with it.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player - especially for the money
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased this Zen Nano player to replace my Creative Muvo 512M player that was starting to wear out after 2.5 years.  I originally purchased the SanDisk SDMX3-2048 2 gig player to try something new, but when I got it I immediately returned it. Primarily because it did not offer folder/directories. You could sort your songs by artist, album, favorites, etc, but you could not do it by a pre-mixed folder, which is what I like to do.  So I returned it and bought a new Creative player since I was happy with my last one.  Pros  - Very easy to load. Just open up Explore on your PC and drag songs or whole folders into the mp3 player. Simple. - Folders. As I mentioned, I like to create folders that have a selection of different artists for different moods. Then I just move that folder onto the mp3 player. Then I can switch to the folder I want depending on my mood. - Fairly easy to navigate. The little wheel/button could take some getting used to for some people, but it really wasn't a problem for me, and once you are used to it, it's easy. - Price: $58 for 1 gig? I paid 100+ 2.5 years ago for my 512M player. 1 gig is a good size. It does not hold a ton of songs, but enough for me and my purpose. When I get tired of the songs it is easy to swap them out and put new ones on. - Battery operated. This is a pro for me. It requires just one AAA battery and lasts for awhile. I like being able to just pop in a new battery rather than finding a computer to charge it up again. This is imporant for me when I take it on vacation.  Con - This player connects to the PC through a small usb chord that comes with it. My old one was a usb device in itself. You just pulled it out of the shell and it had a usb connection that you connected directly to the computer. So with this one you will need to use a chord. But this is fairly minor. - I don't know if this is a con or not, as I am not aware how long other mp3 players usually last? But my current Creative mp3 player still plays music, but the button/wheel has worn out so I can no longer skips songs. When I try the player turns off. So now I can listen to it, I just have to listen to all the songs in the order I picked them. I cannot change folders either. But this happened after 2.5 years of pretty good use. So you will have to decide if this is a problem? I gave it 4 stars because of this, but would give it 4.5 if allowed.   Other: - If you like the radio. This comes with an FM Radio. I checked it out and it scans through the radio waves and creates presets for each station it can pick up. Then you can go through and delete the presets you don't like. Then you can just use the wheel/button to move to the next preset. Seemed to pick up radio stations pretty well.   - I have not used other features, such as recording, because I only use it for listening to music.   So to summarize. Battery operated, makes it convenient if you will be taking it with you and not having a PC handy to recharge it. Folders makes it easy to pick the type of music you want to listen to. Very easy to load. Does not take any software. If these pros sound good to you, then definitely buy this (or other size Creative player). If these are not that important, then it still may be a good mp3 to consider, but there are others out there too that you might want to check out.

<Content>after my 1st gen ipod shuffle crapped out i bought this after a friend told me he was happy with his. this thing makes that ipod seem like it came out of a cracker jack box. everything about it is better than any feature the ipod had. and the sound quality improvement was astounding! for about the third of the cost of an ipod you can't beat this mp3 player. and to give you perspective on it's size, it's about as big as a match box. mine came with the armband for use in the gym and running outside. even the armband is better than the ipod's. don't get caught up in the memory size either. i can't imagine needing more than 1gb. another plus is you don't have to plug this in to your computer to charge it. it uses one AAA battery. so you won't have to pay an extra $50 for a docking station to make charging convienient. this mp3 player will not disappoint, i highly recommend it.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted something small and convenient to carry around, whether at the gym or just to have in my purse without dealing with bulk. I couldn't afford an iPod so I bought this since I've had positive experiences with Creative in the past. It has worked beautifully from day 1. I've loaded entire albums onto it and use it at the gym. I also like the fact that it records (can use it to record meetings, lessons, etc) and has am/fm radio. People probably think it's an iPod when they see it and I don't mind at all. :-) I'll be giving this to family members as birthday/holiday gifts this year.

<Title>Great little unit
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Zen Nano plus for a little over 24 hours and I love it!  Once I figured out how to down load files from my music CD's and MP3 CD's, I have been listening almost non stop.    The good points:  Very clear play back with the supplied ear buds or mini headphones that I have from an old CD player.  I have down loaded and listened to everything from Classical to Hard Rock.  Also spoken sermons.  All are reproduced very clearly.  The bad points:  The supplied earbuds are too big for my ears.  They fit either very loosely, or so tight that they hurt..  They are definitely not comfortable for my ears.  I would suggest either getting another pair of more comfortable earbuds, or using head phones.  The only other complaint that I have is the instruction manual (or lack thereof).  It is only 5 pages long and gives only very basic instructions and some not very clear in my opinion.   I am not very tech savvy and have had to spend more time than I care to try to download files from my computer.  Especially downloading sermons from a MP3 CD proved to be a problem.  I finally figured out how to down load these files on my own..  I never found the instructions in the manual.  I would love to give this unit a 5 star rating and in many ways feel that I am being a bit too picky with my minor complaints..  The unit itself is fantastic and I would definitely buy another one once I wear this one out.

<Title>Nice MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: FM Tuner is pretty good quality. It pulled in all the stations I needed with ease. It comes with a belt clip and armband which is a nice touch if you use it while working out. Easy to use with no software required on WinXP. Just plug in and use like a flash drive. Great value for the money.  Cons: No playlist support. Not a big deal for me, but if that is a must have then look for a different player.  Also, I would have preferred buttons over the jog wheel control.  Other Thoughts: This is a nice little MP3 player. It's the best value for the money that I have found, and I really like the included belt-clip so I didn't have to spend extra $ for a case.

<Title>The other Nano
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I wanted something that didn't require device-specific software (no ITunes), used conventional batteries (vs. rechargeables, especially rechargeables only replaceable by the factory), had an FM tuner, and didn't have features intended for viewing photos or videos (wasted on me).  In short, I wanted a music machine.  This is the right player if that's what you're after.  When they make a 2Gb unit, I'll buy it, too.  Just don't bother with tech support--it's useless.  I managed to work out my driver problem on my own, though.

<Title>Very Happy with this Player
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this about 3 weeks ago after my 30gig rio crashed and burned after being dropped on a cement floor. All I can say is I totally love this thing. I bought the apple ipod shuffle 1st, and it sucked. All it did was shuffle, and it did a bad job of that. Worse than listening to am radio. The same songs about every 4th play. And no way to get to one you want. And about $30-40 more! And you must use the i-tunes program, which is a horrible monster, quickly deleated from my computer after returning the ipod.  The ONLY good thing about it was its sound quality and volume. I bought the creative after reading many reviews. It is so cool. You can browse for folders or mp3's of your choice. A biggie for me is no software needed. Shows as a external drive, and its just drag and drop. Has shuffle if you wish. I have never used that, so dont know how well it works. You can always create your own shuffle folder by putting a bunch of mp3's in a folder, right click, and then arrange them by size. This will mix them all up, and is easyer that renaming with #'s. The player has worked perfect for me with no poping sound are incompete playing of tracks. Just make sure theres nothing else in the folders but mp3s. No .jpg, mu file etc. One compaint i've read is it doesent have enough volume. The 1st time I used mine in a noisy enviroment, I was unhappy cause it wasn't loud enough. Turns out it was the headphones i was using. They werent sensitive enough. I went and bought a pair rated at 103db sensitivity,  and the player is plenty loud in noisy enviroments. The player doesent really seem fragile to me, like I've read in some posts. The toggle and buttons feel fine. There is a tiny flang on the batt cover, but just take care and dont leave it laying around. I use recharge, and they give fair playing time--about 8hr. I put in a non-recharge energizer, and only 1 bar was used after about 6-7 hrs. The rubber case with the clip seems pretty good. Gives a nice tight clip to your pants pocket, and looks like it offers good protection. The FM gives a good sound inside, but as you walk stereo will come and go. Not a biggy to me. Lots of presets. Ipod dosent even have a radio.This is a $60 unit, not $200. This player is a winner!!

<Title>Great MP3 player compared to Ipod Shuffle
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I switched from an Ipod Shuffle (the first generation that looks like a stick) to this MP3 player and am very impressed.  For the price, this player has many things the shuffle doesn't including a higher memory and an on screen display of the current song you are listening to.  Although you cannot select specific playlists this doesn't bother me because I couldn't do that with a shuffle either.  As far as size, sound and ease of functions I would say its about equal to an Ipod shuffle.  I love that I can see the song I'm listening to and that it can hold way more songs, this makes it better than the shuffle in my opinion.  Biggest drawback: batteries.  I use it everyday and the one AAA battery only lasts me about 2 weeks, I suppose if I got rechargables I could diminsh this cost a bit.

<Title>A+ for the Nano Plus!
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered my Nano Plus from Amazon on a Friday and received it Monday afternoon! Have to give HUGE kudos to Amazon for their EXCELLENT fast shipping! I wasn't expecting it for at least another four days.       When my husband loaded the music on it that I wanted, I got to play! And at first I was having a problem getting switched from the FM tuner to the music, but I figured it out realitively fast.       I really like this little Mp3 player. I used it at work and it performed flawlessly. I would have liked the sound to be a little louder, but I am looking at getting better headphones for it. (I was not using the ones that came with the player.) All the accessories were very cool too! You get ALOT for your money in my opinion.       This was the player that my daughter wanted, but she ended up with a muvo v100, which she likes well enough. I wanted the FM tuner on mine as well so I could switch between the two.      I haven't played with it a whole bunch yet, having only really had it a couple days, but I am loving it already.      The only thing that I wish I could have gotten was a different color besides dark blue. (I wanted lime green, but couldn't even order that from Creative's web site. It only gave white or dark blue as choices there.)Yeah- I know, it's a girl thing, wanting color. =)      Anyway, I look forward to listening to my music everyday with this little machine. It is absolutely wonderful! And so is Amazon! Thank you!

<Title>Does the job
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hey, it's cheap, it's reliable - what more do you need? It's not a fancy I-Pod, but if all you need is something functional that stores and plays music, this may be it. The sound quality is good. It's tiny and lightweight so you can use it while exercising. I hook it with a cable to my car's music player so that I never run out of music on long trips. It's powered by an AAA battery that lasts pretty long (although I wish I could recharge the unit). The software is intuitive and easy to use. The display is small and hard to read, but that's why it's inexpensive. Another minor irritation is that you have to press the "on" switch for several seconds before it turns on. Overall, a good deal for the money.

<Title>Solid product!
<Date>Sun Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST OF ALL THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A NECKSTRAP!!! There is a misprint above, it comes with an armband - not a neckstrap. I was aware of this so it's fine with me but thought I would warn others.   In regards to the product itself I read all the professional reviews and this was basically tied with the ipod shuffle for best sound quality in the flash player category. If you are an audiophile looking for perfect sound you should get something more robust, because the sound in these small players can be slightly muddy. How to correct this? As with all portable players you need to toss the headphones that come with it. The Creative headphones are average and aren't really made to stay in the ear during workouts or running. If you are considering purchasing an ipod shuffle they will tell you the same thing - default headphones are always cheap. There's a huge difference in sound quality if you upgrade them to something better so it's highly recommended you do this.    I bought the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones for this purpose. They sound great and stay in place while running. For walking around or light house-work I also bought the Sennheiser PX 100's which have even better sound and are more comfortable for longer use.   The armband that comes with this is great and you don't have to pay extra for it like you would with an ipod. I also own an older 256mb version of this product. It received alot of abuse but still works fine. It also comes with a rubber housing so if you bang your arm against the wall it won't break. Operating the unit is a no brainer, you just attach the USB cable to the player and your computer. It then acts as a hard drive which Windows will automatically read. A little window will pop up asking if you want to open files in the removal disk. Then, all you have to do is drag and drop your MP3 files and you are set. It comes with a CD with software but it's not really necessary. The software does have an owners manual that is much better than the written documentation that comes in the box so you may want to install it anyway.  A prior reviewer complained you could not put songs in folders. This is not true. You can organize your songs in folders on your computer then simply drop them into the player. When you want to change folders during use just press in the wheel and select "skip folder." You can then rotate the wheel to the folder you want. There are many options available, for example you can set it to play random songs or you can play them in order. If you like to play folders in order you may want to put a number in front of each folder or it will play them in alphabetical order.   There are several equilizer presets such as classical, jazz, rock, or custom. I set mine to normal because I read that you lose a little sound quality to distortion if you use a preset. Battery life is good, I didn't count the hours of use but it lasted quite a long time and the batteries are small and cheap so is not a large concern. I wish however the armband had a small slot in it to hold an extra battery. It's a bummer to run out of juice while on the trail or in the gym but that's a picky complaint.  There are other goodies as well such as FM radio, microphone to record voice and even mp3 encoding capability but I have not tried them out. I only use as an mp3 player.   The bottom line is that if you are looking for a player to take with you to the gym then look no further. It has good sound, good battery life, good options, good armband, and is easy to use. What more do you want?

<Title>The future is here
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is one of the best designed products I have purchased in years and certainly the best $60 I've spent lately. I wanted anything but an iPod, absolutely no iTunes or Quicktime, and too much space seems to introduce new problems like being able to hear and feel the drive, losing too much data when they freeze, navigation issues, and of course size, bulk, and weight. For a long vacation or the need for video the Zen Vision M, iRiver, or Zune might make sense, but regardless you still have to back stuff up somewhere else anyway, and 1gb stores about 20 albums which is usually enough for my purposes. Besides I can buy a portable DVD player with the money saved.   So for me it came down to a choice between this player, the SanDisk Sansa and the MuVo TX FM. But the Sansa was bigger and bulker than both and personally I won't be using this as a flash drive and liked the idea of being able to record streaming audio not available as an mp3. After using it for that purpose I found I had to raise the computer volume to max to be albe to do this, but the recorded quality does not sound distorted and is just as good as its source. The FM recording quality is also good; I've read reviews dismissing the FM receiver as just average but to keep things in perspective, it's a $70 cigarette lighter sized mp3 player/FM/recorder combo, what did you expect, short wave capabilities? FM reception is roughly the same as my Harman Kardon stereo receiver which is about 300 times larger yet it can't make digital recordings. I read somewhere that the RIAA has begun pressure to remove FM recording capabilities in mp3 players, which I don't quite understand since I remember making cassette tape recordings off the radio 30 years ago, but it's worth considering. File management, as mentioned by others, is so simple and head and shoulders above the rest. Aside from iPod, Creative are one of few makers who design audible.com compatible products, too bad for iRiver and Zune. Sound quality is great for the size, I'm a musician and consider myself an audiophile, just not a pedantic, obsessive one. Navigation is easy enough, backlight for me is fine, and even the standard headphones are not as bad as I was anticipating. The USB cover and navigation dial are made of gray rubber which as others have mentioned is kind of flimsy, but most of the electronics industry is using the exact same material one way or the other on hundred if not thousands of products, it's hardly limited to Creative.   The only things I can really complain about are the lack of playlist support (although that's solved by naming conventions) and the manual. It's pathetic. I assumed most people would have already mastered the complex task of sliding a battery compartment open and pushing in an AAA battery without graphics and written instructions, or else they wouldn't be able to operate a debit card or get themselves safely to a store to purchase this in the first place. What most people wouldn't intuitively know is how to navigate the menus and what all the different icons and options mean, and for some reason they left most of that out entirely. Fortunately the device was so well designed that you can figure most of it out on your own and if not you can google the online manual to answer most remaining questions. And lastly, there is a disclaimer in the manual regarding the sync cable that reads: "Warning: The cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling." Insert shocked emoticon here. Maybe someone at Creative should consider a more creative way to address that apparently serious issue rather than just intructing us to wash our hands after each use, as if!

<Title>An audio book listener's dream machine!
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Unlike most, I didn't purchase this MP3 player to listen to music (though now that I have it, I will probably put some of my favorite tunes on it!). Our public library offers downloadable audio books and I needed a portable device that would play locked WMA files. Through browsing the web I thought I would pay $200 - $300 for such a player until someone at the library recommended this one. WOW! Hard to believe such a tiny device can put out such crystal clear CD-quality sound! I'm hooked! The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I can't bookmark my place in the audio book (Solution is to pause your book, turn the player OFF. If you return to it within 24 hours it will pick up where you left off). Otherwise, I can't say enough about this tiny powerhouse of any MP3 / WMA player!

<Title>Great player for the price and features...ear buds need work
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great mp3 player for the price.  It's very small and great for the gym.  The sound is pretty good and you can customize the EQ.  To be honest I do not have any use for the voice recorder or to record the radio but I do use the radio often.    The only problems I had was with the driver's to load the music onto the device.  It would only fill up half of the 1 GB.  I believe it may have been an issue with my computer because it works fine now since I bought a new computer.    The earbuds have pretty good sound and are fairly comfortable but start to hurt over time.  The first pair I had didn't not last long as one of the buds died.  I replaced them with the same model I ordered from manufacturer's website.  For both pairs that I had I noticed that the foam pieces do not stay on the earbuds very well.    This player is very much worth the price but you may want to use your old earbuds or invest some money in better ones.

<Title>True Value for Money
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was happy with my Ipod mini till the hard disk died on me and sadly I was out warranty then. Quite dissapointed I decided to try other players in market before making second purchase of Ipod.  I was satisfied by Creative Zen Nano; it has built in FM which works fine if you are stationary. This product serves my purpose which was primarily to listen to music. Quality can be close second to Ipod if you use a quality headphone like Bose or Koss. However, I do get good sound just with my Ipod headphones. 1GB nano when compared to Ipod (of same capacity) far outnumbers the value additive features.   One thing that I did found much user friendly was the mp3 encoding facility inbuilt into these players. I guess I will have to dig more into the manual to know this. I recommend this product to all those who are price conscious and want appreciable quality of sound for what they spend.

<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a handy little MP3 player if you don't have the cash to buy one of those fancy iPods. It gets the job done and it sounds pretty good. Back when it was released, it was intended to compete with the Shuffle. It had an LCD screen and an FM radio when the pricier alternative didn't. Now it's just barely meeting status quo but costs a heckuva lot less.  It has one feature that makes it both superior and inferior at the same time. It uses 1 AAA battery which means you can replace the battery when it runs out of juice without sending it to the manufacturer. But it's not as convenient as plugging in at night to recharge. And the battery cover is pretty flimsy. The tab that locks it into place snapped off within a week. It is now secured with a very attractive beige rubber band requisitioned from work.  4 stars for an MP3 player that doesn't try to impress you with ground-breaking industrial-design and simply works.

<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> I really should have given it five stars on it's performance.  It's a great little unit, easy to navigate when you get used to it a little.  I got this for my daughter to replace the Sansa unit which locked after a day.  I liked this unit enough that I bought one for myself too.  The FM receiver is very clear, it works easily with drag and drop and it's more robust than I thought it would be based on the reveiews I read.  In my opinion, there is no comparison between these and the Sansa M200 series.  The only negative is that it doesn't have any search capabilities.  If you drag and drop folders, you can choose to go to another folder and then select the section within, but there is no choosing by artist, genre, or album.  I've gotten used to it and can find a selection quickly.  Have no fear, it's a nice little unit.

We don't have a ton of gadgets around the house, so it is possible that we are easily impressed.  Still, my 8 and 10 year old sons picked up the Nano and operated it easily.  None of us have read the directions (important criteria for us!)  I bought a second for a colleague who retired recently.  Hope this is helpful.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had it for a month now and I love it. It's small yet it packs a bucketload of music (1GB is enough even for 1week trips). I haven't tried the radio (though I've heard it has a shoddy antenna), but the recorder works well.  Menu is easy to use, I only wish the volume keys and the next/previous keys were swapped, then it would have been perfect.

<Title>It has opened up a whole new world to me
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use it primarily for Audio Books.  I listen to them while doing the dishes, while running, and sometimes right before bed.  The best feature is that when I turn it off, it remembers where I was and starts me right back there!  There's more than enough volume for me, and with a single AAA rechargeable battery, I'm styling for a good long time.  I took the Zen Nano on a trip, plugged it into my car stereo through an adapter (not included), and wiled away the miles listening to Old Time Radio program.  Beats looking at the plain landscape in TX.  1GB was enough for me.  I can fit a dozen or more Audio Books on the Nano.  I like that I can plug it straight into my computer without having some nonsense proprietary software to transfer files.  I haven't used the voice recorder function yet.  I assume it works, but I just have no need for it.  It also, apparently, will digitize a signal input.  That must be what that extra cable is for.  Don't need it, don't use it.  Probably works, though.  I tried out the FM radio.  It works, but who listens to radio these days?  I was really surprised by all of the features they packed into this mp3 player.  It even has EQ settings!  I actually use those.  I've been nothing but happy with this little gadget.  It sure makes the 20 minute drive to work easier to swallow.  Would I buy it again?  Damn straight!

<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriends son and he loves it.  Enough memory to hold a lot of music and at a great price.  Its also very sturdy.  The player went through an entire wash and dry cycle inside his pants pocket and still works like it was new.  Incredible!  It is also a cool feature that you can download music in real time directly from CD playres or between two MP3 players without a computer.  I also purchase two other identical players in other colors and they work just as well.

<Content>I got this with the intent of using it on my upcoming vacation. The battery life was great. I got a few days use out of it before I had to change the battery. Using the software was a bit of a challenge, but thankfully you can just drag and drop the songs you want right into the player folder. You can even make folders of music and choose between those as well as the songs within them. Great little player. Glad I bought it.

<Title>Great Gift for first Time MP3 Player 
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my grandson who has been wanting an MP3 player. I of course had to try it out myself first and fell in love with it! If you want a good MP3 player for someone who has never owned one before, this is it. The drag and drop file selection eliminates needing to install additional software in order to load the music on the device. The sound quality was excellent. I listen to a lot of books on tape (CD) and found that this unit comes with a trial offer to Audible (which I already belong to).I loaded one of my books onto the unit and enjoyed the mobility of being able to listen to my book while being able to move around the house freely. I love this! I plan on buying another for myself. It also comes with a built in mic and FM radio. The radio has very good sound quality, the mic is usable if you need to make a quick note but is not best for making important audio files. All in all, this was a great buy!

<Title>Nice player with just a few quirks
<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're hesitant to spend $300 on a nice IPOD because you tend to lose things and scratch them, get this Creative Zen Nano. It's a great buy for the money.  A nice player at a great price. Plenty of storage room, if you manage it. I use it for Podcasts and listen while working, running, cycling, and other times. Great sound quality, but relatively low volume with my cheap sony headphones. Not sure about the included headphones - I haven't tried them. Also, a nice protector /belt clip /arm band for runners, etc. Nice and small, not bulky like many of the Ipods.  My gripes: - as mentioned elsewhere, the battery cover is really delicate. I'm being very careful with it. - no simple way to lock it. My old Rio Forge had a slide switch to lock the buttons; wish the Creative nano had something similar. - to turn it on, you have to hold the button for a full 3 seconds. My time is precious; I have better things to do. Same for turning it off, but that's an expected interface feature (most players are the same way). - the included software is pretty weak tea. No podcasting ability; it seems to be just a nifty interface with Microsoft operating system vice stand-alone software. I don't use the software at all. It has a "fill 'er up" feature that randomly grabs music and fills the player. Not sure why anyone would want to do that...

The earplug cord was tangled with the strings of other clothes, and it took her 5 minutes to set it free. Amazingly, my CZNP just works as good as new. Not a single piece of music was lost or damaged. FYI, she used the gentle cycle and low heat.

Finally, the display text is so small that it's hard to read. I got rid of mine and bought an Ipod.

The printed instructions are kind of sparse, but the instructions on the software make up for this and are very complete.

<Title>A great little MP3 player
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although the instructions from Creative are not very illuminating most of the functions are pretty intuitive and it is a breeze to add music from my PC. The size is great (small enough to fit into a pocket) and the protective cover comes with a clip if you don't have a pocket. Although 1GB doesn't hold a lot of songs it works for my purposes and 1 AAA battery lasts me about three weeks of daily play.   One of the Zen Nano's selling points was the FM radio and it clearly receives the signal from my local NPR station, which is no small feat (my alarm clock radio has difficulty receiving the signal). I have not tried to record with the microphone so I don't know how well it works or the quality of the recording. The only thing that hasn't worked well for me is the earphones--they were uncomfortable and too big to fit into my ears so I had to buy another pair.  I highly recommend the Creative Zen Nano and am planning on buying one for each of my daughters.

<Title>The Size of a Pack of Gum
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, this is by far the most extraordinary thing I've ever bought.  Who would ever have thought that we could come up with something so tiny that would play music with such extraordinary sound quality, and lots of it!  I've had the Zen 1 gig player two months now and have hardly any complaints.  I'm mostly into classical music, and so a number of the files I listen to are large.  The capacity and function of the Zen player is not compromised by this, however, and I have yet to max it out.  The sound quality is great (especially with better ear buds), and the controls are easy to use and quite intuitive so long as you're not gadget phobic.  The included software is quite useable, but the player will interface with a PC very well without it.  Some people have complained about the flimsiness of the buttons and the relative "fragility" of the player itself.  The controls are pretty easy to read, and I think the buttons are more than strong enough for a product this size.  As for the player's fragility, the people who complained about breakage had also dropped it on a hard surface.  WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?!?!?  If electronic components come back ticking after they are dropped, you should count your blessings.  If they don't, well, you shouldn't have dropped it.  I travel a lot, and the player goes everywhere with me in my shirt pocket, zipped inside a carry-on bag, or clipped to my shorts in the gym.  The Zen works great everywhere.  The only real complaint I have (and it's small) is that I get more like 5 or 6 hours of play on a battery, not 11.  Not a real problem, but I am going to switch to rechargeable batteries the first chance I get.

<Title>Great alternative to ipod shuffle
<Date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I primarily use my Zen Nano Plus at the gym.  I listen to music and lectures/books.  It sounds great and it's a great alternative to its more expensive ipod competition.  I know because my wife's shuffle pales in comparison.   The player is easy to use.  Drag and drop simplicity was it's main attraction.     It's versatile and has good features for the price.  It plays MP3s and other formats--WMAs and WAVs.  It can be used as a USB drive, a voice recorder and it has an FM radio.  It's about $15 less than a 1GB shuffle--and a much better deal if for no other reason than the LCD screen.    It doesn't require proprietary software.  The single most hateful aspect of using an ipod is having to load that odious software on my PC.  My sole complaint is the little tab on the battery compartment.  (But for this, I'd have given 5 stars.)  Lots of others have complained about this thing breaking off.  It hasn't happened to me yet, but it IS very flimsy.  If the battery compartment won't close and other "stuff" gets inside, it's over.  The player won't last forever, but it seems a shame to invite its demise with this vulnerability.

<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this in every way except for the fact that I planned to do a lot of recording of lectures and so forth with it, and that idea is out.  The built-in mic is dreadful.  Even speaking right into it comes out sounding somewhat muffled, and there is a constant thump-thump-thump in the background as if I were using a bad tape recorder.  Standing just a few feet away makes a really really bad recording.  Also, note that there is no way to plug in an external mic. You're stuck with the built-in one.  Okay for recording a quick message to yourself, other than that, don't count on the recorder.  However, the music sounds great.

The first unit was defective, and after going through all of the hassle of getting a return authorization, shipping it back, and waiting for repairs, they sent me another defective unit [different unit, and a different defect].  Again, going through the hassle of an RMA and sending it back, after two months I finally got another new unit from them, but it was only a 512mb unit instead of the 1gb that I bought.  Again, more hassles calling a manager at Creative, getting another RMA, and having to send it back.  They didn't even offer to send me one until they get this one back, even after two months of not being able to use their product and all the hassles. Their poor quality is only surpassed by their incompetency in customer service.  DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS!!  A purchase that I definitely regret.

It's tiny, has all the features I need, is really easy to use, and has a great battery life.  The jogging strap it comes with works great as well.  I use it all the time.  Best of all, it's durable!  I ran it through the washing machine by accident and was sure it'd be toast.  I was planning to buy a new one from Amazon.  But after 4 days of drying out, it works just like new.  I'm amazed and very pleased.  A few days before that it got soaked while I was running in the rain and it survived that too.  It's a great little device.  I recommend it very highly! :-)

<Title>Almost 5 Stars - No IPOD needed  :)
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is a crowd pleaser... We set up the Zen Nano, quickly transferred music onto it, plugged it into external speakers and were shocked by the quality.... Audible quality is great. We played a song by Sting that we never realized had very faint instrumentals in the beginning of the song - but it could be heard on the Zen. Digital display is clear, you can scan to the songs that you want to hear, when you power off and on, the music starts where you left off and did I mention the quality is great :) We just downloaded 6 cds worth of music onto the Zen, and most of the free disk space is still available.  The ONLY reason it did not receive 5 stars is battery replacement. My husband uses the Zen on long commutes, so it seems the batteries are being replaced 2 times per week (AAA batteries I believe). But I imagine more selective use would result in the batteries lasting longer.

<Content>I love this little MP3 player!!!  It is the only one I have ever had and that is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars (I have nothing to compare it to).  It is very simple to use and it uses just one AAA battery.  I also purchased rechargeable AAA batteries and a charger so I don't have to keep buying AAA batteries.  This MP3 player is very small and has great sound.  I did purchase Sony earphones instead of using the ones that came with this MP3 player.  The ones that come with it are OK, but I wanted something with better sound quality.  Overall, this MP3 player is a great buy and much less expensive than the iPod.  Definitely worth the money.  I am very happy about this purchase.

<Content>Easy to use and good sound, convenient to carry. But the product manual is not meant for a novice and the headphones hurt my ears so I had to change them. Otherwise, the Zen Nano delivers.

<Content>I had bought an earlier version of this product - the zen muvo - earlier, and this upgrade is truly amazing in terms of features and sound quality. Not for users who like a good display, but it does what its supposed to do - Play Music, pretty darned well. The jog wheel can take a little getting used to but once you have learned it its quite convenient and easy. Love that it plays WMA files too because that means I can store double the number of songs with the same space. Having the radio and voice/line in recorder dont hurt too :-) One negative point is the volume buttons - They seem to be of cheap quality and rattle when the player is shaken. Thats a put off from an otherwise sleek and sexy player. Highly recommended.

<Content>This mp3 player more than fills the bill for me: worksite music with no commercial interruptions or having to constantly change cd's. Creative has a great line of computer audio gear, so I'm familiar with their electronics; I also like the ability to change the battery and not worry about a charger.  I have to agree with the other reviewers who've commented on the build quality, it does seem a bit light-weight, but I guess time will tell - so far, so good.  The earbuds are useless, as far as I'm concerned; they sound ok, but they keep falling out! (I've just ordered a pair of V-Moda's, which should solve that problem). The one thing that sent me over the deep end with this little unit is the sound through my Sony MDR-V600's (bought for use with my home stereo); I can't believe they actually power them with one AAA battery. As I'm typing this, I have the Zen set on the #1 (lowest) setting and it sounds great.  The software looks good, Creative's thrown in a few bells and whistles for you to play with, but, my audio library is all in the Windows Media Player, so I don't really need theirs. I did have some initial problems with migrating from the computer to the Zen, but that may have been my impatience. I finally just clicked the :F drive(Zen) icon and used that menu to transfer to the player.  I can't think of anything bad to say about the Zen, so I'll just say, if you're looking for an alternative to the Apple gear, this is it.

<Content>Very nice for the price. Lightweight and manageable.  The only problem is that for some reason,the battery cover breaks very easily, which makes it difficult to use at the gym.  The voice record and FM radio features make it the best deal in terms of the price and range of funtions.

<Content>The software is easy to install, directions well mapped out.  Size of unit is great- weighs next to nothing.  Ear phones could use a stabilizing brace--sometimes they fall out from my ears.  The volume controls are easy to access, sound is good against background noise (traffic).  The control knob though is too easy to mix up between a push forward (to the next song) and a push to get in to the other modes.  Sometimes I have to stop jogging to check the screen, push more buttons to get back to play mode.  Overall, I'd buy this product again and I am satisfied with its performance.
