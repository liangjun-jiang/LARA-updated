<Content>so when i bough this ipod nano. i called in to mack sure it is what im getting like there was a case pichtured in it and im like wow this is a great deal for the price the rep said that it would be coming with a case so i bought it and when it came i opened it and it had marks on the sceen and everything. it did not come with the case that was saposed to come with it i call them and i said whats the deal with the case and they were like it does not come with the case and i said why is it pichtured then there like to sell more so im like so ur cheating people to buy it thinkgin its going to come with a case. so i told them i want a case since it was in the photos. so they eneded up sending me a i pod case that doesnot even fit my ipod nano. they said they had shiped it and when i got it it was shiped a week later so they are just scammers trying to get your money so make sure you call them and make sure everything pichtured comes with it!

<Title>iPod Nano, first generation
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a shuffle and got an Nano for my children.  This product was refurbished and an older generation but this is what I wanted as my children are younger.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something that would likely be dropped dozens of times or even lost.  Love the iPod, easy to use, easy to sync.  Wish I had gotten one capable of playing videos but won't send it back because of that.  Product was shipped on time and arrived in stated condition.  No complaints.

<Title>I-pod is good
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Whats good about the I-pod nano is that its so small. You can fit it in your pocket with a slide. (unlike the big one witch you need a case for) I have been doing some research and i have found the i-pod nano is the best 1gb (2gb or 4gb) mp3 player. The mini has no color,the others are very expensive and arn't that portable as the nano. This is a great MP3 player to carry around. I recomend you buy it.

<Title>I love my nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for a birthday gift and it may be the best gift that I have even received.  It is incredibly easy to use and the sound is AMAZING!!! iTunes has been pretty simple to set up and purchasing songs is a little too easy...its hard to not get too carried away.  I am so excited that I found singles that I couldn't find on Napster.  The only sad thing is that I have a lot of purchased Napster tracks that I couldn't automatically transfer into iTunes.  I will try to burn them onto CDs and then import them into iTunes.  I definitely recommend the Nano for any music lover.

<Content>Just got my mine in the mail from Amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. And now, I am listening to each one of them. The quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. It's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. The little device is so light too. I mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. Lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) Enjoy!

<Title>good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>overall i found the 1gb ipod nano pretty good for everyday use. i can plug it into the car, or listen to it while at the gym. sound quality is above average. it has some simple games included too. since the i pods are popular by far, theres so many accesories available and to choose from. the downside is that the nano scratches so easily, so i had to cover it with a film and rubber casing. playing the games likes to drain the batteries because of the constantly lit screen. the other thing down the road is wondering how long the internal battery will last. i've heard apple customer service is very good from friends, so that's a plus. when i compared it to other players of this memory capacity and features, i found that the nano overall dominates, other than its nonreplaceable battery.

<Title>good and bad
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(to save some time read this) Pros - small, portable. - clear screen. - stylish. - automatic sync. using Itune. - include other programs(games,photo/slideshow,notepad.etc) - lock  Cons - deliget - too expensive( so as other accessories). - only Itune compatible. - only 1 GB ( comparing to 2,4,30,& 60 GB) - fingerprints are visible after using it. - unable to delete music from nano whitout using a computer. - a few bugs need to be fixed (the screen gets stuck sometimes).  (to get more info read this) i like ipod nanos, its easy 2 use, it looks cool, just like a mini version of a pocket pc.but the bad thing about it, is that it cost wayyy to much comparing to other mp3 makers. the only way to copy music to nano is using itune( and a couple of other 3rd party programs). itune rename the file name to 4 letter which makes everything more comfusing.i recommend getting a 2 or 4 GB nano because 1 GB is not big enough(around 240 songs).i also recommend getting something that protects the nano, fingerprints get on very easly. overall, i  think this is a good product.

<Title>Wading through the hype
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano is a good product, and a good value depending on what you're looking for in a music player.   First, the bad. Yes, it scratches and smudges easily. Even moderate handling is likely to leave your beautiful gadget hopelessly marred. That's a fact. I bought a case right away and still have some minor scratches on the surface. If you buy a Nano, buy a case (gel or otherwise) on the same trip--it will save you some trouble down the road. Second, the software needs a little tweaking. While most of the time, it works fine, I did experience a glitch here and there that mysteriously returns me to the main menu. It's not damning, but it can be annoying. Hopefully, Apple will fix this soon. Third, if you're dikkering, as I was between a Shuffle and a Nano, know that the Nano is a bit more delicate. I bought this for working out, and I do worry that I'll have to cash in my Applecare warranty more with this than I ever did with my shuffle. It has a screen, it's smaller, and it's more delicate.  Now, the good. First, it's gorgeous--flat out, a beautiful design. You will marvel at the screen and the impossible thinness. I also own a mini, and as lovely as that is, this is even prettier. Second, again, if you're dikkering between a Shuffle and a Nano, the battery life is quite good. I got about 11 hours on a single charge, and considering the bright color screen, this is great. Additionally, it holds a charge well between uses. Very little power seems to eke out. Third, you can use playlists. If you're like me, and have different playlists for different moods, the Nano is superior to the Shuffle in this respect. Finally, the screen. It's quite nice. I expected to not use it much, but find myself glancing at it constantly for the time of day and song titles (album art is a bonus).   So here's my recommendation: if you don't need your whole collection with you or are considering a shuffle, the Nano is also a great choice. Yes, the screen and front can get marred, but if you invest in a case, you'll be fine. The sound quality is great (better than my Mini) and the form factor is good for workouts or car trips. You really can't go wrong unless you need a higher-capacity player. Great product, overall.

<Title>The actual thing is great
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod is, without a doubt, a perfect Mp3 Player; especially the feature of scrolling the lists up and down with simply moving the tip of your finger around the wheel. But there is one thing, not about this actual iPod, but about the reviews that Amazon and other sources give to such things. It's when they say, like, "Memory holds UP TO (example) 240 SONGS". IS "SONG" A NEW UNIT OF MEASURING THE SPACE? I'm used to using bytes, kilobytes, etc. It is not only technically incorrect to estimate the number of songs that the memory can hold (a single song can be 2, 4, 7, 10, (...) megabytes big, depending on its length and format), but it also pisses me off whenever I hear or read something like that.

<Title>Just plain awesome
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After avoiding purchasing an MP3 player for some time now, I finally gave in and settled for an iPod.  The Apple 1 GB iPod Nano is the very first Apple product I have ever bought and put to use, and I have been more than satisfied with it since I got it.  The sleek design of the Nano sealed the deal for me; with an incredibly thin body and frame that slides right into your pocket.  I was initially fearful of it's fragility, but after everything I've put my Nano through, I must say that it is quite durable.  The 1 GB can hold up to 240 songs, which is more than enough for me personally, and isn't a bad deal at all for Apple's asking price.  If there's any shortcomings, it's that the selection dial can be too touch sensitive, and that it would be nice if the battery life were longer than the 12-14 hours of life, but those are only minor gripes at best for what you get here.  All in all, if you are looking to get your first iPod, the 1GB Nano is a perfect place to start.

<Content>My Apple iPod came in what appeared to be it's original box, witht the headphones, usb cable, booklet and software all wrapped up and sealed. The only gripe I have about this purchase is that there is a small scratch on the screen, so when I'm scrolling or playing games or viewing photos on the iPod, it is a little annoying. The product itself works great, the battery is very long-lasting, and the sound for the headphones is very nice. I just wish I knew about the scratch before I purchased it.

<Title>Just Buy It- It's worth it
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Considering the price, I was hesitant about buying th Nano. But Now that I have the ipod nano, its worth it.   Don't believe the lies that ipod nanos scratch easily and is not durable. Only morons scratch their ipods. It's been 3 months and I have not scratched my nano. I have dropped it several times and I have lied on it while I was sleeping (thousands of times). Buy a nice silicon, aluminum, or leather case and you're be fine. A good case will absorb the shock of dropping. Leave the plastic sticker on and your screen will be protected from scratches and other things.   When you first take the ipod out of the box, be careful. First and foremost, get a case and everything will be swell.   Ipod provide spectacular sounds and multiple useful features (games, calendar, stop watch, contacts, notes, clock: worldwide, shuffle, photos, and etc.). I really enjoy the "on-the-go" playlist option. The "on-the go" playlist allows you to make a playlist on the ipod.   The things I hate about the ipod are the short battery life and the headphones. The good thing is that these things can be easily fixed. Buy a car charger and home charger on ebay and a cheap high performing sony headphones at walmart and everything is good.   The ipod is enjoyable and itunes is really user-friendly.

<Content>I was hesitant about the nano after a VERY bad experience with the shuffle. I have had it now for about a month, and I dont see how I lived without it. It's size is amazing! It can fit in my pocket comfortably. The display is amazing it shows the albulm cover and you can also shuffle songs on the ipod nano. Uploading photos to the already user friendly iTunes, is a snap. If you have outlook express you can also upload your calendar to your ipod. With other features like games,  and a clock (just to name a few). The nano gives off great sound. The photo's look great on the ipod, I didnt expect such great quality. If you order from apple.com you can get a message engraved free, thats the only thing I wish amazon would offer. Anyways, GREAT BUY!

<Date>Thu Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Nano as an anniversary gift from my husband. He had it delivered to me at work. I usually leave the electronic stuff for him to figure out but this time I was too anxious to get it working. So I read the simple instructions, installed the software, plugged it into my computer and it was good to go!  I had seen it online before and I knew that it was going to be small, but I couldn't believe how tiny and cute that it was and the engraving on the back was such a nice touch.  I also love the photo album feature, its great to be able to show off all those personal pictures that don't usually make it off your digital camera.  One suggestion is to go out and buy a cover for it immediately and keep the plastic film that it came with on it until you do because the back does scratch really easily.

<Content>I have been wanting an MP3 player since they came on the market.  I wanted to wait a while to see if they would come down in price.  Finally, last month I got an email ad about the ipod nano.  I was very pleased with the price, so I bought one. "Wow," I have been blown away. I did not know how wonderful it could be having one.  I walk for exercise, and using a CD player was no fun at all, with all the skipping, you know what I mean. I am so impressed with the ipod Nano. The sound clarity is unbelievable.  I wasn't sure the sound quality would be there,  but it is way better than any CD player I have used. I can't compare it with any other MP3 since it is my first,  however I love it so much,  I plan on getting one for my son.  Best investment I've made all year. Folks you will not be disappointed. How can so much power be inside such a little device? I love it.

Why wouldn't you keep it in a case, there's so many different designs and colors out there. It's hard to resist buying a cover or case. The music quality is AWESOME. It holds 240 songs and can hold photos, too. I'm seriously thinking about updating to a Video iPod, because you get more out of it. This one is just music, excite your life with video too. If you're not a video person though this iPod is perfect for you. GO APPLE!!!

<Content>I gave this iPod only 1 star because besides the fact they are built nicely and that they are "classy and popular", they are misleading. Don't get your hopes up if you have many songs you plan on loading onto it. I cannot even get half the number of songs it advertises for (240) on mine. I do not recommend it if you plan on loading more than sixty songs onto your iPod, which most people do. Avoid the 1 GB iPod Nano and avoid hours of frustration if this applies to you.

<Content>I NEVER thought I would ever be writing a review for an ipod, but here I am.  I have done my research for mp3 players and though I found what I was looking for, only to be dispointed again and again UNTIL I bought an ipod!!     Although I do listen to a small amount of music I was looking for a mp3 player to listen to audio books.  I am in awe of this little thing.   I have gone though a Sandisk (is not EVEN book friendly!) and a Samsung (load 3 cds from the same book, it plays track1 track1 track1 , track2 track2 track2 and so on, so you have to ff 2 times what a mess)    Not with this ipod. I have 6 discs of one book on it right now and it will play the first one all the way through and then start with the next cd (what a concept!?) Feel like listening to music for a while? IT BOOKMARKS! Want to shuffle your music but dont want to hear your book, right well it knows the difference and does not shuffle the books! Wow smart and cute!   I had to do a small amount of trial and error to get around in itunes but it was pretty easy.  I was suprised with the amount it will hold too.  I had heard that ipods dont hold as much as other players but right now I have 7 full cds on there and I have not even used up 200mb! I have to admit it is kinda fun to use too.  All I heard about ipods (the bad stuff) I thought the last thing I would like is an ipod but I LOVE IT! I dont just fork over affection for devices easily either! If you are looking for an mp3 player that does it all BUY AN IPOD! TRUST ME! I started looking at the price and with all the others I had (not that much less, but not worth the pain at ALL!) and wish I would have bought this one FIRST!  Update:  Well my LCD has a line in it and has made it useless!  Apple does not cover the LCD screens even when the outside screen is NOT cracked.  I am now looking for another MP3 player and I am not going to pay Apples big bucks for something that only lasted less then a year!  I was told that it MUST have been from abuse.. It was working fine when I had it in my pocket while taking a walk I even paused it a couple of times to talk to my neighbors but when I took it out of my pocket to turn it off as I was walking up my drive way it looked funny, yet the glass part was NOT damaged AT ALL!!!! I would rather give my money to a company who does not make shotty products and then blame it on the customers!

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano.  Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150.  You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs.  If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>a great affordable mp3
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have done my reserch on mp3 i have also seen many "copycats" i saw something the other day called a tripod it said it was like 3 times as good as ipod nano for less i think it was a scam but it look just like one but a tad bit different. anyways nothing can stack up to and ipod maybe if they had one with a screen, i seen all of them and the dont got a cool screen like the others that why ipod cost alot,, (even though i am frustrated with the price) you can get 240 songs which is good for me because i dont have many songs. and it is 14 hours, that like more music then anybody needs for a day. so you can chrage it when ever..altough i heard cases of the batter dieing and you would have to get a brand new one so be aware of that..(get that insurance) and if you dont want ur screen runied id get a case i perfer cases from belkin..or you can get a skin clear is the best so you dont hide the beauty of your ipod. this is my post ----me----

<Title>Beating boredom during self-abuse
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must be the last person in the world to acquire an iPod. I mean, at 57, do I resemble the rhythmic human silhouettes gyrating to iTunes on the billboards? Be that as it may, however, I found myself laboring on the crosstrainer at the Y bored to death having to stare at either the cartoons on the wall-mounted TV or the wobbling flesh of the person running on the treadmill in front of me. (Contrary to popular myth, there seem to be few beautiful hardbodies at the gym, my bod included. And, those few present are dressed in shapelessly disreputable togs. Where's a lightly sweat-sheened Demi Moore in a thong and mini-tank top?) So, as an alternative source of mind fodder, an iPod nano seemed just the ticket.  Excitedly ripping open the box delivering the nano (1 GB, black finish), my first thought was what men dread to hear, "But, it's so small!" I must be careful not to drop it, or I might lose it down the grill of the central air floor vent. Accompanying the iPod were the de rigueur headphones and dock connector cable, plus a cheap, plastic thingy that apparently serves as a dock adaptor and a useless soft vinyl (?) sleeve - useless because it covers up the screen and click wheel controller, though you can use it to stuff the headphone into. There's also a Quick Start guide that can best be described as minimalist. Luckily, the installation disk, which effortlessly installs iTunes and iPod software onto your computer of choice - PC (Windows XP Home) AND Mac (OS X) in my case (I'm eminently flexible) - includes an extensive "iPod nano Features Guide" accessible through Adobe Acrobat Reader. Registering the serial number of the device on the Apple website presents the only challenge as it's engraved in impossibly tiny characters on the back of the casing; I needed a magnifying glass.  The click wheel controls are intuitive and easy to use. Touching any part of the wheel turns on the gadget and lights up the color screen, after which there are four relevant control points located at 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 on the wheel: Menu, Next/Fast Forward, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind respectively. In case the user has Chubby Fingers Syndrome, "play" is also activated by poking the wheel's center button. Volume control and menu scrolling is cleverly accomplished by running one's digit in a circular motion around the wheel's circumference.   Tether the nano to your computer and an iPod icon will appear in the "Source" pane of the iTunes window, to which icon you can drag individual songs or playlists. Once loaded, the music can be selected (with that twirly finger motion) by playlist, artist, album, song title, genre, or composer.  But how, you ask, does the contraption perform? Ok, ok, so it's not Sensurround Sound. It does to near perfection what it's supposed to do - provide a great sounding, portable music archive to the sweaty masses that even the most intellectually challenged can navigate. The greatest peril is perhaps getting tangled up in the headphone cord.   For the iPod to withstand my exhausted collapse off the exerciser at the gym, I thought it prudent to buy a snappy sport armband to which the skin-protected nano attaches. That was an extra expense, but worth it. Boy, will I look cool as I hit the floor!  Today, as I listened to my toy for the first time, I was able to ignore my immediate surroundings to the beat of Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time" and focus on the physical pain of my self-inflicted ordeal. Of course, I still keep an eye open for Demi.  Postscript: If you're looking for a set of portable speakers for your iPod, consider the mm50 by Logitech. See my 3/7/07 5-star review entitled "Bodacious."

<Title>warning for other old foggies
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is amazing.  It is tiny.  I found it easy to use once Apple tech explained it.  Up until then, it was driving me nuts.  The manual was  minimal and incorrect in some ways (at least for a PC user).  For example, iTunes did not work as described.    The serial number is so small I could barely read it for registering and the language switched to Japanese when I started it.  That was confusing!!!  I am going to buy one of those "missing manual" books.  Also, I do not like the ear phones and am using 30 year old one from a cassette player.  I will buy good, folding ones.  The sound is amazingly good, it is tiny, it is easy to use once you figure it out and it will be nice for long plane trips.  I just wish Apple provided a real manual and bigger serial numbers!!!
