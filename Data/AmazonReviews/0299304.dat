<Product Name>Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Green (2nd Generation)
<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The third generation of the iPod Shuffle is similar to the second.  It's a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seemed a little bit more durable.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points.

Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC.  You can convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  Sound  The sound this unit produces is pretty good for it's size.  However, it's just ok.  I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, but the trade off was it was much longer.   Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $50.  Sandisk's Clip has similarly priced models.  While it doesn't have some extras like the stopwatch included with the Creative, it does have the integrated clip like the Shuffle.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.
