<Title>Hardware Problems
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First let me say that overall, this is not a bad mp3 player. The internet radio is a great feature (especially when you aren't willing to pay for premium services like satellite radio). The menu transitions seemed to lag a bit, but that could be resolved with future firmware updates. However, I rated this for two stars because of unreliable hardware. The first one I had would overheat and shutdown when it was playing and charging with a car adapter. After a days use it also started to turn itself on everytime the player was plugged in and lock up before it finished loading. If I plugged in the player while playing music, it would also lock up. I sent that back for a replacement, which had a nonfunctional volumn down button. If you really need WiFi capabilites, wait for something better to come along.

<Title>Wifi????
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Sansa Connect arrived yesterday afternoon and I spent the rest of the evening trying to get it to connect to my home wireless internet, my neighbor's unsecured network, anything. Nada! I even took the MAC filtering off my home wireless router, completely disabled all security, and it still would not connect. VERY frustrating.

<Title>If you like Yahoo! Music and Internet Radio, you will love this
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best Father's Day gift I have ever gotten. To really enjoy it, though, you need a subscription to Yahoo! Music Unlimited To Go. Depending upon promotions, this will cost anywhere from $7-14 a month, and will allow you to download basically whatever albums and songs you want from the 2 million in Yahoo's catalog for that one fee. No more paying for each song or album.  With that subscription, the player really comes alive. You can do things like listen to Internet Radio customized to your musical tastes (you rate songs as you listen and it learns from that--an awesome way to discover new music). If you like the song that's playing, you can instantly download it (or the entire album) to your player--no computer required. You can also download mixes of songs that Yahoo! thinks you'll like, again without a computer. If you like a song, you can tell the player to make a mix like that song. The entire mix gets downloaded to the player and updates in the background as you listen to it. This is of course in additon to the standard procedure of transferring music from your computer to the player, which you can also do.  In a nutshell, this player is the Yahoo! Music experience made portable, and it's what I've wished for ever since I first discovered their excellent Launch (Internet) Radio. If you like discovering new music, as opposed to just buying a few favorite albums and listening to them over and over again, this is the player for you.

<Title>Wonderful Internet Radio
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having Yahoo! Launchcast Plus included with my AT&T DSL service, this Sansa Connect player has been a great way to enjoy internet radio without having to use my computer.  The stations are far more varied musically than satellite radio, and I am planning to drop my Sirius subscription to use Launchcast Plus and the Sansa Connect exclusively.  The interface is easy to use, and the screen is bright and has lots of active animations.  In fact, it is easier to mark and access favorite stations in Sansa Connect than on the Launchcast website (and it's impossible to do so in the Yahoo! Music Jukebox application).  So why not 5 stars?  Here are some disadvantages: the device is compatible with neither networks that have hidden (non-broadcasted) SSID's nor with networks with WPA-Enterprise encryption.  So, if you have a non-broadcasted SSID for security's sake, you'll have to start broadcasting it to use with the Sansa.  Furthermore, if your school's wireless uses WPA-Enterprise encryption, you won't be able to use it there.  Hopefully, Sandisk will start supporting these kinds of networks.  Finally, I haven't found a way to listen to "fan" stations that are related to the genre stations.  For example, on the Web, you can listen to the Noa fan station from the Middle Eastern page, but there is no similar access on the Sansa Connect.

<Title>The Unlimited to go service the WiFi depends on may be shutting down
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unfortunately yahoo has just removed the "Unlimited to go" option from their website unless you've bought a Sansa Connect.  Based on that and reports in reputable sources such as the WSJ and other business based reporting it may be that the "To Go" option is being phased out. Actually, IMHO, I think that Yahoo is coming to the realization that the Unlimited to go pricing model just doesn't work.  It's based on the assumption that a person will only download about 8 - 9 new songs per month to their MP3 Players (figured as $.79 per song and the price differential between monthly Unlimited and Unlimited to go subscriptions).  Most people, when they learn the potential for 'all you can eat music' download much more than that.  From a financial point of view the $6.00/month "sample all the music you want on your PC" and then get a $.20 discount for buying the music makes much more sense.  Unfortunately this will cause major problems with the Connect unless they can set up an option for an "Unlimited" account to be accessed on the unit and then you hit a "Click here to buy" function.  This will also required them to allow for a wider access to their on-line store through the Connect something which may not be possible. Oh well, I'm just glad that I'd found this out before I bought a Connect for my son for his birthday, I'll now consider a satellite radio/mp3 player (such as the Inno (we're XM fans)) or just get a something like a view or the E series unit. The only advantage I ever saw in the Connect was the ability to wireless transfer music and playlists and since that may be going away I'm going to stay clear of the device.  Without the wireless download capabilities the device offers no advantage over the other Sandisk players and I'm not going to pay the premium for a functionality which may become useless in the near future.

<Title>The Mother of All Devices
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I happen to be a SONYphile...I live a SONY lifestyle...well, that's what they wanted wasn't it...but to this day, other than a player that plays movies which I rarely have time to watch...will anyone, including SONY come out with a small and attractive device as cool as this.  Ooops, it plays movies too by using their Media Converter...so watching your favorite flicks while eating lunch or waiting for the Doctor is a snap.  I've been a MusicMatch guy for years and was rather pissed when Yahoo! bought them out...BUT, wait...Yahoo Music Unlimited To Go is the coolest service on the planet.  I own a Creative Zen Vision M (retired) and could load all of the music that I had downloaded from Yahoo! on to that baby and listen to it in my car...DEAD!  Now I own this little WiFi bugger and it is the absolute best.  Recently, Yahoo! upgraded the software on this device to give you much more latitude in your music attitude...you can now download any artist using the scroll wheel to spell the name out...or just stream your Yahoo Music Playlists, whcih update immediately after creating on your PC...It is unbelievable, really what this device provides.  As others have said, it offers an enormous library of music that is easy to download and sync with either Yahoo! Music on your PC or thru Windows Media Player 11.  I have a little SONY Bluetooth transmitter that I hook up to this rig and play my tunes thru my SONY Bluetooth headunit in my truck as well; I have the Kyocera KR1 Mobile Router with a Sprint EVDO Card and can play Launchcast Internet Radio thru this device in my car...it is very cool and the sound is of the best quality...almost no gaps as this device has a large buffer cache.  All in all, it's the best $120.00 that I ever spent...but unfortunately, I'm still gonna have to feed my SONY Jones and get the new   NWZ-A818 Silver...because, like Mt. Everest...it is there.  If you take me up on my advice, I hope that you too enjoy this little and versatile music device.  All the best,  Warren

<Title>Just too cool!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved my Connect for several months now but the latest software update really puts it over the top. My biggest complaint before was that you could not search for specific songs from your Yahoo unlimited music subscription but the latest update allows you to do that and more! By more I mean you can search by song, artist and album but on top of that you don't need to download to listen you can just stream if you are in WI-FI range. Sansa has basically turned this into a MP-3 player with a 3 million song capacity. And if your leaving the hot spot just download. Why anyone would consider buying an i-pod and spending $.99 a song when you can get this device for $108.00, spend $120 for a two year subsciption and never pay for music again no matter how much you listen to. Like I said just too cool!

<Title>Great Product, almost
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great features, great construction, great concept.  What's wrong then?  Battery life is ABYSMAL.  I'm talking 30-40 minutes when the device was brand new and running on a full charge.  In my opinion it's pretty much unconscionable to ship a portable music player that isn't really portable for more than 30-40 minutes.  Even with the WiFi turned off it's not much better.  Contrast this to my 5th generation iPod (which the Sansa was intended to replace) which gets 13-20 hours per charge.  I never even worry if it's charged or not, it always just seems to have plenty of battery life.  I was excited to receive the Sansa Connect, even told all my friends about the concept of unlimited downloads.  Sadly I'm very disappointed with the product.  I don't think it's worth paying a subscription fee to Yahoo Music when the device isn't even portable -- I could just stream music for free if I wanted to be tied to only places with power available.  The other very bad thing about this product is that if you are already a Yahoo Music Jukebox user it's nearly impossible to get the software for the Sansa to work properly.  Unlike with an iPod where you just plug it in and it offers to transfer your songs, I had to uninstall, reinstall, delete songs, re-download songs, etc. etc.  It was a total nightmare.   Also, if you don't sync it frequently enough it gets screwed up and you have to reload everything.  Yahoo offers no helpful tech support either.  I'm someone who loves the concept of DRM'ed subscription music.  I don't like the idea that I need to back up my iTunes library, and was looking forward to switching to this device.  Sadly it is no substitute and I regret buying it.

<Title>Great value, full of features, but not quite perfect
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this after my 5th gen iPod 30GB broke, and I have been very impressed. The screen resolution and brightness far exceeded my expectations for an MP3 player, and the interface is as intuitive as my old iPod while looking better than the older iPod. Battery life is as I expected, pretty good with wifi turned off.  Still, the wifi features are pretty amazing. Even if you don't pay for the Yahoo! subscription plan, you can still browse Flickr and the free Yahoo! radio stations. If you do pay for the subscriptions, then getting new music is easy even without a computer.  My only problem is one of software. Getting the device to work with Linux took a lot longer than expected, and I can't manage the subscription music from Linux. Yahoo! Music Jukebox is fairly bloated and resource-hungry, and sometimes gives the occasional error or glitch when trying to use with the Sansa Connect. Windows users with faster systems probably don't have to worry about any of this.  Sandisk seems like it's serious about providing good firmware updates - they've addressed the most common criticisms of this device since its launch, and now boasts new features added in October including logging onto certain types of wifi networks requiring browser login, video playback, and built-in search tools for the Yahoo! Music downloads. I'm looking forward to seeing whether they'll continue to add features (maybe even support for flac or ogg files, video support not requiring their own video converter).  Overall, this player blows away anything else under $100, and even outperforms the more expensive iPod nano, even if you don't use any subscription services.

<Content>Let me preface by saying I have a subscription to Yahoo Music Unlimited, so when I saw this little gem for $100, I simply could not resist. I think the operation is intuitive, and I have really ejoyed the option of downloading songs directly into the unit via Wi-Fi. The sound quality is great, and I have had no glitches whatsoever in the operation of the device. Admittedly, I have not tried to log on to commerical Wi-Fi nodes at airports, Starbucks, and the like, but the Wi-Fi works flawlessly with my router at home.

<Title>Sansa Connect - a Portable, Searchable 'Nabster in a Box' Next Gen Device
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I went to the store to get an Ipod nano, until I saw this for the first time.  Why is this device not advertised?  I have no idea - it is the first Ipod Killer.  Zune step aside too.  If you want an Ipod go get one, if you want a 'Nabster in a box' get the Connect. I got this for under a 100.  Please understand this concept - it includes all the music on the Internet. Think about that.  This is the only device that has this out of the box.  All the music you ever need - CD quality.  Searchable, Catalogued, streaming and downloadable.  And once you download songs (in the background - you never see a download bar) you can take it to the gym or the ocean.  You can hear the whole song - not a section of it. You don't even need a computer - just a wireless router or wireless connection point at your favorite place.  In fact, I have filled up 2 GB of music and haven't yet connected a computer or cable or CD or software program.  If you believe that the musical experience is a trip rather than a known destination, and the discovery of what you like and what is new is part of the experience, then get this player.   If you think you already have all the music you want and plan on purchasing new songs for a buck each from Itunes or another service then get an Ipod.  Like sat radio, this player lets you select a channel of music and listen to it for hours. This is basically like XIM or SIRIUS radio on steriods:  Here are some of the channels: 1980s pop, 1990s rock, 1970s soul, 40 years ago hits of 1967, forgotten hits of the 90s, disco, house, dance, brazilian, salsa cien po ciento, latin jazz, classic rock, emo, garage rock, alternative, metal, hair flare, brit rock, goth rock,southern rock, classic soul, reggae, underground hip-hop, east coast rap, hardcore rap, any many many others.  These channels are all CD quality and if you dont like the song hit next and it flips to the next song. If you like a song click save and it downloads it offline for listening when not connected to wifi.    You can also just search for an artist or view recommendations to find music. You can make playlists on the player and see album covers.  I recommend also getting the following accessories for this: Logitech im510 dock speaker, griffin technologies clear case.  The only downside to this player is that it is not more widely adopted.

Yes, for whatever reasons, after a couple of on/off, downloading a song or two, the player would not power off, it got stuck in the welcome screen. Since it does not have a detacheable battery, I had no choice but to return the item to Amazon. Wish Sandisk had paid more attention to product quality.

<Title>It's OK when it works
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally LOVED the idea of this when I found out about it. WiFi radio anywhere you go that you can get a signal! Wow. Cool. Right? Well, it IS pretty cool - when it works.  BUT --- learn from my mistakes: #1) You are totally reliant on Yahoo Music Service. It cannot be used with another service for the internet radio portion. And NO it is NOT a 2 for 1 Mastercard Promotion. THAT is for 'Yahoo Unlimited' which allows you to LISTEN to ANY songs in their library on your computer ONLY - 6 bucks a month. The Sansa Connect requires 'Yahoo Unlimited TO GO' in order for you to transfer any of those songs to your player - 15 bucks a month. THEN it is another 79 cents per song if you wish to burn them to a CD. #2) Yahoo Music Jukebox is slow and crashes my machine. Maybe it won't do it to yours? #3) This is my second player in one month's time. The first one crashed and burned for no reason. It just stopped. I called tech support, they had me download a rescue program. It didn't work. They told me to return it and get a replacement. So it doesn't appear to be the best made device. By the time I got my replacement, I was over the 'trial period' for the WRONG Yahoo service and they wouldn't refund me my money. They PRORATED what they said I used.  OK - so what IS cool? Well, certainly it would be MUCH cooler if this device worked outside of the Yahoo environment or if Yahoo worked better and more cooperatively. But since this is a review for the player itself - well - it has a BRIGHT screen - cool blue light around the wheel - sounds really good for such a tiny thing - you can store pictures on it - you can store your OWN music on it and take it with you - I am pretty sure you can transfer music that you have rights to from other companies (I haven't tried) - not Apple obviously - but again, it is designed for Yahoo services and you will not get the internet radio which is the BEST feature of it (and the WHOLE point of the wireless) - has an external speaker - has a storage card slot  Overall, its not a bad device but certainly not what I had hoped for. As you may or may not have noticed, the price has dropped on these things by 20 bucks or more since before Christmas. I may be returning it and putting this 100 bucks towards a satellite portable radio. I am debating it as the Internet Radio thing IS cool.

<Title>The best and most versatile music solution
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've tried many different MP3 players, satellite radio, media players, and cell phones that play mp3's and the Sansa Connect is the best solution so far.  For only $15/month I get to listen to any song I want and anywhere I want to.  With traditional MP3 players you need to buy all of the music which limits you to a much smaller amount of music.    I use the Sansa Connect at home hooked up to external speakers in the bedroom, hooked up to my receiver in the family room, and with an FM transmitter in my car.   When at home or work I can stream music directly from Yahoo's site while in the car I can play 4 gig worth of music downloading the newest albums for no additional cost.    Some people still don't get "renting music" but once you get over that, it is very liberating.  The music you get to listen to is not dictated by a radio station or your ability to afford tons of new cd's each month.    I really don't understand why the Sansa Connect is not flying off the shelves.

I login to Yahoo Music wirelessly (must have a wireless connection) and then select that genre of music. When I hear a song I like with the push of a button it is loaded on my player. You can also logon to Yahoo Music through your pc and download many songs at once. You must have a Yahoo Music account to do this but the first month is free!

<Title>Very impressive "system" - MP3, WiFi listening (downloading, etc.)
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>UPDATE:   After using the device for a week, I am VERY impressed. Quality is high. Solid. As far as the unit's functionality - amazing. Hard to believe a PC software writer could write something this smooth. Apple: beware. This device rocks. And at the price? Are you kidding? Buy two. That way you can pass tune recommendations back-and-forth in one area: just kidding, but this is actually possible with this device. Seriously, this is really a nice device. I'm very impressed with the intuitiveness of the Internet Radio function; much easier than using a full-sized computer to perform the same tasks. Sandisk's software crew really did their homework on this device (well, at least for the PC world - they left us Apple users out in the cold). But as an Apple user, I would go as far as recommending that an Apple user buy this product even without a means to hard-synchronize the Sansa Connect to their Apple OS X machine. The Sansa Connect is THAT GOOD. The FREE selections that some in this forum have criticized as being "limited", I find to be quite varied and very interesting: Here is the list of FREE stations on your Sansa Connect:   Latin music (5 stations), Pop (13 stations), Rock (33 stations), Dance (4 stations), Electronic, Urban (18 stations), Country (9 stations), Oldies (7 stations), Indie/Folk (7 stations, and no idea what Indie means), Christian (4 stations), jazz & Blues (6 stations), World Zone (19 stations), and More Genres (10 stations)...all these are free.   Of course, you can elect to sign-up for the very nice all-you-can-ea music from Yahoo...but, I haven't done that yet. However, I can see from the device's software that this part of the Connect is well designed; or at least, it seems so.   Last - quality of this little device is excellent. One recommendation: buy the Griffin leather case. Superb fit, and does not impede any of the various keys or ports on the device. It has high quality leather, looks great, and has a solid leather front (over flap - with magnetic closure), that works perfectly.   I strongly recommend this device to anyone who enjoys music, and who (more specifically) enjoys NEW music, versus the stuff you've already loaded in you iPod. I still love my iPods, but this device does many things that an iPod cannot do.   Now...if Sandisk would PLEASE write some software for my Apple OS X machine. Come on, guys!    What a fantastic piece of hardware...  My only criticism is that I  wish Sandisk would write some interface software for Apple (OSX) users, who could then hard-sync our Sansa Connect devices.   Another interesting fact is that Yahoo (the folks who supply the music downloads for this device) also did not write any Apple software for your Apple computer.   Still...the Sansa Connect easily connects via our wireless (WiFi) router and syncs very easily with a secured wireless router. Like nobody's business, actually. Honestly, this Sansa Connect is one amazing device.   There are many FREE radio stations that this little device picks up automatically - not as limited as some suggested on this site. And, access to those Internet radio stations is much easier than via a PC computer on the Yahoo music web site. Go figure. Seems Sandisk did their homework with respect to making the Connect user-friendly.   If Sandisk would simply commit some personnel resources to write OSX software for this amazing little device, well...in my humble opinion, I believe Sandisk would sell thousands of these units to Apple computer music lovers.   Even AS IS (with NO capability to sync with an Apple computer, this is an amazing device, as it comes pre-loaded with all its software, and there is actually no need to install anything; just use it with your wireless router. Likewise, adding your secure code to the Sansa Connect is quite simple - and it allows all the characters that you would need (via its wheel) to authenticate your device. It would be very nice to do a hard-sync with my Apple, but even without that capability - this is one superb device. Well made, solid, excellent video (yes, video), photo player, and a convenient micro SD slot on the top right side.    I highly recommend this device - IF you're willing to accept the no-sync capability with your Apple OSX computer. On the other hand, if you're a Windows person with all the benefits of syncing to your computer, this purchase ought to be mandatory.   Enjoy.

<Title>Pretty pleased, overall

<Content>I've had this for about a month and a half. I mostly use it for podcasts. I wanted something with possible memory expansion. Memory cards keep getting cheaper, and I didn't want to get stuck with a fixed memory size. I'm sure there are better units out there, but this one's pretty good for the price. The flickr function is fun, but I don't use it much, since I don't spend most of my day near a wireless connection. Same goes for the Internet radio ability, although I do use that around the house. The face of it's already scratched up, which is somewhat disappointing, although covers are available. I get about 7 to 8 hours of battery life out of it each day. Not bad, but I have to remember to plug it in each night if I want to be able to use it the next day. It would be nice to be able to go a couple of days between charges. Ergonomically, I like the controls, the look, the display, and the weight. The lock switch is a little small, and if I have the earbuds and the charger both plugged in I have to unplug the earbuds from the jack before I can unplug the charger. Not a big deal, though. When I first got it I had to use the Sansa Recovery tool (from the Sansa website) before I could get Windows Media Player to recognize the player. Not sure who to blame there -- Sansa, Microsoft, or me. Anyway, it works fine now. I'd say the pluses outweigh the minuses by quite a bit.

<Content>If you are considering buying the Sansa Connect go check out Yahoo Lauchcast Radio with your Microsoft Internet Explorer browser (It will not work with Firefox!!) and see if you like it. Sansa connect= Sansa e260 - FM Tuner - Recording ability +Yahoo Launchcast ONLY on Open WiFi ONLY + very low volume external speaker Power button (sleep and shutdown) is on top. Connectors are both on bottom (makes it impossible to disconnect USB/Power connector while headphones are plugged in). Micro SD slot is in same place as e260 on right side top. Yahoo Lauchcast is 2 Flavors: 1. Free with ads 2. Paid with more stations and no ads ($3 a month right now) It does view pictures and videos (converted to mp4 with converter which you can get on Sansa website). Comes with Yahoo Jukebox software (like WinAmp, MediaMonkey, or Microsoft Media Player but arguably worse).  You can download files directly to the device in Microsoft Windows Explorer (File Manger) when connected USB if you can get it to connect. I have found it to be a bit buggy so far not connecting and downloading files well via USB but this may be a problem with my particular setup and I have gotten it to work eventually. Thumb wheel is very nice and works well. Navigation of the menus is fast and easy.  It has a Friends feature and purchase music button which I find useless and wish could be eliminated. With my earbuds (I have not used the ones that came with it) I cannot turn it up all the way because it is too loud. The Yahoo Lauchcast monopoly of this system is a bad idea. It is supposedly a Linux system and I assume someone is working on a hack which would make this thing much more likable. If you could download your files via WiFi and get other Internet streamed stations this thing would be great! These things would boost it to a 5 star rating.

<Content>This device is tied to Yahoo Music, and Yahoo music is shutting down, so this thing is worthless.  Buy an iPod.

<Title>Really digging this Cool WIFI MP3
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After my son consistently begged me to get him an MP3 I went out and searched all day for this Sansa. We went from store to store and everywhere was sold out of this little device. Well I finally found one(With it being sold out everywhere; I thought this must really be a great product)and figured I would order mine on-line. When I got it; I was excited being able to download quite a bit of music, the feature of this little player facinated me with yahoo built in which took only a few minutes to setup once the initial setup is complete if you already have an account or had an yahoo jukebox account all your music automatically transfers over. (Neat) If you are a member and you hear a song you like or even want the album you click on get this song or get this album and you have either the song in less than 1 min or the album in less than 5 mins. You can listen to quite a few song(s) in a great deal of time and unlike the IPOD when the battery gets low it will start to make songs drag. I like the quality, sound with or without headphones and the life of this unit. Only suggestion I would say that it is hard to re-configure the yahoo user once you've setup your unit - Maybe this is something Sansa will work on, other than that I love this unit. Great for the price and remember you have first dibs on albums when a member of yahoo jukebox.

<Title>Don't buy this product it wont work after July

<Content>Let me first say, I actually really like the Sansa Connect. I bought one about a month ago for use with the Yahoo Music Service and have really been liking it. I am giving this a 1 review simply because this product will become obsolete in a few months. All of the features using Yahoo Music will just go away when you are forced to transition to Rhapsody. Basically you will be left with an overpriced underpowered MP3 player with a wireless connection you cant do anything with. Do not purchase this product!!!!!

<Title>Better than an iPod for most users
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We own three iPods, as well as a few other cheap mp3 players, and this Sansa Connect is the best player of them all.  The screen is bright, with an intuitive, dynamic interface.  The internet radio has no shortage of stations, and updates to the OS are transparent to the user.  It plays video without a hiccup (you may need to rotate your video 90 degs to get the best view).  A caveat: Yahoo Music Unlimited is apparently being discontinued.  Internet radio will still be around for free music, and likely Sansa will partner with Real or some other company for DRM subscription service.  And of course you can always load your own music/movies.

<Content>Unhappy with sansa connect, I returned it for a refund. Luckily Amazon allows for easy, hassle free returns. Before I purchased this I owned a Sansa E280 which served me well for over a year, (no problems). The sansa connect never functioned properly. I used the sansa connect recovery tool available on the sandisk website. I'm technically inclined, and it isn't difficult to update the firmware on any hand-held device I've used in the past and currently. However, even after multiple attempts of reinstalling the firmware using the recovery tool I was never able to get it to work properly. I mainly purchased the connect as I was interested in being able to use the wi-fi compatibility to listen to free yahoo music stations. However, I was never able to get my yahoo account (which has served me flawlessly for over eight years) to login properly so I could access the free streamcast stations. I even setup a separate, new yahoo account strictly so I could use the sansa connect... this attempt failed as well. Even all this aside (huge disappointment) I decided to give the Connect another try as strictly an Mp3 player. This seemed to work well until inexplicably it would stop and display an error message saying, "sansa connect has encountered an error and must restart now." This process would then take approximately three minutes, (I think it was trying to reset itself). Anyway after doing this it would work for about another 5 minutes to an hour, and then do the same thing. This was unacceptable for me, so I finally gave up and just returned it. I then did some more research and ended up purchasing another product. It is the Cowon D2 available here on Amazon.com. It sounds excellent, has touchscreen controls, excellent battery life (50hrs for music), and has an SD/SDHC memory card slot. Far superior Mp3 player.

<Title>Sansa Connect - Great Product with Some Limitations
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa Connect is an amazing MP3 player that comes with software to load tracks.Sometimes the programme does not recognize the MP3 player and I needed to reinitialize the device twice.  It can connect to the wireless internet if you know the password and the signal is strong enough. The membership to download "More Music" is not available in Canada, where I live. I love the internal speakers, the large, clear, colourful sceen and easy to use, rubberized control wheel. This is a great product and I got it for a great price. Thanks
