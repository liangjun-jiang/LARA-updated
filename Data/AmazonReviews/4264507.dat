<Title>I Love my I Pod Touch
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Being of the 40 over generation and needing reading glasses, the Ipod touch is wonderful, I don't have to squint to read those little buttons.  It's all on the screen and large enough to see. Then I just touch away.  Editing photos for my contacts is so easy, and I love showing off my I Pod touch to everyone and how easy it is to use.  Watching music videos and movies.  Now when I do have a long airplane ride ahead of me, I can download a movie or two and watch them while on the plane.  I also listen audio books, meditation music and classic rock and roll and even my some of my daughters music, which I probably woulnd't have done before, so I am keeping up on some of the newer music and videos.  My IPod touch is great.

<Content>My fiance and I bought iPod touches at the same time and we both LOVE them.  Wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player.  The only thing that sucks is having to spend an additional 20 bucks to get the upgrade, but it is worth it.  We have reccomended this product to all our friends.  Everyone that has tried ours have felt the same about them as we have.

<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My review of the IPOD TOUCH  is just spectacular ,I give it this review because I drop my ipod in some water and didn't even realize it until it was to late and it got all wet' and I had just purchase it on the 27th of Jan, anyway I thought all was lost until 3 days later I put the ipod on the modem from my desktop which generates heat' by doing that the remaining water that was inside the IPOD gradually disappeared before u know it I was using my ipod again. I was really upset before this happen but luckily it returned to it's original form,"however APPLE design this product I give them a thumbs up, they must have had some type of protection around the chip inside but whatever it is it saved my ipod from destruction..

<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple iPod touch is a great electronic device. You have music, videos, photos, internet- everything at your fingertips literally!!  The touch interface is well designed, and the clarity of images are superb. The only things I have against this device is that my finger is a little too big for the tiny screen keyboard and browsing the web. I wish the screen could be a little bigger, but this would have a negative impact on the overall footprint. Great device!

<Title>Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted an ipod touch since the first moment I saw it. It is an excelent MP3 player, with the apple quality. The screen is amazing, the touch interface works perfectly. I think it has 2 things that could be better:  1- The back of the ipod get scratched so easy, I recommed get an ipod case, otherwise it will have hundreds of scratches in 2 days.  2- The volume, if you have your ipod playing and locked and you want to change the volume level, you must press the unlock button then slide the touch button to unlock it, go to "music" -> "playing now" and change the volume. This is very annoying!! sometimes I have the ipod in my pocket and have to do all that to change the volume, a little volume control out of the screen will make it a perfect MP3 player.  But well, this item is amazing, I recommend it.

<Title>Outraged that Apple is charging $20 for a system update!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am outraged that Apple is charging early buyers of the iPod Touch $20 for a system update that ought to be free.  While I understand Apple's decision to charge money for the new applications the new $20 "application pack" also includes a SYSTEM UPDATE in the form of the home page editing, web clips, and lyrics features. All of these are updates to the currently existing iPod Touch software and NOT new applications, which means that they ought to be free to all users of the iPod Touch.  Adding insult to injury these applications are all hidden in the 1.1.3 system update, a whopping 104.4mb file that all users must download if they want to fix bugs in the system. These applications can only be used when you pay Apple $20 to "unlock" them, but even if you decide not to buy them they stay on your iPod taking up precious space that could be used for songs, videos, or photos.  Apple is normally wonderful when it comes to providing system support and updates, but having them shaft early adopters and loyal fans like this is offensive and shows that Apple has absolutely no regard for the iPod Touch community.  I was not planning on jailbreaking my iPod Touch, but after this outrageous behavior on the part of Apple I probably will.

<Title>Exquisite piece of technology
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my first CD player about 15 years ago, but rarely purchased CDs.  The thought of spending $15 to $20 on every CD that may or may not have more than 1 song I liked on it seemed ridiculous.  You could say I've waited 15 years for this.  The iPod touch 8GB is absolutely beautiful.  The design is impeccable.  The system is so easy to learn.  But I do have one small complaint.  I would prefer a paper manual for quick reference in locating features of the iPod.  I agree that it is best to minimize over-production of paper products that can be supplemented by digital documents. But I still hate reading through manuals via my computer monitor.  Yet, the lack of paper manual, that I would have looked at only a few times, does not hold weight against my love for my iPod touch.       I am at a loss for where to begin a description of everything I love about the entire design and function.  But one thing I must point out is that the use of the internet browser is not frustrating.  I would have expected frustration in surfing the internet without a large monitor, mouse and keyboard.  Truly a remarkable design in making the speed & simplicity of surfing the net on a small iPod.     Thank you Apple, I love you.

I had a lot of trouble choosing between this and a kune but I'm happy with my decision to get the ipod. I bought it for the reduced price of about $260 then could'get the upgrades that came out the next week because Appple is cheap but I sort of knew that might happen.

<Content>I got this iPod for my husband for his birthday.  This is our first iPod, but not our first MP3 player.  He loves it and takes it everywhere he goes.  The 8 gig capacity has proven plenty for his favorite music and videos.  We have not tried it for movies.  This iPod has all the same features as my iPhone except the phone and external speaker.  The new feature pack is worth the $20 download cost.  He loves to check the weather and maps.

<Title>Worth it if you're willing to hack it
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod Touch is a great media player for people who don't have a million songs to upload. I am very picky with what goes onto my iPod and can barely fill up my 4GB nano 2G. It's sleek and have an intuitive OS, which probably doesn't surprise anybody familiar with Apple products.  What got me excited about this product is that it can act as a PDA if you're willing to put in the time. There are countless websites out there that explain how to "jailbreak" this device and installing free 3rd-party applications. Once you do that, you have a PDA and media player for a mere $260. One can even make free internet phone calls on it if by buying a proprietary microphone and installing VoIP software. In the end, the iPod Touch can be 95% like an iPhone for much less money. This product is fine on its own, but outstanding if you tweak it. Because of the potential in this device, I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Crazy Fun IPod
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, at first I thought it was a little radical with all the bells and whistles and what not, but when I used my friends, I was sold. I was deciding to get a new IPod because my old gen.1 Nano was starting to 'go' if you know what I mean. I have always been a nano lover, and I was gonna buy the Nano. Then I got curious, I looked into the Touch a little and was amazed. Then a couple of weeks later, my friend got one, and let me try it out. AMAZING. It's pros definetly outway it's cons.  PROS: 1. The nice slim body plate. It's cool how nice and small they got it for something with so much. 2. Even though this part is half pro half con (because you'll rarely use it after a while) The internet is REALLY nice. 3. Very nice looking. 4. Light weight design. 5. Many things to keep you occupied BESIDES listening to music.  CONS:  1. It's a bit over priced. 2. Kinda tricky to get used to, especially if you're used to other IPods. 3. Not really that much of a con, but some of the bells and whistles become not used after a couple of weeks.                   So the answer to the all important question:                           "Should I buy one?"                        If you can afford it: YES!

<Title>Great Design - Poor Performance
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The touch-screen and colors on the Ipod touch are superb. This is where the great story comes to an end and makes me cling onto my 4G and 5G Ipod's for performance. The user interface is sluggish and the time lag to response irritating. The Wi-Fi is so slow even when i stand on top of my DSL wireless router that it is waste of time to even try and check your email or surf any websites. What make things worse is that 2 of the keys on the "Virtual Keyboard" simply do not work. These are the 5 Key and R key. I am perplexed as every time i try and attempt this input with vertical or horizontal screen orientation the input character is the adjacent key. Therefore it is usually impossible for me to login to my Gmail. It may be a defect on the screen of just my unit - but i dont know if this is the case or whether the OS of the Touch is flawed. The sound quality is decent, but a lot needs to be done to get this Ipod to work fast , reliably and without input issues. Performance is as important as looks when you pay so much for a device.

<Title>Awesome New iPod
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's newest iPod is really great. It has internet, youtube, photos, video and even iTunes. The most surprising thing about the iPod is that it's REALLY fast for such a small gadget. The iPod touch works much in the same as previous iPod, but it expands on the features.  The downside to the new iPod Touch is that it feels fragile. I would never want to put it in my pocket because I would be too afraid to scratch the screen or even break it. The ipod itself is super thin, which makes it easier to break.  The iPod touch is a great new iPod, but if your looking for something you can rough up a bit, try the iPod classic or nano.

<Title>Sweet advances
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking to upgrade my trooper of an Ipod Mini and was going to upgrade to an Ipod classic but when I saw what the touch offered I was intrigued. What sold me on the touch was the wi-fi capability. After many years I reuturned to college to pursue a bachelors degree and the touch's wi-fi capability has been an excellent feature. Many of my courses have an online component and instead of hauling my laptop or wating in line to use one of the university's computers, I can use my touch to check email or see the latest discussion postings or contribute to the discussions. Typing has been excellent, very few errors and I have gotten quite fast. I use the widescreen view when I observe web pages and the zoom function is just plain sweet. I am awed by the interface, very responsive. Any misses or non-responces are due to my errors and not the interfaces. You have to train yourself a little bit on using the touch screen but it's not difficult.  Some have complained about storage capacity but reality check people. Not everyone needs 80 or 160 gb's of storage. I have the 8 gb model of the touch which is double my old mini's capacity and it suits my needs perfectly. A couple of gb's of music and audiobooks, a few tv show episodes for when I have no reading or studying to do between classes, a few short films, and some photos to share with my classmates, such as my new niece.   Sound quality is excellent and I have had zero issues using the touch in my car with the power adaptor and fm transmitter. Battery life so far has been excellent with me mixing up music, video and photo slideshow use. I have not had any issues concerning the screan or the touch acting all wonky. At the moment I am using it an average of about five hours a day and zero issues as of this time.

<Title>Product's Great: Video selections mediocre
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iTouch is a great little device. It's easy to use, fun and great grown-up toy.  Since I already own an 8 gig ipod Nano, which I use for audio books and some music,  I bought this to view videos on long plane trips.  It's much more convenient that dragging out my laptop. The problem I have run into, however, is that iTunes doesn't have the most current or greatest selection of movies.  Hopefully, they'll come up to speed as more and more househoulds buy this product. In the meantime, I suppose I'll have to download tv re-runs and videos I've see before but still enjoy....

<Title>Great product, but it does need much more memory for the power users!
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Watching videos on the iPod Touch is quite an improvement over the iPod video, particularly, due to the bigger screen size. As commented by other reviewers, this gadget is wonderful, but if you are used to the kind of storage capacity of an iPod Video (30Gb) and you are serious about watching videos and movies with it, you are going to need much more memory, so at least go for the 16Gb version, or even better, wait until Apple decides to put more memory in it (30 Gb should be the minimum for music and video). Every iTunes movie is 1.6 Gb, then, with five movies the 8Gb will be full. Every music video is between 20-40 Mb. Then, with 50 videos (1.5Gb), and two movies there is only room left for 800 songs (4Mb each) and a few photos. I guess actual capacity is good only for Nano users.   Also be aware that your old cables for watching videos/movies on the TV are no good for the Touch. You will need a new set of video/audio cables because the format for video in the new devices is different, allegedly of better resolution. The old cables are good only for listening to music.  Due to the memory capacity limitations, I left all my music on my "old" 30Gb iPod Video (around 4,000 songs), and I am using my new iPod Touch just for photos, music videos and movies, and loading music only as you do with a iPod Shuffle, which is annoying, since I prefer to carry my entire collection of music, videos and photos together. Meanwhile, I will travel with both gadgets.   Aside from comments from other fellow reviewers, I will just add that the interface/software for surfing the web needs real improvements. I do better surfing with my cell phone's smaller screen than with the iPOD Touch.   After all this is always the price you pay for being among the first to use a new technology. I bet some patience will be fully rewarded in the very near future.

<Title>A revolutionary device, however...
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod Touch and don't have anything more positive to add than what's already here.  The reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that there there is a USB power issue that can affect older PCs.  If you read the technical support forums on Apple's site, media transfers can crap out after long transfer times.  Which means that on my 2.5 year old notebook, I cannot transfer large movies to my iPod Touch.  I need to use my newer laptop for syncing movies, which is very disappointing for me.

<Title>iPod Touch
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone who owns an iPod Touch knows it is an indispensable piece of electronic equipment.  Its dimensions are that of a Hershey's candy bar, and this is brilliant because the small size makes it easy to handle.  This particular version of an iPod serves as a computer, an MP3 player, and so much more.  One of its major features is its ability to access the Internet wherever there is a wireless modem.  Another feature is the impressive amount of music it can hold.  Specifically, the iPod Touch can store approximately 1,800 songs which play with just a touch of the screen.  This screen is very unique compared to any other MP3 player because it is sensitive to touch; therefore all of the controls are located on the screen itself.  Thus, the iPod "Touch."

<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player and after evaluating a few I checked the Touch.  I am glad I went with it because of the added features like internet connectivity and multiple other apps like mail, weather, contacts, maps, stocks, YouTube.  I have to be honest, I use it more for these other things than I do for music. I have even retired my windows based pda because the Touch does everything I used the pda for.  And the Touch also will transparently syncing with Outlook so my calendar and contacts are also there.  When I am not at home where I have wireless connectivity I don't have to go far to get connected.  While on vacation last week I was able to connect at every hotel/motel, restaurants, a library, a bank etc.  I can't imaging being without it.

<Title>treo user's review
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the itouch to hold me over until my treo's sprint contract completes.  If I actually walked around listening to music I would have just got the iphone.  My ipod is pretty much only used to play music in my cars.  I wanted the iphone without a contract.  The itouch was a perfect need-want compromise.  Technically the treo can do most things the itouch can but I'm already noticing how the itouch is changing how I do things.  In the morning I used to take a peek at email, the weather and stocks on my pc.  Now it's nice to do all this in bed on cold mornings as the heater kicks in.  I actually wish apple would make a slightly bigger itouch device to take around the house.  As small as the macbook air is, it's still a laptop.  Maybe because the itouch doesn't have a physical keyboard, it doesn't feel like some work shackle that I take around the house.  Also, my wife would kick me out of bed with a laptop.  Checking the weather and stocks on the treo is an ordeal.  On the itouch, you push one or two buttons.  I never watched youtube before but the resolution of the content and size of the itouch screen is a perfect fit.  Instead of seeing what's on tv, I'll poke around on youtube.    I have some gripes.  Browsing the web is pretty good but the experience gets me wishing for a slightly larger itouch.  It gets old expanding and moving every page.  Although not recommended, it's harder to change music in the car while driving because of the moving touch screen buttons and locking feature.  If your current ipod is close to being 8gb filled, then just get the next size up.  I spent 1.5 hours trying to figure out what content to exclude and will continue to have to do which wasn't worth saving $100.  Some conveniences I'm used to having with my treo make me want to just get the iphone now.  I google phone numbers all the time and wish I could click on the found number directly to call.  I'm also used to getting internet access anywhere with the treo where I'm confined to hotspots with the itouch.  Sure, open wi-fi is readily available, but rarely when you're stuck in bad traffic, in a car with a sleeping baby, or a long post office line.
