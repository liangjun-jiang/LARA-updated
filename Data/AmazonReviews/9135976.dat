<Title>Awesome player!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had an Ipod Mini before I got the Samsung and wasn't very happy with it. The YP-T9JAB !!for a fair price!! keeps all it's promises: the batteries last more than 20 hours. It's fun to listen to music or to watch short movies on it - which the player converts to the supported format without a fuss. The music upload is fast enough (updating the Ipod wasn't any faster) and the sound is great. The software is not as advanced as ITunes - but I'm hoping for updates.  I got new headphones though, I'm not particularly fond of the Samsung ones.  I can only recommend this mp3-player - there's no better choice.

<Title>Beware and warning. No good for eaudio books.
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Never buy anything from Ace Photo and Digital.  I encourage Amazon to sever all relations with this disreputable company.  I purchased the Samsung YP-T9 and it's defective.  I bought it to listen to audio books and it skips so badly I can't listen.  Ace Photo and Digital are so sleazy they don't have the integrity to let me return it for credit.

<Title>Awesome - Ipod killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this mp3 player! Its small, very light, and can hold a ton of music and movies, text, pictures, and some other stuff. The screen when watching movies is super clear! If your into Microsoft this thing syncs flawlessly with WMP 11. Although, if you are transfering video I would recommend using samsungs software because it compress's the video some how so you can still fit a ton of other sutff on it. I love it!  Now the bad  Dont call Samsung tech support - They freakin suck! I would recommend when you first get this player to download the firmware update for the unit and get the newest version of the samsung software for you computer (off of samsungs website).  The unit it self is kind of slow to boot up and navigate through each menu. It is flash based software though (very cool looking)

<Title>This is the one
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the one I've been waiting for.  I couldn't be happier, this feels like the time I got that huge Voltron when I was a kid in the 80s.  I've owned the Samsun T9 for a month now, and have zero buyers regret, and never even looked back at an iPod.  Loaded with features, this is a great device, and the price is even better.

<Title>Excelent media player
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There is nothing I would change on this little guy. It's fast, innovative, and good looking. The controls are easy to use and navigates pretty well. The display is beautiful and bright. Sound quality is good. Some of the covers made by third parties make the scroll buttons hard to press and it can confuse the controls. I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>this should clear up most of youur qualms about this productt...
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>so basically, i seem to see a lot of reviews saying that the product wont "work" or turn on or wutever, but thats only a selected few, and you could always exchange it, because trust me, when it works, its AMAZINg... so i bought mine right here off of amazon, and it worked fine. sure enough, there was occasional freezing, but that only happened in the first 3 hours of owning it, andit could easily be solved by holding the Menu and REc buttons and a few other buttons at times. SO... as for me personally, i did have an issue with the software/firmware thing- it took me a full week to figure out why things werent working. It seems to me that about 60% of owners of this product seem to have software problems, but if you search up forums on the t9, you'll figure everything out. Once you get the firmware, software, and the needed files, the T9 is everything you can ask for (see other reviews for detailed functions and etc). my only issue is the scratched screen which i could easily have avoided by NOT throwing in my backpack... T_T;;

<Title>Warranty? What Warranty?
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After using the YP-T9 for about 7 months, the battary would no longer accept a charge. Called Samsung for help and they asked for the serial #. Unfortunately the # is on a small label on the back of the unit, where it will easily wear off! No #, no warranty! They told me I could send it in and pay about $120 + shipping out of my own pocket to fix the problem. Gee, the unit itself only cost about $100. I also have one of their 50" widescreen DLP TVs and when I had a problem with hooking it up to my DVR using a HDMI cable, they immediatly blamed the problem on the DVR and told me to just use one of the other types of input cable. The HDMI input capability was one of the reasons I bought this unit! THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND HONOR THEIR WARRANTIES!!!

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compact with great graphics and sound. Size is perfect for working out or running and plenty of memory for a wide variety of music.   The proprietory software leaves a lot to be desired and Samsung doesn't have a USA available online store like Apple to purchase music.

<Title>A good alternative mp3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a pretty good mp3 player with only 1 drawback that I have to mention. The interface is rather slow and downloading music takes more time than it should. That criticism knocks it down a star but otherwise, I would recommend this mp3. However, that being said, I would not pay 320 dollars for this mp3 player. I mean, get real, why pay 320 bucks for this when you can get a 80 gb apple ipod for 250. I have to think that price cant be right because I paid half that.
