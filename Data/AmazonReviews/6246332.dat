<Title>Awesome player!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had an Ipod Mini before I got the Samsung and wasn't very happy with it. The YP-T9JAB !!for a fair price!! keeps all it's promises: the batteries last more than 20 hours. It's fun to listen to music or to watch short movies on it - which the player converts to the supported format without a fuss. The music upload is fast enough (updating the Ipod wasn't any faster) and the sound is great. The software is not as advanced as ITunes - but I'm hoping for updates.  I got new headphones though, I'm not particularly fond of the Samsung ones.  I can only recommend this mp3-player - there's no better choice.

<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Never buy anything from Ace Photo and Digital.  I encourage Amazon to sever all relations with this disreputable company.  I purchased the Samsung YP-T9 and it's defective.  I bought it to listen to audio books and it skips so badly I can't listen.  Ace Photo and Digital are so sleazy they don't have the integrity to let me return it for credit.

<Title>Awesome - Ipod killer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this mp3 player! Its small, very light, and can hold a ton of music and movies, text, pictures, and some other stuff. The screen when watching movies is super clear! If your into Microsoft this thing syncs flawlessly with WMP 11. Although, if you are transfering video I would recommend using samsungs software because it compress's the video some how so you can still fit a ton of other sutff on it. I love it!  Now the bad  Dont call Samsung tech support - They freakin suck! I would recommend when you first get this player to download the firmware update for the unit and get the newest version of the samsung software for you computer (off of samsungs website).  The unit it self is kind of slow to boot up and navigate through each menu. It is flash based software though (very cool looking)

I've owned the Samsun T9 for a month now, and have zero buyers regret, and never even looked back at an iPod.  Loaded with features, this is a great device, and the price is even better.

<Content>There is nothing I would change on this little guy. It's fast, innovative, and good looking. The controls are easy to use and navigates pretty well. The display is beautiful and bright. Sound quality is good. Some of the covers made by third parties make the scroll buttons hard to press and it can confuse the controls. I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>this should clear up most of youur qualms about this productt...
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>so basically, i seem to see a lot of reviews saying that the product wont "work" or turn on or wutever, but thats only a selected few, and you could always exchange it, because trust me, when it works, its AMAZINg... so i bought mine right here off of amazon, and it worked fine. sure enough, there was occasional freezing, but that only happened in the first 3 hours of owning it, andit could easily be solved by holding the Menu and REc buttons and a few other buttons at times. SO... as for me personally, i did have an issue with the software/firmware thing- it took me a full week to figure out why things werent working. It seems to me that about 60% of owners of this product seem to have software problems, but if you search up forums on the t9, you'll figure everything out. Once you get the firmware, software, and the needed files, the T9 is everything you can ask for (see other reviews for detailed functions and etc). my only issue is the scratched screen which i could easily have avoided by NOT throwing in my backpack...

<Title>Warranty? What Warranty?
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After using the YP-T9 for about 7 months, the battary would no longer accept a charge. Called Samsung for help and they asked for the serial #. Unfortunately the # is on a small label on the back of the unit, where it will easily wear off! No #, no warranty! They told me I could send it in and pay about $120 + shipping out of my own pocket to fix the problem. Gee, the unit itself only cost about $100. I also have one of their 50" widescreen DLP TVs and when I had a problem with hooking it up to my DVR using a HDMI cable, they immediatly blamed the problem on the DVR and told me to just use one of the other types of input cable. The HDMI input capability was one of the reasons I bought this unit! THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND HONOR THEIR WARRANTIES!!!

<Title>A good alternative mp3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a pretty good mp3 player with only 1 drawback that I have to mention. The interface is rather slow and downloading music takes more time than it should. That criticism knocks it down a star but otherwise, I would recommend this mp3. However, that being said, I would not pay 320 dollars for this mp3 player. I mean, get real, why pay 320 bucks for this when you can get a 80 gb apple ipod for 250. I have to think that price cant be right because I paid half that.

<Title>BEGINNER"S REVIEW... Great buy!!
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Samsung T9 4GB was the first MP3 player I have ever purchased. After reading many reviews on many products, I finally settled for the Samsung T9. I AM TOTALLY DELIGHTED WITH MY PURCHASE! The sound is SPECTACULAR! The T9 design is SLEEK and ELEGANT and smaller than my small cell phone. For the "technologically challenged" it's been pretty simple to operate. I downloaded the manual from Samsung's website...no problems! Transferring songs was a breeze (from Rhapsody To Go). I love the RECORD function and look forward to having fun with the FM radio, video and photo functions. I have learned quickly that 4GB is not enough space if you want to include lots of music AS WELL AS your favorite photos and videos. I'm new to this MP3 scene and I am already  researching for a MP3 player with at least 16GB!!  As others reported, the earphones are not the most comfortable but the sound is absolutely wonderful!! I purchased these accessories which have really come in handy and which I reccommend:        SonyCPA-9C MiniDisc and Discman Cassette         Adapter for use in the car, Samsung K5/T Power Pack        and the Kensington 33388 FX Speakers To Go.  In summary, the T9 IS A GREAT PRODUCT...especially for beginners to "get their MP3 feet wet"! The cost is low and the sound is great. The accessories (not included) make your listening pleasure more enjoyable and provide greater portability. My only wish is that Samsung would have at least an 8 or 16GB MP3 player. As a music lover, you fast learn that 4 GB just does not provide enough space to hold all of your "favorites"!

<Title>A really nice player
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have shopped around quite awhile before I decided on this particular player.  I looked at the Sandisk e260, the 4gb Ipod and the Creative Zen V Plus, but really liked the mix of features that Samsung provided.  It is smaller than the Ipod, but does a whole lot more (FM radio, voice recording, flash games) has a better screen than the Creative and seemed much more solid than the Sandisk (which everyone seems to complain has a buzzy noise you can hear).  The only one I, and most review sites, seemed to like more was the Iriver Clix, but it was significantly more expensive and I didnt feel it was worth the difference.    The startup is a bit slow and there is a short gap between songs, but the volume and clarity are exceptionally good, the screen is bright, the controls feel solid and are easy to use and the interface is very intuitive.  I like that it is compatible with Windows Media as well.  It has an impressive battery life too.  I have been to the gym multiple times, played the flash games for a few hours on a plane trip (which are not wonderful, but more can be added as they were with the latest firmware upgrade) and listened to a few hours of music outside the gym and the battery hasnt eclipsed the halfway mark.  Most reviews say you can listen for 30 plus hours before charging it and I believe it.    It would be nice if it came with a pouch or some kind of holder in package, but it doesnt.  At present, the accessories are lacking, but I expect that to pick up shortly.  Overall a solid value and a very strong Ipod competitor.

<Title>Not just another fanboy review-- This player is truly awesome
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After owning a iPod mini for three years, I felt like I needed a new player. I could go with the new, sleek nano- click wheel, clean interface, iTunes support... Not much else that was cool. I had heard about the T9, and went to check it out. It was clear that Samsung was determined to make a great player that could be a full competitor to the nano. With the smaller size, bigger and better screen, video, fm radio and recording, a mic, and even flash games, it looked great. After purchasing it, I was immediately pleased. The interface was smooth, and transferring songs was very easy with the packaged software. It may not be all it could, but it gets the job done fairly fast. Of course, I loaded it up with songs from my mini. No surprise, playing music was easy,  organized and nice sounding. The player has several different sound EQs, as well as their own "3D sound" technology. It also has a play speed feature, which is convenient for audiobooks. I also find it quite amusing with normal songs.  The picture viewing is nicely done, too. It shows one picture large on the left, and three smaller on the right in a bar. Selecting one maximizes it to the full screen, and from there you can zoom in, select it for your theme background, or go to the next one in your collection. I've found that pictures look surprisingly good on it's screen.  Video, a feature missing from the nano, works quite well here. Samsung Media Studio, (The packaged software) supports MP4 and AVI video, and then converts it into it's own SVI format to conserve space. Again, the screen makes video great. I don't mind the small size at all, personally.  The radio is another good feature, with shortcuts for favorite stations. It has generally good reception. You can view text files as well. Flash games are surprisingly detailed, and more are added as firmware is updated. The FM recording is awesome. You can choose from either 96, 128, 160 and 192kbps. Voice recording also works well, with similar bitrate options available. There's also a file browser, which is great for deleting files directly off of the player. Overall, this player is full of features, but all of them are done really well. If you're looking for a player that is known for it's convenient interface, ingenious navigation, and it's great software and music store, but not much else, go and buy and iPod. Please. But if you want a truly unique, high-quality, feature full player that's sure to but a smile on your face, go with the T9. You won't be dissapointed.

<Title>Nice MP3 player! Plus more......
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all this device was super-easy to use right out of the package,even if your running Windows Vista which I thought might be a problem because the software that comes with the Samsung T9 wouldnt download on Vista. There is a link on the Samsung site that allows you to get the software, but it transfers files fine from Windows media player if you dont want to use the Samsung software. The advantage of the Samsung software is that it compresses files (especially videos) to a smaller size. And it is also easy to use and navigate. I hear this player works well with pay download sites, but I wouldnt know because I use free ones with no problems at all. I have my entire music library on it, plus about eight 1/2 hour TV shows and an entire Disney movie on it. The picture is very clear and the menu / buttons are easy to navigate once you get used to them. The only thing I didnt like was the headphones,I personally dont like the ear-bud type so I replaced them. I also bought an inexpensive,off brand plug-in type of small speaker from a discount store that fits into the earbud/headphone jack so I can listen to it without headphones. So even though this player doesnt have accessories yet,you can find some that do work with it. As far as a case...you can fit this in most any standard case on the market or make your own. I knitted a sleeve for mine, I usually keep mine in my pocket in its homemade sleeve and no scratches so far. Its not as flimsy as an ipod, no sensitive, crappy fly-wheel so you can put it in your jeans pocket. I also love that I can store my photos on it and text documents. I store everything from directions, to shopping lists, to knitting patterns on it, and they are easy to download as well from your Windows notepad/documents. The radio stations are also a great feature, they come in very clear even in an industrial type workplace and the station pre-sets are handy to have.You can also customize the sound of your music from a menu of different sound settings. I havent used the recording feature on it yet, or played the two games much but the graphics are pretty good on them. I also like how you can customize the screen color, text color, and music background picture. The battery life on this thing is spectacular as well! It takes a little bit of time to transfer alot of files at once onto it, especially videos, but its not bad. Who is in that much of a hurry anyway? It is worth the wait once you see it on this player. Great value, and easy to use...my kids with ipods envy me!

<Content>This Samsung is worth every penny!  This multi-media player has many easy to operate features.  Recording music off of the radio is one of many it offers.  The display color and clarity is very impressive as well.  The only thing that I wish was different was Samsung does not offer many accessories for this product.  I knew this before purchase(after reading a review)so it obviously did not stop me.  No regrets. To avoid scratching the display screen...I have my player in the plastic bag the ear buds came in for now.  =0)~

What I didn't realize that none of the things I wanted to listen to (podcasts mostly) were on iTunes--which won't work with anything but an iPod.    Argh!

<Date>Sun Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this about 8 months ago and I've loved it- it does everything the ipod does and more, for less money. I always used Yahoo to download music and i never had any problems, until about two weeks ago. Everytime I plug it in to the computer, it freezes up. Now I can't download any music to it... very frustrating! I've tried looking online for help but nothing has worked, next step will be to call customer service.  It's really nice that it has radio built in, that it records voice and radio, and that it plays video. I have no complaints while it was working- If I was to do it again I'd try a different brand- after reading these reviews I'm not so sure about Samsung's reliability. Personally, I still wouldn't get an Ipod- I think they are a rip off, and it's ridiculous they only use Itunes.

<Title>Perfect for a runner and podcast listener
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After I soaked and ruining my Ipod by running with it in my pocket I decided to buy an MP3 player that was more suited to run, listen to music, listen to radio and listen to spoken podcast.  First I bought the 2GB version, loved it. Then gave it to my wife and bought this one with larger memory.  The Samsung software isn't useful but the T9 runs well with Windows Media Player (once you get used to WMP rather than Itunes).  The radio has perfect reception and the navigation buttons and OS is good once you get used to it.  I just finished a airline trip with my son.  After Ripping and loading Eragon (14 discs) into the player we listened on the plane with a earphone double jack and got through 8 CDs and the battery indicator only dropped "one bar".  To run with the T9 buy the simple rubber cover and velcro strap from Belkin.  Simple, effective, and the rubber cover is a great protector to use all the time.

<Content>Overall, I like this little MP3 player.    First, the bad.  I don't particularly like the software that comes with it, so I use Rhapsody to do everything I need to.  I also don't like that I can't set the volume to always turn on at a certain level, so if I turn the player off, when I turn it back on it goes back to whatever the default is.    The good is that I love the size of the player, it's easy to navigate through the different menus, and there's enough memory so that I've never even managed to get the thing even halfway full of music.  It has video features I never use, but I've run the video that it comes with and the picture is very clear.

<Title>Outstanding player for a good price
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an avid runner and was interested in adding an mp-3 player to make the runs less dull. I wasn't sure exactly what type to get and decided to do detailed research in order to find not only the best value, but a player that would make the most of the features that it contained.   I chose the T-9 after looking at research conducted through not only Consumer reports and Cnet. Both ranked the player very high and Consumer Reports listed it as the #1 player. I also looked at what other users had said on Amazon and by carefully weighing the good with the bad I ordered the T-9.  I have nothing but good things to say about this player. It works incredibly well, synchs very easily and plays all the music I could want without any hesitation or trouble.   It has good battery life and has the most incredible sound I have heard out of any of the players I read about or researched. To put ti in plain terms for the money that you spend, this will satisfy all your needs and although it doesn't have the massive amount of storage space that other players have, it still gives you enough space to do all you want and more.   I don't see too much of a downside to this, with the exception of storage space being limited, it really is all it claims to be. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second portable music player (don't care about pictures, video, etc). I use mp3 players for music while out on the motorcycle. Important to me are:  * ability to load lots of songs * good shuffle (not many repeats) * easy access to controls * good volume to overcome wind and engine noise * good battery life on one charge * ease of loading music  My previous MP3 player was a Rio Cali with 756 MB ram. It did OK but controls were difficult to access. I'm now running Windows Vista and there's no software to support the Cali. After reading other reviews here, the Samsung T9 seemed worth a try.  * ability to load lots of songs - 4 GB is a huge amount of space compared with my old Cali. No need to swap around SD cards or anything. I can listen to it all week long and not get bored with it.  * good shuffle (not many repeats) - after about a week of ownership I do find the shuffle feater will play the same song sometimes with only one or two songs in between. With so many songs on the player, it seems this should be a rare event. Not as rare as I hoped.  * easy access to controls - I can keep the T9 in my pants pocket and skip songs or change volume while riding. The controls are big enough to feel through the denim but not so sensitive to accidentally trigger. The pause/off is a little inconvenient but it is not an issue.  * good volume to overcome wind and engine noise - plenty of volume. I ditched the earphones that came with it and use my old Etymotic ER-6 earphones. There is little distortion at loud volumes.  * good battery life on one charge - impressive. It charges quickly and there's enough juice for about 10 hours on the road, maybe more. Not sure how the battery will hold out in the long term. I'm also not sure if or how the battery is replaced in the unit. I have to check the directions again.  * ease of loading music - I'm using WMP 11 and the Urge music service. The DRM music is a little inconvenient because of the licensing but WMP does a nice job of loading up the device. I also worked with Media Studio 5. It is a fine program and I can't say WMP has many features over it except that I use WMP all the time so there's no need for Media Studio.  In general, I'm very happy with the purchase. It is a nice upgrade from the Rio Cali.

<Content>Just to clarify a previous review, this device is compatible with Napster2Go. I have Napster2Go and it recognized my t9 immediately and works impecably well. The processors is a little slow. Turning it on and off also takes some time. The sound quality is very nice and it's so small it fits in any pocket. The battery life is pretty good. It was my first mp3 player so I can't compare with any other device. All I can say is that it's easy enough for me to use and have enjoyed it since the first day I got it.

<Title>Video does not work; MP3 is great.
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am not sure where to rate this puppy.    Pros -- intuitive interface -- looks great! -- MP3 player works well -- great photo player -- excellent quality voice recording   However!!!! Cons -- I bought this b/c it did everything an IPOD does (although IPOD interface is still better), and it plays videos, has FM tuner etc, and is cheaper; but several of the features have major flaws: -- VIDEO DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PLAYER!!!!!!  If you are getting this to play video then do not get this.  I have scoured the interet about the video problem and many, many people are saying the same thing about the video. -- FM Tuner is very weak!!!!! -- Samsung software is WEEAAAKKKK!!!! and frustrating to use!!!!!  Those are my three biggest gripes, and they are big gripes as the Video and FM tuner are two big reasons I got this player.  Still, it does look sharp and the price is great for a 4GB.  I got mine for $130 at Best Buy.  I still like it but it hurts that video and FM Tuner do not work.

<Content>I like this player. This is especially true since Rhapsody updated their interface with it. It handles Rhapsody-To-Go, which I enjoy far more than I thought I would. I like this player because I can create Favorite's Lists and can maneuver the buttons in the car without having to look down. The different audible beeps lets me know how many menus I've moved through and gives me a general idea of where I'm at. I'd have to say the one down side to it is that it is a little slow.

<Content>This is probably one of the best MP3/media players I have ever had.  Not only is it very small, but it is packed with features.  Only downfall I see is that it doesn't have bluetooth technology for wireless headphones, but there will soon be a version with bluetooth, so it appears as though Samsung hit the ball outta the park with the T9 :-)

<Title>Good player, weak software
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Samsung YP-T9 for a couple months, and in terms of sound quality and usability of the device, I have not been disappointed.  What is extremely disappointing, however, is that Samsung did not make the effort to include first class software with their first class player.  I am a software developer, and it pains me when I see a hardware device severely weakened by mediocre software.  And, be assured, Samsung Media Studio (SMS) is mediocre, particularly when it comes to playlists.  First of all, how about calling a playlist a playlist?  Samsung calls them "Albums" in the software and "playlists" on the player.  How goofy is that?  Secondly, when you connect the YP-T9 to your computer, you don't see the playlists at all in the view of the player you get in SMS.  Thirdly, if you thought a "playlist" was a list of songs that play in the order you specify, you were mistaken.  When you transfer an "album" from SMS to the player, you can simply forget about the order of the songs in the playlist on the player resembling the order that you set them up in in SMS.  Fourthly, I saw a message somewhere in the software suggesting that if you update an "album" in the software, the next time you connect the device, it would sync the album/playlist automatically.  I have never seen that happen.  You can sort of use Windows Media Player to transfer songs to the YP-T9, but that seems to be a song at a time.  I did not see a way to take a WMP playlist and transfer it to the device and have it show up as a playlist on the device.  Come on, Samsung.  Let's have some software that is worthy of your player.

<Content>This MP3 player is a significant improvement over my previous Dell MP3 player.  I have a set of WESTONE studio monitors and the music clarity is excellent.  The hold switch is handy for locking the player, as I travel frequently and do not want it to be accidentally turned on while in my brief case. The battery life is excellent (rated at 30 hour play back).  Negatives are 1) playlist compliation cannot be done on the unit, that is you must build the playlist on your PC and transfer to the unit, and 2) no AC charger ships with the device, only a USB based charger is included.  The pros are: 1) excellent playback, 2) small form factor and lightweight, 3) good display, and 4) simple screen navigation.
