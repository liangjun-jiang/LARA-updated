<Title>I Love my I Pod Touch
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Being of the 40 over generation and needing reading glasses, the Ipod touch is wonderful, I don't have to squint to read those little buttons.  It's all on the screen and large enough to see. Then I just touch away.  Editing photos for my contacts is so easy, and I love showing off my I Pod touch to everyone and how easy it is to use.  Watching music videos and movies.  Now when I do have a long airplane ride ahead of me, I can download a movie or two and watch them while on the plane.  I also listen audio books, meditation music and classic rock and roll and even my some of my daughters music, which I probably woulnd't have done before, so I am keeping up on some of the newer music and videos.  My IPod touch is great.

<Content>My fiance and I bought iPod touches at the same time and we both LOVE them.  Wouldn't trade it for any other mp3 player.  The only thing that sucks is having to spend an additional 20 bucks to get the upgrade, but it is worth it.  We have reccomended this product to all our friends.  Everyone that has tried ours have felt the same about them as we have.

<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My review of the IPOD TOUCH  is just spectacular ,I give it this review because I drop my ipod in some water and didn't even realize it until it was to late and it got all wet' and I had just purchase it on the 27th of Jan, anyway I thought all was lost until 3 days later I put the ipod on the modem from my desktop which generates heat' by doing that the remaining water that was inside the IPOD gradually disappeared before u know it I was using my ipod again. I was really upset before this happen but luckily it returned to it's original form,"however APPLE design this product I give them a thumbs up, they must have had some type of protection around the chip inside but whatever it is it saved my ipod from destruction..

<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple iPod touch is a great electronic device. You have music, videos, photos, internet- everything at your fingertips literally!!  The touch interface is well designed, and the clarity of images are superb. The only things I have against this device is that my finger is a little too big for the tiny screen keyboard and browsing the web. I wish the screen could be a little bigger, but this would have a negative impact on the overall footprint. Great device!

<Title>Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted an ipod touch since the first moment I saw it. It is an excelent MP3 player, with the apple quality. The screen is amazing, the touch interface works perfectly. I think it has 2 things that could be better:  1- The back of the ipod get scratched so easy, I recommed get an ipod case, otherwise it will have hundreds of scratches in 2 days.  2- The volume, if you have your ipod playing and locked and you want to change the volume level, you must press the unlock button then slide the touch button to unlock it, go to "music" -> "playing now" and change the volume. This is very annoying!! sometimes I have the ipod in my pocket and have to do all that to change the volume, a little volume control out of the screen will make it a perfect MP3 player.  But well, this item is amazing, I recommend it.

<Title>Outraged that Apple is charging $20 for a system update!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am outraged that Apple is charging early buyers of the iPod Touch $20 for a system update that ought to be free.  While I understand Apple's decision to charge money for the new applications the new $20 "application pack" also includes a SYSTEM UPDATE in the form of the home page editing, web clips, and lyrics features. All of these are updates to the currently existing iPod Touch software and NOT new applications, which means that they ought to be free to all users of the iPod Touch.  Adding insult to injury these applications are all hidden in the 1.1.3 system update, a whopping 104.4mb file that all users must download if they want to fix bugs in the system. These applications can only be used when you pay Apple $20 to "unlock" them, but even if you decide not to buy them they stay on your iPod taking up precious space that could be used for songs, videos, or photos.  Apple is normally wonderful when it comes to providing system support and updates, but having them shaft early adopters and loyal fans like this is offensive and shows that Apple has absolutely no regard for the iPod Touch community.  I was not planning on jailbreaking my iPod Touch, but after this outrageous behavior on the part of Apple I probably will.

<Title>Exquisite piece of technology
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my first CD player about 15 years ago, but rarely purchased CDs.  The thought of spending $15 to $20 on every CD that may or may not have more than 1 song I liked on it seemed ridiculous.  You could say I've waited 15 years for this.  The iPod touch 8GB is absolutely beautiful.  The design is impeccable.  The system is so easy to learn.  But I do have one small complaint.  I would prefer a paper manual for quick reference in locating features of the iPod.  I agree that it is best to minimize over-production of paper products that can be supplemented by digital documents. But I still hate reading through manuals via my computer monitor.  Yet, the lack of paper manual, that I would have looked at only a few times, does not hold weight against my love for my iPod touch.       I am at a loss for where to begin a description of everything I love about the entire design and function.  But one thing I must point out is that the use of the internet browser is not frustrating.  I would have expected frustration in surfing the internet without a large monitor, mouse and keyboard.  Truly a remarkable design in making the speed & simplicity of surfing the net on a small iPod.     Thank you Apple, I love you.

I had a lot of trouble choosing between this and a kune but I'm happy with my decision to get the ipod. I bought it for the reduced price of about $260 then could'get the upgrades that came out the next week because Appple is cheap but I sort of knew that might happen.

<Content>I got this iPod for my husband for his birthday.  This is our first iPod, but not our first MP3 player.  He loves it and takes it everywhere he goes.  The 8 gig capacity has proven plenty for his favorite music and videos.  We have not tried it for movies.  This iPod has all the same features as my iPhone except the phone and external speaker.  The new feature pack is worth the $20 download cost.  He loves to check the weather and maps.

<Title>Worth it if you're willing to hack it
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod Touch is a great media player for people who don't have a million songs to upload. I am very picky with what goes onto my iPod and can barely fill up my 4GB nano 2G. It's sleek and have an intuitive OS, which probably doesn't surprise anybody familiar with Apple products.  What got me excited about this product is that it can act as a PDA if you're willing to put in the time. There are countless websites out there that explain how to "jailbreak" this device and installing free 3rd-party applications. Once you do that, you have a PDA and media player for a mere $260. One can even make free internet phone calls on it if by buying a proprietary microphone and installing VoIP software. In the end, the iPod Touch can be 95% like an iPhone for much less money. This product is fine on its own, but outstanding if you tweak it. Because of the potential in this device, I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Crazy Fun IPod
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, at first I thought it was a little radical with all the bells and whistles and what not, but when I used my friends, I was sold. I was deciding to get a new IPod because my old gen.1 Nano was starting to 'go' if you know what I mean. I have always been a nano lover, and I was gonna buy the Nano. Then I got curious, I looked into the Touch a little and was amazed. Then a couple of weeks later, my friend got one, and let me try it out. AMAZING. It's pros definetly outway it's cons.  PROS: 1. The nice slim body plate. It's cool how nice and small they got it for something with so much. 2. Even though this part is half pro half con (because you'll rarely use it after a while) The internet is REALLY nice. 3. Very nice looking. 4. Light weight design. 5. Many things to keep you occupied BESIDES listening to music.  CONS:  1. It's a bit over priced. 2. Kinda tricky to get used to, especially if you're used to other IPods. 3. Not really that much of a con, but some of the bells and whistles become not used after a couple of weeks.                   So the answer to the all important question:                           "Should I buy one?"                        If you can afford it: YES!

<Title>Great Design - Poor Performance
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The touch-screen and colors on the Ipod touch are superb. This is where the great story comes to an end and makes me cling onto my 4G and 5G Ipod's for performance. The user interface is sluggish and the time lag to response irritating. The Wi-Fi is so slow even when i stand on top of my DSL wireless router that it is waste of time to even try and check your email or surf any websites. What make things worse is that 2 of the keys on the "Virtual Keyboard" simply do not work. These are the 5 Key and R key. I am perplexed as every time i try and attempt this input with vertical or horizontal screen orientation the input character is the adjacent key. Therefore it is usually impossible for me to login to my Gmail. It may be a defect on the screen of just my unit - but i dont know if this is the case or whether the OS of the Touch is flawed. The sound quality is decent, but a lot needs to be done to get this Ipod to work fast , reliably and without input issues. Performance is as important as looks when you pay so much for a device.

<Title>Awesome New iPod
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's newest iPod is really great. It has internet, youtube, photos, video and even iTunes. The most surprising thing about the iPod is that it's REALLY fast for such a small gadget. The iPod touch works much in the same as previous iPod, but it expands on the features.  The downside to the new iPod Touch is that it feels fragile. I would never want to put it in my pocket because I would be too afraid to scratch the screen or even break it. The ipod itself is super thin, which makes it easier to break.  The iPod touch is a great new iPod, but if your looking for something you can rough up a bit, try the iPod classic or nano.

<Title>Sweet advances
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking to upgrade my trooper of an Ipod Mini and was going to upgrade to an Ipod classic but when I saw what the touch offered I was intrigued. What sold me on the touch was the wi-fi capability. After many years I reuturned to college to pursue a bachelors degree and the touch's wi-fi capability has been an excellent feature. Many of my courses have an online component and instead of hauling my laptop or wating in line to use one of the university's computers, I can use my touch to check email or see the latest discussion postings or contribute to the discussions. Typing has been excellent, very few errors and I have gotten quite fast. I use the widescreen view when I observe web pages and the zoom function is just plain sweet. I am awed by the interface, very responsive. Any misses or non-responces are due to my errors and not the interfaces. You have to train yourself a little bit on using the touch screen but it's not difficult.  Some have complained about storage capacity but reality check people. Not everyone needs 80 or 160 gb's of storage. I have the 8 gb model of the touch which is double my old mini's capacity and it suits my needs perfectly. A couple of gb's of music and audiobooks, a few tv show episodes for when I have no reading or studying to do between classes, a few short films, and some photos to share with my classmates, such as my new niece.   Sound quality is excellent and I have had zero issues using the touch in my car with the power adaptor and fm transmitter. Battery life so far has been excellent with me mixing up music, video and photo slideshow use. I have not had any issues concerning the screan or the touch acting all wonky. At the moment I am using it an average of about five hours a day and zero issues as of this time.

<Title>Product's Great: Video selections mediocre
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iTouch is a great little device. It's easy to use, fun and great grown-up toy.  Since I already own an 8 gig ipod Nano, which I use for audio books and some music,  I bought this to view videos on long plane trips.  It's much more convenient that dragging out my laptop. The problem I have run into, however, is that iTunes doesn't have the most current or greatest selection of movies.  Hopefully, they'll come up to speed as more and more househoulds buy this product. In the meantime, I suppose I'll have to download tv re-runs and videos I've see before but still enjoy....

<Title>Great product, but it does need much more memory for the power users!
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Watching videos on the iPod Touch is quite an improvement over the iPod video, particularly, due to the bigger screen size. As commented by other reviewers, this gadget is wonderful, but if you are used to the kind of storage capacity of an iPod Video (30Gb) and you are serious about watching videos and movies with it, you are going to need much more memory, so at least go for the 16Gb version, or even better, wait until Apple decides to put more memory in it (30 Gb should be the minimum for music and video). Every iTunes movie is 1.6 Gb, then, with five movies the 8Gb will be full. Every music video is between 20-40 Mb. Then, with 50 videos (1.5Gb), and two movies there is only room left for 800 songs (4Mb each) and a few photos. I guess actual capacity is good only for Nano users.   Also be aware that your old cables for watching videos/movies on the TV are no good for the Touch. You will need a new set of video/audio cables because the format for video in the new devices is different, allegedly of better resolution. The old cables are good only for listening to music.  Due to the memory capacity limitations, I left all my music on my "old" 30Gb iPod Video (around 4,000 songs), and I am using my new iPod Touch just for photos, music videos and movies, and loading music only as you do with a iPod Shuffle, which is annoying, since I prefer to carry my entire collection of music, videos and photos together. Meanwhile, I will travel with both gadgets.   Aside from comments from other fellow reviewers, I will just add that the interface/software for surfing the web needs real improvements. I do better surfing with my cell phone's smaller screen than with the iPOD Touch.   After all this is always the price you pay for being among the first to use a new technology. I bet some patience will be fully rewarded in the very near future.

<Title>A revolutionary device, however...
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod Touch and don't have anything more positive to add than what's already here.  The reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that there there is a USB power issue that can affect older PCs.  If you read the technical support forums on Apple's site, media transfers can crap out after long transfer times.  Which means that on my 2.5 year old notebook, I cannot transfer large movies to my iPod Touch.  I need to use my newer laptop for syncing movies, which is very disappointing for me.

<Title>iPod Touch
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone who owns an iPod Touch knows it is an indispensable piece of electronic equipment.  Its dimensions are that of a Hershey's candy bar, and this is brilliant because the small size makes it easy to handle.  This particular version of an iPod serves as a computer, an MP3 player, and so much more.  One of its major features is its ability to access the Internet wherever there is a wireless modem.  Another feature is the impressive amount of music it can hold.  Specifically, the iPod Touch can store approximately 1,800 songs which play with just a touch of the screen.  This screen is very unique compared to any other MP3 player because it is sensitive to touch; therefore all of the controls are located on the screen itself.  Thus, the iPod "Touch."

<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player and after evaluating a few I checked the Touch.  I am glad I went with it because of the added features like internet connectivity and multiple other apps like mail, weather, contacts, maps, stocks, YouTube.  I have to be honest, I use it more for these other things than I do for music. I have even retired my windows based pda because the Touch does everything I used the pda for.  And the Touch also will transparently syncing with Outlook so my calendar and contacts are also there.  When I am not at home where I have wireless connectivity I don't have to go far to get connected.  While on vacation last week I was able to connect at every hotel/motel, restaurants, a library, a bank etc.  I can't imaging being without it.

<Title>treo user's review
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the itouch to hold me over until my treo's sprint contract completes.  If I actually walked around listening to music I would have just got the iphone.  My ipod is pretty much only used to play music in my cars.  I wanted the iphone without a contract.  The itouch was a perfect need-want compromise.  Technically the treo can do most things the itouch can but I'm already noticing how the itouch is changing how I do things.  In the morning I used to take a peek at email, the weather and stocks on my pc.  Now it's nice to do all this in bed on cold mornings as the heater kicks in.  I actually wish apple would make a slightly bigger itouch device to take around the house.  As small as the macbook air is, it's still a laptop.  Maybe because the itouch doesn't have a physical keyboard, it doesn't feel like some work shackle that I take around the house.  Also, my wife would kick me out of bed with a laptop.  Checking the weather and stocks on the treo is an ordeal.  On the itouch, you push one or two buttons.  I never watched youtube before but the resolution of the content and size of the itouch screen is a perfect fit.  Instead of seeing what's on tv, I'll poke around on youtube.    I have some gripes.  Browsing the web is pretty good but the experience gets me wishing for a slightly larger itouch.  It gets old expanding and moving every page.  Although not recommended, it's harder to change music in the car while driving because of the moving touch screen buttons and locking feature.  If your current ipod is close to being 8gb filled, then just get the next size up.  I spent 1.5 hours trying to figure out what content to exclude and will continue to have to do which wasn't worth saving $100.  Some conveniences I'm used to having with my treo make me want to just get the iphone now.  I google phone numbers all the time and wish I could click on the found number directly to call.  I'm also used to getting internet access anywhere with the treo where I'm confined to hotspots with the itouch.  Sure, open wi-fi is readily available, but rarely when you're stuck in bad traffic, in a car with a sleeping baby, or a long post office line.

It's an iPod; it's an Address Book; it's an Internet access device with real-time surfing of the web; it's a Photo album; and on and on. It's something completely new, with a real OSX foundation. I think that it's going to take a while to puzzle out everything that it can do. The future is limitless. . .

<Title>Fun new gizmo
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've looked at the Iphones and lve the look and feel.  But didn't want to bloat the monthly cell phone budget any further.   And I didn't need another Ipod.  My 30 GB video Ipod has worked great since I got it.   But I was drawn to the new Ipod Touch not just by its interface and sleek appearance.   It was the wi-fi.  I like using it to check emails or a quick browse in the early morning or at night when I don't want to boot up my computer.   Its quick and easy and the display is sharp enough to read text without a problem.    Another plus is the battery really lasts longer on this than on either or my two earlier Ipods.   Finally, they got that right.  The cover display on the music end is very crisp and it works great with my Unviersal dock and remote.     On the down side, its only 8 gigs.   But 2000 songs will last awhile.    The Ipod Touch is another step forward.

<Content>It's amazing, simply amazing!!! You can't imagine how incredible it is until you lay your hands on it!!! Of course there are some issues that probably will be fixed with a firmware atualization but, even with these little problems it's the most incredible piece of hardware that I've ever seen...

<Title>I absolutely LOVE it, but...
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a gift from my fiancee, and I have been having a great time with it.  For those of you who have not had an oportunity to see one in person, they are quite amazing: it feels like you are holding something from the future right in your hand.  The interface is great (go Apple) and coverflow works like a charm.  As an iPod, the hardware still has some issues.  On a couple of occasions, I have been showing-off the features to a friend (be prepared to do this a lot).  During navigating through playlists and songs, I (or friends)have accidentally started playing a song.  If the headphones aren't plugged in, this is easy to overlook, and the song will keep playing as you navigate through other features and later goes to sleep (still playing).  One day later, the battery will be dead.  It's not a big issue, but it wold be nice if there were a little led or perhaps a banner on the home screen to indicate that music is playing.  Another iPod consideration is that the touch screen means you can't operate the controls (brace yourself for irony) "by touch".  If you plan on using it for tunes in your car, you had better find a single playlist and a comfortable volume setting and leave it alone while driving.  On my old 2-Gen iPod, I can reach down and fast-forward, rewind, pause, lower the volume or turn off without taking my eyes off the road.  That isn't a criticism of the iPod touch per se, but it should be a consideration for those of you who are deciding between an 8GB touch and an 8GB nano for $100 less.  While driving, the iPod touch has even less functionality than a shuffle (you still can't see what's playing, but you can control the music by touch/feel).  The touch does have WiFi, which seems beyond cool at first, but zooming and panning (despite Apple's great pinch/stretch design) stops being interesting after a while, and you'll go back to browsing on your laptop.  You can check your mail using the WiFi and a web application, and I would expect that some of these web interfaces will become scaled specifically for the touch in the future.   There is also a calendar feature on the iPod touch, but unlike the iPhone, you cannot make any changes to the calendar (aka you cannot add "events").  I very much need an app where I can update my calendar on the go.  For now, I am still stuck with having to carry my palm pilot with me.  A working calendar, notepad, and other features may be available in a later software update.  If not, Apple is trying to release a (non-web-tethered)software developer's kit for the iPod and iPhone in early 2008.  I'm sure a good calendar app, contacts app, good notes app won't drag to far behind.  So, I love it.  Lots.  I hate myself for only giving it three stars, but a crippled calendar application and an all-to-easy way to leave your music running and drain your battery are below the standards I have for Apple's hardware.  If I had $300 for myself, I would buy a nano and have a $100 stockpile for accessories.  However, once I had the iPod touch in my hands, I couldn't let go.  ***EDIT 11/21/07*** With the latest iPod update (through iTunes), you can now add and edit events in your calendar.  My iPod touch can now replace my Palm Pilot, and I am a very happy camper.  I'd change my rating to four stars, if I could.

<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I held off on a portable video player till one came along that had all the features I felt were worth the cost.  This has the compact size, high resolution, long battery life and big screen size - and was worth the wait.  I've got 5 hours of video and another 5 of audio and it's only half full - I didn't feel the need to carry around a week's worth of entertainment so the 16 G wasn't worth the extra $$ for me.  The wi-fi link is also fun - great for checking weather when traveling.  Highly recommended.

Hace 5 d�as comprmi IPT de 8G y bueno, como por variar, el estilo que el Sr. Jobs acostumbra colocar en TODOS sus productos, simplemente estempacado como toda una joya, se puede comparar su embalaje con un reloj Cartier sin temor a exagerar, no hay nada mas que decir.  Con respecto al producto les puedo decir que b�sicamente es una palm al estilo Mac, esto a pesar que el mismo Sr. Jobs ha colocado muchas restricciones en las aplicaciones que se pueden correr en el iPod, lo que equivale a tener un Ferrari con un limitador de velocidad a las 20 mph, pero muy seguramente esto a las buenas o las "malas" tendrque cambiar.  La interface es completamente intuitiva, nada oculto, todo literalmente al alcance de un dedo y ademas es preciosa.  Bueno, espero que este peque�o resumen les pueda ayudar a tomar la decision de compra de este MAGNIFICO producto.

<Title>Great device, intentionally crippled
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first ipod I have owned (but not first mp3 player), so I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered it.  The touch has some very innovative features. The cover flow is a nice addition, the keyboard is surprisingly usable, and the built in wifi support is an incredibly useful thing to have.  However, those features cannot overcome the fact that Apple failed to include features that are a standard among every other MP3 player in the market, in some cases including their own products.  1) You cannot transfer songs, pictures, or any other form of media by using the mass storage (dragging and dropping through windows). This means that you cannot use this on any computer without itunes, and you can't use it on Linux or Solaris at all. This feature is present in literally all of the ipods competition.  2) Not only can you not transfer media, you can't use it to transfer files between computers at all. According to my brother, you can do this on even other ipods. I had planned on using this to transfer large projects between home and my school computer lab.   3) Software that came on the iphone was deliberately left out purely to separate it form the iphone. For example, notes is left out of the ipod. Why would you leave out Notes, But keep Calendar and Contacts? This is pure software, their is no reason Apple could not have put it on the ipod.  4) you can only sync with one computer. Since I own 2 computers that I use regularly, this is a serious problem.  5) You can't transfer mp3's between computers through itunes, but you can transfer itunes purchases. The only reason I can come up with for this is to cripple Amazons music service for use on ipods.  6) no hardware sound control. This means you cannot adjust the volume in your pocket. Instead you have to take the player out, turn on the screen, go through the unlock screen, then slide the volume bar.    So while the product is innovative and useful, it was also literally defective by design. And crippling a product for marketing and monopolistic abuse of market share is totally unacceptable.  To add insult to injury, the included headphones did not work in one ear.

<Title>Solid Piece
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The screen is very responsive to the touch. I believe it is using a heat sensing technology vs palm devices which uses the stylus. One bad thing about it is you can't add more applications to it w/o having to do some non-approved work around.   It doesnt have some applications found in the iphone such as map. Neither less, still highly recommended.

<Title>The iPod Touch Soars Over the Skys
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> 	It's a plane, it's a bird, no... it's the iPod touch? The iPod Touch soars high over all other gadgets that have come out in Singapore in the past few years.  It is amazing how you can now view, listen and touch your music all at the same time. Along with that, you can even surf the web with the fastest internet browser available today, watch your favorite movies and videos with the stunning graphics on the 3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen screen (http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/specs.html) from iTunes or even from You-Tube like no other iPod before. Another great feature is the Wi-Fi music store, where you can buy as much music as you want on the go. You can do all this on the 8-millimeter thin iPod touch. Apple says it is the best iPod they have ever made other than it's big brother the iPhone (not available in Singapore yet) and with what I have seen, there is no doubt about that. By looking at the ratings that people have given the iPod Touch on Amazon.com, it looks like at least 90% of the people who own this product agree with me by giving a 4 or 5 star rating. My favorite feature is the Safari web browser. It looks exactly like the same browser you have on your Mac. You can zoom in and out with just two fingers. Surfing the web on the iPod Touch is first class.  You-Tube is great to have as one of your main applications. You can view nearly all videos at the touch of your fingers.  When you watch it on the large screen the iPod has, be prepared to be amazed. Viewing your music is better than any iPod before.  You can scroll through your music just like before, sorted by genre, song name, album, artist and so on. New in the music application is that if you turn your iPod to it's side, you are instantly able to view all your albums in cover flow, like on iTunes. If you hear a song you like and have your iPod handy, you can just easily tap the Wi-Fi music store and search for the song you want just like on the iTunes music store.  To buy the song all you have to do is log in to your iTunes account and click "buy song". The only downside I find to the iPod Touch is that you can surf the web, buy songs on the Wi-Fi music store, and view videos on You-Tube only if you are in a Wi-Fi area. For videos you don't have to worry so much because you can still watch them if you have downloaded them on to your iPod earlier. Just like the past iPods you can still view your great photographs, but this time, you can view them in landscape or vertical mode by just simply turning your iPod sideways.  I have now been using my iPod for over a month and there is nothing stopping me from saying that in my opinion, the iPod Touch is the best gadget ever made and sold in Singapore because of its sleek design and its truly amazing applications.

<Content>I usually buy technology before its time, but with the Ipod touch I'm happy to say it exceded my expectations. The screen looks amazing with pictures, video, album covers, the web, everything. I go to school at UCONN and I can pick up the wireless network all over our campus and surf the web to look things up for class or check my email. The touch interface works great and I rarely mess up typing on the keyboard. I just wish I had bought this after the 1.1.3 update came out so I wouldn't have to pay the 20$ for the upgrade (what is that about?).

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my 3rd Ipod purchase in the last 2 years and I was very happy with the Touch. The only thing that bothered me about it was that Apple came out with a software update 2 weeks after purchasing this item. They charged an additional $20 for the software upgrade which should have been free since I had just purchased the Touch. This offset any savings I made by getting it at a discount. The upgrade should have been free for anyone that purchased the item within a certain amount of time. The extra features are great and include a mapping program, email software, updated weather and stock information. Just beware that if you are purchasing this item that you will have to pay extra for the upgrades unless you get a newer version.

<Content>Reference: Look up Mad TV Iphone video on you-tube for a explanation to the "I-witch" joke. Anyways, just bought this item and its versatility/functionality defies logic. Slim, Sleek and incredibly easy to use, this new generation of Ipod seems like something that was developed by an alien race and accidentally left on our planet. Beyond the ultra clear screen shots and the silly easy menu setup is the mind blowing wifi capabilities. I enabled the wifi search function on the way home the other day and picked up over 140 hotspots in a  minute drive. A very sensitive receiver antenna combination. With all the additional functions this product is a massive step up for Ipod users.

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3Y1O/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5383481-1096753">Apple 8 GB iPod Touch</a>  Fellow human beings, we have officially now launched into a true space age like device!  Space age product is the category i give this of delectable piece of silicon!   I had just gotten a unit free with our local distributor here (actually a friend's unit really!) along with any MacBook purchase (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RG0RFA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5383481-1096753">Apple MacBook MB062LL/B 13.3" Notebook PC (2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, 8x SuperDrive) White</a> )   This new deal from www.jarirbookstore.com in Riyadh was one of the best promotions i have seen. Within 5 days this offer went out of stock!   Anyway, the device was definitely from the future. It really is "the" mini-computer and internet device that we all pictured of having like on Star Trek!  Most notable features: * The screen touch ability ...i cant really describe the experience u must try it to believe it (in consulting circles they use a term "experience based differentiation (EBD.)  They differentiated!   *Seamless connectivity to any WiFi (that includes the Access controlled version as well..one can find the MAC address under About within the iPhone menu)   *Apple lossless audio playback: now this was the feature that my ears were shocked by.  I listened to similar music on both Touch and classic iPod (apple lossless codec) and they have done something with the playback of this version! it sounds crisp and clear!   * iCal, contacts, YouTube feature are all some of my favorites as well. There is a different "feel" to having those funny videos on the fly and showing them to friends semi-intantly.    * Apps, Apps and more apps: this bit is for my friend (Waleed) who was a bit hesitant about the devices; he is a former PDA user of all other types of devices which come with a ton of 3rd party applications. Well this platform is new and is building good ground for a ton of apps:   http://www.apple.com/webapps/productivity/index1.html They have built several great productivity apps for this platform and i am sure it will eventually become mainstream development. There is no shortage on what can be made for this device!  * Last but not least: this is not a "dummied" down version of a very popular computer operating system. Folks considering this or the iPhone from the PDA perspective should appreciate that application class of this device are actually as close as u get from your standard desktop applications; example on the Safari web browser equipped on this device is in fact the same on an Windows or a Mac version of Safari.    Granted they are a bit off on the overall features but no one up to this point built a PDA application which runs like a desktop class application. (maybe they have and i am not aware of it!)    Final thought:  the iPod touch experience is seamless internet.... like what amazon.com is to online shopping!

<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, always thought the Apple devotion was more cult than substance.  Must reconsider.  With iTouch, Apple got the interface not just right but a took a big step past the competition.  Forget the excellent video and sound quality, it's simply an aesthetic pleasure to use it (and look at it).  With the 8 gig model, I have on board tons of podcasts, several audiobooks, perhaps 20 albums, and a half dozen full-length movies. Yah, with 16 gigs could double that but do I really need to: iTunes software makes it easy to load what I want for the next trip.  By the way, video's from DVD's have acceptable quality when output to TV -- not HD but certainly viewable.  (For video out, I rip DVD's to MPEG4 for the iTouch at 640 x 480, twice the pixel dimensions needed by the iTouch.  Unlike other, earlier video-capable iPods, if you want to deliver video to another device, do have the annoyance of having to pay big bucks to purchase the Apple connecting hardware because of proprietary design/embedded chip of the video/out feature on the iTouch.)

<Title>My Comprehensive Review on the iPod Touch
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After waiting 2 years to buy a touchscreen/fullscreen iPod (I had been reading rumors for a long time) I was finally given an iPod Touch as a gift a few days ago!  It is everything I wanted, and more.  Here's why:  COOL FACTOR:  The iPod Touch turns heads everywhere I go.  A lot of people haven't even heard of it or seen it, so when they see me using it, they're amazed.  I go to college and almost everybody has an iPod.  But not the iPod Touch.  FUNCTIONALITY:  The iPod Touch functions like a charm because the touchscreen is smooth and surprisingly accurate.  Unfortunately without a click wheel, you have to take it out of your pocket and look at the screen every time you want to use it, even if you want to change the volume.  That is my only gripe, but doesn't overshadow the other things about it.    INTERNET:  I use the Wifi to surf the internet more than I expected.  Although it drains the battery quickly, I find it useful if I'm on campus and I need to quickly use the internet to google something, IM a friend, or check my email.   Amazingly, the iPod Touch picks up wireless networks better than a computer.  In any single location, I can have dozens of networks listed.    QUALITY:  Fantastic quality.  The iPod touch is thin as a pencil, but heavy enough to feel substantial and worth $300.  The display is large, beautiful, and vibrant.  The chrome back does get scratched, but  this has happened with every ipod, so I recommend a full body shield (film for the front and back) to protect it, or a nice case.  If you've heard that the iPod Touch doesn't "sound" as good as other iPods, that's not true at all.  I found no difference in the sound, and I've been quite pleased with its audio performance.      Questions you'll deal with before making your purchase, and answers for you:  1.  "The iPod Touch is over $100 more than the other iPods."   True, but the other iPods (classic, nano, shuffle) don't use the latest and greatest technology.   It's well worth the extra $100 for the internet, touchscreen, highly-evolved calendar, etc.  2.  "But the iPod Touch only has 8 or 16gb!  Why pay so much for so little space?"  Yes, the Classic has 80 and 160gb of spinning harddrive space, but that doesn't compete with the flash memory in the iPod Touch.  Flash memory lasts longer because it's not affected by movement such as exercise, running, or dropping.  Why does it cost so much?  It's newer technology.  To give you an idea, 32gb is the most flash memory available, and would cost you about $1000.      3. "I need more space for all my music and/or movies."  You may feel like that's true. The iPod Touch is for someone who actively uses their iPod on a regular basis, managing it, taking care of it.  The iPod Classic with all its storage is for someone who dumps all their content onto their iPod and forgets about.  I've learned to manage what's on my iPod Touch so that I never have to worry that I don't have enough space.   That's all I have to say for now.  The iPod Touch comes with very high recommendations.  You, your loved ones, and friends will be ECSTATIC to get this for the Holidays!

<Title>Best value as an iPod I ever owned
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an amazing piece of technology. I will skip all the iPhone like features, such as multi-touch.  Pro:  - Best iPod user interface ever - Enjoy quite some useful and fun 3rd party apps if you jailbreak - Official 3rd party apps on the way - Works as iPod, and PDA: Calendar, Email, Notes, Internet via WiFi (if jailbreaked) - Light weight and slim compared to Nokia's N800/N810, easy to cary around - Running Mac OS X which is UNIX, although this is a stripped version - Screen is quite scratch proof - Possibly could do VOIP in the near future  Con: - Back of the iPod is easily scratched, it is an design flaw since the beginning of iPods - Battery life is OK but should have been better - Limited storage space due to high price of Flash memory - Have to jailbreak it to maximize funcionality - Apple intended to limit the funcion of iPod touch (compared to iPhone, it does not have a bunch of apps which could have been working without any problem)  Bottom line: This is the most useful iPod I ever owned. I wanted a PDA for a long time. All the other iPods I owned can be only used to listening to music, but this iPod can do so much more. It is well worth the money. To maximize its funcionality, you have to jailbreak it.

<Content>First the positives.  Fantastic screen.  Beautiful UI.  Now the negatives.  Although gorgeous, the UI is a pain in the butt as an everyday mp3 player.  It requires way too much attention to use.  With a regular ipod you just slide your thumb in circles to navigate.  Almost everything you want to do with the iPod touch forces you to look at the device.  Couldn't get the wifi working with my home network.  Never had a problem doing so with my computers, PDAs, or phones.  Alarm clock is useless, you can barely hear it.  Cool product, but for the price it ain't worth it.  Get a regular ipod.

<Title>Apple hater loves iPod touch
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm sure all of this has already been said, but I felt the need to cast my vote too. I love my iPod touch 8GB.  Let me explain that while this is not my first portable media player, it is my first iPod. By choice. I was raised on PCs and have hitherto always hated Apple, so I'm probably pretty different from most iPod reviewers in that respect.  The touch-screen interface is probably the most intuitive interface of any device I've used. Not only do I think wheels are stupid, I'm now starting to think buttons are obsolete. I'm exaggerating, of course, but this thing is a pleasure to use.  The audio quality is excellent and there are a great number of useful EQ presets. 8GB is pretty small for the price of this player. However, although I don't have every song I own on it, I do have every song I ever think about listening to (1365 of them) as well as a few podcasts, some photos, and a couple of TV shows. The screen is very large for a device that fits in your pocket, and it plays some beautiful video.  It isn't the perfect device. It's picky about video (but so is every other player). The wifi and the web browser are exciting features, but they are limited in ways you might or might not expect. The browser doesn't support Flash player (at least yet), so no internet radio. You can play mp3s from web pages in the browser, but can't store them for later use. Also, the wifi music store isn't a wireless-optimized iTunes store as I expected: there are no podcasts or TV shows on it, and it doesn't point out free content the way iTunes on your computer does.

<Title>iPod Revolution
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think is great to leave something clear: why cooperate with such a comercial product? Why giving it more power to take money away from people? if you notice this device slowly evolved with "generations" so you buy the new model each year, they could release the iPod color when cell phones already had color screens, but didn't... $   Same with all the other models, now why letting a company control what you hear? or how you hear it with their own music format and software that feeds their databases with stats they later on sell to companies, or companies that already paid them for you to receive their info without asking for it. Less is more friends.

<Title>Ipod Touch-8Gb vs 16Gb
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I concur with all reviewers who have rated this as an excellent and user friendly product. I just wish to address the issue of whether to purchase an 8gb or a 16gb unit. I bought the 8 gb Touch because it is $100 cheaper and otherwise identical to the 16 gb model. Here is my recommendation: If you plan to be away from your computer for, perhaps, a week or more, then you may want to consider the 16 gb model, as this model holds more stuff. If, on the other hand, you do not plan to be away for your computer for more than a very few days, why spring for the 16 gb unit at $100 more? After all, the stuff that you will be filling the Ipod Touch with lives on Itunes in your computer and can be added to or subtracted from anytime you have access to your computer. 8 Gb still holds a lot of stuff.  That's my two sense worth..  Dan

<Content>After reading comments and reviews for over a month, I finally ordered this. I was concerned about downloading the new updates, but it was very easy and well worth it! All of the applications are great. The calendar and notes sections are expecially useful to me as reminders for things I need to do as well upcoming events. The video quality is amazing as well as the sound.  I did debate between ordering this from apple or ordering from Amazon, but in the end, even with the update, Amazon was cheaper. I am very glad I ordered this!

<Title>IPod Touch Review
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>In a word really cool. I just love this device.  I use it to surf the web, listen to music, watch movies and videos and listen to my share of podcasts.     The multi-touch interface is very cool.  The only things I have against it is that my finger are just to big for that tiny on screen keyboard, but given the size there is not really much they can to there. Also I was a bit upset that I had to pay $19.95 for the google apps, but they were worth it.  One additional complaint is the lack of bluetooth and the difficulty in finding a set of bluetooth earphones that are small and lightweight for it.  I hate wires and in the cellphone world we have moved to bluetooth headsets, but in the mp3 world we seem to love wires. Anyway, the IPod touch has the coolness factor all over it.  It tempts me to replace my Blackberry with an IPhone.

<Title>The Gold Standard of iPods
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is probably a tad over-reviewed on Amazon, and if you were going to buy it, you would have bought it already by now. Still, if you can reach one person.... For starters, this was my first iPod, so the whole iPod experience was new to me. The 8GB is not a draw back for me. I can always have a cross section of my music collection on the unit, without any danger of using up too much memory. Not being a portable music fan, the biggest selling point for me was the wireless internet access. That is fantastic, and unless you live in the desert, or the North Pole, you're always going to find a wireless connection available, usually for free.  Most of the negatives have already been resolved by a simple $20- software update. You should purchase the update the minute your iPod Touch arrives in the mail. Here is a list of complaints people have had, and how Apple has addressed them:   1) Touch screen can be a bit frustrating: I have never noticed this as a problem, and besides, that's what the backspace key is for! 2) No email: That's been resolved with the software update. Just about every email provider, commercial or private works with the Touch now. It takes seconds to set up. 3) Too few applications: You get a bunch of new applications with the update, plus, many new applications are being made available every day.   I use the iPod Touch daily. It is my primary source for portable internet access and email, even though I have both on my cell phone as well. I have no problem carrying around a cell phone and the Touch. They both fit easliy in your pocket!  My only complaint will probably not be addressed until the next generation Touch, if then: no external speaker. I'm really not a headphones person, and it would be nice to have an external speaker, especially for that super Youtube feature!

<Title>iPod Touch - next generation of computers
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was facinated by the iPod touch when I first saw it at Comp USA. It is sleek and the internet (Wi-Fi) utility is just great. If you cannot find a song in iTunes... find it on You Tube. All in all its the harbinger of a whole new level of computing, one without mouse and keyboard.  The only thing which I would have liked with an iPod touch was an inbuilt speaker. And I guess thats just human, the more you get, the more you want for.

<Title>Great for what it has
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Ipod touch for about a month now and I am very satisfied. It is really cool in the fact that everything is done through your touch and is very enjoyable. PROS: 1. Music, Video, and Photo work great and are really cool. 2. Graphics are great. 3. Internet works great with the Wi-fi  CONS: 1. While everything it has works great, it doesn't have much more than that. The thing is there isn't much more. I would expect some accessories or stuff to do while I'm playing my music but without access to the internet there isn't much to do. There are no games to install. One could jailbreak the ipod but that's very risky.  2. While it does have link to itunes, but you can't download like podcasts or any free music onto your ipod. You to listen to music from other websites and there is no way to download.  3. It ain't cheap.   If you have the money and you would like a flashy iPod have fun!

<Title>Not Impressed
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok, now that I have your attention, I'm just kidding. Anyone who does not think this ipod is amazing, probably has not held one in their hands. I was skeptical when the product was first released, but, once I actually saw it in person, it was love at first sight. Since I already have a 30GB video, which isn't even maxed out, 8GB is plenty for a couple of movies and about 10+ albums, who can listen to more than that amount of muscic in one day anyway? (Oh, someone who travels cross country? well, don't buy it, but, don't complain about it either) Anyway, go to your local Apple store, Costco or Best Buy and see this thing for yourself and you'll come away amazed. If not, my bad.

<Title>The new era for iPod's!
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first heard about the new iPhones I couldn't believe how great it was that you can actually touch the screen and not worry about buttons. Then I realized that it was great technology...but it be so annoying if were in the middle of watching a movie or listening to a song and you get a phone call.  So then, I just decided to wait for something else from Apple, and boy...was I glad I did!  The brand new iPod Touch, the same technology from iPhone, minus a few things here and there. This is by far the greatest Mp3/Media player currently on the market right now. This product is just as amazing as I thought it would be, but if your really into watching videos I would recommend the 16GB one over the 8GB.   You can easily store about 6 movies on the 8GB version if you upload the movie files at 700MB, and will still have room for about 500 songs. I think that is plenty of room for most people, because lets face it why keep the same movie on there if you have already seen it? Technology will always come up with something new and fresh, doesn't mean you have to run off and spend money on it. If your really into music and movies, then I think the extra $100 bucks is worth getting the 16GB model. Overall, this is a gadget that won't get old for a long time because of watching videos in widescreen and listening to your tunes while surfing threw your collection, and best of all you can be on the internet!  It's fun...it's user friendly...and most importantly it's money well spent for what you get out of it. Enjoy!

<Title>AMAZING.
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this I-pod.  I got rid of my blackberry because of it.  There was no use for it, as living in NYC means you have endless wi-fi hotspots.  The internet on the touch is far superior to any cell phone internet I've used.   The first i-pod touch I received had a faulty battery, and wouldn't turn on.  I had to exchange it, (depressing since it was engraved) but luckily got one that worked.  But to the music......being able to download from itunes from the ipod is awesome! It makes me not mind paying for music! The only caveat is that you cannot download podcasts or videos straight to the ipod, which will probably change by the next incarnation. I love the sound on this ipod, combined with the bose sound dock or i-home especially.   The only thing that makes me nervous, is the large beautiful screen.  Should a scratch get on it, I would definitely be heartbroken.  The other problem I have with it, you cannot add anything to the calendar from the ipod itself, you must add it from the computer.   Despite that, I LOVE THIS IPOD.  If you can drop the big penny on it, do it. You will not regret it!

<Content>I am happy with the purchase of my ipod itouch. I currently own a nano, ipod classic, and a shuffle. I would reccommend that you buy the larger 16GB model if you are one to watch movies or tv shows. The 8 GB gets used up fairly quickly. Because I own the other ipod models I use those for music and the itouch for video. I am pleased and would recommend this for video watchers who are not going to put this to hard use as the device is really not for on-the-go usage that is "rough and tumble". Just being honest here...but again i am happy with the purchase.

<Title>Best mp3/media player with lots of extras
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would have to say this is my favorite and best mp3 player I have ever had. I never used to like apples ipods, was completely against them. My recently purchased sandisk sansa e280 8gb froze for the third time. Thats when I would try an ipod touch and I just loved it. My previous player before the sandisk was a dell pocket dj 5gb which lasted me 2.5 years. I also had many problems with it have to reset it all the time when it froze on me. Ipod touch is so easy to use, has a ton of very advanced features. Its so easy to find accesories and help with it. Although it costs more than my budget it is defenitely worth the extra cash. I only wish it had a few features like: fm radio/voice recorder,bluetooth (for wirless headphones), bult in speakers, a camera, being able to used it as a hard drive like the other ipods and not having to use itunes to synce all files and most of all more use of the wifi - like being able to download anything wirelessly from itunes and being able to sync the ipod wirelessly via wifi. On the bright side the ipod touch has many pros: touch screen, wifi web browsing, download songs from itunes via wifi, you tube, great sound, big 3.5 widescreen, good battery life, sleek and compact, being able to switch to horizontal and vertical view and ofcourse the apple brand name which makes ipod pretty much seemless to synce and use.

<Title>Ipod Touch, Best Ipod Yet
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod touch 8GB is a great product, though the space, even with a 16 GB is a little limited. Besides that the only other major flaw is lack of hardware volume control (though double clicking the home button brings up volume control). This iPod is superior to other iPods due to the added Internet functions, and the touch screen is far easier and more visual to use (less menus). All in all a great product if you have the money, it is especially cheap from amazon.   P.S. My only other complaint is that Apple decided to release an iPod touch update @ MacWorld with 5 new apps (which is great for new ipod buyers) which costs $20 for existing iPod users, but is free with new ipod thouches. This shows how Apple overcharges/ might make people pay in the future for all kinds of apps and updates that should be free.

<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my iPod touch right after christmas and it is one of the most amazing products I ever had. I have it with me all the time and either listen to music, watch a TV show or check my e-mail. So far, the Touch is working flawless. I did not have any problems or hick up. The wireless reception is very good and if you are lucky like me and your Town or City is providing free wireless service in most part of the City, you are good to go. For me, the 8GB version is big enough. I have about 1000 songs on it and a couple TV shows. Watching videos and TV shows on that crispy clear display is lot of fun. I just installed Apple's "January upgrade" which will install Mail, Weather, Notes and Stocks on the Touch (same as iPhone) for $20. Did I mention that I love my iPod Touch? How can somebody not want one? :-)

<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the touch as a replacement for my wife's MP3 which was stolen.  After playing with it for a couple of hours and get it loaded with her music I when out and bought me one.  I don't listen to a lot of music but this thing is WAY more then a MP3 player.  I love movies and own upwards 500 DVDs.  I found a software online that rips the DVD into the Ipod format.  I syncd it up to the Touch and have been watching movies on the go for the past two days.    The interface on this went playing music is awsome in how you can "flip" through album covers to find the music you want to listen to.   There are couple things that made me mark my rating down to 4 stars. --You have to pay $20 for the extra programs which really should have been free and on the system from the start.   --it would have been nice to add a FM transmitter to the unit to be able to play in the car without have to by a transmitter. --the unit "desktop" should be able to turn if the unit is on its side like the internet does over the music does.  Like I said small things.   if there was a way to do 4 3/4 starrs I would for this product.

I went out and bought a protective cover for it, a screen protector, and an FM transmitter for the car. Everything worked great and I told my wife it was one of the best gifts I've gotten. I love the whole setup.  Well the thing went blank (white) the next day to my dismay--2 hrs wasted downloading iTunes, picking out my songs, etc. plus now I have to go back and return it. Tried all the advice on the internet about the "White Screen Of Death" but no matter what I tried, it wouldn't turn off/work no matter what I did. Hmmm...if I wanted a faulty product, I'd buy something that was made by Microsoft. Well back to Best Buy to get a replacement!!!

<Content>Okay, so I can completely understand why the Touch isn't getting unanimous rave reviews. But read it from someone who's never wanted an iPod before that this particular product is something to be taken with; I can't keep my hands off of it and I've had it for a good deal more than 24 hours.  The touch screen, amazing clarity and WiFi are what made me give in to Apple, and I have to hand it to them. It's probably the most advanced product in my house. Just a few cons:  I wish it came with a speaker, like the iPhone. I have a younger sister who'd like to watch movies on it with me during roadtrips, so I had to go buy a portable hookup. (Check out the Altec Lansing Orbit speaker!)  Two, the "compatible only with iTunes" wasn't a bowl of fun to deal with when I first connected it to the computer. I spent two hours uninstalling and reinstalling programs when all I needed to do was unblock the Apple Mobile Service on my antivirus system. It's much easier to open up the USB drive with my Creative Zen player and drop and drag songs than sync the iPod to iTunes every time.  Logging into Hotmail tends to be a failed task for me. It's my main e-mail, and I've only been able to log on once. When I was playing with the testers at the Apple store, I wasn't able to log onto Hotmail, either.  But, the good? Love the cover flow, the photo section (excellent for vertical pics!), and video. And the fact that you can listen to music while you surf the web. The storage space is just fine for myself as well; I'd rather not carry my entire music and video collection with me when I go out. If you've never owned an iPod before, don't want the phone contract and are looking for something quality, go for the Touch. Especially if you're entitled to a present or have extra cash/gift cards from the holidays!

<Title>Apple 8 GB iPod touch 
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first got my iPod Touch, I thought, "Wow, this will be a fun thing to have". I opened the slick Black box and took out the iPod. It had a beautiful screen(which it actually glass)and had a great look to it. I couldn't wait to load up my songs. I put the USB into the iPod than my computer, loaded up iTunes and waited. "Cannot connect to your iPod. required software is needed". After 2 hours of the same old error, I took it back to get another one. Maybe this iPod was a dud. After I got my new one, same thing. I started all over. I deleted and cleared out everything that had to do with Apple. iTunes, Quicktime and the iPod driver, everything. I reinstalled everything I needed. I worked! Maybe I actually installed something that was "required". I put in my iPod and it found it. I started to load up my songs and it kept losing a connection. I had to close out iTunes because it wouldn't reconnect. I loaded iTunes and it did find it again but it sill lost a connection. After putting on 12 songs, lost connection. If it did keep finding my iPod I didn't care if it only loaded up 10 songs at a time. After 4 hours to load up 400 songs, and 2 hours to edit them I had my iPod all set. I loaded up my iPod and went into the song section. The sound was great. Very clear and loud. Listening to about 10 songs, I heard silence. Great another problem. The song wouldn't play. Then a few more didn't play and so on. Only half of the songs played. I went back into iTunes and reloaded the songs that didn't play. Same thing. I thought maybe I was the only person who was having this problem. Go to the Apple website and to the message board. About 40 people were having the same problems.  Now for the features of the iPod Touch. It has a calculator, Internet connection for web browsing, music, settings, video, and the time. Really. After all the commercials and ads of the stupid shadow dancers, I really expected a lot more features.  For the look of it, it's really is nice. It's about the size of a Razr and has the same weight. It's very bright and clear. Very slick looking.  For the feel of it. It's great. The screen is very sensitive and responsive. When selecting, it really never got confused and selected the wrong thing I touched. That's actually a good thing about it.  For the sound. It's excellent. Just as loud and clear as my old (working) iPod.  The accessories were pretty disappointing. USB, head phones, and a stand which no one ever uses. For the booklet. Nothing. I mean yes it does come with one but it's just a legal thing. No booklet of the iPod itself. It does have a "Get started" booklet but it's nothing you already don't know.  It was very easy to use and operate. If you've used an iPod before, it will take you literally about 5 minutes to remember where all the limited features are. If you've never used an iPod, you will have a tough time.  Some of you who are reading this will say It's me and not the iPod. My old iPod; my Brother and Father's are working just fine. 3 iPod Nano's. I would stick with that until they fix the bugs and for the price to go down. Don't even think about getting this for a while.

<Title>Grandpa's iPod
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player for music, but I also wanted to have photos of my granddaughter, audio books, podcasts (weather, science, NPR programming), video, and WiFi access ( I get stuck at banquets from time to time, wanted to be able to check sports scores, etc ). But, I did NOT want an iPhone - didn't want the cost associated with data plans, and didn't want a device used for relaxation and recreation to be interrupting me with phone calls... so, the iPod Touch fit the bill for me.  The screen is sharp and clear - photos and videos look fantastic on it. As to the sound quality, it sounds great to me - but I also have old ears, so my hearing is probably not the best test of audio quality.  The only thing keeping it from being five stars are:  a. no physical volume control - so, if iPod is in sleep mode, need to wake it up and use the on screen slider to adjust the volume.  b. at the moment, cannot install additional applications. That is supposed to change in February when the developer's kit is released.  All in all, I love it, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.

Music, Video, TV shows, Podcasts,etc. all on a super cool touch navigation. I havent seen anything like this before, Im simply amazed. I do suggest to download the app upgrade, for notes, weather, stocks, and mail......all cool features that add to the touch's already sweet features. I've transferrred my own DVD's and home videos on to the IPOD touch as well as transferring shows from my TIVO to the IPOD touch. The picture quality is simply awesome !! My friends are simply blown away! If you dont have one yet, what are you waiting for?

<Content>When I first bought this Touch, afterwards I looked at getting the Iphone, since the new upgrade for $19.99 it has made my choice alittle better, I still like the Iphone better, overall this a quality product but wish I would have gotten 16mg and I can't wait until they go higher like (80gig) because I could really load the Touch up, great for full length movies,music,photos and my favorite podcast. There are some great third party software so you don't have to got to Itunes for movies,songs etc. This is not just for kids I'am 61 years young and love it.

<Content>This is a great replacement for my PDA. It syncs beautifully with my iMac. All of my iCal calendar entries and address book contacts are there, and I can add, delete or edit them from the iPod touch and they sync on the computer. The fact that I can go online wherever there is wifi is fantastic! Apple just started selling a software upgrade that adds a mail program, notes, widgets (weather, stocks, maps, etc.) and more  for $19.99. It also makes the screen customizable! It's everything the iphone has except the phone! It's worth it for the e-mail program alone... SO much easier than trying to read web-mail on this size screen. (Oh, yeah... and it plays music and videos, too!) Not as much memory as my video ipod, but I just make a file of my favorite music and it syncs to my ipod touch. AND it was a great price on Amazon... I'm very happy with this purchase.

<Title>Simply Amazing.......
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first Ipod but my fourth mp3 player.  I have always been averse to trendy objects just because everyone else had one, and this is the way I had viewed the Classic Ipod.  But then came the Ipod Touch and my curiosity was piqued.  This device fills a gap and acts as a pseudo-PDA with wifi and web surfing ability, and is also able to do pictures and video.  Though admittedly, on the 8GB model, it is debatable whether video is really and truly an option, as 8GB (heck, even 16GB) is a dearth of space when taking into account there will also be a music library.  But as I am not into videos, that was never an issue to take into consideration for me.....but it might be for others.  The flash memory is also nice, as this can get jarred around for running and the like, unlike the classic version which is disk based.  I have been playing with it for just one day but so far I absolutely love it.  It is very intuitive, although one complaint so far is the fact that on one sync of my photos, for some reason it doubled the amount of photos on the device and made two folders.  On a Windows drag and drop model such as the Rio Carbon I have, I could simply go in and delete that specific folder.  But now, I must find a way to do this through itunes and the sync process.  As I am a new Ipod/Itunes user, this is admittedly a little bit of a pain.   The ability to wirelessly surf the web on the fly is what won me over with the Ipod Touch.  I may not use this capability often, but it is nice to know it is in my pocket, as opposed to having to carry around a laptop or the like.  I tried the wifi/Safari at the local Panera's and it worked like a charm.  One difficulty in using this is that when zooming in, as you must deftly use your fingers to zoom, without touching any links which will inevitably open.  On a page like CNN with many links everywhere, this can be challenging.  But like all things, there will be a learning curve to this.    Some minor complaints, though admittedly not with the device itself.  The charger is contained in a USB cord, so if you plan on taking this away for any length of time like a week-long getaway, you will either need to be near a computer to recharge or buy an adapter.  This really should be included.  And one thing which I would change is the lack of ANY documentation with the package whatsoever.  When I pay $300 for a device, I expect some type of documentation.  This does not even come with a disk; I shouldn't have to run out to ANY website before being able to use this.       But all in all, this is truly an amazing device.  A caveat however: do not get either the 8GB or the 16GB if you want to carry around a large music collection, or are into videos.  This will simply not be enough space.  And a note to the people who complain that the Touch should be 80GB instead of 8GB, they obviously do not understand the differentiation between players using flash memory for storage and those such as the Classic which use HDD for storage.  Flash memory is **much** more expensive than HDD storage per GB of storage, and thus putting 80GB of flash into this Ipod **at this point in time** (because flash memory costs are always decreasing) would put the price of this Ipod Touch around $1500.  At least!  Simply not an option.  And an FYI: I have read some reviews which claimed that actual battery life was well below what Apple claimed.  In my opinion, turning off the wifi should increase battery life as you will not have the wifi searching for a network all of the time.  Apple did an amazing job on the interface and it is clear in my opinion that this type of device will be the future of interactive graphical user interfaces, where the user will interact seamlessly with a virtual world.  This device is a revolutionary, not evolutionary step, forward.  A definite 5 stars.

<Title>Very pleased with this one
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player of any type. I've wanted one for quite a spell but with "old eyes" I had a lot of trouble reading the screens without my reading spec's on. The ITouch solved the problem. The screen is large, well lit and easy to see, yet the unit is  sleek and fits easily into a shirt pocket. I wanted the ipod for music and ebooks and this one has plenty of capacity for my needs. I find the menu's and control features easy to use and the battery life adequate for my needs. All in all I am happy with the Apple ITouch, 8gb, MP3 player. I gave the unit a 4 rating only because I felt that apple should have provided some sort of carrying case with the unit. UPDATE: Apple has come out with some additional features for the touch..only cost ya $20. None of them interest me, but when you press no thanks, the site doesnt recognize it and seems to feel you have made some sort of error. So everytime I plug my touch into the computer I have to read the ad again. Small thing, but annoying as hell.

<Title>One of the best yet
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'll be short and to the point...  Good Stuff:  Great device with a "next gen" user interface - amazing. Very good sound quality compared with a Cowon D2 (which is also a very good PMP).   Bad Stuff: Yet another propriety interface (aaargh!), Seems fragile - no doubt I will break it by doing something crazy like "dropping it".   When it says "Synch" it's really one way - the PC/Mac/iTunes is the ONLY way to delete content from it. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I listen to a ton of podcasts and other content and there is no way for me to keep track of what I don't like - even some kind of flag/rating thing I could deal with until the synch but this REALLY REALLY REALLY SUCKS!!!  Other than that it's awesome.  UPDATE: Now that I've used it for a few weeks, I'm still digging it except;  1. the delete thing - still bugs me - I can manually delete a video file but not a song - ridiculous.  2. Forced to use iTunes. The more I'm forced to use iTunes, the more I hate it with a passion - it's a big fat mess and NOT the way I want to manage my media at all. I use MediaMonkey and all the other ipods are supported but Apple decided to handcuff me to their crappy POS iTunes with this version.    3. There is a rating method to help with deleting songs but this is a crippled approach.    Hey, Steve Jobs - you've been hanging out with Bill Gates too much - just stop it - seriously - just stop....

<Content>This product has it all. Wifi web browsing, Youtube, Itunes built in, Music, Video etc. I must admit that it does indeed lack in terms of memory since it only holds 8GB of media. Nonetheless, I believe the innovative touch screen more than makes up for this flaw. If you are a buyer who requires significant memory to hold your thriving media library, I wouldn't recommend the itouch. However, if you own an average media library that you don't mind rationing and changing on the Itouch to songs and videos you will listen to/view at that time, those most current for you, then this is for you. There will be and have been a lot of products that try to mimic the interface of the itouch/iphone but none match the versatility and ease of this product. I mean, quite frankly, this piece is absolutely magnificent. It feels solid and no other mp3 player/video player has the ability to scroll through screens and menus w/ the flick of a finger. This is an awesome product and worth every penny if you can deal w/ the memory!

<Content>Everything about this device is great except for the price. I bought one only to realize how badly i was getting ripped off by Apple. Don't get me wrong, the iPod touch does everything I wanted it to do and more. A beautiful touch screen, gorgeous Cover Flow, WiFi internet access, and much more, but none of that justifies the inflated cost. It's basically a crippled iPhone. I recently read online that a company tore apart the iPod touch to assess how much the Touch should really cost. The results were a slap in the face. It costs Apple $147 to make one of these. I don't know about everyone else out there, but I don't like paying twice the price for anything, no matter how good it is. Feel free to check out the site-  [...]

<Title>Seducted by an iTouch. 
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Purchased an iPod nano 4 GB for the 2006 holidays. Throughout the year, it provided consistent functionality, without so much as a day off. Plugged it into my car audio system with a simple cassette/cable connection. No problems with syncing, downloading music and photos. This little green media pod was perfect. In September, 2007, the iTouch caught my 'i'. I looked at her sleek lines, read about her functions and capabilities and decided that she was the one for me. My wife asked "why?" I replied: "it's a guy thing". I scoped out ways of funding the vixen. I sold my iPod nano and a Samsung cellular for $112. I figured I'd receive the remaining $188. from Christmas cash gifts. Decided upon the 8GB model which I received from Amazon in two days. The look and especially the sleek feel of the iTouch are amazing. I plugged it into my computer for its initial sync. The iTunes software recognized the new machine, eradicating the last bit of reference to my beloved iPod nano. The 3.3GB sync took about 2 hours start to finish. The Touch's basic set-up and operation are fairly intuitive and all was well until I attempted a wifi connection. My home LAN is wired, but with the advise of a friend, I purchased a wireless router for my personal wifi access (don't get me started, puchasing equipment for a wireless LAN is a MAD story unto itself). I got the wifi working. I punched numbers and letters into the iTouch. I pushed the Safari, You Tube, and iTunes areas on the Touch. Her response: "cannot connect to ______, can't find server". In the interim, I purchased the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLG5ZY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5383481-1096753">Universal Apple iPod USB Charger Kit - USB Retractable Hotsync Cable - USB Home Travel Charger - USB 12V Cigarette Lighter Charger</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WOIFO2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5383481-1096753">DLO HipCase Leather Folio for iPod touch (Black)</a>). Both are very nice by the way. I began to have syncing problems with the iTouch to the point where I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. Initially, I had syncing and drive recognition problems with the new machine but I finally resolved same. The iTouch Information Manual provided as a PDF download from the iStore was ineffective in solving my wifi problems. The router's information on the net was very helpful and I now have access to Safari, You Tube, and iTunes which is really cool. In summary, the iPod nano 4GB cost about $200 ($175. for the set and $25. for a case) and a couple of setup hours. She operated flawlessly. The iTouch cost (so far) is $370: ($279. + 60. + 20. + 6.) and many hours learning about iSyncing and setting up a wireless LAN. Why? It's a guy thing.

<Title>My First iPod
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I haven't bought an iPod until now b/c I did not want to follow the party line and get what everyone has, but, I guess I couldn't resist the wifi browsing and the touch interface.    The bad: 1.  likes to use the battery  2.  Even though it is fairly easy to figure out how to operate the touch, it'd been nice if it had come with at least a CD with a manual on it.  3.  I used the link in itunes to download the cover art for the cds that i already have, but i can't get it to work.  So, while it looks cool that some of the album covers do show up for the tracks i got from i tunes, it doesn't show up for the rest of them.  If anyone knows how to do this, please comment.  4.  While the accelerometer is cool while viewing pictures or the web, I wish one could turn it off at times.  I like to listen to music as i go to bed, but i can't advance the song without opening my eyes to look at how the display is oriented.   Good: 1.  awesome sounding, regardless of what people say.  it's better than my sansa rhapsody.    2.  I love being able to use the web around the house.  It's easier than using my laptop, and with a 2 yr old, it keeps him from pushing the buttons.    3.  It has high enough encryption to check your bank account and things like that.  it also features tab browsing, but you have to figure it out, as said above, there is no manual other than a quick start guide.  4.  you can charge and use the iPod while it is plugged into the computer.  I couldn't do that with my sansa rhapsody.  all in all, i don't regret buying this.  I wish itunes had a subscription function like rhapsody, but we shall see if apple changes their minds.  I would advise everyone who gets one of these to purchase a better set of headphones, as well as a iPod protector as it will collect fingerprints.  7 Jan 08.  I figured out that I would also like to customize what the icons look like and to also add some applications (legally) as well.  I'm sure that this is already in talks but with this being my first iPod, i'm not sure.

<Content>The ipod touch is everything we wanted it to be, but it would have been nice to know that if you have the internet running while you are down loading your songs from a CD all of the title, song and artist will automatically showup.  It took us a little while to figure that out.

<Title>Difficult to navigate in internet
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am very pleased with the Ipod. It takes a while learning how to make the best out of it. The image size while navigating in internet is to small and makes it difficult to reach to some web sites. Other than that is a piece of art.

<Title>Unbelieveable!!!!!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this for our 25 year old daughter and we're incredibly impressed with it. Our daughter has loaded TONS of music into it as well as videos and still has TONS of room for more. The screen is a great size and crystal clear, and I think the coolest thing about the iPod Touch is the way you can flip through your albums with a swipe of your finger across the screen. We have wireless internet and she has had no problem at all with connecting, and the viewing of webpages is incredible! So many things about the iPod Touch are amazing, but I'd have to write a HUGE review to cover them all. If you can afford the price, buy one. You won't be disappointed!

<Title>cool internet tool with music and video
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great tool for using the internet while you're traveling. It lacks flash capabilities but that's not too bad. I have some minor issues with it though, 1. sometimes halfway during songs, it'll stop playing that song and go to the next song. 2. when you press the menu button twice to get the volume and music controls, sometime the next buttons don't work.  beyond the issues above I think this is an awesome device. It plays music, video, and it does internet. The display is pretty good in resisting scratches but the back side is still quite very prone to scratches.

<Title>The good, the bad and the ugly
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The good: beautiful media player with great touch screen, wifi connectivity, web browser, YouTube support, mail client and calendar and contact list.  The bad: just a beautiful media player with great touch screen, wifi connectivity, web browser without flash support and no download abilities, YouTube support and no support for any other similar service, mail client that can only be synchronized with outdated version of Outlook Express and also calendar and contact list with the same limited list of supported partners (oh, no Google calendar, but you can import your contacts from Yahoo... no, no Yahoo mail of course). Also some small features like no microphone (why somebody expect to have one? what? Skype?),  Google-map application is not supported, etc etc etc  The ugly: whatever you may think about it - it just a beautiful media player, locked, closed and hyper protected from any attempt to be anything  else Apple want it to be. Think different. May be in a year Apple proudly declare that new model of iTouch allows synchronization with Vista calendar or support of any other video service than YouTube or support for Google maps or flash player supported in the browser.  The problem I see here is that above media player part, Apple decided to sell us one feature at a time. Sometimes it means - access to one web site at a time. Had Microsoft done anything like that, the whole world would be screaming...  In short - if you want to buy something more than just media player - look elsewhere.  Update: 1/15/08 Looks like my worst predictions are realizing: who is first to pay $20 for Notepad, e-mail, Google Maps and other two missing app from touch, but available on iPhone? Brilliant. Artificial market.

<Title>Definitely good if this is what you want . . .
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>1. Wi-Fi connection, you've gotta accept that it's not like an iPhone that can do internet connection anywhere that has a signal.  But you know, Starbucks, Panera Bread, around your house, college, and so on.  2. Multi Touch, which is works really good and easy to use.  Easy to type  3. Chat via meebo.com  4. PDA-like, planner (calendar), calculator, contacts.  5. Small, thin, tiny, and comfortable enough to fit in your pocket.  6. YouTube which works pretty good and easy to use  7. iTunes music store which also good and easy to use again Overall, it works pretty good, don't know what to say.  Anyway, it should be better when Apple allow 3rd party program sometime between February and March.   The bad things - no built in Mail, Weather, Stocks - no speakers - access internet only thru wi-fi connection - no bluetooth

<Title>I LOVE MY iPOD TOUCH
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>this is the best thing i've ever gotten for christmas. But beware: If you are looking for an MP3 player where you can control without looking at it, you're better off with the iPod Classic. But if you are looking for an iPod that has wi-fi, online iTunes, Youtube, touch screen, 3.5 inch screen, and capable of holding 3rd party applications, look no further.
