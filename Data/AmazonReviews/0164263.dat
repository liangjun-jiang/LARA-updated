<Title>Read the fine PRINT
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change.  The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables.  They have inserted an "authentication chip" requirement into the firmware.    If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE.   After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.   If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units.

<Title>Decisions, decisions..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had my 3rd gen ipod for 4 years, holding out on a video ipod until for a larger screen.  I was torn when Apple released the full-screen flash memory based 'touch' with 16gig max (less than my old 20gig full with music files), and the small-screen hard-drive 'classic' with up to 160gig. Maybe the full-screen and hard-drive together would wear too much on a battery?   I decided I would be annoyed with 16gig, managing which files to load.  I have a Blackberry, and get enough internet, without being limited to wi-fi, plus all my work mail and calendar are tied to that. The bigger touch screen was not worth it for me, and I could not wait for another upgrade.   Because of an Amazon delivery est. 4-7 weeks out, I canceled my order for an 80gig, went to Apple instead(free shipping), and ordered the 160gig.  160gig does not seem extreme.  There is always something new to fill space.  Higher quality music and videos, backups, games etc..  Plus the apple-site shows the 160gig battery has about an extra 30% play-time than the 80gig (apple site Classic tech specs).   Had to pay sales tax, but got free engraving.  Used that to add 'return to' with my name and email on the device.  That gives the honest majority of our population the chance to get it back to me, and the less classy folks will need to scratch up or hide the back side.  **update** I now have it in hand and stick with my 4-star pre-review.   I got it loaded fine, including new videos I had in anticipation, and many photos from my pc -all of which barely made a dent in the space.  The options are very easy to manage in iTunes.  I like you can choose full-photo vs. ipod-veiwing-photo file sizes. Old news to many of you though. Of course I went full-sized, I have 160gig now, and this is a great way to back up those pics. Actually I have 148.79 available space.  Everything looks good and runs smoothly, so I'm not griping about the space the os/software used up.   I like the album art display on the menu and songs.  Things like that don't matter in the big picture to most people, but those types of touches make Apple products seem a little more friendly. I am jumping from a monochrome music-only ipod, so for me this is a major upgrade.   It does have the search option, but typing in a word by scrolling around a click wheel is not much faster than working through the menu. It also has a few games loaded, clock/alarm, a lock code setting, notes and calendar you can load from your pc/mac.  I like the stopwatch, which dispays an old analog version.  Using a stopwatch makes even boring activities seem more like an event. The only real rub with this is the 'TV-out' (video output)option is locked to 'off'.  I had seen a 50buck cable for sale from Apple so I knew I could do it(cnet claimed video-out had been removed), but I read on a rumor-site that you will now be forced to use the Apple licensed component-cable in order to enable the video out.  Fine, it comes with some other adapter stuff, so I'll do it, but their availability is 3-4 weeks.  I do love this device, and appreciate how far we've come since reel-to-reel and projectors, but not getting a hard-drive in the the 'touch', and not having the video cable (and many games) ready for launch takes a star off. *** Update 2 *** Well, I had it stolen already.  Hope the engraving somehow causes the perps some pain.  Smashed my car window at church and grabbed my bag.  I was dumbfounded.  I did an on-line police report and tried to get my serial number from the Apple registration.  Could find no way to veiw previous registrations, and the email confirming the registration didn't have it.  Without the ipod connected to iTunes there appears to be no way to see it there either.  I easily signed on to Garmin and got my gps s/n (they got that too), so I don't know why apple would make it so difficult.  My wife found it printed on the box.  Good old printed ink.  Writing it down may be a good idea.  Maybe this is gods way of telling me to get the touch?

<Title>Prefer Touchscreen
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I prefer the touchscreen, at least over the scrollwheel, simply because the scrollwheel is too imprecise, and it's hard to get to deeply nested items.  I've been happily using a 1 gig (yes, that's one gig) device for almost 2 years now, and have been anticipating moving up to an 8 gig device, so moving to a 16 gig device seems downight exciting.  16 gigs holds 192 CD's at 196 kbps, mp3. Does anyone realize this? I don't have that many CD's, and a lot I don't listen to anymore anyway, and even when you include some converted mixed-tapes and long podcasts, which I need to "recycle" anyway, 16 gigs is, quite frankly, great. I can't imagine having to manage 160 gigs of music, what with al the tagging and converting of files - sounds like a nightmare, and intrudes on the listening experience.  The touch is definitely a breakthrough.

<Title>IPOD 30G + Video Problem
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod for Christmas 2006, and lately it has been cutting out about 1/2 second, I estimate, randomly. I emailed Apple on their incredibly confusing website, saying let me know how to get this fixed under the one-year warranty. I actually did get a response, but: get this: they'll cover it under warranty, but the shipping and handling would be $31.65!!! I emailed them back complaining, saying it's too much, and that I'll just live with it and buy a Zune next time. I never got a response other than the usual offers to buy more Apple stuff, now that they have my email address!!! BE CAREFUL with this company!!

<Title>Don't buy a special offer from Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?

<Title>iPod  vs iTunes
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (Ai, atomic number 13). The "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recommend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.

<Title>I've got one!!! Size matters..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok guys, I just picked up my silver iPod classic 160gb from the Apple store on Regent Street in London so I can give an actual review on it.  I've had an 80GB video iPod for a year and it's already full, so I was really hoping Apple would make an iPod big enough for me. Presently I've got 110GB (and counting) of music, so this iPod is for people like me who have a large music collection, and who like to be able to take it anyplace.  The 160GB iPod is the same size as the 80gb, but costs less than the 80GB did when it first came out.  With a brushed aluminium front finish (similar to the 2 and 3G Nanos), it should be less prone to scratching, though the back is the same smudge magnet, and I don't know how resilient the screen is. The front is curvier than that of the last 2 video iPods, with the screen slightly depressed from the rest of the casing.  Additional features are extra long battery life (40 hours for music, 7 hours for video; I've tested this and playing music non stop without much fast forwarding, etc, it's about right), and cover flow (a fun way of scrolling through for music using album cover art, though it is a bit sluggish).   The new split-screen interface lists functions to the left half of the screen, and symbols (or previews of content such as cover art, videos or photos shown as a slide show) to the right as you scroll through the functions. Neat!!  During music playback, after being idle for about 80 seconds, the screen goes gray and displays a clock, and battery power. Viewing tracks in an album also gives you, at a glance, the track times. Same for video. A nice touch. To my hearing, the sound quality (without equalizers, mind you) is improved; more bass and a bit more treble. The iPod turns off in about 2 seconds, much faster than previous models.  It's still got the other regular features; album track lyrics (new, nicer text font, and it also shows the album art), can play video and games, store photos, contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and screen lock (which allows you to lock the screen with a password), and it can be used as an external hard drive. It shows up in windows explorer as an external drive. The search feature allowing one to type in album/song/artist titles (introduced in the last video iPod) is still there, but relocated to the "music" menu. I didn't spot it at first. In fact, the menu has been reshuffled to make it better, and (under settings) one can now view number of songs, videos, photos, etc graphically just like in iTunes.  If you need loads of space for your music collection, you can't go wrong getting this. Judging from the crowds in the store, Apple's got another hit here. Now if only the iPod touch had this much memory...

<Title>Finally, more than 80GB!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB.  Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did.  Hope it sounds better, too.  After all, that's what it's for.  I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical).  Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch.

<Title>Absolutely stunning (I own this product)
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8782139-7500665">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.

<Title>It's great but ...
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Pros: I had the first generation IPOD Nano 4GB before I bought this one. My music collection has grown so large that I need an mp3 player with a bigger storage capacity, which this IPOD delivers. I can now play all my music video on this IPOD too, and the video quality is great (provided that you start with a good quality music video in the first place). I also like the new IPOD surface too since now I don't see my fingerprints all over the place.  The Cons: The downside to this IPOD is it often freezes on me. I don't mean once or twice, but almost every time I connect it to my laptop. So it becomes an annoyance to me. Sure I can unfreeze it but why do I have to do this often? I've never had this problem with my old Nano and it seems like this problem is faced by newer generations IPOD (I have a friend who just bought the new Nano and it freezes on her several times already).

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you.

<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is iPod #2 for me.  I'm one of those people who likes to have *way* too much music at hand at all times.  I filled up my 60Gig iPod, so I gave it to my wife, who has about 3 CDs she likes, and moved up to this thing.  I use the video function very rarely, but it *is* nice to take a movie along for long layovers in the airport or to have instead of renting a movie in a hotel.  I mainly listen to the iPod when I walk to work, or in the gym.  I hate going to the gym, so an audiobook on iPod makes that experience much better.  I'm very pleased with this iPod.  I use Sony ELP828 earbuds rather than the ones that came with it because a)I don't want advertise to the world that I've got an iPod, and b)They're really good and not terribly expensive (I have a cat that thinks they're food).  Be sure to buy a good case with a belt clip.

<Title>Lots of Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I will go straight to the details as to why this unit sucks:  The software called iTunes will frequently duplicate songs and waste space.  The unit itself is prone to not being recognized by Windows XP, so there is frequently no sync available, so....when sync is not available, you cannot upload new songs into your ipod.  When plugging in your ipod, iTunes will tell you that the ipod needs to either re-enter all the songs, or reformat the whole ipod.  When you "restore" your ipod (according to the will of iTunes), nothing happens afterwards except an ipod with no songs in it....and trying to put the songs back into the ipod...i'm still trying. Help!  Getting help (help!) from iTunes is impossible, but I'm still trying.  Managing more than one ipod's music in your pc is problematic and prone to glitches. I heard it's easy to manage multiple ipods if you have a Mac.  If you are still thinking of getting an mp3 player, the most trouble-free is the Creative Zen Microphoto (8gb), and the Sandisk Sansa Clip (2gb) that holds 1000 songs.    If you do decide on getting an ipod, make sure you save the music on cd's (burn them to cd).

<Title>What went wrong???
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a 40GB iPod Classic.  It's a breeze to use, an excellent product, and I love it.  It's full, so I wanted to upgrade to the 160GB.  What a disaster!  Apple was in a hurry to get this one out.  It shipped with a bad software version, so the first thing you're stuck with is updating the software, but there's a glitch:  You can't download the new software without jumping through a bunch of hoops to disable firewalls and other stuff on your computer.  That required a lengthy tech call.  After downloading the software, I tried to sync it up.  It would load a few MB and then freeze.  Several more tech calls and hours of wasted time (including reimporting my library and reformatting the iPod)and it still kept freezing.  Bottom line:  This piece of junk doesn't work with its own software and is nothing but a headache.  Apple should be ashamed.  They had a corner on the market and a reputation for excellence, and they blew it.  Keep your money until they remove their heads from their posteriors.

<Content>I have the previous generation 80GB Ipod, and needed/wanted the extra space.  To me the only reason to buy the new 160GB was for the extra space.  I love the functions of my 80 GB.  I'm music centric and don't care about the video or game functions. All I was expecting was the same device, albeit with more storage capacity.  The cover flow is superflous to me: nice but unneccesary.  This device is virtually the same size as my 80, but feels smaller and a bit heavier in the hand. So far I like it.  Too early to say I love it in the way that I love my 80.  The five stars are for IPOD itself.

<Title>CONSUMER ALERT
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item last week to upgrade my ipod 80gb (great item!!!). I found the sound on the classic VASTLY INFERIOR to the old ipod.  I thought it might have been my imagination but after cruising some websites, I discovered that APPLE is using another chip that deteriorates the sound in  significant way.  I found the sound of the Classic to be thin and shrill compared to the older one and not nearly as warm and "clean." (I mostly listen to Jazz and classical) Again, I thought this might be my imagination but apparently other purchasers have had a similar experience. I'll be returning mine.

<Title>Excellent sound quality, and the 160GB are a treat
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the previous 60GB video iPod, and the additional 100GB comes very handy as I only use Apple lossless compression. What I did not expect is the much better sound quality on the new iPod. I did A-B comparison and the classic's sound quality is first rate and much more musical. I guess the DAC must have been improved. For info, I use the excellent Shure ES500 headphone. Most of my music is apple lossless compression. I never use MP3, as it throws away too much information, even at the highest setting (320kbps).  The interface is very intuitive, as usual, and fast. The screen is much brighter. The search option is very handy to locate album or song. A big plus too.

<Title>  Re: Ipod classic TV out problem 
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple has intentionally disabled the Video Out button on the Classic models.  Spend more, get less features.  I am shocked to hear that Apple will treat so poorly those who shell out $349 for a 160 GB Classic. I contacted the Geek Squad none of the salespeople or support team had a clue that Apple had disabled the video out feature. They pushed every available button before contacting Apple to find out that Apple has disabled a basic feature available on all prior video Ipods. I had stopped at Circuit City first and had the same experience there.  I would not have bought this so quickly had I known that Apple disabled the video out capability. The video settings menu is still there, but all the clicking in the world will not change OFF to Ask or On. Apple will soon be selling a $49 accessory to allow some limited output of video. I already own the Icuiti IWear. Memorex and Virtual Reality Ipod video accessories, all now rendered useless by this greedy move on Apple's part. We all expect value-added from Apple, not elimination of a basic feature. Shame on you, Apple and Steve Jobs.

<Title>Cheapskates
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What happened to the slip case?  For this kind of money, and with all ongoing fuss about scratches to the screen etc., it's unbelievably inconsiderate (not to mention cheap) of Apple not to give you a very basic case to help protect it from wear and tear.

<Title>You must be up to date to play this!
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I tried plugging this to a Mac with system 10.4.6 and unlike all previous versions of iPods, this requires you to have the latest system and the latest itunes version.  So if you have panther, cougar or anything below 10.4.7 and an old version of itunes (because you dont like the new one) you are out of luck.

<Title>Great size and hard drive capacity
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is pretty much the best iPod based on it's value. I did notice that they didn't include the soft slip case this time, like they did with the 5th generation iPods. They also took out the video out feature, which I think was a bad move on them. I do like the new interface though, they also added the cover flow feature. They include a nice shiny metal case when you get the iPod. I did end up buying a case for mine. I didn't mind buying one since I didn't pay for my iPod. And BTW for those wondering how I got my iPod classic go here: flingk.com/n21v9v1  I was amazed how thin the iPod Classic is considering how much space it holds. I do think it is better than the other iPods based on how much you end up paying.

<Title>don't buy the 6th gen ipods...read why
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple is pulling a clasiic Microsoft tactic here by making the 6th gen ipods NOT backward compatible for no apparent reason other than to force you to pay more to upgrade your OS and docking stations / cables.  Plus, the 5.5 gen is faster, and better assembled.  From what I am reading here, alot of others are saying the same thing.  Don't buy this item.  Buy a 5.5 gen instead.
