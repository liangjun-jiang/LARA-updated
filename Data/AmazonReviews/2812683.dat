<Title>Better than the Sansa Rhapsody, but still some flaws...
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To the best of my knowledge, there are only two mp3 players on the market that actually advertise to be compatible with Rhapsody.  Those two players are the Sansa Rhapsody and the iriver clix Rhapsody.  Since I have a Rhapsody account, these players attracted my attention.  I started out with the Sansa and after a year, I was disappointed with random shut downs, the player locking up, and in the end, the player not even turning on.  So my next natural progression was the clix Rhapsody from iriver.  After reading many reviews, I finally bit the bullet, and purchased the clix.  The price is obviously much higher then the 4GB Sansa, but hey you get a pretty sweet player.  Here are the pros: -Player style is a huge plus, easy to navigate with the "screen buttons" -The screen is amazing.  Still kind of small, but still good enough to play some music videos -Volume is insane at 20 and it reaches 40! -Adjustable EQ is much better than Sansa's -Flash games are fun for those boring times, but they cut the battery -Player boot up is about 10x faster than the Sansa's  Here are the cons: -The battery definitely doesn't last for 24 hours of continuous playback.  The most I've gotten was 8-9 hours. -When using Rhapsody to update player, it seriously takes 10 minutes to load my player's music.  This could be a rhapsody software problem, but it's really annoying. -There are random "skips" in audio playback like it's playing from a CD.  There is no pattern to the annoyances, they just happen. -Audio playback stops when you start playing flash games.  Due to the cons, which can be very nerve racking, I gave this player a 4 out of 5 rating.  I would have liked to give this player a 5, but the "skips" really tick me off when I'm trying to rock out...

<Title>Perfect size for a front pocket!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, let me just admit that I'm an MP3 player addict and I usually get the big hard drive ones.  So for comparison purposes, I've put this up against an iPod Touch, an iPod Video 5.5, and my Archos 605.  The main thing that drove me to buy a Clix was the glowing CNet review and numerous comments about the superb audio quality of the iRiver players and the Clix in particular.  After a lot of fiddling with audio settings, I finally see why the clix 2 gets such rave reviews for audio quality.  However, straight out of the box it doesn't sound very good at all, you will need to spend some quality time with your clix to get good sound.  As is my wont, I like to list out the things I love followed by the things I don't love so much:  1) This thing is real nice to look at, its sleek and thin, clean design. 2) Perfectly sized for a pants pocket, which is a first for me! 3) Beautiful screen for the price. 4) Innovative D-Click interface with lots of dedicated buttons for volume, power, hold and even a special programmable button. 5) Easy to operate blind with only a little bit of practice so you don't necessarily have to take it out and look at it to see what you're doing. 6) Very customizable in so many ways. 7) After setting to MTP mode I was immediately able to download my music and playlists, as well as album art and song ratings using Media Monkey; this was as easy as the iTunes/iPod setup which is a minor miracle.  I'm very impressed, given the problems I've had doing same with my Archos 605. 8) Built in mini-USB port, might sound like a minor thing but none of my other players has it. 9) Special button: one button can be assigned to a special function which is nice (I set mine to do Play/Pause). 10) Lots of other features which I don't use and other reviewers have described in detail. 11) Flash theming: you can download all sorts of flash background themes and fonts and really customize the look of the player.  12) If you are patient, you can really get some great sound out of this thing by fiddling with the Wow and SRS and other EQ settings.  Things that I'm not loving so much: 1) Fits so well in my jeans pocket, but every time I bend over it starts fast forwarding.  I have to put it on hold every time I put it in my pocket.  Basically, the down side of the D-Click interface is that it is easily activated by random bumps and jostles so I pretty much have to put it on hold all the time.  I also find this can be hard on battery life as my case will keep the screen alive when fully closed. This has become a real problem to me, unfortunately my noreve case isn't helping matters at all. 2) After the joys of touch screen interfaces, I find it a little tedious to not have any sort of sliding/touchy interface for doing things like scrolling through long lists of songs. 3) Hard to find accessories: welcome to life outside the Apple happy place, I have yet to find a store that actually will sell me an accessory for the Clix.  Looks like I will be ordering everything online!  So for now I have to carry it in my pocket whether I like it or not; fortunately that works pretty well! 4) Battery life is a bit disappointing, I end up putting it on the charger whenever I'm not using it! 5) Although the screen is beautiful, its very hard to read in full sunlight.. unlike my iPods. 6) I can't get this thing to work with Rhapsody ToGo to save my life, in spite of going around with Real and iRiver tech support it still doesn't work for me; I have heard it works for others though.   7) Tech support, where is it?  I put in a ticket and never got any response at all so it appears to be non-existent.  Makes Archos tech support look stellar by comparison!  So, in summary, this is the best pocket player I've ever found, the sound is crisp and clean, the interface is innovative and fun.  I think its a great little MP3 player for the price but I don't think it holds up to the higher priced iPod Touch overall... not surprising since it is a hundred dollars cheaper!  Update after 1 month of ownership:  well I have to say this little player has really grown on me.  After fiddling with settings I now find that the sound is as good as advertised (still lacking some power though!), it is addictive, all my other players don't seem quite as crisp and clear anymore.  I've updated my pros and cons accordingly.  Normally this would be good enough reason to bump the rating to 5 stars, however I've discovered a few more things I'm not so happy with so I'm leaving it at 4.  Hoping the next version (Clix+ ??) will resolve some of these problems!

<Title>Fabulous MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I must say, the Clix Rhapsody is awesome!  I did tons of research before buying this player.  My husband has a Creative Zen 30GB player and it is too big, and I find it difficult to operate when I use it every blue moon.  I wanted something small for when I run, and wanted the flash games so my kids could use it on the airplane.  The iriver Clix is so easy to operate, and the sound is awesome.    In addition, if you are wondering, I believe this is 2nd generation player.  I couldn't find it mentioned in Amazon's detail except for "(1clix4b)" written in the description.  I had assumed this was a 1st generation with that description, but after visiting the iriver website I think the 1st generation was much thicker.  This confusion almost prevented me from buying the player, but I am so glad I did.  Hope this helps!

<Title>Good at first, then back to Amazon it went
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did extensive research to decide between this and the Sandisk e260R.  I knew that I wanted a player that could take full advantage of Rhapsody channels, and at the time, these were the only two available.  After comparing features, I went with the iRiver Clix2 (as seen on this page).  At first, it seemed fine.  It is lighter than you might imagine, and quite small.  Worked alright with my FM tuner (also iRiver branded).  However, the battery life wasn't even close to what is advertised.  They say it can get about 20-24 hours, and mine lasted barely 6.  Perhaps it was because, using the channels, I was skipping songs often, which meant lighting up the screen, which drained battery life.  But still, that's one of the main features it was made for.  I tried it for two weeks, and all told got maybe 8 hours from a full charge, playing only music at moderate volume.  Second, and the final nail in the coffin.  The batteries died on it while I was trying out the e260R (which I'm very pleased with).  I had to recharge from scratch (3.5 hours), and found that all of my music had vanished from the player!  This is a serious problem.  Flash drives shouldn't wipe clean like that just from running out of batteries!  So, back it goes.  A shame, lovely screen.  I still give it 2 stars for the potential to be a great player.  Perhaps mine was buggy, but I'm not willing to give it another chance with a new one.  If it worked correctly, I'd give it 4 stars.  Good: -Screen (it is quite nice) -Very customizable (skins, wall paper, etc...) -Size  Bad: -No accessories for it.  I had to use a generic camera case to keep it safe, and screen protectors cut down from a bit one meant for a PDA. -Battery life (6-8 hours!) -Buggy OS (I'm guessing) -Very difficult to use one-handed (if you are driving, for instance).  I'm sticking with the Sandisk e260R.  NOTE : Amazon was excellent throughout this, and offered a full refund as well as paid for the shipping back since the product is faulty.  I will absolutely buy from Amazon again, just not this product.

<Title>Great design but firmware doesn't meet expectations
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The latest firmware isn't working well with Rhapsody V.4.0.  The issues all relate to Rhapsody's Digital Rights Management (DRM). The Rhapsody player updates the subscription tracks but the player doesn't recognize the update. There is no good fix for the issue. This has been a big dissapontment.

<Title>Keeps me happy
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Player that has it all.  This player does more that most any other.  MP3, WMA music files I can drag and drop AND use Windows Media player AND use Rhapsody for subscription music (Napster subscription service works too, but doesn't have Rhapsody's awesome channels, which are like having a personal DJ)  Just about any other music service out there will work, and you can still rip and copy your own files.    But wait, I'm just getting started.  This thing plays videos on it's beautiful QVGA screen.  If you think you can't stand a tiny screen, you haven't seen the Clix's OLED display.  It's crisp, bright and easy on the eyes.  Some of these small screens show pixels and ghost images, not so with the Clix2.  I can watch for hours and not mind at all.    Okay, I'm not even close to done yet.  We also have Audible capabilities.  Audible is a great audiobook service that gets all the latest audiobooks and makes them available for download, these transfer over to the Clix2 in a snap and provide hours and hours of enjoyment for everyone who likes books but has trouble finding the time to read.    Want more?  Sure!  The built in FM radio is easy to use and picks up more stations than any of my portable players, it has something like 20 presets and will set them all in no time.    What's the catch? you must be thinking.  Don't ask me, I'm still looking for one.  Good volume output with buds or full size headphones, great equalizer presets, a manual EQ and SRS WOW magic stuff that makes headphones and speakers sound like they cost a bundle of cash.    Oh, wait!  You want more?  Really?  OK, Clix delivers.  You can look at pictures, browse through or see an automatic slide show (while listening to your tunes, of course)  and if you got some time to kill, it comes with 4 great flash games you can play.  If you look around you can find more on the web.  So, I must say that I'm really pleased with the HUGE array of features, the sound quality and overall operation of this player.  It has NO equals in it's category.

<Content>2nd gen clix. best player i have used (ipod video, nano, zen v plus, zen micro, sandisk sansa). themes are customizable/downloadable. plays flash games. great user interface although it takes sometime to get used to. such a great player. plays video, pics, music sq is very good, display is great. hard to find accessories, but the player is so small any aftermarket case should be fine. this player is better than the ipod nano, creative zen vplus( which i also own. My opinion, best flash mp3 player on the market.

<Title>Another great iRiver product
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this to upgrade from the iRiver u10 and to supplement my Creative Labs Vision M player.  I use the flash player when on the move and don't want to risk accidentally having my files deleted on the HD player.  Stuck with iRIver because of all the options the u10 offered.  Great sound, easy navigation, FM tuner, pictures/video.  Lots of improvement from the u10: Navigation is much better.  Quicker startup and navigation.  Option to rotate the screen four different ways (compared to two on the u10) for personal preference is a +. Much more information can be seen during playback (album art, track details, next track, time) adds to the eyecandy factor... so much so that I spent a few hours hunting down album art for the songs :)  One major gripe I have is with the pictures.  Pictures are not shown full screen all the time (as it was on the u10).  If the u20 is in landscape mode, it will show the landscape pics full screen.  It will however decrease the size of the portrait pics leaving black bands on both sides.  it doesn't automatically rotate the pic for full screen viewing. I tried puting the display orientation on portrait hoping it would remedy this problem, but to no avail.  The landscape pics are shown full screen, but not the portrait.     Tried both MTP and MCP and prefer the MCP (iRiver plus).  On MTP, you can basically connect to any computer with Windows Media 11 and transfer files.  This is perfect for the individual who connects to various PCs.  I, on the otherhand, mainly use one PC with the occasional other on the same network so don't really care for compatibility with other PCs.  I found transfering files (especially pics/videos) much easier with iRiver plus.  The videos are autimatically converted using this program for optimal play on the U20.  Also preferred the iRiver software to update information on the song tags (title,album art, artist, etc) to keeps things neat.  Battery is great! Lasted long for me.  There's been a few times that I wanted to drain the battery before connecting it back to the PC to transfer more files, etc so I didn't ruin the battery life--- and took quite long!  Lasted more than 3 hrs on FM tuner and song playback with picture slideshow (didn't have video on yet).  Sound is great!  I didn't even bother using the stock headphones as I have Shure e4c and a Sony pair with noise cancelling properties.    FM is great!  It is strong and comes in clearly.  Make sure the headphones are connected when using automatic presets as it is used as antennas! Took me a few days to figure it out when the scanning was only picking up one station.  Great player and look forward to using this most of the time.

<Title>Excellent MP3
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was slimmer than I thought it would be and the control interface was interesting and worked for me. I like that you click the 4 sides of the display to navigate the menus. The clarity of the screen was very good and videos were clear to view, but just not to watch movies on. The sound was the main thing that hooked me. It is louder that the iPod and I have the original 1st Gen 20GB iPod.  A++++

<Title>Be careful not to drop it.
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had the Iriver Clix for several weeks and loved it. All that music!  But today I dropped it on a wooden floor. And that was the end of my $189 Clix. The screen went black, except for a few thin white lines. Now those are gone.   Conclusion: nice device but too fragile considering the cost; will try the Sandisk next. At least that's only $89-99.

<Title>Iriver  makes great products for a competitive price
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my third Iriver player and they are all still working like new. My first was a 128 MB unit that was about the size and shape of 1/2 a cigar. You could wear it around your neck or on your arm. Next I bought a 20 MB hard drive based unit that holds about 5500 titles and uses just over 9 MB. I record usin WMA at the 64k setting. The I just couldn't resist the features of the Clix! It has it all. The older units had FM and voice recording plus record from FM. But this has all of that plus great pictures, videos, and even games. The color and screen are magnificent. And the ergonomics work for me. What a great idea it was to make the 4 edges of the screen navigation buttons. It has been said the volume buttons are not intuitive but depending on the screen orientation they may or may not seem right to you. So whta more would I like? Two things come to mind. First I wish there was a shuffle mode for viewing pictures. If there is I haven't found it. Second, I wish there was a way to jump directly from "A" to "B" to "C" and so forth when scolling through song titles. The scrolling is fast but should't there be a way to perhaps double click to the next alphbet lett of tune names? Still I rate it 5 stars because, I love it!
