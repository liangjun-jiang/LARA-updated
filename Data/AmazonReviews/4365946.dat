<Content>I love my Sansa! Mp3's, videos, pictures, FM tuner and I can record! Excellent. It's also so incredibly simple to use and the battery lasts forever. The expansion card slot is a major plus and of course so is the USB charging cord. If I run it down completely it takes 3 hours to charge fully.  I'd recommend it over iPod any day.

<Title>Great value, great performance

<Content>I've never had a problem at all with this model of the player.  We have three in my family and every person is ALWAYS using theirs.  Reliability is a great feature for a player in this price range.  There are some great features with the Sansa e260 -- on this model long before iPod finally decided to roll out to the Nano a few weeks ago.  It's a shame that Apple didn't realize the capability of a 4GB player, with long[er] lasting battery, video, FM tuner, voice record features, etc.  The charge time is really great and, as the other reviewer said, the batteries seem to last a LONG, LONG time.  I've converted several videos for use on this player and have synced countless podcasts and music files with absolutly no worries.
