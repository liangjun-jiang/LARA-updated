<Title>Good--but very limited
<Date>Mon Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this MP3 player as a Christmas gift, and at first, it seemed to work great.  The directions for transferring files to the player were unnecessarily complicated and confusing, but once I figured out how to load files, it was very easy and fast.  The MP3 function is very easy to use and the sound quality is fine, but the radio function is horrible.  The reception is lousy, the radio changes stations for no reason, and the player often randomly shuts down and changes the presets.<p>However, I ran into a problem when I tried to load the WMA files I had purchased from Napster and BuyMusic.com.  The files wouldn't play even though the player was supposed to read WMA files.  After trying countless fixes, I gave up and called customer service, who informed me that Memorex products do not read any legally downloaded music files.  I was advised to either download the files illegally or stick to files from my CDs.  Since the entire reason I wanted an MP3 player was to play songs I don't have on CDs and I would rather not be sued, I returned it.  <p>If you just want to listen to music tracks from CDs, it works great.  However, if you want to buy any songs over the internet, don't buy this MP3 player!

<Title>extremely convenient little player
<Date>Sat Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Never had an mp3 player before I got this one for christmas, but as far as I'm concerned this thing is GREAT--how people on this site cannot get it to work I dont know...it works fine with windows 98 even though it doesnt say so on the packaging. At first I was kind of bummed that it was so small, figuring it would have been better to not have such a small player, and get more memory on it....but as it turns out, I'm really enjoying this tiny, incredibly lightweight player, and 40 songs is plenty enough for me--> way better than my bulky old cd player w/ 22 songs.  Pretty much this thing rocks--easy to set up, easy to operate (control stick is ingenious), good capacity, great battery life, everything you could need in an mp3 player--and expandable too! definitely a good buy

<Title>Pretty nifty package
<Date>Sat Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first dive into the world of MP3 players and I had done research on a handful of products to know what features I wanted in one (i.e. a lock feature, random play, eq, decent backlighting, song title/artist display, etc).  This one had all the features I wanted.<p>First, this bad boy is so, so lightweight.  It is basically weightless even with battery.  That's a boon because I am using it for long runs.<p>Secondly, it was easy to upgrade and fairly easy to download mp3's to the device.  My only complaint is it did not work hand in hand with the RealOne player and you have to sorta of trick RealOne to function together.  A simple driver could have fixed this.<p>Everything seems solid enough construction except at the USB port where it is quite fragile.  My first plug in nearly broke the thing.  Now ever cautious, I'm not having problems, but it could be real heartbreak for $100.<p>Finally, the best part.  The sound.  This little sucker is loud.  Deafening loud if you want it to be and many MP3 players out there are quite tame in this catagory.  It's limited EQ functions are actually plenty for my plebian musical tastes and these were the first earbuds that haven't sounded like utter garbage when using them.<p>All in all, I am quite pleased with this device.

<Title>'Repeating Reboot'
<Date>Sun Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So this 'rare' problem seems to be popping up yet again!  I was attracted to the price, 128 memory, and FM tuner of this little number.   I thought this was the coolest thing!  Sound was terrific and very easy to operate.  No problem at all loading the software with XP.  I was in love with this little device and literally used it 2 times while running 45 minutes each time.  This unit now reboots itself and will not turn on no matter how many times i go through the troubleshooting part of the manual and reset the unit.  So...for 100 bucks, I got 1.5 hours out of this piece of crap.  Also - something wacky is happening with my iPAQ now too...outlook seems to store 'recordings' in the notes folder and then my iPAQ freezes up while synching.  Coincidence?  I think not!

<Title>good for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found this little gem at Target for $99.  So far everything has been great.  Very easy to load songs with XP because it just becomes a removable drive.  I can use it with songs from my cds, legally and illegally downloaded songs also work great.  My only complaint is that the earbuds tend to fall out of my ears very easily.  The sound is very clear and I love that it shows the song title and artist on the display.  I had my heart set on an ipod, but the pocketbook didn't agree.  The cheapest is $299!  So for $99 I got this and it works great, I also love that you can upgrade with additional SD cards.  Good product so far.

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well I've waited around 2 months to write my review for the Memorex WMA/MP3 Digital Audio Player - MMP8500. I bought it in Xmas and it's definitively worth the prize. I did looked for a numerous ammounts of MP3 Players and from waht I've seen it's the best one around (comparing with other under $100 players)    Here are the positive things:  -Has an expansion slot for extra storage, MMC or Secure Digital cards.  -Battery last over 10 hours (at least when the battery is brand new, I really recommend you to use Energyzer rechargable batteries)  -Interface is so easy to use you'll learn how to use it without seeing at the reproductor  -Has a chronometer and a FM stereo tuner included.  -Displays the title of the song, along wth the MP3/WMA bitrate.  -Plays MP3, MP3PRO, WAV and WMA files.  -Much better than the Rio (Rio S35S Sport Digital Audio Player) or RCA (Lyra XXX MB MP3 Player). It's actually smaller than the Rio player (and it sounds a bit louder than it) and it just better than the RCA player. It ruberrized parts that make it stronger than the RCA player and it's definitively not a cheap thing you're getting. I've read the RCA player it's really nice (actually it's smaller than this one) but it looks like a cool, though simple plastic wrapped up device  -Ruberrized protection: I accidentaly crashed it again the floor once (while I was remembering about all thee reviews, hoping that the guy who wrote that the Memorex MP3 player is NOT cheap was right) and it definitively has protection and it's not a one month only device.  -Has a built in 128MB memory, which should be enough for 35-40 songs (in MP3Pro format)  -It includes a velcro arm band which is just great, it's easy to use and you can be sure you'll be able to jog while listening to it. I use it in Tai Bo classes and I've never had to stop in order to adjust my arm band.  -It includes a registration process in which you can get a new device if it's stolen, allthough I haven't tested that service (I didn't even registered since I live in Ecuador) and I haven't read reviews of that service.  -Under any windows it's recognized as a remobable storage device, which means that you can use it to backup/transport any files (for instance your address book, or your latest drivers, gaming patches, documents... you're working on)  For example I use my Memorex MP3 Player after work, while I am in the gym. I can record (again it's as easy as recording files to a diskette, allthough transfer reates are as fast as a hard drive) 25 songs for instance, and use the extra space to make a backup of my Inbox and contact list, which I then use it at the house in order to reply the emails that were categorized as &amp;amp;quot;to do&amp;amp;quot; things.  -You can play the songs in random, shuffle and repeat mode.  -You can hear your songs in pre-equalized formats: rock, pop, classic, ubass...    Bad things:  -You can't program your songs. I suppose that if you buy a 512 MB card and have around 200 songs, then it's really buggy to go from song 100 to song 300.  -The Chronometer only runs when the MP3 player is not working. So you can't go jogging while hearing music and timing your run. Why would anybody like to have the MP3 player work ONLY as a chronometer?  -The FM radio tuner doesn't has the seek function. So if you're in FM 88.1 and want to go to a station which operates in 100.1hz, then you'll need to move forward passing from station to station (at least it searches for the next available station in the FM band) numerous ammounts of times.  -The sound is definitively great, however you won't get the sound of a Sony Discman in it. It's good however it's not the best.   -You can consider buying another headphones so that you can hear the sound in a louder tone.  -It includes Real One player, a version which is the basic one (actually you can download it from the net), which is really annoying. Apart from not recognizing my CD rom driver, it has a zillion of parts which require a &amp;amp;quot;registration&amp;amp;quot;. In other words, it's one of those programs that wants to grab your credit card each time you use it. I use Music Match Jukebox Plus which is the best program around, and all my files are recorded in MP3Pro format (64 kbps with CD quality) and am able to record around 35-40 songs in my Memorex MP3 Player.  -Upgradable via Firmware, allthough I've never done it. It's just nice to know you can upgrade your unit to play future music formats. I am the type of guy who likes upgrading it's programs when needed.    Conclusion:  -----------  Compare MP3 players under $100. I really doubt you'll get a better player than the Memorex MP3 player. At least if you like doing sports with it, hearing the Soccer (baseball, football...) game in FM while seeing it in the stadium game, and having an extra device which will work as a 128 MB storage device under any windows.    If you're a music lover who is willing to invest more than $100 in a device like the Apple Ipod (which I belive has a better sound quality, but it's useless for doing sports, apart from that I can buy a whole stereo for it's prize) you're definitively buing a good piece of hardware.    I hope you find this review as usefull as possible ;)    If you think that I missed something in my review, please contact me at MSN and I'll try expanding it.    Regards  Xavier

<Content>I purchased this to use with Napster and was told by the sales man that there would be now problem with it. Purchased a couple of songs from Napster and guess what they do not work. My husband who is senior network analyst spent many hours to get the songs to work and could not get them to work. I am now going to buy the rio online at target because it says it is compatible with Napster. Wish me luck!

<Title>Biomorph Bio-degrading.
<Date>Fri Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I wish I could say that for the money, the biomorph is a great mp3 player, but since I actually got it for free, I'm somewhat biased in that department.  However, I can say that within the three weeks that I've owned it, the biomorph has simply fallen apart.  Let me first qualify by saying I don't take it with me to the gym, I don't strap it to my arm when rollerblading- none of that.  I use it for listening to mp3's while on the subway and that's all.  a very low-impact kind of interface.  Given that, it has still managed to fall apart at the seems.  <p>For starters, the case it comes with is counterintuitive.  Aside from being thin and flimsy (and outright unusable) its design by nature requires for it to be looped through your belt.  It also covers up the loop hole in which you are expected to slip the included arm band into, causing you to only be able to use one or the other.  <p>Secondly, the headphones are constructed rather shabily.  The nexus point where the left and right ear buds split off from each other is toggled with a sub-standard plastic aglet that has already slid off, revealing the exposed wires.  In an attempt to resecure it, (which involved simply sliding it back down) I cracked it.  Now a lame-o piece of scotch tape is the only thing keeping me from feeling the current that runs through it.<p>Again, let me say: LOW IMPACT INTERFACE.  I'm not doing jumping jacks, I'm not treating it like a cheap toy.  I'm very responsible with my electronics and this thing falls apart like a pressed daisy.<p>Thirdly, the thin metal clip that serves as the AAA battery's contact point has already broken off.  This from changing the battery twice.  Luckily for me the segment of it that broke off does not effect the actual circuitry, just my ease in lifting it up again to replace batteries.  But make no mistake- it's a major inconvenience as this unit tends to go through its single AAA battery rather quickly.  <p>All of the above I can pretty much handle.  As completely humiliating as it is to have a brand new piece of electronics constantly failing me, like that CD player that always skips, all of the above are actually &quot;deal-with-able.&quot;  After all, we mustn't look gift horses in the mouth.  <p>What I do find to be increasingly irritating though, is the number of times the player shuts itself off when I use the &quot;lock&quot; switch to keep that flimsy &quot;forward/backward/pause&quot; switch from shuffling my songs.  Without fail, every time I lock the unit, the unit shuts itself off.  It's a shame it advertises itself as a lock switch and not a power off switch.  otherwise I might be pretty happy with the functionality.<br>In short, as grateful as I was to receive it, this mp3 player really is more hassle than its worth and I look forward to the day (not far now, I'm sure) when it breaks completely apart of its own accord so I don't have to make up a lously lie as to why I bought a new and better player with better sound quality, more memory and a more intuitive interface.

<Title>Decent flash/mp3 player, poor accessories
<Date>Thu Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this unit because I liked the expandability of an MMC card (which are falling in price all the time), the cheap initial price compared to other units, the ID3 informative blue backlit screen, its shape, and, most of all, its reported simple plug-and-play flash drive capability.  All of these turned out to be as good as promised.  In my Windows XP machine, I plugged the device in without touching the enclosed cd, and the unit was recognized and installed as the biomorph external drive (with two drive letters:  one for the internal memory, and one for the card slot).  I was delighted:  I don't like to install software that comes with peripherals.  My machine already has the software I want. I then just dragged and dropped mp3 and other files, and voila, no problems, and the mp3's play fine.  The other qualities worked out, too.  I really like the shape:  the rubber edging is nice, and the unit fits nicely in your palm.  I prefer this to the long and thin units.  Also, the biomorph is incredibly light.  The ID3 tags worked fine.  The battery compartment is a bit flimsy, but so far no problems.  The weaknesses, perhaps to be expected, are in the little extras thrown in.  I very much wanted an arm band, but the enclosed velcro arm band was apparently designed for Hulk Hogan.  Unless I'm wearing a thick sweater, the arm band won't seal.  This has been my biggest disappointment.  The other two accessories are equally useless.  The headphones sound okay, but the earbuds are too large or something so they are painful in my ears after a couple of minutes.  Have to go shopping for a new pair.  The faux leather cover is obviously a 3 cent joke made in China.  While it does fit over the biomorph, the clasp that seals it on fits partially over the power button, so I find the unit frequently turning itself off and then I adjust it, and then it happens again.  Finally, I have not tried other mp3 players, but the biomorph does not get very loud.  I have tried all kinds of mp3's, and in general I have to leave the biomorph's volume at MAX all the time (including if I plug it into my stereo).  I have not yet taken it to a loud environment, like an airplane cabin, but I imagine music won't be audible in such an environment, if I need to have it at MAX in an otherwise silent environment.  I can't say I'm unhappy.  I have an expandable flash drive and workable mp3 player, and I didn't spend a fortune.  That said, since prices on competing units (with working arm bands and decent headphones) have fallen recently to closer to the biomorph's price, I wouldn't buy this unit again.  Since buying this item, prices on shock-resistant keychain flash drives with high Mac/PC compatibility (like Lexar's Jumpdrive Sport) have fallen through the bottom.  Could I do it again, I would just pick up a cheap 256 meg Jumpdrive Sport for my flash drive needs, and look into a better mp3 player, perhaps the Rio Cali 256 (which my friend owns), even if it lacks the ability to serve as a flash drive without the installation disc.  UPDATE:  After just over three months of use (funny, that's how long the warranty is), my Boimorph has died.  It's actually a shame:  I've really gotten to like it.  Over time, I got used to the arm band (though they make it too loose and I had to stretch it a little to keep it from pressing the power button off) and with another pair of headphones, it was great for jogging and working out.  It was also a nifty flash player for transferring files between my laptop and desktop, which I did often.  But with no warning, I suddenly got an icon of a hand with "HOLD" on the palm.  I held but nothing happened but the unit turning off.  So I replaced the battery:  no change.  I read through the entire manual and the support web site, and no mention is made of this icon, and so no corresponding troubleshooting tips.  (This infuriates me.)  So I followed the only procedure the site and manual provide for the Biomorph not turning on:  resetting it.  Did so, and now I get nothing but a few broken lines which immediately disappear.  Strangely, it still works as a flash drive when connected to a computer via USB, but otherwise it's locked in this oblivion state with crazy graphics.  Not cool.

<Title>Pretty good for the money!
<Date>Mon Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this on EBay for a total of $68 including shipping.  It's very light so that may be why others gave a low rating - it just doesn't feel worth the $99 (actual price).  I read the advice of others and didn't install the software.  I just plugged the USB in and it recognized the item as a removable drive.  All I did after that was drag and drop my songs in to the removable drive window and that was it!  Found that after 23 songs it was full but I have a few cards at home to put in the slot to increase the memory.  Pluses - Lightweight, came with arm band, easy to program/use.  You CAN use the stopwatch along with the MP3 playback.  Minuses - Clip that holds the battery in place looks very fragile, cannot program songs, cheesy case.  Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase.  At least I don't have to carry my CD player in my hand while running to keep it from skipping!

<Title>Great Player For The Money
<Date>Sat Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Bought this player on the spur of the moment while buying a DVD video player.  Got home, set up the MMP8500 with NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!!!  I installed only the drivers and drag and drop my MP3 files from my hard drives. YOU DON'T NEED TO INSTALL ANYTHING ELSE!  The unit is very light and sounds great, I did however buy the SONY MDR-J10 headphones for ten bucks, I just don't like ear buds.  For a 100 bucks you can't wrong. I find the volume to be fine and play my music with the volume about two thirds of the way up. Any louder you you're just asking to go deaf!  As far as it's construction, I don't find it to be any different from most portable electronics. I can't picture this unit breaking unless you really go out of your way to trash it.  The FM radio feature isn't all that great, even strong stations don't sound all the well and it lacks AM which is a bummer for those of us who listen to talk radio.  But then again I did buy it mainly to play my MP3s and it does that very well.  As for this other format WDA I can't offer an opinion being that all my files are in MP3.

<Title>Cheap, small, and not an I-Pod.
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm a junior in high school and I love this thing.  Everyone at school always raves about I-Pods but most of them have MP3 players that are under $100.  Go figure.  Anyway, My mom bought this one for me for an overpriced $152.  She could have done better for that money. But I am a Cher fan, and in case no one has noticed, whoever makes up the CD's has a thing for putting the same songs on 3 or 4 CD's.  With this in mind, it's great so long as you have Windows Media Player because, quite frankly, if you are computer illiterate this is a brilliant MP3 player.  And this way all my cher songs can be crammed onto one memory card instead of me carrying all my CD's.

<Title>A piece of junk
<Date>Thu Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was the cheapest model I saw. I bought this Memorex model to use in the gym and I've had a lot of problems with it. This is for starters; The snap on the carrying case broke making the armband useless, probably because it is made of flimsy vinyl.  The design of the snap kept rubbing against the power button that would shut the player off. (Especially on the treadmill) The player is controlled by a toggle switch that often falls off. It is also very difficult to get into the FM receiver mode. The battery comes loose inside and once again the player often shuts off when rattled. (Once again, especially on the treadmill) This thing also kills batteries, expect to change out the AAA batteries about every other use. (Approx. 4 hours) The battery cover isn't designed very well either. It takes some playing with to get the cover back on which will really piss you off. I would have liked to have a belt clip on it similar to the Sony armband radio.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for, spend a few more dollars more and get a better model and a better brand name.

<Content>This mp3 player sucks. No wonder it is so cheap. Today was my first day with it and it screwed up on me. The instructions on the thing are confusing and you have a hard time getting the thing to connect to your computer so you can download songs. It tells you to "reformat" the mp3 thing and I did exactly what it told me to do to reformat it and it gave me an error message the next time I powered it on and it shut down. Now it won't stay on. My advice YOU should TAKE: DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!

<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this mp3 player for christmas and i have to say that it has served its purpose so far. At first i wanted to get the virgin player but once i found out that i wont need that much memory i opted out of for the biomorph. The 126mb was good enough for me because i listen to the same 20 songs for about a month untill i change them anyway. But, for others you can add addtional memory. The directions will fool for about a day but in all actuality it installs itself. Some down falls are the accesorries, the head-pieces are too big and it doesnt get that loud, the case is shabby and so is the armband. Also, after a day and a half you will find yourself changing the aaa battery. Overall, its a pretty good player.

<Title>Decent Player
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got one of these for christmas. The only thing I DONT like about it is the inability to file songs somehow, ie: alphabetically, by artist, etc. This isnt necessarily a problem now with only 128 mb, but when I expand to 512mb which i plan on doing, im sure it will be frustrating having to scan thru to find the songs i want.  Transferring songs is simple and fast, about 10-15 secs per song. The battery doesnt last long, but im still getting 3-4 hours out of my rechargeables.   As far as the low volume output some people have discussed, I can hear it fine at about 50% volume in low noise rooms, and Ive never turned it up higher than about 80% even when my fiancee has turned the car radio up high to drown out the song I'm singing. And i work on construction sites and dont hear all that well normally.  Overall, i feel a good product for the money.
