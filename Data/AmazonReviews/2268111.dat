<Content>This is a great new offering from HP!  This iPOD is better in the fact that you get great reliability and support from HP.  In addition, HP's iPOD provides a USB 2.0 AND Firewire cable with the product.  A $20 option Apple doesn't provide!  PC lovers rejoice!

<Title>It's the same as Apple's iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Just a correction to another review - I have the 4G 40 Gig Apple iPod, and it DOES include both USB and Firewire cables.  I've seen this one too, and it's another fine product (but then, it's pretty much the same thing as Apple's product, since HP licensed it from Apple.)

<Title>Same exact thing as regular 40GB Apple Ipod
<Date>Mon Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>No worries, when you order this item it comes with "ipod for PC" emblazened all over it, but it still works just the same on your mac.  If you would like to go thru hp and get their warranty, feel free, i don't know if it's better than apple's and i don't know if there's an hp equivilent to "applecare" but with hp's marketing muscle, there will now no longer be problems getting ipods.  I had to wait weeks for amazon to even have this item, but now that it's here, i'm in nirvana. :)

<Content>What can I say other than "WOW"  This is one of the best products that HP introduced. The best MP3 player ever! The other cool thing is that the 24/7 support from hp now all I have to do is call one number and get support for all my HP products. Great job HP!!! Keep inventing!

<Title>Difference in Support between HP and Apple iPods - iTunes
<Date>Sat Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great product but there is a difference in support between HP and Apple iPods.  I was having problems with iTunes not correctly importing my song ID tags (see below) so I called HP.  HP told me that it does not support iTunes, and then I called Apple and they told me that they do not support iTunes for HP iPods-Only Apple iPods!!!  Apple verifies that you have an Apple iPod by the serial number, which they require for tech support.  Further, I believe iTunes is the only application that you can use with the new iPods, so you don't have a choice to use a program that works better for you.  What are they thinking???  I hope they correct this issue as soon as possible.    I believe iTunes may need some fine tuning because my song tags were fine on my old iPod (2G), MusicMatch, Windows Explorer, XPlay, etc., but when I imported the songs into iTunes, many of my songs (a couple hundred of them) had extra spaces at the end of artist, album, and track names, and some genres changed among other issues.  It looks like iTunes reverted the songs to their original tags from long ago.  It took a couple of hours to get them back the way I had them.

<Title>Not a good clone
<Date>Thu Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is totally a rebranded Apple iPod under the uglier skin.  People had hoped for HP adding WMA support, but there is none in this.  If you want an iPod, get the real thing.  If you want a really good MP3 jukebox, check out the Creative Zen Touch.  HP has very poor tech support, by the way, so the ten bucks you save over the iPod doesn't make this a better value.

<Title>Honest and Non biased review of this product,
<Date>Fri Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have seem so many bad reviews for both the 20GB version of +HP Ipods and the 40 GB version of +hp Ipods. The reviewer seems to not understand the whole concept of the technology share venture between HP and Apple. Apple has good design, HP has its manufacturing and Marketing power. Its a natural combination!  I've been wanting to buy an ipod for quite a while now and IT IS very difficult to find an APPLE brand 20 GB 4th Gen Ipod! Apple simply can't keep up with the demand! The +HP brand Ipod is EXACTLY the same as the Apple Brand Ipod. The only few difference are listed here - HP Logo at the back of ipod player (Nothing serious here) - HP support (Not bad either, 24/7 with quick pickup) - Allows HP Ipod custom printable skins (Nice addition, but the skins would probablly work on regular Apple IPods as well). - PC Softwares (Does this really matter? +HP ipod would also work on Macs if you download itune for macs)  People kept on complaining about no WMA support. Remember Apple IPOD design is a copyrighted design by apple. If apple don't want to offer WMA support, there is nothing HP can do about it! HP simply helps the manufacturing and distribution!!! Nothing else. BTW, Hp invented is simply a catchy marketing phrase. The main core business of HP is printers and computers, did HP invent either one of these??? Don't concentrate too much on their marketing techniques, what really matters is the product.  Everything else is exactly the same! Even the apple logo still exist on the back of this ipod player.   So the only big difference I can see is apple support or HP support. To me, I don't really care. But if you really want Apple support don't get this. Otherwise don't look any further.

<Title>Same as Apple iPod + A Few thoughts
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First, this HP iPod is the same as the Apple iPod.  There is an Apple store 1 block from my office and I took it in and compared them.  The ONLY difference in the unit itself is a smal HP logo on the back.  I bought this simply because it was in stock and the "Apple" version wasn't, no other reason.  I really like my iPod for all the reasons everyone else does..it's elegant, works well, holds a ton of music, etc.  That said, here are a few cons I thought I'd mention...  -Using the device as a hard-drive in Windows requires a setting that makes you "eject" each time you disconnect the cable.  Seems like an odd extra step.  -USB connection charges the battery, Firewire doesn't.  -There are fewer cases/covers available for this new design without the buttons above the selector wheel.  These things scratch so easily you need a case.  -Sometimes the wrong song title appears on the display, even though the file has the correct one in iTunes.  I also have a few issues with iTunes 4.6 for Windows, a key component of the iPod:  -The screen doesn't refresh automatically, showing a different song playing than actually is.  Sometimes I get gibberish on the screen.  -The music store is often quite slow to respond to searches or even hangs.  -There's not enough information on the music to make purchase decisions, so I find myself browsing at Amazon and then buying at iTunes.  -Different iTunes songs have different volume levels.  I think there's a setting to make them all the same, but I haven't found it.  -It's hard to synch all your music onto multiple computers.  I would like to have my music on my iPod, work laptop, and home desktop.  Getting them all the same isn't easy.  -You really have to watch pricing on albums.  Most albums cost $9.99 and most songs cost 99 cents.  If there are less than 10 songs on an album, you still get charged $9.99, even if you could get all the songs individually for less.  -I had one of the original Rio MP3 players and ripped a lot of songs using their software, which combined song-album-artist into one field.  iTunes doesn't parse these when importing.  -If I import music from a CD without an Internet connection, iTunes doesn't go to the CDDB later when I do have a connection to get track info.  Despite all the above, I'm really enjoying my iPod, I just wanted to point out a few of the shortcomings in the hopes that Apple would address.

<Title>My Experience with the iPod +hp
<Date>Sun Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased the 40gb iPod about a week ago. My previous MP3 player was a Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 20gb version. I finally decided to upgrade because the Nomad has a horrible battery life. It would rarely hold a charge over 2 hours, so I decided it was time to upgrade to a new MP3 player.    I've been following the iPod for quite awhile and was very impressed with all of it's positive reviews. Especially the sound quality and it's battery life. When the new HP+ version of the iPod was released I decided it was time to buy. Apon checking my local retailer and online, there really wasn't much of a price difference so I decided to buy locally and save the time it takes for shipping.    There are two versions of the HP+ iPod. There is a 20-gigabyte version and a 40-gigabyte version with about a $100 price difference. I had originally planned on buying the 20gb model because I only have about 10 gigs of music and just don't need all that extra space. Apon closer examination I found the 40gb model also included a dock for easy syncing with my PC. Separately the dock costs $39.95 and I was going to buy one anyways. So for only $60 more I could have 20 more gigs of space. That's great to have if I ever needed to back up any large files from my desktop.    The iPod was very well packaged. There wasn't a lot of garbage plastic and annoying ads telling me to buy accessories. The documentation included with the unit was concise and easy to follow. I had the unit up and charging in minutes although Windows XP did require a reboot to finalize the driver installation when I first plugged it in.    The sound is incredible! My old Nomad Jukebox was junk compared to this player. I'm not sure what Apple has done to make sound quality this good, but it has to be heard to be believed. The iPod's control wheel does take a little bit of getting used to but I quickly learned it can be completely controlled with just one hand. I'm left handed and haven't had any problems with it. It's also touch sensitive. Just lightly rubbing the wheel clockwise or counter-clockwise will adjust the volume or scroll through the iPod's menus. The iPod's casing feels very rugged and strong. I wouldn't recommend dropping it, but I think if I did it would survive.    Apple has designed this unit with simplicity in mind. There are only two ports on the unit. One is for the headphones and the other one can be used by the firewire or USB 2.0 cable. It automatically charges it's self through this cable and doesn't have to be plugged in. If you do wish to charge it through a wall socket, an included hybrid power adaptor is included. It's basically a plug-in adaptor with a firewire port.    I was not impressed with the earbud headphones. Not that they have bad sound quality, quite the opposite, they sound excellent but they just won't stay in place for me. Wrap around headphones should have been included. I know earbuds are quite popular right now, but I really have problems with them. I had an ear operation a number of years ago and just don't have the ear support to keep them in place. I've had to use wrap around earphones for years, which is no big deal since I already have a pair that I bought to use with my old MP3 player.    The bundled software is basic. It's just one program, but it's very versatile. It's called iTunes. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but I got the hang of it in about an hour or so. iTunes automatically sorts all of your music into three categories. Genre, Artist and Album. This makes it easy to find music fast. Burning music to the iPod is a breeze. Just drop your CD into the computer and iTunes automatically updates the album name, tracks and artists for you. Just click the copy to iPod button and iTunes takes care of the rest! Play lists are easy to create and upload to the iPod. I have a travel play list for on the road, and a home play list for around the house. iTunes also gives you the option to preview and download music online. There is quite a variety of music to choose from. Whatever your taste in music, there is something for everyone. I've already downloaded three songs and they only cost $.99 a piece. (Sure I could have gotten them for free, but I have a conscience) Entire albums can be downloaded for $9.99. To pay for the music iTunes can either charge a valid credit card or an active America Online account.  Positives:    - iPod has the best sound I've heard   - 40gb version is the best deal and includes a dock.   - The dock is extremely handy and almost required   - Can display .txt, calendar and contact files   - Works as a backup hard drive   - Excellent battery life   - Built in games  Negatives:   - High Price   - Earbud Headphones   - Only Firewire & USB 2.0 Compatible (No USB 1.1) -	Can only be configured with one computer (No Swapping between 2)  Even with a few minor negatives this iPod gets 5 stars. It's the best MP3 player out there!

<Title>Product may be great -- STAY AWAY OF HP SERVICE!!
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi,   I got my IPOD @ COMPUSA before I headed off for Europe for 6 months -- BIG MISTAKE!  I tried to get connect my unit to my Win XP laptop and ended up getting an error message on the screen.  I called HP Tech Support who not only had no clue what the error message meant (the unit displayed a folder with an exclamation mark on it), but they also had no process in place to help if I was calling from outside the US.  I will end up having to send the unit back to the US and pay for it (!!!) and they'll then send it back to my parents only so that I'll have to pay to get it shipped back again!  SO STAY AWAY OF HP SERVICE, wherever you are....
