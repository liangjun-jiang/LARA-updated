<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Save your money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it quit working 3 weeks later. First it started turning off for no reason, we changed the batteries, no better. Now it won't turn on and stay on for longer than 2 seconds. What a piece of crap!!!!!!!! Zero stars.

<Title>Cheap plastic leads to shoddy product
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We expected this item to be at least as good as the older Creative MuVo TX we've had for over a year, but we were wrong. The cheap plastic on this Creative Nano MP3 player leads to two drawbacks we experienced within the first 3 weeks we owned it: 1) The tiny plastic clip that holds the battery cover in place easily breaks off, and it takes weeks to get a replacement cover from Creative. 2) Even when it's inside the plastic case (which you have to buy separately), the unit turns off, loses its settings, or forgets what song it was playing when it experiences light impact, such as dropping 3 inches onto a table.   We never had any of these problems with other MP3 players we've had for over a year.  The Creative MuVo TX is a much sturdier product, and it even has a better cover.  This product was a waste of my money.  It gets 2 stars because the software is very easy to use.

<Title>creative MP3 players not for Mac users
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I was shopping for our kids x-mas presents here on Amazon I thought an inexpensive MP3 player would fit the bill. Checking out the literature and reviews nothing indicated there would be compatiblity problems with Apple products. We purchased two Zen nanos only to find out the ugly truth, not only do MP3 players work only with Microsoft products, only ipods work with Apple products.

<Title>A Great Value
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old. She loves music, but she was tired of lugging around her CD player & CD collection anytime we took a trip. Only one disappointment: At the time Amazon had the wrong features listed in the description, so I thought it had line-in recording capabilities... it doesn't. If you just need a good basic mp3 player you can't go wrong with this one. It has survived quite a few drops and a good bit of banging around, as it belongs to a young kid. We have had NO PROBLEMS of any type with this player that sees daily use. It is easy to load/manage songs on this player as well. The provided software is easy to use and install. We have loaded music from Napster, music match, and personal CDs with out a hitch. Battery life is as good or better than promised. Creative builds a good product that bridges the gap between the cheap-junk players and the Almighty Ipod. 512k is enough memory for quite a few songs, but some may opt for a bigger capacity. Like I said before, if you want a quality, easy to use player at a fair price this may be the one.

<Title>Ready to travel
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We just got ours so don't know about longevity but it is very cute and much smaller than an ipod.  I bought it for my daughter to take on a school trip to Europe and wanted a player that was inexpensive and used batteries.  This one came with an armband but not a neckband.  We had some problems getting our PC (Windows XP) to recognize the device.  It seemed to need Windows Media 10 to work and we also had to load the enclosed software.  Now it works fine.  It seems to easily convert songs from cds that we had stored originally on itunes with no problems.  My daughter loves it.  Now I am getting one for her sister and myself.  The 1GB is now the price we paid for the 512 MB so we are getting those.

<Content>Creative makes a durable and trustworthy line of MP3 players. This thing accidentally made its way into my washing machine and it still works just like new! No worries here. Customer service is great, the warranty is great, and this product is very easy to use. I highly recommend it.

<Title>Hopefully Helpful........
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me save you some time... if your player starts shutting down, tech support will tell you it's a DRM thing and that you have to use a specific program to transfer files, that you have to upgrade the firmware and drivers off of their site. It all works pretty well, although a clumsy process... but if you want your unit to continue to function properly, you need an older driver. Try to find this version: ZenNanoPlus_PCFW_LF_1_10_03 (it's the version before the current one, so it's bound to be floating around out there somewhere... just keep looking or demand it from Creative) - I just reformatted and flashed my firmware using this version and it now works just fine. GOOD LUCK!!! [..]  I should also mention that this would be the PERFECT player if:  1) the little tooth on the battery compartment sliding door didn't break off so EASILY.  2) The firmware wasn't sush a mess (they blame record labels and DRM restrictions...)  3) and the recording quality was something better than, like about 32 kHz wav. 192 mp3 would be better.  Otherwise I LOVE the unit and the ease of operation.

<Title>I love it!!!
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't have anything to compare this to because it's my first MP3 player.  However, I am surprised at just how much I love it.  It is so easy to use and very small and light so it can fit in your pocket.  It was extremely easy to download the music and figure out how to organize music folders.  It holds just about what is advertised which is approximately 200 - 250 songs.  However, I am sure the length of each song will determine how many can actually fit on this MP3 player.  The price was great - $50.  If you are a person who loves the radio, then get the Nano Plus.  Otherwise, this is a great player for someone who wants ease of use and does not have more than 250 songs in their collection of favorite music.

<Title>Battery cover blues
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My Zen Nano's battery cover broke within 1 month of purchase date. The construction is very flimsy, and if you do your research before purchasing you will find that this is not an uncommon problem. I wish I would have researched a little more before I spent my money on it! :-(  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>Very good sound
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is small and fits in my pocket.   The sound is really good (althougth I prefer using my own headphones because the ones that come with it are not very comfortable).  Operating the menu is a little difficult (it is a wheel) and sometimes you get in the wrong place because you didn't turn it just right.    Battery life seems to be pretty good.  Overall, I am happy to have a player, so I am happy with it.

<Title>Cant beat it for the price.
<Date>Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>-Very simple to use.  Sound quality is A+.    -Earbuds have the best sound for earbuds of those type, but usually too large for most women I find (try Creative's EP-360).   -Comes with a neck strap, armband or carring case sold seperatly.  -Case is hard plastic.  At this time I feel you would have to be very careless to break the battery covering or any part of it.  The battery covering slides in and out with ease.    -My 1st two batteries did last about 18 hours.  Easy to use with audible.com and Window Media player.    -Compaired to other players in the same price range, this is the best bang for your buck.

<Title>Battery cover comes off, then battery falls out!  Creative offers little to help!
<Date>Thu Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with Lewis...but lets be accurate.  The battery backing doesn't actually brake.  It just falls off when you least expect it, and it's so small, you don't feel it, so there's no telling where the cover lands.  Going thru Creative is a JOKE!  I already got a free battery cover replacement, but within a month, THAT fell off too!  I contacted Creative, and they said it's going to cost this time.  Now, I'm expected to pay approximately $20 to get another cover (with shipping)!  I told them that this is NOT an uncommon problem, and directed them to several different sites that discuss this problem (with still no solution), and that's where the conversation ended.  I REALLY wish I hadn't bought this one.  I guess I should have done my research, but I purchased it when it first came out, so it wouldn't have done any good.  What a joke!  Stay away from this product, unless you want to lose battery covers and batteries over and over.  That becomes expensive, especially if you are taking the economical way and using rechargable batteries!  STAY AWAY!  AVOID!

<Title>Satisfying for a limited period.
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using this product for almost a year untill it broke down. Once it fell and hit the ground and disintegrated on two pieces,  so I glued them together and then worked fine for couple months untill sweat penetrated into its guts and made the wire that connects battery with main green plate corosive so it disconnected. We tried to repair it but no go it's finished. It's true that I've been using it mostly for running, gym and biking so it was constantly wet of sweat so probably today would still work if I wouldn't use it for sports but I've bought it for that purpose. PROS: - small and quite thin - one AAA battery lasts for about 18 hours - simple menu and a lot of functions (FM radio also) - very good sound for electronic music but not with original headphones   those are crap - it looks nicer than competition  CONS: - cheap plastic - problems with battery cover - cheap and clumzy scroll wheel - too short interval of display light - made in China

<Title>Creative ZEN Nano 'minus'
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Nano sucks. 4 hrs and 2 calls to tech suppoert and the unit still will not be recognized by my computer. One of the Tech support help points was to use one of the USB ports on the BACK of the computer rather than the front (not in the instructions). They say that the ports on the back of computers are more capable that those on the front (?). I asked them why they would design a device - with a 6 inch cable - that required you to crawl under your desk to plug it in each time, when there is a perfectly good port (that works for every other plug-in device I have) on the front? All I got was a sheepish, 'yeah, I know' from the techie. Still did not work on the rear port. Then they wanted me to go in and do some monkey work with the computer's register. Forget it. It goes back. It's like buying a radio for your car and then being told you need to work on the transmission to get the radio to turn on. What a piece of crap.  Amazon should have an option to rate '0 stars'.

<Title>on par with sandisk sansa series
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this player looks cooler than the sansa series, and seems to crash/have errors less, but:  - it lacks a lock button - the display only shows the song title and track time and battery life (the sansas show much more info) - the "wheel button" feels cheesy like it could break and doesn't make control any easier - the headphones are more uncomfortable and fall out for me (i think they are too big, and i have a big head)  overall, i'd say it has a much better value than an ipod, but about the same value as the sansas.

<Title>Agree pro and con
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Every one is right.  Good mp3 player, needs better headphones.  I bought my first mp3 it is the MuVo, which was bigger but provided a soft belt clip holder that also fitted over th battery cover.  It also the main part of the player detached from the battery holder with a bulit in usb adapter, very good, did not have to go through all the cords I have for other stuff. I have been very happy with that one.  I bought the creative nano plus form staples for my grandaughter last Christmas they sent me the nano instead of sending it back I decided to keep it and get the correct zen nano plus which could transferr direct from cd player, the main reason I ordered it.  Well to cut it short, my grandaughter lost the battery cover so I was going to take the one off mine and I noticed it was really loose, i'm sure it would have lost too.  If you really want this player all you need to do is get a holder for it or the cheapest fix is to put a piece of tape on it.  The thing is cheap but you get what you pay for.  I paid about $70, thats a lot cheaper Than $300 for an IPOD!
