<Content>PROS *Different, practically unheard of brand if you like that sort of thing... *Small (about 3 inches tall, 1.25 inches wide) you can carry it anywhere (smaller than a nano ipod) *Nice buttons - just tap lightly and you can select the menus easily, unlike that annoying scrolly thing on the ipod *Very cool looking, sleek, slender, shiny mirror surface on the back, pink light behind the buttons *Color screen is bright and clear *Radio and voice recording (the main reason I bought this) - pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  For radio, you go to the Radio function then press record (the circle button the the right of the ^ button).  For voice, you just go to Voice menu and press the record button. If you want to listen to any recordings, though, you have to go to the Voice menu and press play (all recorded files are saved under this menu.  It took me a while to figure this out). The files are saved as .wav files and you can then copy the files to your computer with Windows Explorer. *The radio gets pretty good reception. You can choose scan mode (where you look through the stations yoursel), or preset mode (where it only shows your 20 preset stations). If you don't want to preset them, the mp3 player has an automatic function that picks up the 20 strongest signals and sets them for you. *It acts as a removable storage device when you plug it in to your computer so you can delete files, add files, or create folders with Windows Explorer or My Computer really easily. *You can also use it with other Media players like real player and yahoo jukebox and add files from the library to the mp3 player using the synchronize function.   *Plays video files!  *Equalizer audio settings! *Comes with ear phones *You can add picture files and look at them. CONS *this one's only 1 GB, so if you want more space go for the bigger one *You have to charge it with a USB charger that hooks up to the headphone jack on your i.beat and then connects to your computer.  I wish it came with one one that I could plug into the wall... *You have to be careful when you first turn it on. Tap lightly on the UP ^ button to choose ENGLISH or else if you press the menu button it will go to German and you have to go to settings and figure out which one is the language button. I had to go to worldlingo.com to translate the selections so I could figure out how to change the language. If it happens, all you do is go to SETTINGS (luckily the menus are all in english) then choose System, then choose Sprachen. *It takes a little time to get used to tapping the buttons.  Just remember that you can get to different menus by holding the button longer or shorter.  Holding the button longer moves you to the main menus, shorter keeps you within the submenus. *It doesn't put the music into categories (album, artist, genre, etc). So you have to do this on your own by going to Windows Explorer and clicking on your mp3 player then creating file folders on your computer.  The folder files will then show up on your screen on your mp3 player when you press the middle select button as you play your songs. But this is basically the same as creating a permanent playlist, just doing it in windows explorer.  This can sometimes be a pro because it gives you a little bit of more control over how you want your songs arranged. You know how sometimes you have to create all kinds of song info before your songs can be arrange by genre or artist.  With this you don't have to do all that. You just make a folder and stick whatever songs you want in it. *You have to convert video files to .smv.  (But it comes with the software and it's really easy after that. Once you open the program, you just browse for the video file on your computer, then press convert. Then go to Windows Explorer and drag the file to your mp3 player and go to the Multimedia on your mp3 player and press the play button!)   OVERALL, it's a pretty good product. I recommend it if you're looking for an inexpensive, multi-functional, and stylish looking digital media player.
