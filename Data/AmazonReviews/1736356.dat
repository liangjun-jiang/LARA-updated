<Title>Worst Mp3 player in the world
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alien ware needs to stick with making expensive PC's and laptops.  They should avoid making mp3 players, because it sucks so bad.    I got my AW ce-iv2 from an other site.    Here are a list of things for the aliens to work on.  1) it feels crappy in your hands (made from cheap plastic) 2) the battery life sucks.  (be sure to get rechargable batteries) 3) The back cover needs to be removed to access the SD card slot 4) After a little use the back cover just falls off. 5) Headphones suck and are not very durable. 5) Ther is not way to go to a specific song with out skipping through all the songs.   6) Scratches very easily.   7) Headphones fall of your ear if you dont stay still like a statue.   8) Voice recording is very weak. 9) This mp3 player shold be priced under $50 because it's crap. 10) FM radio--bad reception  Final conclusion  Dont buy it.  IT might come in a cool alienware casing but its a  SPACE TRASH.

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a few months ago. I have really enjoyed how simple it is to use.  As others have noted, the sound is amazing!  The earbuds are also terrific. It's very small and light.  Great to work out with.  Not to mention the cool Alienware design.  I love it!

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Perhaps I should start with a rebuttal to the bad reviews I've read. The player is very lightweight. This doesn't necessarily mean cheap. What do you expect? It's made of plastic with a few small integrated circuits. The supposed metal band is actually chrome plated plastic. It is not advertised as made of metal so why complain. It doesn't have a built-in rechargeable battery. Good, when the single AAA cell runs down I can chuck it and put another in. At four for a buck that's better than waiting three to five hours for a non-replaceable battery to charge. If you want a rechargeable battery then go buy one for a couple of bucks and buy the optional charger. You have to remove the battery cover to access the SD card slot. Good, it keeps the dirt out of the slot. The instructions say it can only use a 512 MB SD card but my 1GB card works fine. The earphones stay in my ears just fine. That said, here's my review. I'll focus on what was important to me. You can read about some other features in other reviews.  The good:  1. Lightweight. 2. Replaceable AAA battery or optional rechargeable battery and charger. 3. Excellent sound (no funny background noise like some other players. 4. Excellent noise blocking earphones. 5. SD card expansion slot good for at least 1 GB.  The Bad:  1. The display is virtually unreadable when the backlight is off. You should have the option of changing the white on black display to black on white. It would be readable without the backlight then. 2. No folder management in the menus. You have to step through every track to find the one you want (except you can switch from internal memory to the SD card as a shortcut). Careful use of file names and ID3 tags helps to find things. 3. No case. I got an adequate very inexpensive case made by Case Logic. 4. Eats batteries like a demon. When I use it regularly I can easily go through two batteries a day. Well, that's fifty cents a day under heavy use. I may think about getting the charger and some rechargable batteries but alkaline batteries are cheap and convenient.  Overall it's an excellent player.

<Title>Amazing sound.
<Date>Thu May 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good player, the only con is the shuffling through the songs to find something specific. You cant go by artist or album, just what ever order they are put in. Don't really think of that as a con though when u compare it to the sound. The bass really comes out and the dynamics are great. It looks very cool, if a little big. I emphasize little because it still only about 3 ounces.

<Title>I like it
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As others have said, this unit does suck up batteries. According to the manual, however, you can put a rechargable battery and charge via the USB connector (not sure if that is accurate but that is what is implied).  I would have liked some better folder management on the unit.  As others have said, it is hard to read without the back light.  Overall I like the unit, it has nice sound, works well, and is pretty solid.  A good update to the built in software would fix a lot of my issues.

<Title>Great Player, But Eats Batteries For Breakfast
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Awesome little MP3/WMA player with FM Radio and Voice/Radio recorder as well. The screen is hard to read when not lit, but in the options I easily set it to display longer (0-45 seconds). I agree with the other reviewers in that you do have to skip songs to get to the one you want, and this unit does eat batteries for breakfast. I went thru one the first 24 hours I had it. Great sounding ear buds, and great sounding unit. Unit has an equilizer with presets for various types of music and srs. I love the look of it and how the aliens eyes light up when the backlight is on, not too happy their yellow and not green lol.. Buy it, you'll love it!

<Title>WARNING DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Buyer beware...this is a horrible company...check the BBB of Miami site and you will see how many complaints this company has filed against it. They will not give any customer service not allow you to speak to a supervisor and most certainly tell you that even if your product is defective thet cannot refund. Had to write to the BBB myself to get a refund on a laptop that had not worked from day 1 or after sending to the repair center 5 times, also they replaced laptop with a new system that did not work out of the box either. They finally agreed to refund my money after several letters to BBB they received product back over 2 weeks ago and still haven't receive my money back. Deal with this shady company at your own risk.
