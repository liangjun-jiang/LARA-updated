<Title>Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The promotion and advertising for this product states that this would download 1000 songs.  Knowing that some songs are longer than others etc., I figured that I'd be able to load at least 900+.   However, in downloading from my computer, I could only load 426 songs.   Naturally being quite upset, I contacted the Creative Company, and they said:    "Music files encoded at higher bitrate are much larger than music files encoded at lower bitrate, thus it reduces the number of songs a player can store".   They then talked about 32 versus 64 bitrate etc.    To me this is something close to false advertising, because NOTHING whatsoever is ever said about bitrate, and that as a caveat, know your bitrate etc. etc.    Hence, I could only load 426 songs.  This is Creative's major error.   Had I known about this, I would not have ordered a 2 GB player.      SO, I have ordered a 4 GB player, and intend to send back the 2 GB player I originally ordered and received.   (SHAME ON CREATIVE FOR NOT STATING THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION).     However, the player itself is good quality and performs quite well, and had some problems loading the software.     But more info needs to be stated by Creative about the amount of songs that can be loaded based on bitrate (Which most consmers know nothing about).

<Title>Works rather well
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use this nice compact MP3 player in my car, while I exercise and randomly around the house.  It holds quite a bit of music (I use Yahoo) and is easy to manage.  It has frozen up twice, but that is because I was trying to go forward and back too fast!!  It also has an appointment functioin, though there are a few key presses to get to it.  Overall, it has great sound and ease of use!!  I highly recommend it!!

<Title>Didn't last a year
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought this was going to be great. It's light, sleek, I loved all the features.  But towards the end, it became a frustrating hassle.    Janurary 2007: I received it.  Then about two weeks later, the toggle switch that you use to navigate it broke off.  For the remainder of the time that I kept it, I had to navigate using my fingernail.    Spring 2007: It froze.  It's okay, I just reset it.   August 2007: It froze.  But then when I reset it, it froze during loading.   September 2007: Can't skip songs or change volume because it'll freeze.   Fall/Winter 2007: Can't reset it when it freezes because it'll just freeze over and over.  I had to let it rest overnight and attempt to reset the next day.    December 2007: Stopped using it.    It WAS awesome.  But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Excellent starter MP3
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the 1st MP3 player I've purchased. I think it is very user friendly & easy to load. I had it charged & loaded within 24 hours of receiving it. Pretty good for a tech novice.   I love my Zen & don't know how I lived with out. The free ear buds that came with the Zen are too large for my ears. I'm researching the optimal buds for price now. Also, I'll definitely invest in purchasing the electric (plug into wall) charge adaptor. Charging to my PC isn't convenient for me.  The only thing that I found slightly overwhelmed with was locating a company for music downloads & how the process is established. Having hundreds of online companies offering the purchase of music files is confusing. It would've been nice to have received a few free downloads intially. I went with Amazon.com for music downloads for my Zen. It's what I'm familar & comfortable with.

<Title>Good So Far....
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Muvo N200 that was great until it crapped out - I'm hoping this one lasts longer.  So far I'm impressed with the functionality.  I researched long and hard to try to find a player that was small, compatible with Audible, compatible with Netplayer, and had bookmarks.  This player does it all, and the bookmarks are a necessity for netplayer and audible content.  The interface is nice and fairly easy to use.  The included earplugs are surprisingly comfy.  If it holds up it should be a winner.  One dissappointment - I have a Motorola RAZR phone and saw on-line a adapter that claimed to charge both the RAZR and the Zen V.  I figured the Motorola version that I have for both plug-in and car would work, but neither do.  Chargers are getting too smart for their own good I suppose, so for now I am stuck with the USB charger,which I really don't like....

<Title>Love it
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player. It was actually smaller than I thought it would be and it is so adorable! The screen is really pretty, even though you can't see it in the sunlight, but you can just shield it with your hands and it's not a problem. I love being able to change the themes and backgrounds for the menus. Learned how to use it really fast. I especially love the search feature to find a particular artist fast or the keyword search for a song. Would highly recommend.

<Title>i don't like ipods...
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So I bought this instead. It's great, the software was simple to install and use. I made the mistake of attaching it to the usb port before I installed the software. The player didn't turn on, but once I reset it with the post of my earring, it worked fine. I ripped all my cd's into it very quickly. The picture viewer is good too. And I love the voice recorder. It sounds about as clear as a computer microphone (an average one at least.) I just wish the instructions said something about how to delete the mp3s I didn't want in it anymore. I finally found out how, but the button I have to hold in is now stuck. That's the only complaint I got. It's really good. Buy it instead of an ipod. This is for people who actually CARE about their music, not what social statice they'll have.

<Title>Very Impressed
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed with this.  I did alot of research before buying an MP3 player and decided not to get an IPod for various reasons.  I liked another Creative product, but there were complaints about the controls not being easy to use with big hands.  So I waited a while and then this came out. This player however is very easy to control with my big hands.  It is easy to use, and the sound quality is good.  I had some problems with it once, I think I left it on accidentally and drained the power.  I was rather sad, thinking it had failed already.  However I discovered that there are two reset buttons.  One is on the top, the other is on the left side, in the middle.  The one on the side fixed the problem and it sprang back to life.  I highly recommend this if you are thinking about getting an MP3 player.

<Title>Geat looks, sounds decent, annoying interfaces and interaction with PC
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Have had 2 days, so intial reactions of player and as compeared to my previous players as follows:  Pros:  1) Great small small small size! 2) Stylin' looks are fantastic (but why no orange-controls-on-black-body for larger GBs???? Only green (2GB)  or blah blue (4-8GB.) 3) Sounds decent (after twiddling with custom EQ settings, but this capability weak compared to iRiver, also used different earphones, Shures, than came with it to get improved sound quality) 4) Can be used as data store  (must use Creative SW to get into Removable Disk mode. Would prefer if Windows recognized as just another data device in my computer and managed directly as any other external data store. Detailed management functions, e.g.playlists)  should be done via on-board player SW thru' device user interface) 5)Beautiful little screen, I will rarely if ever bother with movies on a 1.5 inch display, but the screen is very clear, crisp, and nice to use which is a big plus to me. 6) Nice it has Radio feature, have not tried yet though. Unclear to me if you can record directly off-air as in iRiver, but maybe you can. 7) Like direct line-in recording feature, haven't tried yet. (Not sure yet if able to upload to PC from player to save in that direction). 8) Not an iPod !!!! Yay! Upped to 4 stars just for this fact!  Annoyances: Many, will not hit on all.  Let me say I work in SW industry so weak or non-working User interfaces are very aggravating to me. Also critical of instruction manuals not giving enough info to problem solve, and this is an example of an inadequate manual (compare the combined printed and SW user's guides to iRiver comprehensive printed manual packaged with player).  1) Wndows XP Professional on IBM laptop first knows device is attached and then doesn't.  Flakes in and out while firmly plugged in to USB port. Not problem with the USB cord or port on computer, tested those.  Sometimes unplugging and re-plugging gets it recognized again, sometimes not.  Go to Creative website for Windows media patches to download, improved time between drop-outs, but did not eliminate problem. 2) SW only works when deivce plugged in and recognized: cannot work with files "offline" then transfer to device when ready. If decides to stop recognizing device while you are working with files, then all work is lost. Happned to me numerous times. Only tried with Media Explorer so far, possibly would be better with the Organizer SW. 3) SW harder to use than some others (e.g. iRiver). Also annoying that transfer sort options won't just let you default to order you put files in (iRiver does allow this). To do ordering must take the time to fool with tags or to create playlists (some of us do not want to spend this much time fiddling with our MP3 player.) 4) Recording button is in the way, next to volume and on side where you bump it easily, constantly.  And I have small-ish, agile hands. Should be on top, more out of way. 5) Takes forever to trickle charge through USB (1st time 6 hours,next time almost as long). Wall charger should have been included. Also, when checking to see if charged up, first gives 'charged' symbol then when you pick it up to do anything the 'charging' indicator starts again. Can't tell when its really charged all the way or not. 6)Horrendously slow downloads. On first loading (1.8 Gb, took about 20-25 mins on USB 2.0 connection...compare this to tranferring this amount to my thumb drive or any other modern external drive). 7) Stops at end of each album rather then keeping on playing to next...this is a pain for a busy professional using when traveling or when exercising.  Again, if had time to fool with playlists, surely it would play the whole list.  8) Screen turn-off and idle time sleep / player auto-shut down timers do not time properly  (too short) and there is not enough control over allowable settings.  Also, depending if it shuts down or you do it manually makes a difference in where it picks up again in songs.  Have not used for anything but songs, so don't know about books. 9) User interface on player OK once you play with it long enough to mostly figure it out, however a better instruction manual could save valuable time here.

<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The screen can not be read in sunlight. File transfer is really quite slow, maybe 2 minute per album. The transfer software is buggy and prone to lock up.  As noted in some of the positive reviews there are some good qualities for the MP3 player but those are mostly aesthetic. These manufactures need to engineer a working product first then put on the lipstick.

<Title>less than expected.
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a Creative MuVo N200 that has worked great for over a year.  I thought I would like this new one with a color screen and the ability to view images.  Well I did not like the required software and built in media management.  I just wanted to plug it in and copy my files to it like I could with the N200.  The image quality on the tiny screen was less than optimal for viewing images.  When fast forwarding through mp3 tracks the time index would advance but the actual position would barley move or revert to the point I started at.  It could not handle true time index for long net casts (pod casts) > 1.5 hours in length.  So, I returned it.  I think I'll take a look at and Arcose or Coby V-Zon

<Title>Great, compact player
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have tried a few different music players, and this is the best. I was looking for a flash player that would work with Urge and Audible, with a color screen, rechargeable battery and great battery life. This unit fits those needs perfectly. My main use is for audio books, with occasional use for music, so the 2GB capacity is certainly adequate. If your needs are similar, I would strongly recommend this unit. I am not as concerned with the look of the unit, but this one excels in that department as well. The shiny black surface is very attractive (although it attracts fingerprints like crazy), and the screen is very nice. The OLED screen gives it great battery life, while not sacrificing screen quality. I have had bad luck with quality control issues in the past, specifically with different models of Sandisk "Sansa" players. I am having an issue with this player as well, but it is relatively minor, as it only happens occasionally. The issue is that every so often during playback you will hear a brief high-pitched noise, and/or the track will begin skipping back and forth like a badly scratched CD. The issue does not appear to be with the tracks themselves, because you can restart the track and it will play normally. It is a minor issue, because I am sure it will be corrected with a replacement (and if not, I will update this post), and the issue happens rather infrequently (once every few hours of playback). All in all, highly recommended!

<Title>Excellent Little Player
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this for a month or so and I love it.  I've heard other people saying that theirs froze up.  This happened to me too, but I'm assuming this is just one of those 1 in 100,000 things.  Also, the first time this happened, I located the reset hole, which was very easy, but you can find it in the instruction manual if you are having trouble.  If you stick a pin in and poke around for a minute, you'll find the actual button.  you'll know because if you press it, it will feel like a button.  Other than that, its very nice.  It works beautifully with Yahoo! Music Unlimited.  The controls are easy to use, once you get used to them.  I'm not saying it's hard, its just remembering that for options, you hold down the back button.  There's nothing really to complain about, except its very hard to find video for it, not that you would want to, considering the screen size.  Unlike iPods, it's easy to remove fingerprints and it doesn't scratch easily(but I still put it in the case just to be sure).  If I had the choice, I would definately pick this over an iPod.  My friend bought an iPod and now he is seething with jealousy.  DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE HE DID!  DON'T PICK THE LOSER COMPANY, PICK CREATIVE!

<Title>Good product as a first MP3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this product online as my first MP3 player after reading the high reviews from CNET and Consumer's Digest. I'm not one to follow the trend of buying the Ipod or Zune because of their popularity I prefer getting the best product for the best price, and I have no regrets. However a few months of having it, I had to upgrade it for the new Zune because it couldn't hold all my music, plus at the time I purchased it, the wall charger was not available so  I could only recharge it through my computer's ethernet port. Overall a good MP3 player, I would highly recommend it for preteens...

<Content>I would like to be able to write a review on the MP3 player but I've never been able to install it on my computer.  I have contacted Creative Customer Service email at least 4 times - spoke to a representative on the phone once - sent the unit back to Creative for their examination and received a new (or rebuilt) unit that I'm still not able to install on my computer.  I continue to get error messages when I try to install it.  Unfortunately, I bought the player from Amazon so Creative cannot give me a refund and Amazon requires it to be returned in its original packaging (of course the original packaging is a sealed plastic container that you have to open with a knife or scissors). I'm not sure if the Creative ZEN V Plus MP3 player is good or not since I've never been able to install it.

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8890105-0823027">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Title>No better or worse than iPod Nano
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this instead of a Nano because it was a little cheaper and because I wanted to see if iPods were all hype or if they did make a superior product. I think that the click-wheel interface on the iPods is easier to use. I like the software on the Zen a bit better (it's easier to change between shuffle, repeat, etc, and the main menu is somewhat customizable). The shape of the Zen is also a bit better than the Nano for running (when I primarily use it).  All in all, if I had it to do over again I'd probably look at the price difference between this and the Nano and go by price, because features alone don't make this much better than an iPod.

<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned about 10 different MP3 players over the years, and have sent a fair number of them to an early grave due to exercise-related stresses (meaning impact, repetitive-motion-injury, or water/sweat damage). I've had the new Zen V for a few months now, and it seems to be the best bet so far based on small size / light weight, solid state memory rather than hard drive, excellent sound quality, and some of the most exercise-friendly controls I've seen. The battery life isn't stellar, but given the size of the unti it's better than you might expect. If you are OK with the 2/4 GB storage capacity, I would recommend this player without reservation.

<Title>Well designed and easy to use
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player mainly for workouts and to play music through my old car radio/cassette player. It suits this purpose exceedingly well. I found the joystick/button system of selecting music and functions very intuitive, and the color screen is very effective and appealing. Another great feature for my use is the ability to record directly from an analog player, such as a boombox; this allows me to digitize my old cassette tapes very easily with respectable sound quality. The player sound quality itself is excellent with the provided earphones and can be nicely tweaked with the built-in equalizer.     As for weaknesses, I find the 2GB memory to be a bit limiting.....8GB would have been a better capacity for the way I use music. Other quibbles are the lack of a stand-alone charger, which requires me to run my computer for long periods to charge the player, and the lack of a secure holder for using the player when engaged in exercise, yardwork, etc.. Sure, these can be purchased as accessories, but they are rarely discounted and are way overpriced.

There are now 4 GB models available with twice the storage capacity of this model.   This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.   Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NPR's website, or NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Content>I have only 2 gripes about this product: 1. battery life.  I use the "smart volume" feature which apparently will drain the battery twice as fast.  I currently get about 6hours of playtime before recharge. 2.  Having to use a USB plug to charge it.  I recently purchased via EBAY a wall charger but it didn't work at all.  I see that Creative Labs has one but it's not available yet. Other than these 2 things I really like this player.  I didn't even try the earbuds that came with it.  I already had a new set of Shure EQC's to use.

<Title>Don't Buy This!
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!     I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs.   This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.  Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player?

<Product Name>Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Green)
<Title>Very Impressive
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have never owned an iPod and I doubt I'll ever consider buying one. I did own a few other MP3 players over the years, including two Creative MuVo devices (both died within a month of use) and an ancient Creative Nomad Jukebox (which is still surprisingly functional).  As to my needs, my music collection is by no means extensive or large, consisting of about 400 songs at the most; I'm currently subscribed to a dozen or so podcasts that are updated weekly; I not a big fan of audio books, although I purchase about one every month to listen to during slow working hours or long walks; and I have no interest in carrying around photos, videos, or contact information on my MP3 players.  With all that in mind, the Zen V is a perfect fit. It is by far the best MP3 player I have owned. Construction wise, it feels rugged and so far has withstood repeated drops to the floor and getting soaked with sweat during my workouts.  You have to see it for yourself to realize how lightweight and how compact the Zen V really is. Just to give you an idea, so far my biggest complaint about its size is the fact that it has made me acutely aware of the inconvenience of carrying earphones around, the size of which was negligible with other players I have owned.  I have found Zen V's navigation system to be very usable, although it took me a while to get the hang of it. Most of the buttons are overloaded, in the sense that they perform different functions depending on the current navigation menu and whether they are pressed briefly or held down for a few seconds.   The screen is very small, but it does a good job of displaying track information and album art. I doubt it would be as effective in displaying pictures, but so far I haven't used that feature and I'm not likely to do so.  The earphones that come with it are absolute rubbish in my opinion, but I had a trusty pair from a previous purchase. So that wasn't much of a problem.  I found the bundled software to be mediocre, but after a few days I found that I didn't need it at all. Windows Media Player 11 is able to sync with this device, uploading all supported media files and album info (including album art), and even down converting the qaulity of uploaded music files to have them all fit into the player's memory. I was used to using my MP3 players as flash disks, simply dragging and dropping files to them as I would with any USB drive. However, I was so impressed with Window Media Player 11 functionality and strong integration features that I now use it exclusively to manage my music collection and the Zen V.  As to podcasting, I use Juice podcasting software and Windows Media Player 11 auto playlists feature. It is by no means as good as iTunes' built in podcasting features, but it is a fully automated solution that works well for me.  As to auido books, I purchase those from Audible, and the AudibleManager software is able to upload files directly to the Zen V without using any third-party software. The Zen V is able to play large files (eight hours long is the biggest I have tried so far), and the bookmarks feature is indispensable for audio books.  The biggest problem so far has been the lack of accessories. I can't find a decent pair of speakers that would double as a charging station. Creative offers a universal charging adaptor that is supposed to work with the Zen V, and they also offer a few generic speaker systems as well. But nothing nearly as aesthetically pleasing as one would find for the iPod in its many incarnations.  Even with all of those caveats, I'm still a very satisfied customer, and I believe anyone with similarly modest needs will find the Zen V to be very satisfactory.

<Content>I looked at every device out there. I wanted my music, video and FM radio in that order. Size and weight were the most important issues for form factor. The screen for video is small but is actually quite sharp and it's very easy to use but the big thing is I can, and do, take it everywhere and don't notice it. I can even put it in my jeans watch pocket or running pants or just hang it around my neck. This thing is awesome, I'm a huge fan of this device and I've had it for several months now, no complaints.

<Title>best mp3 player for the money,
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Is sound quality important? This mp3 player, like all Creative Zen's,  has the best sound quatlity available, easily equal to or better than the ipod or zune.  The big debate in my circle is ipod, zen, or zune. Ipod is not in sync with some of the major subscription music services and has proprietary idiosyncracies. The Zune and Zen are multifaceted interconnects for all subscription services.  I choose the Zen because of the sound quality and ease of use/interface. The next comparable unit is a zune at over $149. I do not need portable music with more than 2 gigs.  I love classical music with full orchestra, Russian composers, especially violin concertos...so I can't tolerate poor sound. In addition, I listen to foreign language music and audio books and there has to be clarity! Now for the complaints that this  shuts down...if you read the directions that install on your computer you will see that this is an ENERGY SAVING feature. Your player is not OFF it is just that to keep the screen on after pulling off the usb port (where you charge and download music) you have to tap the little bar to the left to turn your screen on. All of this is covered in the product information guide. Any person with basic computer literacy, a USB port vs 2, and windows XP or better will have  a ball with this zen. If you have never used either yahoo jukebox with  yahoo music, or windows media player before, do yourself a favor and get familiar while you wait for yourn MP3 player to arrive. You need to know how to download, creat a playlist, and understand rip, sync, and such. But if you don't download, this little MP3 player is the best FM radio player ever. I have 32 channels on my presets. It is the best radio I own outside of my FM tuner. Over all, the best short of a zune. Very intuitive interface, and it has, gasp, a very useful back button.

<Content>I bought two of these for Christmas, and one would not charge at all, so I had to send it back. Looking at the various discussion boards, this seems to be a common problem. The other one charges OK, but only on the computer. It doesn't like the cheap USB charger I bought, even though my iPod works fine with it. This product has a lot of great features, and I hope that we get to enjoy them without any further problems. I would recommend charging this product before giving it to someone as a gift. Then, if it doesn't charge, you can send it back before disappointing someone.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player, purchased primarily to use to listen to audiobooks in the car.  Easy to download books to and organize.  Bookmark feature also easy to use and an absolute must with audiobooks.  I like how you can customize menus so the features you need are easy to access without scrolling through multiple menus.  I've loaded music on too, and used it with earbuds.  My only complaint is that the earbuds are pretty uncomfortable.  Sound is good.  Definitely get the car/AC charger kit to go with it.  I've had to reset it a couple of times (4-5 times over 3 months) but then works just fine - have not had the freezing/reset issues that some others have had.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase.

<Title>Do Not Buy
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the first time I have been inspired to write a review for any product. I bought a Creative Zen V Plus for my wife as a gift on our wedding day.  It was about the biggest waste of $102.00 ever. The player constantly freezes.  We've sent it back once to be replaced (and of course, that took 8 a solid weeks). Since we got it back, it has frozen three more times. Twice we were able to let the battery run down and it would turn on again after charging, but once we had to reset the whole player and reload all the music onto the player again.    Overall, the product is a waste of money and time.  Buy whatever kind of mp3 player you want, but I would not waste my money on this product.

<Content>I bought this about 4 months ago, and it no longer works. I liked it for ease of use and sound quality.  It had to be reset frequently, and after the last reset it remained frozen, and then, just died. I checked and the warranty for labor is good for only 90 days.  I've  lost the receipt, but since the labor warranty is only for 90 days I doubt it would be worth fixing. I replaced a Creative Zen Touch with this. I had the Touch for three  trouble-free years.  This is much smaller and much poorer quality. If you buy it, save the receipt because you'll need it.

<Title>software is aweful - not loud enough
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I have many mp3 players including ipods... I gave this one a spin... I liked the weight and screen but did not like the cheap plastic feel plus the on button on the side is a pain - I should just have to hold play to kick start it on in my opinion.  The windows software to put music on this device is god awful ! Sometimes when I check playlists and go back to the zen no songs will show on the screen and I have to quit and reload. Creative puts too much 'junk' on when loading the software. How about a itunes plug in or music match plugin instead - why do they need to re invent the wheel and then do a terrible job doing it.  I could not get the os x xjmb software to work at all ... so if your gonna hook it to a mac good luck.  When hooking to my car stereo aux in port I noticed the zen could not get as loud as any ipods I use. I did turn off volume limit so I had it maxxed out.  I would stick with the nano over this even though it has a great price point.  It is super light so if weight is important consider it.. it weighs next to nothing.

<Title>Not Ready for Prime Time?
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I bought the 2 GB model because at the time it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs.    This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.   I gave this 2 GB model only 4 stars because there's a glitch described below causing it to go comatose after being disconnected from power. Sometimes it will freeze up at random times as well, requiring reset with a sharp pin.  Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NPR's website, or NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Title>Line in recording is great for saving cassette tracks
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player for my wife for Christmas and we love it so far.  The feature that sealed the deal for me was the line in recording and it works great.  I have a small library of cassette tape sets of self-help and financial gurus (Nightingale, Gerber, etc.).  I know that recording/digitizing these tracks through my PC's sound card is possible, but the Zen is a very simple alternative.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that it requires the Zen software to be installed on the PC to browse the contents.  This is probably because the unit is capable of synchronizing Outlook contacts.  Same thing with my Axim PDA.  Not a big deal at all though.  Sounds good, sized and priced right. Highly recommended.

<Content>I use my Zen for music and for listening to audio books I download from the libary. I also like the Line In feature which is great for converting old tapes to digital format. You play an audio book from a tape player and use the Line In cable to convert it. Works great.  Here's a nice trick for removing Windows DRM protection from audio files. Play them on your computer and record them immediately to disk by using a $4 cable from RadioShack to connect the microphone jack to the headphone jack on your computer.  Bingo, you've got an mp3 file.  Then just copy it to your Zen player.  The Zen V Plus stores photos and acts as a voice recorder.  I especially like the BOOKMARK feature.  You can set up to 10 bookmarks - this is important for listening to audio books and long podcasts. 2GB is plenty of storage space for several audio books and enough for 1000 songs.   The sound quality is great on the Zen V Plus and the menus are easy to navigate.  This is a nice player and you really can't go wrong. It's a bit thicker than an Ipod but shorter. Nice feel to it.

<Title>Fun and Functional, but...
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the features and interface. I wasn't happy about the number of new software programs put on my computer and I didn't know what they were until it was finished.   However, I had it less than 24 hours when the joystick broke. Honestly, it seems almost too light and flimsy to last very long. My camera has a joystick about the same size that is much more robust and has worked for almost 2 years. I'm getting the MP3 player replaced, but... that doesn't help when the joystick is still apparently quite flimsy.

<Title>Feelin' the love
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 2g for myself and the 4g for my daughter.  We love them.    The Zen V Plus plays the protected music files (something we needed), it holds pictures (great fun!), plays videos (haven't used that feature yet), and plays Audible books (a must have for us).    The software application for getting files onto the player is easy to use (we don't need no stinkin' directions!)    The size is ideal (not so big to be bulky, not so small that it's easy to lose).  The sound is wonderful!    It was a contest between this and the Ipod.  Based on the size, sturdiness, and ability to play protected files and not having to rely on Itunes made this the winner.  And I am extremely happy with the reality of this player.

<Title>great

<Content>My daughter wanted an IPod for Christmas.  I just could not justify the cost.  Of course she wanted the blue one which is only available in the 4 gig model.  I bought her the 2 gig Zen because I liked the added feature of an FM radio and the cost.  I signed up for an Amazon card and got another $30 off.  She was disappointed at first but now that she sees she can use the free 30 days of Napster to go and download unlimited songs she is very happy with it.  The drop and drag is so easy to use.  Now her friends with the IPods are jealous because they have to pay per song.  The one negative is the earbuds, they were too big and did not stay in her ears, I even tried it and found they were uncomfortable.  We have ordered some gel earbuds and hope that will solve the problem.  The sound is great and I love the photo feature!!  I wish it could also play games.

<Title>Unbeatable Choice
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Tons of features even if you don't listen to music.  The music is crisp, clear and can get loud.  The video screen has unbeatable resolution.  You can subscribe to any music service.  Works excellent with Window Media player, the Creative software will be needed for more detailed editing of play lists.  For less than 140 (2 gig) model I don't see this being beat.

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and I have not been disappointed.  She uses it constantly and loves it!  I am the one who puts the music on it for her and have not had any problem with this.  The player comes with software to effectively and easily organize, add, and create playlists.  My daughter had no trouble learning to use the player.  About five minutes of instruction from me and she was on her way to learning the rest on her own.  The player has great sound and is especially great for little fingers because of the small joystick operation.  The picture and video quality on this player is fantastic as well.  I have about 250 songs on her player already and there is still tons of memory space left.  Excellent all around!  I would recommend the following accessories: colorful skin to both protect and jazz up your player, a DC charger for times when you can't charge using the USB on your computer, and a carrying case as the one supplied with the player is a small bag and is difficult to get everythig into.  Don't hesitate to buy!
