<Title>mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this product is my first mp3 player and i'd have to say that over all im pretty content. getting started with it was pretty hard. it was confusing on how exactly to get the files i downloaded onto my mp3 player. after a few hours i finally got it. and then it was stuck on the &amp;amp;quot;music&amp;amp;quot; screen and then it would just shut off. eventually it worked (dont ask me how).   i would also have to say that the keypad is pretty difficult to control. the slighest touch will hit the other button. also, there is NO off button. so yeah...idk if you are really good with electronics then i'd say this is a great product,i thought i was until now... good luck

<Title>Yall READ the directions!
<Date>Tue Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am frustrated with the other reviewers, because, my gosh, the software has the manual right on your computer, and it the files can be dragged and dropped (it took us 4 minutes to use all 256MB) and it even tells you how to turn it off!! (UGH!)   The sound is really, really good. And, we got some good deals on SD cards, and you can just pop one out and put another in!   Like having hours of music on teeny tiny cds! Fun stuff.

<Title>Just One annoying problem.
<Date>Fri Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have read the online manual, but I am still having problems deleting files from one of the drives.  The files keeps reappearing after I have erased the files.  In addition, after deleting it from the player, once played back, it reappears again.  Any suggestions out there.  Otherwise, there are no other problems and the sound is wonderful!

<Title>really cool, but one slight problem....
<Date>Tue Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item and started downloading all my music, but the only problem is, it will not let me download music to the memory card! I filled the internal memory with music, but can't get anything else to load. Any suggestions??  Otherwise, I LOVE this player. Sounds really great, and I can even use it in the car. Much better than hunting for CD's!

<Title>Don't waste your money
<Date>Thu Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I wasted 5 hours of my time today on endless help-line holds, downloading patches and drivers from Philips, and working fruitlessly with their support staff who could not bring this not-ready-for-primetime device to life.  It gets returned tomorrow.  Don't waste your time.

<Title>SD card problems, transferring
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i read all the reviews on this page before i bought the mp3 player. well, i didn't see to many bad reviews so i bought it-big mistake! i have had two problems with this device. one, when i store songs on it it still does not recognize them. i went through my browser and opened the 2 mass storage devices to see if they were actually empty. all of the songs i downloaded to the mp3 player were listed-and yes they were all in mp3 file format. then a few days later it magically recognized them and started playing. now it has returned to its original non functioning state. when i turn it on it says, NO FILES! another problem i had with the device was with the SD card. i called Philips and they told me they just discovered in some units the SANDISK card does not work. well i guess i am just lucky! when i save songs to my sd card drive everything shuts off now. when i try and play only songs from my card only option, the mp3 player shuts off! so, buy it at your own risk, believe me i know how to read the instructions and even when i called Philips they acknowledged there are some problems. so i do not recommend that anybody buy this mp3 player.

<Title>Easy file transfer for SD cards
<Date>Sun Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found out that the best way to tranfer files into a SD card it's using a SD card reader and writer,I use them with this MP# player that I just bought and also to transfer media and files I use in my Pocket PC, they use USB connections to transfer files, they come with different input slots for the different types of cards (SD, CF,MMC,etc) you put the card in the reader and then you can access it just like a removable hard drive and tranfer files as simple as copy and paste, they are a lot of them offered out there, you just have to know which USB port you have on your computer (USB 1.1 or 2.0) to be compatible, this way you wont have to worry about using your device to import mp3 files into the SD card. Also they are very unexpensive, average starting usd12.00. I hope this info could help someone.

<Title>Simple to use, works like they say
<Date>Mon Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Purchased for use @ healthclub. Upgraded the drivers and works like a charm. Allows me to download unlike other users and plays exactly the songs I want. If people actually READ instructions, bad reviews on good products would not happen. I have used several other brand SD cards w/o issue as well.  My only problem is switching songs because I have big fingers, but simply reprogramming my card to delete the songs I dont want works for me. Battery life is amazing. Its on week 3 with one simple AAA. We are purchasing a second one for my husbands use. The SOUND IS incredible! Comes with software you dont need as well but are nice to have. Just drag and drop songs onto memory card!
