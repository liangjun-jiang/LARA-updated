<Title>Poor quality and poor support
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am doing Underwater Photography and wanted to have an 'off-camera' storage+viewer; this product was cheaper than the 'professional ones' so I bought it.  Good things: 1. Plays almost any video format (including DivX) 2. Good size product - pretty small. BAD THINGS: 1. Product works ONLY with CF Type I (thin) cards; CF Type II are too 'thick'  for it. 2. Little 'joystick' that is used for majority of operations works very strangely. Having a Computer Science background, it took me a while to figure out how to work the device. Overall UI is OK, but... 3. No support to RAW format (honestly, did not expect it) 4. Takes FOREVER to load large images (at times you think it is hung). 5. Does not play some MPEG-4 (very few of them do). REAL BAD THING(S): I could not get the Video/Audio output to work! ANYTHING I TRIED - could not get the image/sound on TV. Not too much about it in the manual.  I called support - ABSOLUTELY NO ATTEMPT FROM COBY's side to help. Basically 'send us the unit; we will send you another one in a few month' - totally unacceptable!!! OVERALL: RETURNED THE PRODUCT - VERY POOR QUALITY!
