<Title>Creative Support Sucks
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one of these, and i am on my 3rd time trying to get it fixed. the hard drive has issues. first one locked up completely no warning. the replacement, stopped playing, then the replacement for the replacement right out of the box from creative wouldn't even power up and i can't even get them to send me a replacement for the one that was bad that they sent to me.  on a good note. i can say that once u figure out how the software works it is a very good player to have. lots of songs held, but when it crashes better have backups cause u r going to lose everything.

<Title>I would give it 10 stars if given the option
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Creative products is by all means the best i've ever experienced. I could be a spokesman for them if given the chance, lol. The Nomad is very easy to navigate at your thuumbs disgresion. I love the fact that it's compatable with all media programs. WMP, MusicMatch. But the best to organize and sinc music is real player. If you don't want to spend a lot of money and want quality over looks then this is the product for you. the only bad thing about this wonderful gadget is the charger port. I couln't stress this enough; you have to be very careful in handeling the charger. because of the type of por it is after prolonged use of continued charging the port will come loose. It doesn't have a docking station which would help eliminate charging it through the little port. If you are going to invest in this product I would try getting an extended warrantee with it. Other than this, everything about it is awsome especially the ease of creating a playlist. I no longer have it because again the port broke off after a while. I bought a crative vision m for my wife. I only have 3 words for it. Ipod killa, ok that's 2 words but i made my point, lol.

<Title>Fragile software & physically.  Customer service is a plague.
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought it for the raved-over sound ("better than iPod"), but came to regret it...  Owned a 20 Gb Zen.  Customer service will not even accept your call without a credit card number up front, after 90 days.  Their website suggests firmware updates for any/all funky behavior.  But this locks up the unit permanently.  Can play it; just never again can add songs to it, or alter existing playlists.  Creative knows this problem and will not fix it.  Foolishly, I then bought their 60 Gb (same model as the 40 Gb here; just more memory).  Worked a couple months, then froze up unrecoverably.  Several weeks of wading through an amazingly unavailable, incompetent and utterly unconcerned "customer service", I got the same player back, utterly untouched; totally dead.  Several more weeks slogging through the same hours on automated call centers, waiting to talk to a human who doesn't even listen to you describe your need, and is aggresively incompetent, then weeks waiting for them to repair and resend a refurb, ...  and it is a totally nonworking and dented refurb.  More weeks and the same exacted dented refurb is sent to me again, utterly unworking.  MANY more weeks and I finally receive a refurb that works.  Total time wrestling with this utter incompetence: 7 months ! ! !   Though this all started within the initial paltry 90-day warrantee, this quickly dragged on beyond it, and I had to buy the rather expensive 1-year extended warrantee early in that fiasco just to be able to get them to accept my phone calls at all.  Now I have a player that gives that great Zen sound (true enough), but can't take even the slightest justling.  They aren't kidding when they say "don't wear it even walking."  It resets nearly every step.  That is utterly no exaggeration.  I found wearing it in a just the right "fanny pack" allows me to wear it lifting weights, provided I make no sudden moves. But clip in to my short's waist band, and it reset every 10-30 seconds.  Not fun.  Many reviewer gush over the "awesome" software.  It's o-kay.  But it lacks some obvious capabilities.  Like their own file manager cannot move files between folders without Zen losing track of them: they still show in your library, but clicking on them finds nothing and so Zen goes at random to another song.  You have to re-"import" every song moved this way.  A major pain in the but, if you move a large library to an external hard drive.  Also, you can't sort your on-screen display in a playlist by any of the columns (like song title, album, artist, year, style, rating. etc.).  Makes for a lot of manual searching.  Slow and boring.  Also, there is no way at all to keep track of which playlists you have added a song to, except to manually scroll through every playlist and manually look for each track among all the tracks in that list.  Would it be so hard to have a feature that shows what playlists any given track has been added to?  What I am holding out for, is a flash memory player with at least 16 Gb.  Sony recently came out with an 8 Gb.  These are extremely robust versus jostling.  But I need at least 16 Gb, if not 30-60, for my library.  And I didn't buy a high end MP3 player to compress all that CD quality sound down to some crappy little file size.  When one of the big boys finally make a real player, I will pay whatever they want for it.

<Title>"doesn't care less" after sales service + faulty equipment = disaster
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm just trying to be concise and objective, because I can't believe i got screwed twice with Creative. Bottomline is: - their product are priced lower than competition (price/ Mb is attractive), they seem decent with no shiny options, like the kind of equipment you want for your buck. - their product are fragile and faulty. And it's not this particular one (with movable hard disk parts), I own another Creative Muvo c100, and they are reboot with no reason, or freeze. - their software is so painful to master, with little tricks to make it work if you spend litterally hours on it... - and the worse is... their after sales service. People, trust me on this, your Creative piece of equipment will break, other 3 guys (out of 3)in the Office had issues with their Creative: battery, software incompatibility with other softs, movable pieces, cheap buttons, plastic box, screen... Their equipment looks cheap because it is cheap. No other reason. They could compensate this drawback with a good customer service, but I guess they don't have the bucks to serve the US market correctly. The Reps I talked to are decent guys, but they have no policy, no means to do anything. It looks like you talk to a Postal service chief in the 1950's eastearn Europe. in my case, after giving 15bucks for premier postal service, $25 bucks for Creative to look at my Jukebox, they requested 118-143 bucks (depending on the rep i talk to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) to repair their faulty stuff. In order to get that information, it took 20 days, around 30 emails, 3 phone calls over one hour. This is pathetic. Think twice before you want to spare some 50 bucks over an Iriver or other decent mp3 players.

<Title>Newest Firmware Upgrade Destroys Player
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's that simple. The newest firmware upgrade for this player halts mid-install, not completely installing. The player will not start, Windows will recognize the player, but because there is not a complete set of firmware on the player, Creative's own software will not recognize it (thus not allowing me to run another firmware upgrade on the player). Do not buy this product.  By the way, I'm not alone with my complaint. The creative forums are plagued with complaints of this.

<Title>A Reliable Product from a stellar company
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To begin with, I really do not recommend that anyone buy this product now (unless you can get it really cheap) because there have been so many advances since this came out.  I have had mine for almost two years with absolutely no problems.  I love this player.  Around the time I bought it I could get the most memory for it for the lowest price.  Yeah it was bigger and not as sleek, but it was definitely the right decision.  In general I feel that Creative as a company is superior.  All their products are well priced and of high quality.  So if you are going to buy an MP3 player go with Creative over Apple.  The Zen Vision M is cheaper and better overall.  Just go to c/net to look at the reviews.  While the 5th gen iPod scored slightly higher (.3 of a point)on the site review, the user satisfactory rating for the Zen Vision M was nearly 2 points higher.  Take your advice from the owners.  Creative does not disappoint.  And while Apple may be the giant, I feel that unless you want to conform to society go ahead, but Creative provides unique and better choices.

<Title>Dead after 1 year 5 months
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife & I bought two of these for Christmas in 2005 and loved them (our first MP3 players). Mine died 5-28-07 (5 mos out of warranty) and Creative's attitude is "so sorry, too bad, pay us for service, including online support or just fix it yourself." Read the postings on the Creative forum before you buy ANY of their products - CAVEAT EMPTOR. They have posted a firmware "upgrade" that frequently destroys the player. Woe be to the owner who hasn't  backed up his ripped files. I have, and am shopping for another player, but it won't be made by Creative, I guarantee. We still own 2 Zen MicroPhotos (8 GB) and her Zen Xtra still works, who knows for how long? BTW, Creative's software is junk; you would be much better served to buy Notmad Explorer.

<Title>Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Please Don't buy this product unless you plan on working pro bono as a tech for yourself on behalf of creative. The Player will eventually freeze up and attempts to fix officially using creative updated "play for sure" firmware software will "destroy your player for sure". Simple. I just wish i had read a little about this before attempting to upgrade the software and i might have salvaged what little was left of the player. The good reviews are simply from people who just haven't heard trouble with their products, It's not a question of if but when. You've been warned.

<Title>The Worst Technical Support Ever
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Zen Touch 40 GB MP3 player a year and a half ago. When it was working, it was relatively easy to use although the touch pad took some getting used to. The problem started when I decided to upgrade the firmware from their website a few weeks ago. As soon as the firmware upgrade was completed, my player died and I have been unable to revive it. When I e-mailed technical support I was told that since it was out of warranty, they could not help me either on the phone or even by e-mail unless I paid $19.00 an hour. When I explained that the problem did not start until I loaded THEIR FIRMWARE FROM THEIR WEBSITE, and that they should bear some responsibility and help me, they continued to insist that since the player was out of warranty, they could not provide technical support unless I pay.   My advice is if you buy Creative's products, sign up for a warranty, or never ever ever upgrade the firmware. Personally, I will never ever ever buy any Creative product again.

<Title>worried about the headphone jack problem?
<Date>Fri Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>According to nomadness.net, Creative Labs fixed the problem (that being, of course, the faulty headphone jack) -- shipments of new, corrected Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra players have been in stores for a little over a month now.  There are two ways to tell if you have the fixed Zen version.  #1. If the package you bought it in was heat-sealed, then you have the correct version. Heat-sealed means that it takes a lot of manpower plus knives/scissors to open up the package. The plastic is literally sealed together, not just glued together like with the old version. (You may want to pick this up at a real store instead of amazon.com, because you'll be able to see the package for yourself before buying. That is unless Amazon can confirm details about the package.)  #2. If the carry case for the Zen has a hole for the display. The older faulty version does not have this case, as you can tell from some negative reviews. So, if you put the case on the Zen and can see the display, there's a good chance you have the fixed version.  Hope this helps some of you.

<Title>Nice upgrades from 3 months ago
<Date>Wed Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a 40GB Zen Jukebox only 3 months ago after filling my 20GB and giving it to a friend.  Unfortunately, I recently lost it on a bus and felt lost, disconnected without my constant music library.    When I researched my new purchase, I was pleased to see not only a lower price but also a couple of upgrades from just a few months ago.  Notably, two of my problems about my last Zen were fixed:   1. Headphone jack was loose, causing sound problems with certain speakers/headphones.  Seems to me the included headphones sound better than the last ones, even though I prefer to use higher quality headphones.  2. the case now has with a view window, like the 20GB did (why they built the last 40GB version without a view window is beyond me).  This enhancement sounds minor, but it makes the difference between using the protective case or not.  With the pop-off front casing, the case is a requirement -- but without the view window, you have to take the case off to see what you're doing.  If you already have a unit without the view window, I'd recommend contacting Nomad to either purchase the new case or hopefully get it for free.  I LOVE this product.  Reloading my entire 5000 song library was a snap, running the process overnight and waking up with the entire library restored!  I love that I can use my WMA, MP3 and WAV format files and transfer between work and home computers.  Back to happy!

<Title>Very good value
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had mine since February 2004.  I chose it after a lot of research and based the decision on price/value and sound quality.  I held off reviewing it since I heard they were fragile and I wanted to see if it would hold up.  It has, with no problems.  (I broke the belt clip, but Creative sent me a replacement for $10.)  It's probably not something you want to take jogging with you, or drop onto a hard floor, but if you're reasonably careful it's not going to just disintegrate in your hands.  It works great and sounds great (with decent headphones, not the buds they give you with the player), and nearly my entire music collection fits in half the available drive space.  The battery life estimate is a little high for me, probably since I have a lot of higher bit rate files (160 Mb/S wmv's and 192 Mb/S mp3's).  But it's still fairly realistic.  My only complaints are:  1) the horrible PC software that comes with it - if you buy this player, buy Notmad Explorer from Red Chair Software and use it instead; and 2) the black plastic rocker switch thing that you use to scroll through lists and make selections feels flimsy and cheap.  Overall, I like it and would recommend it unless you know you're going to be rough with it.  The user interface is said to be inferior to the iPod's, but this player costs about $150 less than the 40 GB iPod.  ($125 less if you take my advice and buy Notmad Explorer.)  I'd rather buy the Zen Xtra and use the savings to buy more music.

<Title>This is NOT the old 40Gig Nomad....
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I think that several reviewers are confusing this player with the last generation 40 Gig player. One reviewer pointed out the differences in the packaging and the protective case between the two earlier, and that reviewer was right on the money.  This model is shipped as described by the previous reviewer, and has the latest firmware installed. Mine is too new to give a long term report on, but it seems to be a top quality unit so far. The USB 2.0 port is awesome fast. I dowmloaded 1700 MP3 and WMV files to my Nomad this evening without a hitch, and each batch was completed before I could select the next batch. Very fast compared to the old USB standard.  The controls and layout are great. I don't know if there is a difference between new and old, but even the selector wheel has a good feel to it, and I have not had a misfire when selecting a menu item with it. I do agree that it would be nice to have an audio tone to go along with button movement, but it isn't a showstopper.   The included carry case is very well made. It will probably protect the unit from shock well enough to allow it to survive a fall. Some complained about the plastic structure, but it is built to be as light as is possible, while still maintaining a solid feel. I like it.  The software isn't the greatest by any stretch, but it does work, and I was able to transfer music and data without resorting to the manual. There are other packages available for Windows that do the job in a more intuitive manner for only a few bucks. There are also a number of free packages available online that allow you to use your Nomad on a linux system (for those of you who have grown tired of the Windows nightmare). Also keep in mind that the entire OS (firmware) of the Nomad is writable, and there are people working on their own enhanced versions as we speak.   One more note. The ipod has a problem with connecting with more than one computer. I suspect that is a built in hurdle to prevent people from sharing music, but it doesn't help those who use several computers during their work/play week. I was able to transfer song files between multiple computers with the Nomad without any problems. The latest version of the firmware (as shipped) also correctly displays track information for Russian tunes in cyrillic font. It's a small matter, but it can be important to those who enjoy Russian music.  To sum it up, the newest version of the 40Gig Nomad is light, has a great control layout, solid construction, and the headphone jack seems to be as good as any I have used. I think it's a great player, and for the price, it can't be beat. The earbuds that come with it seem to please many reviewers, but I think ALL earbuds are awfull. I have a collection of them now, and they are all junk. Even the ones offered by name brand audio companies. Buy a good set of Sony or other ear hugging phones for $20, and enjoy music in more quantity and quality than you have ever heard before.   Did I mention that the Nomad comes with Creative EAX as standard? Those of you who have an Audigy sound card in your computer know what I'm talking about. It can be used in selective fashion, and sounds just as good as the PC version. There is more than meets the eye with the Nomad. It might take awhile to master all of it's features, but you will be enjoying fine music from the very first battery charge (lots of classical music and EAX demos built in).  This is an amazing player. Even with a total of 2000 songs loaded, I can still rip a DVD movie to an ISO image at a friends house using a free prgram lke "DVD Shrink", download it to a data folder on my Nomad, and burn the disk on my PC when I get home. For that matter, the Nomad can hold several DVD ISO images at any one time.  Someone mentioned that they didn't like the fact that it wasn't weather proof. Neither is the ipod. Then again, with a one quart Zip Lock plastic bag, and a drop of glue, you can make both players beach proof in a few minutes. Just puncture the plastic bag enough to allow three inches of the plug end of your headphones inside. Seal the puncture with a drop of glue, put your Nomad or ipod in the bag, plug in the headphone jack, zip the bag, and let it rain all day.  A good set of light headphones only costs $20. A Zip Lock bag is about 10 cents. Use your imagination here. You can walk in the surf without placing your Nomad in danger.  Aside from the minor complaints about the software, the only other thing that bothers me is that the max volume should be higher. It's not bad, mind you, but it doesn't allow the head banging levels that other MP3 players deliver. This is a minor complaint, and can probably be fixed at the firmware level in the future. Meanwhile, I am happy to report that using a generic cassette adapter, or an "aux" input port on the latest car audio systems will geive you enough CD quality music to make a trip from one coast to the other and back withought being forced to listen to the same tune twice.  That's it for now. If my opinion changes because of problems with the Nomad, I will update this post in a heartbeat. Meanwhile, it gets 5 stars without hesitation...     Update... It has been Months since I wrote this review, and my Nomad is still a constant companion at work and play, It has been dropped, used, and abused. The early problem with the headphone socket must have been fixed, as my headphone jack has been ripped out of the Nomad countless times, and it still works as new. This update was posted on July 2 2005.

<Content>I had the first generation 20GB Nomad Jukebox for almost two years, then the headphone jack went out. Luckily, I purchased it at BestBuy and had the 2 year product replacement coverage. (I had seen the reviews about this fault and poor customer support from Creative) I instantly, received a voucher for the replacement and got the Zen Xtra 40GB. It has worked fine. The sound, ease of downloads, software, file management system all work good for me. The battery is good also , I usually get 10hrs playing time with a 3 hour charge. The car adapter kit works excellent, my moderate quality car audio system pumps a real nice sound with this model. Generally very satisfied.

The newer version has fixed many of the problems described in reviews, so make sure the reviews that you're reading really pertain to that player! The largest fix, among many, is the headphone jack. Though you will see a couple of negative reviews, they are for the OLD version, and those people posted on the wrong page :-)  Have a wonderful day Andrew

<Content>I have been very pleased with this product.  It comes as "advertised" with cables, instructions, ear-buds, case, charger.  The sound is excellent (with earbuds or connected to a speaker).  Operation is easy and the instructions are very helpful.  Downloading music, other mp3 audio files (books) and audio books from Audible.com work easily.  Battery life is excellent (once you charge completely two or 3 times).  It is small, easy to carry around and, tho I have been a bit paranoid about carrying it around since it is a hard drive device, it seems very sturdy.  The "scroll select" wheel works fine as do all the other buttons.   The only issue I have is with technical support.  I had some problems getting Audible Manager to recognize the device so that I could download audio books (initially-these problem has been fixed by working with the tech support from Audible.com!  They were very friendly and helpful and we got it to work).  All in all, I am very pleased with the device and glad I purchased it.

<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought mine over a year ago and I have been using it in dance parties. So far, no problems. I read several reviews complaining about the operational system. What most people do not know is that manufactures usually release several upgrades for OSs and firmware and we need to apply them. I applied all upgrades and it has been working very well.  Pros: Cost per gigabyte is away better then ipod. Sound quality is good. Fast to upload/download songs. Several options to organize the songs. Battery last long and can be hooked up straight to a power supply.  Cons: The navigation button is awkward and cheap. There are several software/firmware upgrades (don't bother to install what came on the CD, download the latest one from internet). Nomad Explorer has issues with Windows XP.

Surprised because while I knew I was going to get an mp3 player, I didn't think she would pick out one so bulky and inelegant as the zen xtra.  (She purchased it from wal-mart's online store for reasons I cannot fathom)  The large size was the first thing I noticed.  Previously I was using the slim elegance of a CD player that was the iRiver slimx (which is a wonderful cd player by all means).  The second thing I noticed was a spot on the display.  It was there out of the box, and remains there to this day, six months later.   The first thing I noticed when trying to plug the player in to charge is that when you have the casing on it, y ou cannot charge it.   I don't know whose dumb idea that was, but the dc-in hole is right under the cover strap.   The first thing I notice right now with it in front of me is that the front cover is loose at  the bottom.    The charger-cord looks more like it would be fitting for a laptop, not a hand held music player.    Don't get me wrong, the thing works fine as far as playing music goes, but it has had me in tears more than once.   Everyone talks about how wonderful usb2.0 is, but when you don't have that, file transfers take literally for ever.  It's nice when you're using the [awful] provided file manager Nomad Explorer, you can't drag and drop files to it at certain times, like when there's files on it already.  And because it refuses to allow you to use it as an external drive, you can't make a send to link in your context menu to use from your folder view.  It is supported in winamp5's portable devices section, but there's little you can do.  trying to play a file from it got me a 'device does not support remote playback' error.  Trying to transfer files with the same was just about as futile.   I took this monstrosity with me to Europe about three months ago.    The battery life was fine.  (I charged it one day after I found someone with a power converter that didn't end up blowing anything up (the girls had a lot of broken straightening irons that week) about halfway through the week and that was good enough to get home with, and home is a long ways away)  It's just as well that making playlists with this thing is so irritatingly slow.  It might be more appropriate for the 256 or 512 mb players which can only have a couple of hundred songs.  Choosing them by hand one at a time is fine in that case.  But when you have a couple of thousands of songs, well let's do math.    Adding a song manually to a playlist probably takes forty seconds.  Thirty seconds to scroll far enough to find the song, and ten seconds to add it.  forty x 2000 is 80000.  divide by sixty, 133 minutes, over two hours.  And that's assuming you know exactly which songs you're going to put on in order.  I don't know about everyone else, but I have a playlist.  I've been working on it for four years, adding things chronologically to it.  It consists of every file with sound that is playable in winamp I have ever had.   Why can't I use it?  I still don't know.  My boyfriend has told me that it's a technical limitation of the players, but I remember the iRiver slimx that I loved so well had no inhibitions about playing my playlists from data cds.  When I realized I wouldn't be able or perhaps not allowed to use my playlist of four years, a good friend by now, on this monstrous thing which contained far more space than I ever dreamed of using for music, I broke down in furious helpless tears of frustration.  It's a fine player, but dont' invest in it if you're not willing to completely change the way you view playing music.  (I dunno, maybe it doesn't play so well.  I've barely used it in the six months I've had it.  I could probably count the number of times I've used it for more than five minutes on two hands and a foot's worth of phalanges)

<Title>One Awesome player
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this used, and it has served me well. It has an excellent battery life, and is pretty durable. It is not waterproof, however. Bios isn't much to brag about, but it gets the job done. Transferring music to the player will take a long time, but probably as fast as USB 2.0 will go. Took almost an hour to transfer 15-ish gigs. Comes with a leather case and charger. The headphones that come with it aren't much to brag about. You can get better ones for $10 easy. Also speeds up and slows down your music too. Definitely worth the money for it. Ipods are nothing compared to this.

<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this 40GB Creative player in October 2004.  The player itself has worked flawlessly.  It survived Iraq without a single issue.  As other reviews have stated, the software bundle is not the best. However, I do like that Nomad explorer works hand in hand with Windows explorer (to drag and drop files).  Compared to an ipod it is a bit "bulky", but remember this particular player has been around over 2 years and is considerably cheaper.  This is an excellent player that I definately recommend.

<Content>I have had this mp3 player for less than a year and twice I have had to send it back for "hardware problems".  Creative is great about sending back a completely new one in record time, so that is definitely a plus, but I would rather have an mp3 player that doesn't break down on me every few months.  When it is working, it works great and the storage capacity is awesome (especially for the price!). I would recommend this mp3 player for those who don't mind having to send it back every few months for repairs.

<Content>The creative labs Zen Xtra 40gb, 30gb and 60gb have a known issue with their latest version of firmware.  During the download of the firmware your PC will freeze.  You will need to reboot.  Once you reboot, your Zen Xtra will never come back on again.  The support staff at creative can not or will not fix this issue.  Posts on their support forums go back over 1 yr.  No official statement has been released and no work around has been issued.  The customer support tells you to mail the device bak to them with a $27 fee foe evaluating the issue.  Eventually, usually at least 1 month, you will be sent a refurbished device with the exact same issue.  After several attempts you will probably find one that works, just be sure not to do any more firmware.  I have not been so lucky.  I now have a 40gb paper weight!!

<Content>I have had the pleasure of this 40G Zen Jukebox as my companion for some time now and I will tell you that I have been, and still am, extremely pleased by its performance.  I travel often to Europe and have listened to it (with noise cancelling headphones on planes & ear buds while on the ground) and have yet to experience any problems or difficulties with it.   Downloading is a cinch with the accompanying software, maneuvering through the selections is easy, battery life still is great, ease of use is simple.  The learning curve is quick. The only problem I can mention is that I had also paid for the 3 year extended warranty and have yet to use it.  Not a serious problem, eh? I have turned many of my friends and family onto the Creative line and they, like me, are extremely pleased that they stayed away from Ipods (several friends have I-Pods and 4 out of the 5 of them are not pleased, are jealous somewhat of us Creative owners). Since then, I have purchased a Creative Zen Vision:M (6 months), also extremely satisfied.  I have also just ordered a Creative Vision:W 30G for my video downloads and am expecting a similar level of satisfaction.  I will be using on my next flight to Europe in October, will let you know how satisfied I am with the "W". Hopefully this will be helpful to you.

<Title>So far, an A+ player
<Date>Thu Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I decided on this player for a few reasons. The first was the size of the hard drive- I know a lot of people say "40 gigs is just too much. You'll never use it all." I have literally thousands of CDs, and I like to encode at higher bitrates (usually 160kbps). The second was the price- at the time I bought it, it was only 200 bucks with the rebate and everything here. That beats the stuffing out of anybody. Apple has nothing on this product- not only that, I'm much less likely to get myself punked or mugged wearing this product. Now, you may be looking at the reviews below this one thinking that you might not want to take the chance of a broken headphone jack or whatever- this is, as others have said, the newer model. It has the window and is not affected by the headphone jack problem.   My only gripe with this thing is the little scroller thing- it really isn't that easy to use. You'll get used to it; it's just that it could have been implemented better in the first place. It's also kind of hard to use this thing in one hand, which is why I just stick it in my pocket.   After receiving it, I noticed it's also quite light- it's a bit larger than the Dell DJ or the iPod, but it is lighter than the Dell.   Update: Three full years later, this thing is working just fine. I have, however, had to repair the headphone jack. I don't think the problem was as bad with this model as it was with the previous one, but I use a pair of Grado SR-60s with this, and they have a heavy cord and a large jack. That definitely wore it through... but I'm more careful with it now, and it's still a good player. And it's nice to laugh at what I thought was a "high" bitrate in 2004 :)

<Title>A lot of bang for the buck!
<Date>Wed Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Okay, here's my take on the 40GB Zen Nomad.  I tried them all.  None of them are perfect.  There are little annoyances in every MP3 player.  But as far as size, ease of use, storage, durability, compatability, the Zen Nomad is the best hands down.  It does everything well, stores upwards of 700-800 CDs (I have a few thousand in my collection), has great battery life.  I read about folks having trouble with the scroller.  Well, every MP3 player I've ever used has a difficult scroller.  But the problem isn't the scroller, it's us!  We want to scroll at a gazillion miles an hour!  So in order to get it to scroll that fast, it's going to be a little unruly to manuever.  That's the physics with speed.  Like with cars.  The faster you go, the harder it is to control.  So, that being said, it's a great unit, and I tested them all.  My only complaint is that I would like more volume.  But powered headphones help with that.  Oh, and one other thing.  The headphones or earbuds that come with every player suck.  You have to buy new ones no matter which player you buy.  So you can't judge the player by the headphones or earbuds.  So once again the Zen Nomad comes out on top.  If you want an MP3 player that meets every one of your criteria perfectly, build your own.  If you accept that every player will have some minor feature not to your liking, then get the Zen Nomad.  No other player can touch it as far as features, quality and price.

<Title>This is the best! Trust me, I shopped around.
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I spent a couple of weeks agonizing over which hard-drive player to buy. But eventually, the same arguments that have kept me from buying other Apple products have surfaced here. Apple users may claim it is unfair living in a PC world, but Apple is just as much to blame for failing to be compatible. To my knowledge, the iPod is the only player that does not support the Windows Media file format, which is slightly superior to MP3.  The Zen Extra does.  You might not think that the difference in compression is much, but with a hard drive this big, it translates into being able to hold a lot more songs with the Zen Extra. Score 1. The 40 gig iPod is $400, and suspiciously there is no variation in this price no matter where you look. I got the 40 gig Zen Extra on NewEgg for $230, and it's about the same on Amazon, and yes the price varies, so you can believe that actual competition is working in the consumers advantage. Strictly controlling what retailers sell your product for is very, very bad, Apple. Score 2. As near as I can figure, at least $100 of the price difference is style points; that's 25% of the total price, which is always the problem with Apple products.  The Zen Extra looks just as nice, but maybe is slightly less cool. Well, so am I, so score 3.  The Zen Extra also has an easily removeable battery, which is not a standard feature on other players. Score 4.  I don't know about faulty headphone jacks because, in electronics years, that is ancient history. No such problem exists now. My player has also survived a fall from 5 feet already with no damage.   There are a very few problems that I am willing to put up with for the price. The dial/scroll nob/thinga-ma-jingy is a bit clumsy because you have to push it in to make your selection, and if you are like me, you can often scroll right off of where you need to be b/c you lack the motor coordination to push it straight in (think of a 3-button mouse with a middle scroll wheel that doubles as a button--I am horrible at using that, too.)    The players software is decent, but not great. I am sure they will continue to upgrade it. The PC software you use for ripping and transferring the music from CDs is also decent. Actually, none of the ripping software out there is acceptable in my opinion, but this will do. (Ironically, I have better ripping software that came with my Creative Labs CD burner). The Zen's software uses the Gracenote database for automatically identifying CDs and tracks, and while Gracenote is an utter piece of garbage, it is unfortunately the best thing out there.    The support for non-Latin alphabets is terrible--it is almost 2005, this should be a requirement by now--but it theoretically is there for some of them, although I cannot get Cyrillic, or what they simply call "Russian", to work at all. There are a few other little quirks, like that the program that lets you view the Zen's hardrive from your PC does not actually refresh; you have to back out and go back in. But no deal breakers.  And it is so easy to use, that you really don't need instructions for any of it, which is fortunate, because they really don't give you any.  The ear buds that come with it are terrible, but generally the headphones that come with audio toy are going to be junk.  Best of all, I know these are in stock for he holidays!   UPDATED ON AUGUST 7 2007 Almost three years later, it still works absolutely perfectly and zero degradation in battery life.  In my new office, I have been dropping this thing left and right, and there have been no problems.  This has been of of the most durable electronics products I have ever owned.

<Title>Problems with battery failure
<Date>Sun Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The first couple of months we loved this player and loaded our whole CD collection onto it.  In month eight, the player battery would no longer charge with an AC or car adapter.  We drained the first battery and bought a new battery.  While trying the various suggestions from the Creative Help Lab, the second battery also failed to charge.  I haven't found the help lab all that "helpful," either...mainly an overall lack of understanding the problem we stated and the troubleshooting measures we had already taken.

Finally gave in and got the ipod.  hard drive failed.  the second one's okay, but the headphones are literally falling apart.  my wife's ipod mini has a noisy (i.e. static click/pop in the headphones?!) but is out of warranty.  also consider the ipod must be returned to apple to replace the battery every 3 years, are you kidding??!  no.  i think for the price, these are crap.  go with the nomad.  same functions and features for 20% less, and you can replace the battery yourself. ;)

<Content>Hey I'm not usually one to write something like this, but this needs to be said.  I got this last year around christmas time, and I loved it.  It worked great, 40 gigs for the price of a 10 gig ipod, even had a changeable battery.  Great sound quality, the interface, well ok no one ever beats apples interface, but it worked.  After about 10 months, all of a sudden the sound stopped coming out of hte headphones.  Its not like I was throwing it around, it either A sat on my car seat, B sat on my desk @ work, or C sat on my desk @ home.  I took it apart because Creative's wonderful customer service led me through so many hoops only to find out that I would have to basically pay for a new one to get it fixed, so being a junior at an engineering college with experience in electronics, figured it wouldnt hurt to even look at it.  I took it apart, and the headphone jack had broken off of the board in 2 places.  In one place it was a simple soldering job to fix, but on the other side, it actually tore the tab and induction coil off of the board.  I repaired the left side and can get sound out of the left but no chance at sound out of the right because instead of breaking the solder or the contact, it tore the board.  Now I'm stuck with the do I pay for a whole new player (I could actually go buy a 10gig one and put the 40 gig drive in and then see if i could put the 10gig drive in my laptop)- but after how creative treated me even though they new this was a recurring problem and obviously a defective design, I would rather pay more for the ipod.  I would not recommend buying this unless creative changes their practices-or you want something this expensive for a year or less.

<Title>Tip for new Zen Xtra owners...UPDATED!
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ironically, the day I originally wrote this review, I had my player out of its case, bumped into it and it fell to the hardwood floor.  I reset the player and it booted into "recovery mode" with a "Hard Disk Failure" error message.  Creative told me I had no choice but to send it in and pay for another hard disk.  I could not believe that a 2 or 3 foot fall could completely trash the player, especially the day after I started using it.  It was like an ACME gadget from a bad Road Runner episode.  Taking the advice of a message board poster, I tapped it gently but firmly on my desk, and it started working again.  A friend also got a Creative player, and started using it without really reading the manual.  When it locked up on her, she called Creative and they told her - guess - to send it in and they would replace the hard disk! Luckily, she figured out how to use the reset button, which was all that was needed.  You could just chalk both incidents up to user error, but shame on Creative for providing such sloppy customer service.  Because of that, I am revising my stars down to 3 - the player itself works fine now, and all the good things about it are still there. But Creative's customer support stinks - I don't feel that I'm exaggerating by saying negligent and unethical - and the whole time I was trying to revive my player, the phrase "you get what you pay for" was repeating in my head.  If I was to choose now, I'd go with an iPod and fork out the extra money for a better built product and helpful customer support.  Boo, Creative support! [...] Anyone who has a problem with software or errors such as "player busy or disconnected" - go to the Creative site, find the tech support page, look for the Zen Xtra update download area and download the newest drivers and firmware.  I experienced problems until doing so and now it works like a charm.    In my mind, it comes down to price and name brand preference.  Really, size is not a big deal.  The Zen Xtra is smaller than a CD walkman and weighs just about the same.  So many people like the iPod because it's prettier (do you really want to be a slave to advertising?), or their friends have it, or they're already Mac people so they would never consider something not Mac, that they are willing to pay (...) and upwards more for an iPod.  It may be that Creative's customer service is bad, but I'm not willing to fork out that much more money to get the nice friendly Mac people on the phone.  I'd rather take my chances and get oodles more storage.  UPDATED June 13, 2007  Nearly three years later and still ticking.  No scratches, same battery, no problems (with the player).  MediaSource still stinks.  A week ago I downloaded the most recent firmware, software and drivers and after a bit of tinkering, all was fine.  I was worried after hearing that the latest firmware caused all kinds of problems.  But either Creative fixed the issues or the problem was (dare I say it) user related.  I will say that it was a chore and a half to pick and choose which updates to install.  It'd be nice of Creative could model their download section off of Microsoft, which checks your system and then tells YOU which updates you need.  And taking the time to figure out that you have to install the "jukebox plugin" AND the "PlaysForSure plugin" to have your player talk to the software, well that was an eye-roller.  I don't remember having to do this the last time I updated?  But maybe that's just my faulty memory.  Anyway, it seems silly to have two seperate plugins to use a device that you got the software for in the FIRST place.  I doubt many people are using MediaSource just for the fun of it.    After years of reading about it, I finally sucked it up and paid for Notmad Explorer to manage my Zen instead of the Creative software.  God, I wish I'd done this in the first place.  Sheer Heaven!  I'm actually thinking about trying to upgrade the hard disk, if possible.  If not, then I would have no problem dropping more money today on an up-to-date, new, larger hard drive Creative media player.  I'd just use Notmad to manage it and I wouldn't expect support from Creative.

<Title>Works perfect for this novice
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I did a lot of research before the purchase.  I finally found the perfect player for the perfect price on Amazon.  I paid $165 (no tax or shipping) for the $40gig player with coupons and discounts offered by Amazon.  Not a cheaper price anywhere for this player, and the player is great.  I have this newer model without the bugs of "last year's model."  Read the reviews for model #s to figure out how to get the new model.  I have had none of the problems others mention - face plate popping off, headphone jack breaking, harddrive crashing after too many downloads, etc.  It's built solid and has acted reliablly over a week of straight use.  I loaded over 3000 songs and have used about 1/4 of the HD space.  That's about 400 complete CDs.  Don't be discouraged by MP3 snobs: it's not too big or heavy - it's the size of a tape walkman and no heavier.  Yes, you have to install the driver on each computer, but you can put the drivers on a flash stick or carry the CD.  The headphones sound great, but the earplug type just stink in general, so yes, you might want to buy new ones (or use what you have already).  The battery will run all day in play mode.  It takes a few hours to charge.  The software will do you fine ripping CDs, storing them on your computer and/or the player and it syncs the two so only new songs or changes are transfered.  The online CD info database found every one of the CDs I have, and I have some obscure bootlegs.  Flaws: I really only dislike the battery life transferring music.  Synching drains the battery quickly (about 500-800 songs) per.  So, for that first big sync, plug it in - it runs off the battery or cord.  I have USB 1 on the computer and it is slow to transfer (5-10 seconds/song).  USB 2 must be much faster.  Finally, I cannot find a car charger to work with the player.  Any CD to tape player will work, but the MP3 player requires a 5V car charger, and it's just not available anywhere (Radio Shack, Circuit City, or on Creative site).  Creative needs to offer more accessories like this to make it completely useful.  Bottom line, best quality, storage, bang for the buck without a doubt.  Ipod is much more expensive and has its limitations with sharing music on different Ipods/computers.  This will synch to any computer or Nomad.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had the previous version of this MP3 player but it broke when it flew off my dashboard when I hit an uneven railroad crossing doing 70 in a huge van.  I almost broke my neck so I wasn't really surprised when the Zen Jukebox MP3 player broke.  I had dropped it several times before (biking, running, dancing, etc) and it had a lot of good falls and I was amazed that it didn't break earlier.  I had had the previous version of the Zen jukebox about a year and a half when I finally killed it. I almost cried.  I had my entire cd collection on it.  My husband took pity on me and bought me the new Zen Jukebox for my birthday and I love it even more.  The carrying case is diffrent because it now has a window to see what you are selecting (definite plus, cudos to the Zen Jukebox guys) and the sound quality, as before, is excellent.  The software is a breeze to use too.  Oh, and even with virtually distroying my previous Zen Jukebox, I was able to salvage about 80% of the music I had on it and transfer it to my new one, so that was pretty good considering the amount of damage it has sustained when I broke it(when I say it flew, I ment it FLEW. Lots of air time and a sickening stop at the end).    I'm a music nut, and I love to excersize, but I don't like to workout without my music, and with this baby you can jump, fly, fall and the music won't skip a beat (as long as it doesn't fly off whatever you attached it too). If only Creative labs could comeout with a water proof case, a wireless fm transmitter, and an arm or waist band that could secure it (better than a clip that is), it would be PERFECT. Then you could sky dive, scuba dive and kyak with it.  If they came out with accessories, I don't think the Zen Jukebox would ever leave my side.  I've never had an Ipod, so I can't really compare, but you get your bang for your buck with the Zen Jukebox. It is extremely affordable.  And DO buy the car adapter (to charge it), the fm transmitter is a must (it's GREAT to have one of those, considering most cars don't have cassette cases now a days) and the stereo adapter thingy is awesome too, especially if you are always on the move and don't have a few hours to spare charging the thing up. I really like the stereo adapter so I don't have to take out my cds and get them scratched (always happens).  With the easy menu options on this MP3 player you can create your own playlists too. For example I name my playlists name like Mellow Yelllow- easy jams to mellow out to, suicide tracks-sad, depressing love songs we all love,workout jams-self expanitory, chick songs- my girl power, guy hating emsenble (we all have them days), etc, you get the drift, and you can set it so you can listen to whatever suits your fancy without mess around with your stereo every time you want a diffrent song, or you can set it to random, or by artist, cd, genre, you name it. You can even pick and choose what songs in what order come out, or what songs you want and then set it to shuffle if you like to be surprised.    I read in a previous review about the volume can be problematic on this MP3 player, but I don't have problems with it.  I listen to it when I ride my motorcycle to work (yes I know it's illegal, but that's besides the point here), and I have cobra pipes on my bike which are REALLY lound (you can hear my bike about 3 to 5 miles away) and I can hear the music just fine.  It goes from 1 to 25 and with my bike roaring I have it on about 18 and works just dandy.  I'm sorry I couldn't provide you with any technical stuff here, I'm not very savvy on such things so I won't pretend.  It's been a good product so far, and I have dropped my new one already about 5 times (the clip doesn' hold up good when you're bouncing on a trampoline,or when you fly off a mountain bike) but I guess that's to be expected.  It still works great and I LANDED on it when I flew off my bike.  So I give it a thumbs up for taking everything I've dished out. I even got caught in a rainstorm while I was on my bike and it got pretty wet. Still works like a charm, but I wouldn't recommend for anyone to hose down their Zen Jukebox on purpose.  I hope my review was helpful.

<Title>Waste
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Approximately 2 weeks after taking my 40gb Nomad out of it's packaging, the hard drive froze up.  This erased hours of downloading time spent. After contacting CREATIVE they had me send the mp3 player to Oklahoma City to have it repaired.  When they were done (approximately 1 month later) they mailed it back to an incorrect address.  When I contacted customer service it took them another 2 weeks to respond.  I ended up having to contact the address it was delivered to and make arrangements to pick up product myself.  Overall, when the product works, this is a good mp3 player.  It has lots of space and is easy to use.  However, the CREATIVE company provideds THE WORST customer service I have ever dealt with.

<Title>Love it! Great Buy!!
<Date>Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It was very easy to download all our cds onto this. I just wish when we use it in our car with a cassette adapter that it would stop playing when the car is turned off. But that may be due to the adapter. Also, when we put it on the setting to randomly pick songs from all the music it seems to choose songs from some of the same albums. It just seems that since we have almost 300 albums on there the odds would be that you wouldn't hear the same album within 20 songs from each other.  Overall, we are VERY happy with this!!!!!

<Content>i bought this mp3 player back in August and it was working perfectly fine and the music uploaded &lt;u>very&lt;/u> fast  except that some of the albums i uploaded weren't in the correct order and i hated the fact that there was a little skip/pause in between songs (which ruined listening to 'Frances The Mute')  after a month or two, it started to freeze for some times. now, it doesn't even work. i had only dropped it once and that was a while before it had stopped working. there are major hard disk problems and it won't let me clean in out.  you'd be better off with one of those new, spiffy iPods.

<Title>Don't Buy This Player!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We bought a 60 gig in Feb of this year.  Within 4 months we got an error where the device would not boot.  There was no misuse of this product.  Just simple wear of 4 months.  This is with 6,000 songs on a hard drive that should carry over 15k!  We called the lovely customer service there at Creative and got the instructions to send it in and that our music was lost!  The warranty with creative had of course already expired at 3 months.  So they wanted us to pay shipping, send it in to see what is wrong, and then they would charge us how ever much to fix it.  On a side note, we have noticed that the wonderful case that is provided with the mp3 player has a hard clip in the back, witch seems to dent the casing rather easily.  By just putting it in your pocket!   My husband got another 40 gigs Creative Zen Jukebox Ultra,  for his birthday in June.  Luckily with a wonderful warranty from Circuit City.  It is Dec 4, and today our 40 gig died.  It displayed the same problems everyone here described.  It is not worth $200 + to buy a MP3 player that will only last you 4 months at a time.  All the extras that this device has, is completely outweighed by its software issues!  Today we are going to Circuit City and looking for a different brand. ��

<Title>My Constant Companion
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yes, there have been faults with my player, but with technical support and a little patience I've managed to keep this little treasure working. I now have more than 600 albums to choose from, in great sound quality, and I wonder how I ever did without it. I believe it's important to remember these are quite fragile, sophisticated electronic devices and more likely to malfunction than your average toy. Even with careful handling I've dropped it a number of times, and it would certainly have broken without the protective leather case - ALWAYS use the case! Using the software is dead easy, loading files and navigating with the scroll wheel simple and straightforward, and after 18 months the replaceable battery is still going (fairly) strong. In short, a great buy that's brought an immense amount of pleasure!

<Title>I love it, but it is still early
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased and received my NOMAD JBZX 40GB in early November. Since then I have had absolutely no problems, however I am aware that a lot of reviewers state that problems started after having it for 4 months or more. I will keep an eye out for that. As for the operation of the unit, I could not be happier. No problems, downloading music, or with playback. I even took it to the Dominican Republic and bounced it around quite a bit. Still no problems. (Note: I purchased one of those FM transmitters that allow you to play you MP3 player through a stereo by setting the radio to a particular frequency. Well, I was wondering if this would work outside of the US. Happy to report that it does).  Software is adequate. I love being able to edit track information for a group of songs at once. If for some reason the Artist, etc info is not correct, I can change it. I can also assign a custom genre, if I so choose for playing music by genre. I'm very happy with the unit; so far.

<Content>I did a lot of research for an MP3 player for my 12 year old.  This product is GREAT:)  The whole family uses it.  My 12 year old can use it with now problem.  I purchased this for under $200.00. 40 GB for less than 200.  That is AWESOMW!!  I did not want to spend 300.00 for a 12 year old, so I went with this product after researching and talking to people. We are all VERY satisfied.  It stored everyones music collection (even my 4 & 5 year olds).  I recommend this product for anyone who just wants to listen to music.

<Title>An amazing player if you can live with the interface
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Creative Nomad Zen Xtra MP3 Jukebox is actually an amazing MP3 player, if you can forgive its relatively large size (when compared to the iPod) and clunky user interface (again, when compared to the iPod).  Not only does it have SUPERB sound quality, unmatched by iPod or Rio or iRiver, but it sports some features you won't find elsewhere:  - volume leveling, so all your tracks have the same volume - time scaling, so you can adjust the playback speed fast or slow, a boon for people who have audiobooks in the MP3 format (the iPod can only adjust the speed of special Audible files) - sleep timer - alarm clock (!!!) - profile settings that remember your preferences, great for sharing with other family members - pretty decent playlist management - works as an external drive in Windows - removable LiIon battery  These features are all the more amazing because all recent Creative products (Zen Micro, Zen Touch, ...) do NOT have these features.  It's sad to me that Creative has taken a step or two back in all these convenience features, which would have made their products compete better against iPod and others.  Just sad.  In short, if size and jog dial don't turn you off, the Zen Xtra is the best hard drive-based MP3 player.

<Content>I purchased this 10 days ago. It's been wonderful so far. I already transfered more than 2000 mp3s from my collection in to 20 play lists. It's playing just fine. Sound quality is quite good. The software that came with this is very good and user friendly. I ripped all the original CDs I had and converted them in to mp3s. It's been fun playing with this toy. I highly recommend this.

<Title>So Good So Far
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Nomad for about a month, got it a week after Christmas (all those pesky best buy gift cards you know), and I am glad to say I am very happy with my Nomad.  It downloads songs fast, and you don't need to put the music on your computer, then from the computer to the Nomad.  You can go directly from the CD, which, for me, makes things much easier.    Some flaws, well not many but I haven't had it for that long.  It has frozen on me once or twice, but it is easily fixed with a thumb tack.  I also don't like the carry case that it comes with, doesn't seem very sturdy.  Other than that... no real big problems.  The softwear that comes with it is good.  It gets the job done.  Pretty easy to learn how to use.  Now, I have never owned an ipod, but I think the Nomad kicks its butt.  The Nomad has easy to use buttons, unlike the ipod with that stupid wheel thing.  The Nomad is a bit bigger than the ipod, the ipod is skinnier.  But the great thing about the Nomad is you get the same thing, 40GB, for about $100 less.    I am very pleased with my Nomad so far.  This is only a short term review, and I haven't really taken it anywhere accept on a car ride to Disneyland.  So, very good, great deal.

<Title>Many Problems even with newer model
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is awesome, till you own it for about 5 months.  Interface, sound, all that is excellent.  Yet the headphone jack is just not secure.  You will start to lose sound in either the left or right headphone, then both.  Also, instead of reinforcing it with a brace, they have it completely soldered into the board for support so when it comes up it rips the board.  I've checked all over the internet and this happens with everyones player.  so be careful, all their other models look excellent and do not have this problem, buy a different model.  Oh, this one starts freezing really bad if you load over 20gigs of songs onto the hard drive

<Title>Wish battery life was longer... but overall, solid
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved this mp3 player as a Christmas gift. I asked for an Ipod, but did some research, and found out this was a better deal and creative makes good products (best sound cards). First some things I like about the mp3 player: Comes with case Nice bright screen Sleek (but a tad too big, especially with case on) THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY  The case doesn't "pop off" as easily as some say, I haven't had any problems with it. The player organizes the songs pretty well and has a decent layout. It is somewhat durable, since I've dropped it a few times and it still works. Lastly, the space. I've got over 1000 songs and 33 MBs left.  The problems I had with it was the battery life. This thing gets 5 hours tops, and this is why I want to get Zen Touch (15 hours +). The software that comes with it isn't great (but can download better software), but it does the job. The jog dial seems flimsy sometimes. The button layout isn't spectacular.  I wish I could give it a 3.5 because there's something I really like about this player. The bads outweigh the goods, but if you can look past a few minor details and look at what it's made to do, play music, it's a great mp3 player. If you want to sacrifice space for quality though, go for the Zen Touch.

<Title>The Product Was Great, The Software Was The Problem
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this product as a replacement for my 20 gig ipod which was too small for my music collection. I wanted 40 gigs, but was intrigued by Creative's alternative to the ipod. After reading the reviews, I decided to get one. And the player itself was great. But the software was one problem after another. First I tried using Windows Media Player, because it said it was compatible, but there were two problems. First, the player would not accept any playlists from WMP, no matter what I tried. Second, it would not accept songs with the same name. If I already had one song titled "Breathe" loaded, it wouldn't take any other song by that name. So I tried the software that came with the Zen Xtra, Creative Media Source. And it was worse. Not only was it difficult to maneuver, it actually made my computer shut itself down, more than once. It turns out there's some kind of glitch, and the best you can do is upgrade the driver, but that didn't work for me. There's no actual way to fix this. So after losing several important items on my computer, I returned it and got an ipod. As for the player itself, I had no problem with it. In fact, I really liked it. My problem was the software. It would be a fanatastic player, as long as you can get the software to work.

<Content>I read all of the reviews that I could lay my hands on, and I must say I was a bit nervous.  Until I got the product.  It was easy to set up the software, I copied about 10 cd's,(with more to come), onto the jukebox and I even installed and downloaded a program called audible.com so I could listen to books on the jukebox.  Other than having to go onto Creative's website to get the firmware upgrade to listen to the books, which was very easy as well,  using this product has been much easier than I anticipated and I HIGHLY recommend it.  I take it running on the treadmill at my gym, listen to it in bed, and I have had absolutely no problems with it.  I agree with another reviewer, I don't drop mine, or I have not yet, but it is a hard drive, so some care must be taken??  Anyway, it is awesome and I am so sorry I doubted it at first!!  It is so worth the price....

<Title>Save money on an iPod...Buy this unit instead
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I won an iPod photo from a raffle and used it for a few months. I was happy with the features, but found that people were paying huge amounts of money for them, even when they were used. I decided to sell it (and got 370 on eBay). I then bought this unit for just 200 dollars, and found that it is just as good, if not better.  The unit itself is pretty light. I always found that my iPod was a bit too heavy because of that metal plate in the back. I also didnt like how your finger prints always got on the plate, and it was tough to keep clean.   The battery life is great. I think the best I have gotten out of it has been about 15 hours. I like the fact that the unit has a detachable front plate, so that you can change out the battery. I bought another one so that when I travel, I can play music for upwards of 30 hours without charging. I bought an iRiver transmitter so I could play the unit in my car, so I really only have to take it out of my car and plug it in about once every two weeks.  The display is a cool blue color, and it allows you to customize backlight time. You can control other features too, such as the screen saver. It can show time and date information, which is great for someone like me who doesnt carry a watch.  The player is light, and the carry case it comes with feels like it can protect the unit very well. I throw it into my backpack and do not worry about anything breaking.  The only things that I have found so far that I am not crazy about is the included software and the scroll button. I still use iTunes for playing music when I am at my computer becuase it is easier to organize, more user friendly, and easier on the eyes. As for syncronizing music to the player, it is just as fast as the iPod. Adding tracks is simple, but the software does make it a bit more frustrating to create playlists. When you click on a track to move into a playlist, the window scrolls all the way back up to the top of your music list. Thus, it takes a long time to find where you were, and it makes list making a cumbersome task. As for the scroll button, I guess I got a little to used to using the scroll circle on my iPod. The Creative player has a little tab on the side that you push up or down to scroll with. I think it can be a bitter more difficult to land on a song because the scroller accelerates on its own, so you have to get used to stopping short of the artist or song you are looking for, then slowly selecting it.  Other than my dislike for software, I love this unit. I think that anyone shopping for a player should start here, both for the price and the functionality. I do think some of the features should not factor into your decision, such as the EAX audio functions (which I guarantee you, you wont use).   Pros:  The unit is pretty light, despite being slightly larger than iPods.  It has awesome battery life, (better than the iPod's from my experience).  Looks great, and feels pretty durable.  Cons:   Software could be improved.  The scroll button is tough to use if you are used to the scroll pad of iPods.

<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...but that's really the only problem i've had with my Zen. the people docking it multiple stars for that reason alone are ridiculous.  first of all, those who are saying you have to use Creative's proprietary software are idiots. I'm not sure about Macs, but you can definitely transfer files through Windows Explorer just by dragging and dropping. It's not exactly ideal, but it does work.  secondly, if you really find the software that cumbersome and don't want to transfer through Windows, Red Chair Software has an excellent product called Notmad Explorer that is available for fairly cheap (it was only $20 when i purchased it about a year ago) from their website. much more intuitive and solid than Creative's program.

<Content>I read the terrific reviews and decided to purchase Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player for myself, thinking I was getting an excellent deal.  Yes, the storage capacity was great- but that's about all.  When I first purchased it, it worked like a charm.  But after the first couple months, it no longer was recognized on my computer.  It said that the device was not plugged in, although it was.  I tried restarting, charging the battery all the way, trying different USB ports and cables, and just about any other thing that I could think of.  It plays the files that are currently stored on it fine, but now I can't add any new ones, defeating the purpose of my buying it in the first place.

<Title>The ups and downs of Zen
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, after I sat down and read all of the peoples comments, about the difference between Ipods, Zen, Ryo's and Sonys I ended up choosing the Creative.  It came in a pretty fancy box, and yup, the player in fact is pretty small. A bit bigger than the ipod, but it still can fit in to a shirt pocket. Heavy? naa, you can feel a bit the weight but is nothing compared to a walkman or to a CD player.  I open the box where all the cables and stuff were and it was a big surpise that it has its own cover. Ipod comes naked and if you want a case, the cheapest and therefore the not very nice one  its worth like US$25.00.  Now, let me issue the Ups and Downs of this product.  UPs -Its rather small and its light -The screen is easy to use -Eventhough many say that the scroll its not easy to use, I say they are wrong, its very usefull and against dummies. -Blue screen is more than enough for the purpose of the player -It comes with a case to protect the player! -You can save in it all kind of data  -What you get for the prize you pay is much more that what you can gain with the ipod.  DOWNs -The software...yup, the software is a major trouble. Eventhough I am a Helpdesk supervisor, this software is pretty unfriendly. And what is worst, I come to a find that in a stranger PC I plug the USB and YEAH, the XP don't recognize the player, so I had to download the driver. Then I wanted to take some movies with me and again, it was not recognize easily by the windows, so I had to download the NOMAD explorer. This means I will always have to carry the software CD and the USB cable besides the player. -I began to pass to the player a 4 GB file of different .avi movies and when it was in 50% the battery died, eventhough it was fully charged... -The ear phones are too big for the ears, I don't get it...what model did they use to make those sizes for the ear phones?!  So in conclusion, this player is design for people who look for a MP3 player with good quality of sound and BIG hard disk where you can carry  a LOT of things...is not as fancy as the ipod (and not as "in fashion") but who gives a **** right?

<Title>Won't support To Go services -- Don't support Creative
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before you buy, check out the blogs about Creative's customer service. There IS none! Most of us who spent a lot of money last year to buy a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra were disappointed to find out that this mp3 player does NOT support any of the Janus subscription services (like Rhapsody to Go, Napster to Go, Yahoo's to go service). That is bad enough, but any attempt to get a straight answer from the company about firmware updates (so that we CAN use these very cool services) is met with either no response, or a canned "This device does not support these services at this time." No one has been able to find out when or even IF they ever will. I suspect not.  The other problem is that both my Nomad and my son's have a serious freeze-up problem, one to the point of not being able to be used.  I would highly recommend another mp3 player if you are considering the Nomad and certainly don't buy from Creative, they pretty much don't care at all about their customers once you buy from them.

<Title>Great value, great player
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've never owned any other MP3 players, so I can't fairly do any direct comparisons, but I researched this one fairly extensively before buying. I opted to skip the iPod because they're way overpriced, in my opinion, and you can't replace the batteries, and I'm not the least bit concerned about managing my music through iTunes or showcasing my iPod trendiness. I'm also not much interested in viewing video or photos on it. I bought this for one reason only: to play my MP3s.  The Creative Nomad Zen Xtra is a great value for the capacity (40 GB) and I've been happy with the quality of the sound. I use it in my car now instead of my CD player, and with the right EAX custom EQ settings on the player in tandem with a car cassette adapter, it's indistinguishable from CD. (My guess is that a radio transmitter might not sound quite as good as a cassette adapter.) The included ear buds are junk, naturally, but I've never, ever met a pair of ear buds that I've liked. Use real closed-ear headphones for best results.  The Nomad's custom EQ is a terrific feature that allows you to balance for your specific headphones or operating environment, although I've found that high EQ settings combined with high MP3 recording levels can result in some nasty overmodulation/distortion on the peak bass levels (my one mild gripe with the player), so in such cases you might have to back off the EQ levels a bit ... but that's usually only at high recording levels.  The built-in music library feature detects all your ID3 tags and organizes your music extremely easily (by album, artists, genre, etc.), so if your MP3s are already tagged you won't have to do much of any organization at all. I'd seen a lot of concerns/complaints about the software that comes with the Nomad, but I found it perfectly adequate and was able to load all 24 GB of my music onto my player in 90 minutes (fast USB 2.0) while watching football in another room. Honestly, to rip and organize your MP3s, first just use Windows Media Player. Then use the Nomad software to copy the files over; it's a snap.  I've found that battery life does not seem to come close to the "up to" 14-hour claim that Creative mentions, but I always use EAX settings and wasn't really expecting 14-hour battery life anyway, so take that for whatever it's worth. Overall, highly recommended.

<Title>Not bad, but not great
<Date>Mon Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had gone to Best Buy with the intention of buying a 20GB iPod, but then ran across the Nomad Zen Xtra.  Weighing the pros and cons of the features, I just couldn't bring myself to purchase the iPod when I could get twice the amount of hard drive space, a removeable lithium ion battery, a free case, and sound normalizing via EAX for $50 less.  I used the extra $50 to purchase the 2-year replacement warranty, which I'm really glad I did.  Here are my gripes about the unit:  1.  Never owning a hard-drive based MP3 player before, the first thing I noticed (much to my disappointment) was after I transferred all 5000 of my MP3s that I had neatly organized by artist-labeled folders, all the songs were dumped into one directory.  Since I had previously stripped all my ID tags (since it would have taken forever to uniform them all,) I couldn't sort my songs by artist unless I either 1) recreated 5000 ID tags, or 2) created playlists by artist.  I chose option 2.  Luckily, I found a nifty little program that scans your directory structure and creates playlists by folder name within seconds.  Then I just used the windows find feature to locate all the .m3u playlist files.  Then I drag and dropped them to the player.  Problem solved.  Again, this annoyance isn't exclusive to the Nomad.  The iPod "organizes" files the same way.  My preference would be to have the OS recognize the unit as an additional drive, where I could just drag and drop my folders to it, but that doesn't seem to be the way these things operate (for whatever reason.)    2.  The next flaw I noticed with this player (and exclusively with this player) is that the front cover pops off WAY too easily.  Since the battery isn't locked into place, it pops out when the cover comes off.  If this happens in the middle of playing a song, it causes the data to become corrupted.  When you restart your player, it has to go through an annoying recovery routine.  After it was done "recovering," my playlists had become corrupted, which meant I had to drag and drop them again.  But, even after dragging and dropping them, I noticed that some songs were missing from the playlists.  I could not fix this any other way (because of the limitation with the included software,) without deleting everything and starting over.  Everything was great for another day, until the exact thing happened again.  At this point, I'm getting very annoyed with the fact the front cover keeps popping off.  Why Creative Labs made it so easy to remove a lithium ion battery that will only need to be accessed for replacement every 2 years is beyond me.  It should be secured with user-removeable screws...but that's just my two cents.  So, now I had three options.  1) keep it in the protective cover to prevent the front from popping off.  I opted not to go with this option because it adds to the bulkiness of the unit.  2) Take it back to Best Buy and get a refund so I can purchase the 20GB iPod, or 3) use electrical tape to secure the front cover.  I chose option 3, and it's worked very well (albeit, it makes it look like a homemade bomb.)    3.  I have to be perfectly honest here.  The software that comes with this unit is absolutely PATHETIC.  I read through the usenet groups about the notmad software, so I decided to save myself a lot of headaches and just pay $25 to get what I should have gotten in the first place...user-friendly software.    4.  The next thing that annoyed me about this unit is that it doesn't power off the USB cable.  You have to keep it plugged into AC whenever you are transferring files to it, or you will suck the power out of it in no time.  I have an external hard drive that works just fine being powered off the USB cable, so I know it's possible for them to design the unit that way.  Why they opted not to is beyond me.  5.  Lastly, I don't like the fact that I have to carry around the CD with me so I can install the driver for this on other PCs.  Now for the positive things:  1.  Although everyone else seems to hate them, I really think the earbuds are pretty good.  Of course, I'm comparing them to other "cheap" earbuds I've owned in the past.  But the sounds quality is above average in my opinion.    2.  The battery life is outstanding (as long as you're not transferring files.)  I play it nearly all day long, and charge it at night while I'm sleeping.    3.  Lastly, I like the fact that if the battery no longer holds a charge, I can just go out to ebay and pay $16 for a brand new one.  It's one of the few hard-drive based MP3 players that gives you this option.  Again, it's WAY to easy to remove the battery.    Overall, it's not a bad unit.  I think if they made the case a little more durable, improved their software, secured the front cover with user-removeable screws, allowed it to power off the USB cable, and allowed you to drag and drop folders through Windows Explorer and have the player KEEP them in the folders (viewable through the player's menu,) the unit would be much better than an iPod.

<Title>good unit, two months of use
<Date>Fri Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player just before christmas and have been using is every day.  I have not had any of the problems that people list here:  my cover has never come off and have had NO problems witih the software.  This is my first mp3 player:  I used windows media to rip a lot of my cds.  I have 357 on there so far, I have a stack of 50 or so more to go.  I had no problem losing artist, track, song information.  I have MANY different versions of the same song by the dead and phish.   The player keeps them well organized.    Playlists are not easy to create on the fly on the player. They're easy enough to create using the jukebox software.  You can set the back light time and auto off feature - which is usefull so I don't run the battery down.  My only complaint is the scroll wheel.  It is a little hard to highlight and select items from the menus - it does take a little practice and I am getting better at it.

<Title>Reliable little player
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player back in August, and it has served me well since buying it, but it has it's cons.  + durability-  I often go jogging, and at first I was a little apprehensive about bringing it with me, especially after hearing the horror stories from other buyers.  There were no problems with it at all, even when I tripped.    - Battery-  When I purchased the player,  I would routinely get around 16 hours to a charge, now, six months later, i'm lucky to get 10 hours.  The problem is mitigated by the choice of buying  an additional battery, but that would be another $40 bucks, not something I look for in a value player.  + Features- While the random feature is hidden in a menu, the speed up/down function, environment simulator, and customizable equalizer settings are very well-made and fun to play around with.  - Buttons-  After six months of essentially living in my pocket, the buttons are starting to lose their sensitivity.  The scroll wheel on the side especially feels like it's losing it's springiness, and the fast-forward button is losing it's shine.  However, I don't need them much anymore, as I just set it on random and leave it alone.  All things considered,  I would most certainly encourage you to buy one of these, and if (not when)I need to replace it, I'll buy from Creative Labs again.

<Title>Good value - lower cost per gigabyte traded for larger size
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Creative Nomad Zen Xtra appears to be the most consumer-budget-friendly hard disk based mp3 player on the market. Creative built this player using a standard, 2.5" wide and 9.5 mm thick hard disk used in laptop computers. These hard drives are bigger and heavier than the whole iPod; however, since they made in huge quantities, they are rather inexpensive. This allowed Creative to offer a 40 GB player at a price close to half of that of iPod and iRiver with the same disk size. Additional built-in savings feature (which apparently added another millimeter or two to Zen's thickness) is user-replaceable lithium-ion battery. One can find a spare battery from twenty dollars, keep a charged spare at hand when going on a long trip, and replace it faster than it takes to change AA batteries in a portable CD player. All other comparable mp3 players must be disassembled to replace the battery (which usually loses its capacity after 250-400 charging cycles), which costs roughly twenty-thirty dollars for the battery and approximately fifty to seventy dollars for a five minute installation job.   Yes, Zen Xtra is bulky - it is 0.3'' taller, 0.6" wider, and 0.3" thicker than iPod, and 2.3 oz heavier. This seem to be not a lot on the paper, but when you hold an iPod in one hand and Zen Xtra in the other, it does seem BIG. It does not look that bulky after you get used to it (or have no iPods nearby), but it is still feels heavy if you put it into your shirt pocket on in your fanny pack.   Out of the box, it comes with a partially charged battery and about 60 pre-loaded pieces of popular classical music (not a stellar performance, but good melodies). The earbuds are comfortable and have surprisingly clear distortion-free sound. However, thier bass is not very strong, and trembles could be somewhat more transparent. The sound quality of the player is very good (&lt;0.1% harmonic distortions, 98 dB signal-to-noise ratio), it support mp3 up to 320 kbps as well as WAV and WMA. In fact, the general opinion seems to be that its sound quality is the best of all mp3 players in its class.   The unit comes with a 12-month warranty. The information on Creative's web site (as at the end of February 2005) was contradictory, but I got confirmation from their customer support that their new policy is 12 month and no longer 90 days.   Zen Xtra supports USB 2 and USB 1.1 (although does not support charging through the USB port) but does not work with firewire. Its software (required to copy sound tracks and data files back and forth between the player and your PC) can be installed on any version of Windows, including 98. Mac is not supported. The first application uses Windows Explorer interface; the second one is more elaborate, provides more sophisticated user interface, and supports ripping of music into mp3 format.   I read many negative reports on Creative Media Source, but I personally find this piece of software very convenient and efficient. It indeed takes some time to figure how it works and why it works this way, but once you figured it out, it works great.   All tracks are saved in the root folder on the player's hard drive (data files can be saved with folders), and looking through an endless list of files in Nomad Explorer could be very intimidating. This is where the Media Source comes into play - its multi-window structure allows you very quickly display tracks which match certain standard selection criteria, such as genre, artist, or album. This is in a way similar to instant arrangement of tracks into folders, as one would do it on a computer.   The player comes with a decent quality leather case, a charger, and a USB cable.   To summarize, Zen Xtra is not as cute and tiny as the iPod, and does not have the iRiver's endless set of capabilities. But if offers you 40 GB for $150+ less, and saves you another $50+ each time you need a new battery. It is bulky, but it plays very well, has long battery life, solid feel, and a quite convenient user interface. It is the player to buy if its size and weight are not major factors, but the price is. Six stars for the value, four stars for the size and weight, five in average.

<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nomad for almost a month now and I don't know how I ever lived without it. I was a little nervous about what the software was going to be like after reading several customer reviews but it was extremely simple to install and just as easy to use. I'm fairly computer illiterate, too, so it really says something that I find it easy to use. I had been wanting an ipod for a long time but, being a starving college student, I could not even come close to affording one. When I heard about the nomad, and specifically how much less expensive than the ipod it is, I thought it sounded too good to be true. But it isn't! Buy one, trust me, you will not regret it. A couple of weeks after I got mine my roommate went out and bought one, it's just that good.

<Content>I've had my Zen about two months now. When I first got it, I wasn't too sure about it. It's operation was very different than my old Archos MP3 player. After a few days, I got the hang of it. Navigation it easy and the search function cuts down on the time it would normally take to find songs. I have my entire 200+ CD collection on it with almost half of the drive space still empty. It's light weight and small size make it very portable. I take it everywhere with me. The included software is ok, not as great as it could be, but still it works well enough. Throw away the crappy headphones it comes with and get some good ones.

To make things worse, customer support said if I want a new hard drive its gonna cost me $150. Overall, the customer service people were anything but helpful and really, I don't know why they're even there.  It does have really good sound quality though. I'm just frustrated because I read through all the packaging and warranties and they didn't say anything about making sure it stays motionless. The customer service guy said you shouldn't even walk around with it. If that's the case what's the point?! I could've bought a car stereo that played mp3s for much cheaper than this stupid thing and just played the rest on my computer for free. Overall I'm pretty frustrated with it right now, although had I been asked before it broke I would've had nothing but great things to say about it, the interface is awesome and the software is simple. It just sucks you're not supposed to do anything with it besides set it on your desk

<Title>Numerous hard drive and physical problems make this product 
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product is the most worthless piece of junk I have ever purchased in my life.  Not only are there obvious physical problems (which I thought would not bother me), but there have been numerous - and I mean numerous - problems with the hard drive since I purchased it a mere seven and one half months ago.   First of all, the plus side is that the player has an attractive appearance, the music is well-organized on the player, and music is quick to upload on the player.  However, music can only be uploaded if Creative's software is installed on the computer.  So if you think you can easily transfer music from a friend's computer onto this player (like with an I-Pod), think again.  Oh, and there is no radio on this player.  The physical problems are as follows: the player itself is way too big and bulky, it weighs a good deal, and its carrying case will not stay hooked onto your article of clothing.  Also, with the addition of the carrying case, the player now has even more bulk.  But I have found the carrying case is always necessary, because the player is too flimsy to withstand bumping, jostling, or dropping.    Now to the more important problems.  Approximately one month after I received the player, an error message started popping up every 7 or 8 songs, obscuring the scene.  It did not affect the music too much, although it was a huge nuisance (still has not gone away).  About three weeks after I started using the headphones, one of the pads fell off; thus, they are now useless as they will not remain in my ear.  About four months after I purchased the player, I could only hear music out of one ear.  Despite numerous emails to Creative's customer service (who are unsympathetic), the problem still remains unresolved.  Now, I can only hear music in both ears if I have the jack in a certain position; otherwise I can only hear in one ear.  Now, seven and a half months after my purchase, the player has stopped functioning completely.  I tried cleaning it, rebooting it, and replacing the firmware, but there is a "Harddisk Problem," and I cannot play any music.  Again, despite emails to Creative (whose solutions have been either to send it with a forty dollar repair fee not including various other costs or reinstall the firmware), nothing has been resolved.  Now these may seem like isolated problems and you might think they will not happen to you.  But I have always kept the player in the carrying case and I don't throw it around or anything, so I suspect these problems are not mine alone.  Plus, why deal with the hassle of all these problems when you can find a player that is a much better value?  I have spoken with multiple people, all of whom have I-Pods (surprise), and although I was initially against the idea of the I-Pod, now I fully recommend you buy it instead.  I have yet to find someone who has experienced problems with their I-Pod, while mine is completely dead.  Good luck!

<Content>I'll concentrate on areas that others haven't covered:  Good: You can (and should) get the third party (inexpensive but not free) notmad explorer from redchairsoftware. It's a lot nicer (IMO) than the Creative musicmanager and also provides a way to use the mp3 player to do audio streaming over the internet. So, you can leave it at home and listen to it at work, for example.  Bad: The manufacturer's warranty is only 90 days! I wouldn't spend hundreds of Dollars for a portable device with tiny moving parts with a 90 day warranty. Suggestion: Check out vikingwarranty for an inexpensive after-market extended warranty.

<Title>Buy it and get the extended Warranty!
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just get the extended Warranty, but if you want to know why read on. I bought my creative Jukebox 40GB right around the New Year. I have placed over 400 CDs on it and plan to continue. I wanted to wait to write a review, these reviews really helped my decision. I did a ton a research and this is what I found: Ipods are much more aesthetically pleasing and have a slightly better operating system (more user-friendly) just like all their products. But like all their products they overcharge compared to the competition for basically a "hot lookin" item. I paid about $150 less than the Ipod but then bought the $40 2 year extended warranty from Best Buy. Ok extended warranties are like lottery tickets but if you plan on using your player the battery will die, and there is your $40 investment right there. Best Buy (I'm sure other stores have these, CC etc.) will give you a new battery. Plus if the dreaded headphone jack fails then your covered and paid $100 less. One of the best features that the Ipod doesn't have is that you can add a song to a play list, meaning that if a song is playing you can select another one to play after, and so on. DJ style. The battery life definitely out shines the Ipod. I have had multiple 8 hr road trips. The headphones that are supplied are poor so don't be fooled at the initial sound quality it is definitally equal to the Ipod and plays wma format. Selecting songs can be a hassle especially having over 10,000 because of their weird slide wheel. There is an alpha search so if an artist starts with a `T' you can quickly get to the T's. You can use it as a USB drive for transferring files although I don't use that option often. You can have multiple sites of download for Mp3s, so if you keep some of your music on another computer... The software it comes with isn't anything special but it gets the job done could improve. Recap: With everything comparable (size sound quality etc.) the price and making mixes on the go are the reasons I purchased this guy. I bought about $100 worth of music in the last couple months, saw a show, and bought new strings - rock on.

<Content>I love this MP3 player. The controls are easy to use, the battery lasts a long time before needing to be recharged, and the software works fast for transferring. It did take me a couple of evenings to figure out the software, but after that, no problems. One of the reviewers mentioned the lack of car power adapter, but Bed Bath Beyond & Radio Shak both sell universal car adapters so that you can plug small appliances with household plugs into a car(handy for lots of things). I've had no problems with the player, it works great, and I've been using it about 2 months. I put 220+ albums of my collection on it, with plenty of room for more. I've been using an adapter to play it thru my cassette deck on my car plus my home stereo system. I've never used the earplug headset that came with it, since I had better headphones already.

<Content>I purchased this unit thinking the Creative name meant quality, well that might be the case but let me tell you My computer (which is a dell 8400 tricked out)  could not pick up the player using the provided software, the player does not work with Windows Media Player, There is no excuse for any company to not have their player be compatible with Windows Media Player, If Creative wants to be a stand alone then merge with Apple, and the Tech support, Boy What a bunch of air heads, no help, all tech support would do was refer me to the problem section of the creative web site and tell me to call back if the issue was not corrected, after 5 times of of that insanity and going no where I returned the player and bought a Rio Karma,and with the  Rio I am a happy camper again.  The Creative Nomad is only a paper weight and the Tech Support should be fired.

<Title>Even if you have a mac, it's great.
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm a mac user but I decided to go for the 40GB Nomad and I don't regret it, with only a plug in for the itunes I can load the music into the nomad with no problem, I have twice space with 40GB for almost 65 bucks less, It works great, never skips and the battery life is outstanding for all the things it does. It also comes with the pouch and the ipod doesn't, the only thing I don't like, the earphones, too poor for the type of product, they should put headphones like in past nomad models, this are pretty cheap. But above all it's a great product for a decent price, there's no need for ipod. If this product would come with mac support it would kill ipod sales. Thanks

<Title>Great Product for the Price
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First, I have to disagree with a few previous reviews. The software is very easy to install. However you will find all you need are the drivers for Nomad. Because the Nomad DOES work with Windows Media Player. In fact, my son's Dell DJ was much more difficult to install on a Dell pc than the Nomad.  I give this product a 4 star rating for two reasons. It is not a great looking item. Its very simple. The buttons are not lit like some other players. I would also not recommend this item for a younger child or teen. Its made of very light weight material. Perfect for me, but I am not so sure it would be suitable for my teen.   The facts are, you get tons of storage space for much less money. So I think the average person can overlook the lack of beauty from this item. The battery life is very satisfying. It will last you the 14 hours.Some have complained about the earbuds that come with the item. Is that really a big deal?I don't think so. The protective case that comes with the Nomad is nice as well. Transfers are quick and easy. I loaded over 600 hundred songs in no time.When shopping for an MP3 player, I definitely think the Nomad should be considered.

<Title>The Manly MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I decided to rid myself of hauling my CD's around, scratching them up, then wasting money replacing them, I knew an MP3 player was the way to go. I already had a small 128kb Pen Drive/Player, and it was okay for the gym or walking between classes, but I really just wasn't happy with the amount of space. I decided that I needed something with the capacity to store all the music I could concievably own within the next 5 or 10 years. This meant a 30 or 40 gig player, which realistically left me with 3 choices: an iPod, and iRiver, and a Zen Xtra.  Not one to drop 200+ dollars on just anything, I researched them all. The iRiver just didn't have many features that appealed to me, and I'm not very familiar with the brand, so I didn't really know if they had a reliable reputation. Apple's top-selling iPod would have been tempting, if I didn't hate the look, interface, and price tag. Not to rag on Apple, they make great products, but they just always seem so alien to me, and a little girly. So I looked at the Zen Xtra, which seemed to have it all for me.  Let me start with how it looks. This is the sort of player no man would be ashamed of, with it's slick aluminum skin, large, bright screen, and extremely sweet and durable black leather case. It's got some weight to it, which is good, because I like to know there's some guts in my toys. I don't feel like I'm going to break this thing with ordinary use, it is very solid. I like that it has actual buttons, and the scroll wheel is simple and intuitive to use. After my first charge (which takes about an hour or so), I decided to go ahead download all 2,276 songs from my CD collection to it (which I had previously ripped to my computer). This took about 15 minutes, which blew me away. The provided software makes it relatively easy to select and organize your music, which is all I really need it to do. Playback on the Zen Xtra is clean and punchy, though I will reccomend replacing the included headphones right away (they're decent, I just don't like earbuds). Finding songs and artists is relatively easy assuming you have your tracks tagged correctly. There are a ton of EAX features like equalizers, ambience, and such. The best one by far, though, is the match volume setting. This is something the iPod doesn't have that it should, and was one of the bigger selling points for me. Not having to reach up and adjust the volume between every song should be a must for any MP3 player.   Other than that, I don't really know what else there is to say about this player. it does everything I want it to, I take it everywhere with me. If I did have any gripes about it, it would be that I wish it were easier to skip to a certain song without leaving my current playlist. I suppose the battery life could be a little better (gets around 12 hours normal playing, 8 with eax settings on), but I charge it every night when I go to bed so that's kind of not an issue for me.   I would highly reccomend this player to anyone looking for a good, solid MP3 player with an insane amount of storage space.

<Title>Great Player for the price, works well, but the PC Software.
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an exceptional MP3 player for the price, without the limited usability that IPOD implements in order to stop piracy... they're only losing customers who have more than one PC and buy their music like me.  Let me see... $200 for a 40GB MP3 player from Creative, or $599 for an Ipod... not a difficult choice.  I found setup to be very difficult indeed, and I am an advanced PC user.  The driver on this disc wouldn't install, so I had to manually download and install the device driver from the Creative website. (This is why it gets 4 stars and not 5).  Also, the installation instructions are pretty poor.  It will say things like, "In the content menu select your music, and hit the send to device button"  Unfortunately for us, it doesn't give pictoral represtentations of what or where these buttons are, and the in screen buttons don't have a pop up label when you hover your cursor over it.  Very frustrating, but, eventually you'll figure it out... unless the driver doesn't install on your PC either, then you're left to either manually install it or contact Tech support on how to do this.  I've read a lot of complaints about not being able to arrange by folders... but you can arrange by playlist.  Either manually, which will take forever, or hook it up to your PC, and use the Nomad Explorer program to open your Nomad files on your PC and manipulate the player at your PC's keyboard (much faster).  You can sort, arrange, and do almost anything with this.  Arranging the files by playlist is virtually the same thing as arranging them by folder, and you can store all of a certain type or band to a playlist for easy access.  Though, you can not create sub-playlists, which would be conveinant if you wanted to sort a band with several albums.  It would be more conveniant to sort each album to a playlist.  So, though the initial instalation was a little tedious, the device program for filing information really isn't as bad as everyone is making it sound, and its easy to 'Playlist' a group of songs from your PC.  It has Superb music quality and volume.  I would recommend this product based upon Price, quality of sound, and volume.  But be prepared for a slightly challenging instal.  Still, worth the $300 I saved!!!

<Title>Overall great MP3 player
<Date>Sat Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this to play in my car and listen to while I go on my walks. \ I have had it for 5 months now with absolutely no problems. It has frozen up a couple of times, but the reset button takes care of it and does not effect the memory.  It has superb sound quality and is very user friendly. I don't think I will ever fit all of my music on it. It transfers songs super fast. My only issue is the size. It is bulky to take on walks or to exercise with. But for the price and the storage capacity, I can't complain too much.  I like the creative labs products so much, I am buying a smaller MP3 player (MuVo2 512MB off of eBay stores creative.labs at a great price!!!) for exercising with.

<Title>so far so good
<Date>Fri Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've only had this player for two days, and so far I like it. It seems pretty durable, I've already dropped it a few times and it was fine. It sounds really good, but I would definetly recommend using the equalizer to customize the settings, otherwise there's no bass. I didn't think the software was confusing at all. As long as you follow the directions it's pretty easy.

<Title>Creative rocks!
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my player after perusing various reviews of MP3 players here on Amazon. Although I'm fairly computer savvy, I'm relatively new to the whole digital music deal. This seemed like the best, the most storage space for my money and the option of using it to store data.  My player arrived in good condition. I transfered all of my CDs (including all 6 of my Harry potter audio book CD sets) to the player and was pleased that I still had a good deal of space left to store data files.  The EAX audio is a wonderful feature, I love adjusting the sound configurations for the varied genres on my player. Transfering files was a snap, and creating playlists with the NomadExplorer program was a breeze. I became semi-addicted to my player over the course of one week. Then, after a month, the music stopped. For no reason, my player kept displaying a "Harddisk error" message. I was heartbroken, and a bit angry at first. I feared I had spent over $200 on something which I could not have repaired or replaced.  But there's a very happy ending - I contacted Creative, and their customer service people could not have been nicer. In 24 hrs they issued a return merchandise agreement for me. I sent the player off, and within two days they diagnosed the problem, fixed it, and sent it back to me. The process was SO easy, and I could follow every step of their problem analysis on the web.  For producing a wonderful product and providing stellar customer service to support it, I give this five stars.

<Content>For the price this MP3 player is unbeatable.  The software is easy to use, you can even edit the track tags from the software when it's already uploaded on the player.  It holds a ton of music and it is easy to access from the music library.  I love the EAX Audio, you can really change the sound to fit what you're playing and the time and place you're playing it.  I really don't have any complaints about this player.  If you love to bring all of your music with you it is the easiest and cheapest way to do it!

<Title>DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM CREATIVE!
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Updated August 2007 (Originally purchased June 2005): I used this product for two years and it's always worked great. Compared to my wife's iPod the storage space was much higher for the dollar.   The only reasons I didn't originally give it five stars are these:  1. Sometimes if you hit two different controls a little too quickly, the unit just locks up and you have to reboot it. This was fixed by a later firmware upgrade.  2. The AC power jack is under the strap that closes the protective leather-like case, so you can't secure the case if you're charging.  3. Usually, the thing will shut itself down if idle for a short period of time. However, I found that when you plug in the USB cable to sync with a computer and disconnect the AC power, it doesn't automatically shut off all the time, and the next day your battery's dead. This can also prevent audio book bookmarks from being saved.  4. If you jostle the player, the battery tends to come loose, causing the player to reboot. If you're listening to an audio book at that time, you're starting over.  With those things in mind, the Zen Xtra 40 GB worked great for me. Until July 2007 when I bought a new Zen V Plus to get a lighter unit with a radio. First the software failed to install, then it wouldn't uninstall. Then I found that the software for my Zen Xtra wouldn't work anymore either. Creative's support is non-existent. I returned the V Plus and got my money back.  To fix the problem with the Zen Xtra software I tried to upgrade the software, which required an upgrade the firmware (which I had done twice in the past without problems). The firmware upgrade froze at about 3%, and left the player unusable. I later found out that this has been a problem for many Creative customers for several years and Creative does nothing about it. I've tried the "fixes" - rolling back to Windows Media Player 10, trying again - but I refuse to re-install a clean boot of Windows just to fix a problem created by the vendor.  Do not buy anything from Creative! They don't support their products, they sabotage their own products and they don't care about the consequences. If an auto dealership did this to a car they'd have to fix it or buy you a new car, but electronics manufacturers don't give a damn.

<Content>I've had this player for a little over a year now and love it. I've never had any problems at all. It sounds great, especially if you replace the ear buds with better quality phones.   Having read about the Ipods battery woes I'm really glad I bought this player with it's replacable battery. After a year my battery works fine, but it's nice to know I can replace it myself if I must.   Highly reccomended.

<Content>Well, I really dont need to add more praises. Kudos to the Creative guys for this player. Its great, cheap and real user friendly. The menu options, buttons, browsing are very good. It does hang, but very rarely (twice in 3 months now) The sound quality is great, and so is the battery life. The only fault I felt was that the hold option was digital, instead of a button. The leather case provided is an added bonus. The universal USB cord to be used is also an useful feature. Compared to the iPod, I think this is way better in many respects. Go for it !!!

<Title>Great sound, poor construction, cheap materials
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Removable face plate bent upon initial battery instillation. Very thin metal.  Player sounds hollow and tin-like when tapped...like the first Honda Civic did when you shut the door.  Plastic hinge pulled off of face plate (one drop of glue held it on), had to glue it back on.  Bulkier than competitors.  Controls are clumsy. Player is too bulky to easily manipulate controls on both sides of player with one hand(no controls on front of unit).  Why do I have to go to the menu to lock the player?  Why not a dedicated button?  It took me 2 years to beat my Dell to death on my outdoor adventures. This player will not last very long.  If you baby your gear and only care about getting the most storage for the buck, this player may be for you.  If you tend to push your gear to the limits, you may want to look at a different player.
