<Title>Looked good but the product was defective.
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A high-tech piece of junk! I was very impressed with it when I first got it in the mail. After a couple of weeks, while trying to transfer some music files on it, the device just went dead and would not re-start. Make sure you  consider the risks before deciding to purchase it.

<Title>Software and Documantation Lacking
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this and it plays songs just fine. Trying to figure out how to make playlists and albums and sort songs on this is totally confusing. It seems to have some unknown limit on the number of albums and playlists you can have and the number of songs you can have in an album. I keep creating them on the software, download to the player and the song is there but no album. The documentation does not mention anything about limits or sorting. If anyone can help, email me at tukesmtn AT yahoo DOT com

<Title>This player is fly
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player the first week it came out and boy do I love it! Its so slick that i almost got mugged in the subway.lol. I dont care for video support and massive HD that holds thousands of songs. I wanted something slim and sexy and samsung delievered the goods.Ah yes, I just upgraded to 3.5 FW and I just love the custom settings for EQ and DSP along with visuals.The bass boost is seriously so sick that you can damage your hearing.My only regret is not having cool cases and accessories made for it.Two horns up.

<Title>Get it!
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I decided to buy an MP3 play for my boyfriend, I did all kinds of research and was ready for a difficult time.  But honestly, all I did was stick the CD in, download the software and hook the player up to my computer.  I preloaded songs into the player so it was ready to go when my boyfriend unwrapped it. I didn't even bother with the firmware - the software included works with no problems and does everything we ask it to do.  Including creating playlists.    We haven't really explored the photo or video features of the player, so I don't know how well they work.  However, the Samsung plays music amazingly well and that was all we are interested in.  The sound quality is amazing.    In summary: easy to set up, easy to use, sounds fantastic, great price.

<Title>OK, not great.
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As for style, it's very cool looking. Functionally, the touch arrows are very sensitive, and the slightest touch will change you're setting. Also, one of the navigational arrows doesn't work half the time and requires repeated "mashing". Sound is great, and I don't regret the purchase, I just don't care for the sensitive navigational arrows.

<Title>One I bought had defective jack
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one of these as a Christmas gift for my wife. The jack on the one we received was defective. When you plugged in the earbuds that came with the unit, you had to spin the plug in the jack to find the magic spot that made the connection -- but even then the connection did not hold. We tried another set of earbuds and high-quality headphones with the device, without success: The defect was clearly in the jack of the MP3 player. We requested a refund and the Amazon return procedure went off without a hitch -- so 5 stars for Amazon but only 1 for the Samsung YP-K3JAB (only because you cannot rate an item as zero stars!).

<Title>Simple, Beautiful & High Quality
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this for xmas, and love it!  It's tiny, attractive and sleek as heck!  The sound is VERY GOOD.  Navigation is easy and self-explanatory, not that I require much where that is concerned nor do I have any basis for comparison.  The pad is completely flat and so pressing the buttons does take some getting used to (it's veeeery sensitive; subtle taps are all that's needed - any more than that will take you back more than one menu).  The LED display is really kickin', and I'm highly impressed they made something so classy looking with the simple (energy efficient!) LED.  Everything right down to the box it's shipped in is classy.  Go look at the video reviews on YouTube.  It's seriously nice.     This also has an FM radio tuner as well as a thing for photos that I haven't fiddled with yet. It will sort all your music by genre if you like, or if you import playlists it can do that as well.  You have to put those together in the software before it's transferred over to the device though.  One thing I love about this is that when you're stopped/idle long enough for it to power off, (a time length you can pre-select), this baby picks right back up exactly where you left off.   I listen to talk radio, so this is wonderful.  Listening time is at least 4 hrs between charges, and the player is  charged via USB cord that connects to your computer, not an a/c adapter.  The software they include for this is extremely user friendly, nice looking, and easy to use.  Like the player itself, I never needed to refer to the user manual or the help menus at all - it was all completely self-explanatory.  Samsung must know this, since the quick start guide they include is very brief.  Another really nice thing about the software is that it tells you how much of your alloted space on the player has been used.    Did I mention this thing's got style, and is really sweet looking?  Probably, but worth repeating.  I got the Eco-nique case to go with it, which I've mostly been happy with.  I like the fact that I'm paying for good sound quality and 4 gigs of space, rather than fancy memory-intensive pictures or an overly market-saturated brand name. And yes - I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for something simple, beautiful and high quality.  It may not have the name recognition (yet), but it's got everything an mp3 player should have IMO - nothing more and nothing less.

<Title>Simply the best on the market!
<Date>Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>YP-K3 came in a cute little box. I opened it, plugged it into a USB port on a Dell WinXP machine and it immediately came up as a hard drive. I drag&dropped several dozen mp3s (transfer was super-fast!) and K3 started playing them with an astonishing sound quality (at least as good as the ubiquitous IPod if not better). No need to get tied to a stupid buggy proprietary software for mp3 conversion&transfer. I refused to purchase an IPod for this reason for over a year. YP-K3 plays radio as well, and it looks very stylish. What more can you ask for? (unless you are looking for an overpriced robot dog or a massage chair you can plug this into.)

<Title>"Nano-killer"?
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone who wants something that beats an iPod needs to get over it. iPod Nano is a solid product and so is the Samsung YP-K3. iPod Nano is trendy, slim, holds a lot of songs, and has a nice, tough exterior. The YP-K3 doesn't have such a tough exterior, it has great storage, you don't need to deal with iTunes or the disgusting Quicktime program required to install iTunes, and it's just as slim as the nano. The touch controls are nice, people complain about smudges and how easy it is to skip a song, well anything with a glossy finish will have smudges. Do smudges make the music sound any worse? No. If you put it on hold and just listen to the music, it's fine. People who complain about this product are just upset that they didn't get a product tailor-made just for them, well tough cookies it's not a perfect world. The YP-K3 does everything I need it to do and more, it's a solid buy if you don't want to shell out $249 for 4 gigs of music and trendiness, and I like the headphones included. My only gripe is that because Samsung doesn't own 75% of the marketshare on mp3's there are almost no accessories for this, not even just a sleeve to put it in. The best I found was a full-face protective cover like they have for the original nanos and a silicon case but both aren't what I'm looking for. For now I wrap it in a microfiber cloth I got from another product and I have zero complaints. Samsung addressed most of the big problems CNET pointed out with firmware updates, so no problems there.

<Title>One SLEEK looking player
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The K3 is slightly larger, heavier and more prone to scrathes than its direct competitor, the iPod nano. But at a cheaper price tag, it comes in a much more appealing exterior - it's certainly one of the NICEST looking mp3 players currently available. I've been comparing the K3 to a 2G nano for about 3 weeks now using a pair of Grado GS1000 headphones. Soundwise, the K3 sounds more congested, with the nano sounding slighlty clearer. The nano has slighlty more visceral bass, but at the same time, has harsher highs. These differeces were slight, but noticeable.   K3 navigation is very simple, but due to the nature of the touchpad, accidental button depressing is inevitable. When the K3 is inside a pocket, it becomes difficult to issue commands as it lacks physical buttons. The player comes bundled with Samsung Media Studio, but is not required. SMS is a decent program, but its interaface is not as simple to use as iTunes. Creating playlists for the K3 using SMS is quite annoying, and nowhere as easy as iTunes. It does support Gracenote however and I find SMS's song-info-retrieval system to be excellent. Transfer speeds are slower than in iTunes due to SMS pausing briefly after each song transfer. All in all, the K3 is a nice player that I'd buy just on looks alone.

<Content>Great product for the price, easy to download music too. and easy to play. the radio reception is good especially for me I use this while I ride my motorcycle so I was worried but it's fine for that. the battery has lasted me for 3 days now and is still full. only thing is that the touch pad is pretty sensitive so you fat finger it alot, but it's not overly annoying. and if you ride with a helmet the headphones have to go cuz they fall out of your ears. but if you don't they actually sound pretty good.

<Title>The best choice
<Date>Sat Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this little device for my girl friend and she really loves it. It is slim, looks neat, easy to control with everything lit up at night when driving in a car. Image viewing quality is not great so I don't think that feature will be used often. Music quality is pretty good with original earphones.   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVR9ZA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1852428-4223213">Samsung YP-K3JAB 4GB Ultra Slim MP3 Player</a>

<Title>Great alternative from the Ipod.
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently wanted to get a MP3 player, but NOT an Ipod. Everyone seems to have an Ipod so I looked around for other good Mp3 players. I read a few reviews on this one and researched into it and this one became my final decision. I really like the size, battery life and GUI of the player. One thing you will want to decide is what firmware you want to run.  USA firmware (standard): -Few sound sets such as vocal, bass boost, etc. -Organizes music like most Mp3 player by reading the ID3 tags and organizing in Artist, Genre, Album, etc. -No text viewer  Korean firmware: -Lots of sound options along with custom bass boost and custom EQ settings. -You have to organize your music in folders, it doesn't organize by ID3 tags. -Text viewer -Plays .OGG music files.  Right now I am running the Korean firmware because I enjoy the custom EQ and bass boost, but it is up to you. All in all, I like this player.

<Title>Very nice Mp3 player
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very nice mp3 player, easy to put songs on your player. It is slim and the buttons are high tech, they arn't really buttons, its just like a push screen like the walmart self check out.  I got rid of this mp3 player because for some reason I couldn't open WMP, but it would let me play my music from my computer using the "samsung player" or whatever you want to call it. Secondly, I bought a FM transmitter for it to use in my car, which works pretty good [very little static] but its almost impossible to know which button you are pushing because of the way the buttons are so that is another one of the con's I didn't like about the player.
