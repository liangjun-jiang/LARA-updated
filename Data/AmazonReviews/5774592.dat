<Title>Not Worth the Price
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple Computers should be ashamed of themselves. I received my 40 GB ipod as a 2004 Christmas present and the problems began after only 6 months. Though I sould say, I really loved my ipod before it crapped out on me. I see a lot of other customers have had similar trouble with this thing and I just want to cast my vote of disapproval. The problems are: The computer/itunes not recognizing the ipod. The hard drive spinning up but never starting. The hard drive crashing and losing all data resulting in having to reset the ipod to factory settings and reinstalling the software and after all that having the same problem happen again.  After hearing all the horror stories about Apple's customer service I figure it's not worth trying to repair. Since this model has been discontinued, there's no point in telling people not to buy it now. I only hope that the new ipods are better. I'll be reading the reviews very carefully if and when I decide to get another ipod. Live and learn.

<Title>Better than expected, 4G 40GB iPod
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You don't find many of these new and still wrapped in plastic. I needed one with firewire, so this is what I bought. It was packaged just fine and I received it via UPS just in time. I'm just not fond of using UPS. As for the actual iPod, I love it. I had a 2nd generation for a long time, but after botching it up, I needed a new one. I would have gone with a video iPod, but both Macs I own do not have USB 2.0. Transfer rates would have been s l o w. I needed one with firewire and enough room to hold my music. I can't believe Apple abandoned firewire on the newer models. Mine even came with the dock. Apple has abandoned that notion as well in the new iPods. Having a dock really is nice. The price on this one might have been a bit much considering its age, but you can't beat finding a 4th gen 40GB iPod in new condition this far down the road. I'm protecting the screen after seeing scratches on my brother's 20GB 4G. I'm more careful with my stuff though, so even without the screen protector, I doubt I'll see much damage. I'm not taking any chances though.

<Title>4G ipods, the most unreliable one you can buy
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Be warned folks, the 4th generation of ipod is the most unreliable in the lineup. If you're looking for a cheaper old version of ipod (who needs video anyway) go for the 3G. My almost 2 year old ipod popped up with the notorious sad face icon out of nowhere and is now unusable. I have taken very good care of it in that time, never even dropping it once. I called the NYC Apple Store to ask about getting it fixed and was told I was better off buying a new one! How about that? Nice customer service.  Needless to say when I do get around to replacing my broken mp3 player it won't be one from Apple.  Obviously I will miss the use of ease I have come to expect but the hardware is simply not hardy enough.

<Title>Lemon of the Bunch
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In the first year, I had to send my iPod in under warranty a total of three times.  Twice, they replaced it.  My iPod recently died for good, and because I'm not covered under warranty anymore, I could buy a new one for the cost of replacing it.  When I looked into it, I found that loads of people with the same model had the exact same problems.  It's the lemon of the bunch.  There's a reason they discontinued it.

<Title>Another One Bites The Dust
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning my 4G 40GB IPOD for almost a year, it died out. Luckily, I owned it for ALMOST a year, and sent it in before my warranty expired out. Apple sent me a brand new IPOD with a postage paid envelope to send in my defective one. I was happy at the fact that they did it so quickly too. The only problem was that my problems weren't over. After about 6 months of using the new IPOD, it died out too. I have no warrenty now, so i'm stuck trying to  restore, restart, and all those other crappy "R" fixes that they have that don't work. Now it seems that i'm just another statistic for people who spent a lot of money on a peice of junk. Apple has made a lot of money off this product, I think the least they should do is have some sort of definite recall for anyone who has bought this model. It's really pretty discouraging to see this many people with the same problem. I loved the ease of use of it, but now i'm really hesitant on buying a new IPOD. That new Zune is actually starting to look kind of good...

<Title>Apple 40 GB iPod Lemon Club
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a member of the 40 GIG Ipod Club. Purchased first 40 GIG Ipod 2/05. First Hard Drive Failure 10/01/05. At that time thought it would be wise to purchase Apple Care Protection for Ipod. Second hard drive failure 2/22/06. Third Hard Drive failure 8/06. Brought it in to Apple store and the guy said the connector to the hard drive was loose and he fixed it (taped it in place). It worked so I was happy. He also said they were not supposed to fix them and he would order me a new one if I wanted, I was happy it was working and went on my way. Fourth hard drive failure 11/10/06. Brought it in and they are ordering me a new or refurbished one. I like my Ipod but this is rediculous. I guess the next one will last 4 to 9 months, I will be out of warranty, maybe I can fix it myself or buy a more dependable Ipod, or heaven forbid, buy a Microsoft Zune or whatever they call them.

<Title>Yet another 40g with recurring hard drive problems
<Date>Mon Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was lucky enough to have an HP service contract that extends the warranty for 90 days after repair. My iPod 40g has failed for the 8th time in less than 2 years or like clock-work about every 90 days. Always the same "Sad Face" icon that will not respond to any of the simple procedures that Apple or HP propose to remedy the problem.  I cannot understand why Apple has not instituted at least a trade-in program for this ultimate lemon.  A recent survey showed that it failed at 10x the rate of the newer models.  For me, I am not sure that I will ever buy an Apple product again regardless of a trade-in.  I really have never understood the cult of Apple.  It is no more reliable a product or more intuitive a product than anyone else.  It is all Steve's PR.

<Title>What a Lemon!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got it new about 2 years ago. I bought it from Apple's Refurb site, and when it arrived, it showed the sad iPod icon. I took it to Apple, they said it needed a new hard drive!!!! Then the clickwheel went on it, which makes it so it won't always respond. Then the hold switch won't lock on it, and then all the problems stopped for a while. Then 5 months later, it wouldn't even turn on, and then only the backlight would show, and there was nothing on the screen. When the warranty was up, it died on that day. Now it sits in it's box on my desk. Don't buy this iPod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>I got mine for a Xmas present 2 years ago.  Within 6 months it acted up, making me do the ridiculous R method of resetting it over and again.  Itunes refuses to recognize it and now it tells me that I have a corrupted iPod--no kidding!  At the moment, it is sitting on my desk like a dead bug on its back, frozen.  Save yourself years of aggravation, listen to those of us who have had this for over a year...caveat emptor.

<Title>To put it more succinctly...
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>...an excellent option in this field. Yes, you must use iTunes, but no, that isn't a problem. Yes it's big, and yes, if you don't have a collection of, say, at least 300 CDs or so, then you should probably opt for a cheaper model with less memory (unless you have to have very high quality in your files). Yes, occasionally locks up, but restarting is an easy process that just takes a few seconds. Great interface, great sound, great capacity, quick to transfer music, looks good (I disagree that the chrome backing is bad design), and even this larger model fits easily in many pockets or other such places.   One note re the battery: it is NOT the case that you should never let the battery go dead. That was good advice back in the days of NiCad batteries (which still appear in cheaper, smaller items) due to the so-called "memory" effect involved with those batteries. However, as Apple advises in the iPod section of their site (and indeed as other makers, such as Nokia, advise you to do with their products, as well), you SHOULD let the NiMH battery run out completely and then recharge it completely perhaps once a month. This scrambles up the electrons are whatever in the battery and extends its life as opposed to shortening it.  In short, you cannot go wrong with this unless you just plain don't need it.

<Title>The iPod is good but.... 
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Spent a bomb on the 40GB iPod (apparently the 20GB model is out of stock all over Singapore where I am at) and kinda regretting it, though I wont be giving it away to anyone. HAH!~! Anyway grouses currently are :  1. Songs cannot be transferred to PC which means only 1 way transfer from PC to the iPod is possible now! (installed 3rd party software does help.)  2. There is no cross-fading feature unlike some other players and no gap-less play. This means for those dance compilations or for albums like Pink Floyd's The Wall, expect some pause btw tracks. This is blamed on the MP3 format (but I wonder why other MP3 players can do it!) For gap-less play, Apple recommends all tracks be joined seamlessly into 1 large file. I cant search for a particular track like that!! There are petitions on plenty of sites asking Apple for this feature.   3. No Alphabetical Search feature which means all tracks have to be scrolled. So if you have thousands of artistes and bands, then good luck!  4. No casing or remote is given and they have to be purchased separately. These cost abt 68 bucks for remote PLUS another 40 - 80 bucks for the casing.   5. The iPod looks so scratch-able!! It's scary... what's the point of the iPod looking cool and sexy when it's wrapped up like a mummy. (that rhymes, take note)  6. The earphones are white... err.. unsightly to hook up my other (mostly black) earphones to the remote.  7, Remote does not display song titles.   8. Only ITunes can be used with the iPod. Apple does a good job of disabling other software with every update AND no drag and drop into Windows Explorer. iPod wont detect those files.  9. Battery does seem to drain fast unless you turn decide not to turn on the equalizers, shuffle feature and dont ever forward any track that's currently playing.  10. The remote cable is TOO long. I have to wind it round my iPod when i throw it into my bag.  11. Made in China! (doubts abt quality control... I always had the conception that products in China are mass produced and dont go through quality checks)   12. It's freaking expensive still!  13. Back to earphones, these are the type that cant be slung behind your neck... so when someone stops you for a chat, you have to hold the ear-buds with your hands. Geesh.. I LOVE complaining...   14. The Dock which comes only with the 40GB model makes no sense to me. A box which is used to charge the iPod but the cable connected to the box can be connected directly to the iPod for charging. THAT box only helps to make the iPod stand upright! DUH~! What diff does it make... sigh..   15. Gotta make sure all the files are tagged properly. This doesnt mean just renaming the files but editin the tags individually. Time consuming task! Else you get 2 instances of the same band and the songs wont be in the correct album, not in squence as in the album etc..   Phew... this is the kinda review you guys appreciate I hope. Something you should consider and what most people dont tell you. haha... the good thing is the sound rocks n I have an iPod and you don't!! Wait for Xmas and you might just get the out-of-stock 20GB model your parents bought for you last month...

<Title>Fragile & Disposable
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I dropped my 40 GB iPod in the sink for the briefest of moments.  Believe me, the smooth shiny case is conducive to slipping out of hand or pocket.  Water rushed into the docking port and the unit is toast.  Naturally, water damage is not covered by the warranty.   But now the bad news ... it costs $249 plus $7 in shipping, or $256 to obtain a refurbished iPod (nothing is repaired), compared to $399 for a new 40 GB iPod (or $299 for the 20 GB model with the same repair charge).  It is the same charge whether covered by warranty or not.  There is NO credit for being under warranty whatsoever.  Even a battery replacement is $99 plus $7 in shipping.    Apple product support personnel were matter of fact about the charge and the problem of water.  One told me of an iPod destroyed by being splashed poolside.  Another mentioned that he has raised internally the problem of water rushing into the docking port.  Imagine walking around with an iPod in even a steady rain.     A friend has replaced her teenage son's iPod twice in a year due to breakage.     My conclusions - the 40 GB iPod is a fragile, expensive piece of equipment with arguably a design flaw.  The excessive cost of repair/replacment undermines its attractiveness.  It was my first Apple product and my last.  Bad show Apple!

<Title>Excellent Item!
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It seems that the iPod was hands down the hottest Christmas gift of 2004.  I went to Circuit City recently to look for accessories and they were completely sold out of everything from the units themselves, to all of the different accessories.  I've never actually seen anyone who owns one on campus, so when I return in January, I expect that they'll be everywhere.    I opted for the 40GB version.  A lot of people seem to go for the smaller hard drives because they claim they don't really need 40GB, but I think it has more to do with the price.  Most people are biased towards the model that they own.  Although I think they're all overpriced and the 400 dollars I shelled out for my model isn't that big of a difference compared to the others.  I bought 40GB just to be safe.  Where do I start?  For one, you MUST use iTunes in order to run your iPod, which is one of the biggest questions people seem to have.  No, that doesn't mean you have to download your music from the iTunes store, as I think they're expensive and I have other ways of acquiring mp3s.  I have an enormous collection of CDs and previously burned CD-R compilations, and it's great to be able to store them all on the hard drive and never have to worry about lugging around my CD collection ever again.    I want to note that while one of the major selling points of the 40GB iPod is its ability to hold 10,000 songs, you must remember that the amount of songs you can store isn't based on a number.  It is based on the size of each file.  About 90 percent of my mp3s are ripped at 192kps which is equivalent to CD quality sound, as opposed to the more popular 128kps, which compresses the files to where they lose quality.  Some don't notice a difference, but believe me if you have a tendency to blast your music and prefer crystal clear sound, then you'll want the best quality possible for sure.  I have about 1000 songs currently on my iPod and I've only taken up about 5GB worth of space.  So if this remains consistent, I'll be able to squeeze around 8,000 songs on it when it's all said and done.  Although the chances of me even finding 8,000 songs that I actually LIKE is very rare.  I've heard many horror stories about iPods freezing up, going dead, or bad sound quality.  I haven't experienced any of these yet and from what I've heard, Apple is pretty good about accommodating the customers, so hopefully I'll not run into any real problems either way.    Supposedly the built-in battery only lasts for about a year and I believe it's 100 dollars to replace it.  Although hopefully a year from now, the prices will drop a little bit.  By next Christmas, I can see the iPods getting a bit of a price drop.    The ear buds are okay.  A lot of people hate them but I don't really have any problems.  However, my primary use of the iPod is in my car so it's of no real concern to me.  If you have a cassette deck in your car, then a good adapter will run you about 20 bucks.  I do not have a cassette deck in my car, so I had to invest in an FM transmitter which plugs into your cigarette lighter and uses an unused radio station to play the tunes.  I bought a Monster Cable iCarPlay for 50 dollars through Amazon and it works fine and also charges your iPod while you use it.  There are cheaper versions, but this one is the best.  Circuit City sells the same thing for 75 dollars, so you're best to go with Amazon for that.  Back to the iPod model itself.  It comes with everything you need to get it running.  A charging dock, and USB and FireWire cables, headphones, and the iTunes software.    The chrome back is very annoying and will scratch very easily if you're not careful.  Even if there are no scratches, just handling it will result in ugly fingerprints everywhere.  It's almost as if Apple did this on purpose so we'd have to invest in a case.  You'd think for the price we pay they'd throw that in.  There are so many different ones and this was probably the hardest choice for me.  I finally went with a iSkin eVo2 which has a screen cover, and allows me to access all of the outlets.  They run about 25 to 30 dollars.  Some cases do not protect your screen, and some of them cover up the entire iPod, making access to click wheel or the outlets difficult or impossible.  The biggest complaint people seem to have is about the battery life.  Apple boasts that it'll last for 8 hours.  I have yet to have mine drain out completely yet.  Even before I had my FM transmitter, when I just used the headphones, I was in my car for 4 hours and the battery was only halfway drained.  It seems that when you first use it, the bar will start going down quickly but then has a tendency to stop.  If it's really that big of a problem, I'd suggest buying a battery pack which hooks onto your iPod.  Someone else pointed out that battery life preservation has to do with the way you use your iPod.  The less you use your backlight, and the less you fast forward or skip through songs, the longer your battery will last.  Because of this, I always make playlists before I go out.   All in all, I think it's a great gadget and is well worth the investment, despite the current backlash that seems to be going on right now.  My only complaint is the amount of money I've had to spend on extra accessories.  Expect to spend another 100 dollars or so if you want a case, FM transmitter, and a car dock.  I haven't bought a wireless remote yet, but probably will in a few months, and that'll run another 50 bucks.  I give the product 5 stars easily.

<Content>I just received an iPod for Christmas and let me tell you, I love it!  It's quite compact and cute, has huge amounts of storage space, has great sound, the list could go on all night...or at least for another minute or so.  I take it with me everywhere I go, for example, the grocery store, the mall, the bathroom, work, church, my car, and even exercising.  The shuffle mode is great because it provides a nice surprise with each new random song.  Yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but after you realize how much more you get in return, you realize that you wouldn't have minded paying more!

<Title>iPod Changes my image of Apple
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have always been taught that the Apple is the Anti-Windows, a freezing computer with the whole computer inside the monitor. They were ugly until they came out with the pretty colors in the mid 90's.  The iPod has changed my outlook because my iPod has not frozen up yet, and i continue to be surprised at the things that it can do. Yes, it is a bit overpriced, and it is only compatible with iTunes. That means mp3's, WMA's, or anything else that is PC-based will not work with the little wonder. In that respect, it can take a long time to covert all of the music on your hard drive into the right format for iTunes. After you have all your music loaded onto your computer from your CD collection,(Simply insert into the CD drive, open iTunes, and press import on the CD screen) it is easy sailing. You can create playlists, listen to music, and rate your tunes. You can also sinc-up your iPod using the included dock. All of your music will go straight into it. This usually takes a few seconds it you haven't added any new CD's, or a few minutes if you have. My whole CD collection, which takes up a lot of space, only takes up a little more than half of the 40 GB. If you have a small collection, I reccomend the 20 GB rather than an iPod Mini. The Minies are cute, but they cost only $50 less than the 20 GB, and only have 4 GB, which is a 4,000 song difference! Believe me, you will want to be buying new music for your iPod all the time. New tunes only cost $.99 each, or the whole CD for $10. That is cheaper than you could buy at the store, and you can choose which songs you actually want!! There are some cons, however. It is difficult to figure out from the instructions how to add contacts and calendar dates. Also, the foam earbud covers fall off frequently, and can be difficult to put back on. I suggest investing in the In-Ear headphones from Apple. That will take away this con.  Overall, I would definately suggest the iPod for any Techie!!

<Title>Batteries still an issue
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Let me start out by saying that I love my iPod overall, but the advertised "up to 12 hours of battery life" isn't even close to reality. The best I have been able to get is around 6 hours. At first I was only getting 4-5. After some searching around Apple's site I saw some information that claimed if you use low amounts of compression, the battery life will suffer. At the time I was using files with Apple's lossless compression. I converted the songs to AAC 128, and the life has improved to around 6 hours. But, under no circumstances can I ever get beyond that amount of time. I can't even fathom what scenario might give you 12 hours of life. This is really disapointing for me. I was using Archos units in the past that were giving me 8-12 hours of life all the time. It also seems to take more than 4 hours to charge. Usually 5-6 hours.  Other than the battery I am very happy with the unit. Controls and interface are much better than Archos units. A lot of thought went into the interface, as it is extremely user friendly.  As long as you use iTunes to organize and sync your iPod you should have no issues. You'll probably find that you need to tweak the artists and album names in iTunes to get your music organized on the unit the way you want it. Syncing with the dock and firewire is very quick. 6,500 files synced initially in about an hour and a half. After that daily syncs take no time at all.  Nothing like carrying 450 CD's in your pocket. Just wish the battery would give me a couple more hours.
