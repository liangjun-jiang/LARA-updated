<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50-60.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3959501-0466003">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Great player for the value
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  I own 1000+ CDs, and at age 37, consider myself a bit of an audiophile.  I have listened to some songs from my phone, but never took the plunge to a dedicated MP3 player. Even after a few days, I don't know why I put this off.  First, moving music to the player was remarkably easy.  I just plugged it in, and the player showed up in Windows Explorer.  I copied MP3s from my computer, with no specific directory/file structure to follow, and they showed up, sorted correctly by artist/album/song, etc. No extra software to use!  No iTunes or WMP or Rhapsody or LockYourMusicIntoOurStore stuff!  Second, this is a fine interface. Yes, it is text-only.  But that is how I always listened on my phone anyway, I scrolled through the album titles and when I found the one I wanted, I hit "play". Naturally, if you REALLY NEED to see cover art, get a different player.  But if you are buying music, and not cover art (and also not little plastic disks and boxes), then get this player.  Now I have already purchased eight albums from Amazon in MP3 format, with no problems putting them onto the player.  Great playback quality, easy to use.  I won't go back... I can't go back...

<Title>Awesome value 
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just bought this little player today, brought it home, loaded some tunes, fired it up and been listening with a smile on my face ever since! It sounds terrific and that's the most important feature for me and this player doesn't disappoint. I'd previously been using a iRiver 512mb flash player and it sounded really good - I was skeptical that this Sansa Clip would be as good at this price but I really can't tell a difference and it may actually sound better than the iRiver. And, the display is SO much easier for me to see than my older player (I don't have great vision so this Sansa display is wonderful.) Loading up songs couldn't have been simpler - I already had quite a few MP3's on my hard drive, so it was simply a matter of dragging & dropping to the Sansa player under My Computer. I think this just about has to be the best MP3 player value available on the market right now. (Edit): I learned how to rip CD's directly to the player (thanks to the Sandisk user's forum) and man, I'm really loving this little player even more! HIGHLY recommended!

<Title>Exceeds My Expectations
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was about to buy the ipod shuffle, but found out it didn't have an FM radio, and it only plays MP3's. After researching several other brands and models, I decided that this was the best for me. I got an incredible surprise when put the earphones on and played some tunes on this Sandisk player! The sound quality is superb...it really depends upon the quality of the MP3 or WMA track you're listening to. It's just as good-sounding as my Zen Microphoto. The earphones that came with it are excellent-sounding...not the best, but excellent, even though the wires look a bit on the thin side.  The LCD screen is bright and very readable...I wear -1.25 reading glasses and I don't need them to see what I'm selecting. The buttons and slide switches are good quality. The clip is plastic, and spring-loaded. The capacity of this 2 gigabyte player is rated at 1000 songs in .WMA format; less if it's MP3. I'm sure you can get more songs in, if the songs are less than 4 minutes each.  I was pleasantly surprised that even though all I did was dump all of my MP3's unsorted, the Sansa put them all in genres, albums, artists, and playlists!  And about the only thing I wish this Sansa Clip had is a bigger memory.   It's smaller than a hot wheels toy car, so it's perfect for when you don't have much room when traveling. It has a built-in clip, so I place it on the back of my baseball cap when I go walking or working out.   This is a very rugged and dependable mini mp3 player. I recommend it highly.

<Title>Absolutely the BEST mp3 player for the money available
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When looking into buying an mp3 player I had several things I wanted, but wasn't certain--at first--that I could find: Great sound...FM tuner...voice recording...screen...size...Napster compatibility and most importantly, cost.  We purchased several Creative Zen Stone shuffle-type players for our daughters for Christmas convinced that they were compatible with Napster, which they are not...so we were a bit disappointed.  Oh, they are fine players, but not being able to download from our Napster account was a giant negative.  The girls chose to keep their Zen Stone's and download off our current cd collection.    So...the wife and I went on a search for mp3 players for us.  We knew what we didn't want, but weren't sure we could get everything we wanted at a decent price.  Out of the blue, we accidentally discovered the Sansa Clip and after a brief once-over, my wife and I decided this was what we've been looking for.  First, these little gem's are small.  Considering all it does, it is amazingly small.  Sure, it's thicker than the ipod shuffle, but the shuffle lacks quite a few of the features of the Sansa Clip--and it's STILL cheaper by not a little, either.  The screen is great.  MUCH better in person than I thought it would be.  If you absolutely INSIST on a color screen that can also show photos and video, look elsewhere, but if you want a screen that displays quite a bit of info and is VERY easy to work with, the Sans Clip is fantastic.  At first we were afraid after opening the box that it wasn't Napster compatible, which would've been a HUGE letdown...but after some 'net surfing and investigating, we discovered this: according to Napster, the Sansa Clip is NOT on their official list of compatible mp3 players...yet.  According to SanDisk, yes it IS compatible, it just hasn't been certified just yet.  What WE discovered is that yes, it IS compatible and works just perfect with synching music to our players.  Problem solved.  If you have one yourself and you wonder the same thing, take it from me, it IS compatible -- but if it doesn't work, try it using a different computer before you write it off.  Sound quality is also a BIG deal for me.  I work in radio and I have become almost annoyingly accustomed to digital quality audio, and while some people may not be bothered with this, I find it bothersome when I hear a song that is so obviously recorded from more than 10 years ago and you can hear that analog *hiss* in the background on almost all songs not digitally re-mastered.  Some people either don't care or can't hear it, but for some reason I do...and with ths Sansa Clip, the quality is exceptional.  One of -- if not the best I have tested.    Features that come with the Clip include the shuffle category, which I think could use some tweaking because when I put it in this mode, I hear specific songs repeat sometimes after only 3 songs have played...I want my shuffle to play all the songs randomly--but never repeat anything unless and until it has played ALL the songs stored in memory.  Call me picky, but that is my only real gripe with this model.    I like how you can choose music based on genre (country, pop, rock etc) and you can rate all songs using from 1 to 5 stars...VERY convenient--after you finally have all the songs rated.  It does take time to set it up, but worth it.  The voice recording is a cool feature in case you are stuck somewhere and need to write something down or save a thought you just had and you can't write it right away.  VERY nice addition.  Size.  For MY money, this little player is tiny.  I am constantly amazed I can carry with me 500 mp3 songs in such a small package.  Sure you can buy more memory mp3 players, but honestly, who listens to 5,000 songs that regularly that you have to add them to your playlist?  My wife loads anything and everything, whether she just likes it a little or a lot...for me, I like to download ONLY the songs I REALLY like.  I don't want to have to skip ANY song in my library--but if that isn't a problem for you, passing one song for the next is as easy as pressing the right side of the wheel on front.  Voila.  Easy.  The included earbuds are fine and provide decent audio quality, but never quite fit my ears all that comfortably.  This is not a problem for my wife, so I guess each person must weigh this factor individually because the earbuds are NOT one size fits all, more like one size fits most.  I have a pair of Phillips noise cancelling earbuds which work WONDERFUL and more than fulfills my audio eccentricities.  Finally, co$t.  For the money, I think it is VERY hard to beat the features in the Sansa Clip and quality.  I have yet to see a comparable name-brand mp3 player for the price that fulfills all my needs (and wants).  While one may be out there, I just haven't found it personally.  I am VERY happy and quite thrilled I have this little device around to help me out when I work out at the gym, go walking or just sitting around and need my tunes with me.  If you are looking to make an investment in a small player with multiple features at low cost, you would be hard pressed to do better than the Sansa Clip.

<Title>Great value player!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the 2nd one of these I have bought.  The first one I originally bought for my dad, but kept because I liked it so much.  Everything I could ask for in a player without the weight, size, or cost of *less functional, more popular players*.  Voice and FM recording work fine.  Audio playback is great.  The included headphones actually sound amazing, much better than any of my mp3 player headphones or my DJ headphones.  The plastic-y feel can get a little annoying but it's not so bad when you consider the price.  Also does not have the screen cracking problem that other Sansa players have.  Biggest problem with the player is the long recharge time via USB.  I have heard there are plug chargers, but have not yet looked for one.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.

<Title>Love it
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I first purchased a 1GB Sansa clip for my son, and loved it so much we bought a 2GB for me in pink, and 2GB for my husband in blue.  Great little Mp3 player!  Works great, easy to use, and couldn't be simpler to load music (and I'm not computer savvy).  I can even download audio books onto it from my public library.  It easily attaches to my computer for charging, and I've found that the charger for my RAZR cell phone fits this perfectly as well, if I want to plug it into the wall for charging.  Battery life is great, and I love the clip.  I definitely prefer this to the Ipod shuffle - for 2 reasons.  It has a screen so I can choose what I want to listen to very easily, and it is compatible with my public library's audio files.  Ipod isn't compatible with the library downloads.   I've used the earphones that came with it, and they are fine, but I tend to prefer the feel of another pair I already owned.  My son uses the pair that was included, and has no complaints. I've purchased albums and songs on multiple sites, and everything I've dowloaded has worked perfectly on this player.  I can't say enough great things about it.  My whole family loves it!  Highly recommended.

<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This MP3 player is cool little product. Exceeded my expectations, though when I opened the package it was much smaller than I imagined from the product picture. Plays with great clarity, enough power and the ear buds are as good as others have described. I like its convenience of plugging into a PC to recharge or take on new tunes. Very easy to manage. And properly priced, IMO. I'd buy it again!  RC in Sac-town
