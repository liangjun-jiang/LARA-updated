<Content>This sounds like a great offer. I purchased 3 of these, one for my boyfriend's birthday, one for me when I heard how great his sounded and one for when I had to send my boyfriends back due to problems with the sound and the radio kept disappearing and use the warranty to get another one. Within a month there were problems with both players. Mine would only play thru one earpiece and then none unless you held the connection piece in the whole time listening, and my boyfriends's started having a tinnie/tinny sound to the music and the radio selection would disappear with the first, the second one did the same as the first and then his earpiece gave out too. Now this was something that is internal so purchasing another set of headphones would not help. Also the manual is hard to understand and no company information was provided. Basically I am out of $$ since we both ended up getting better player for Xmas. Thank Goodness. Also the only game on it was soduku and it hardly ever worked.

<Content>I would not consider this MP3 play for one hot second. I received this as a gift months ago and just figured out how to get songs on it. The software is as useless as the manual. The manual had to have been translated into English by someone who has never read or spoken English. If you have the misfortune of owning this device, abandon the manual and use Windows Media Player to Sync songs, at least you'll get something on there. On the up side, it is nice to have a little gadget that if I forget it somewhere or it gets stolen, I really wont feel bad.
