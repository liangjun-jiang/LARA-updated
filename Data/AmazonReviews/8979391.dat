<Title>Snapbox not good buy
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the snapbox for a friend thinking it would be as easy to operate as my sansa MP3.............I was wrong, i couldn't figure out how to upload, i didn't like the play back options, do not purchase, the instructions were horrible............pay the 20 bucks extra and go with the sansa 4 GB  exccellent MP3 player  
<Overall>1
