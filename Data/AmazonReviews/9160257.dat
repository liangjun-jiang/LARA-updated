<Title>Waste of time and energy!!
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased one and the first one would not turn on even though we changed the batteries a few different times. We exchanged that one for another one thinking it was just faulty. The next one allowed us to turn it on and even put A song on it. When we went to put more songs on it the computer would not recognize it. We persisted, we tried uninstalling and reinstalling the programs and reseting the computer but it just wouldnt work. We also returned that one. Dont buy this product. the user's guide is worth nothing and costumer service doesnt make sense. Even though this product seems to be a great deal dont buy it. Go for something from a company you already trust.

<Title>Good flash player, great value
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After comparing this model v. others, I chose the Zen Nano because: 1) great price 2) Abundant features and comes with everything you need. 3) Works with many subscription based music services.  I use Yahoo Music and its simple to drag and drop songs onto the player.  I use the player mainly during workouts and runs.  The Nano is small and lite and has more than enough storage space (1 GB) for my purposes. The setup is non-existent.  Just plug it to your computer and start swapping files. I recommend that you don't install Creative's software unless necessary.  One, I don't think you'll ever need it.  Secondly, it slowed down my laptop's startup.  I highly recommend the Zen Nano Plus.

<Title>Don't bother....
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Recently purchased this item through Amazon Marketplace and I am stuck with something that doesn't work...I own the 512 mb version of this model and have used it for over a year without an issue...only use it for running because it is so small and clips easily to my waistband...this model has given me nothing but trouble since I took it out of the box 4 days ago...customer support has been a joke...if they tell me to download the firmware one more time....did it and still not working...won't play past the third song without shutting down or simply just stops playing any music at all...won't shuffle..keeps going back to the first song...waste of money.  Keep shopping for something else or just be sure that you can get your money back when it does not work properly!!!

<Title>A glitch in the product
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this since a week or ten days and found the following glitches with the product. If you have songs in different folders, and want listen songs from another folder , you need to restart the player.Isn't it annoying? especially when you are running/walking. The software comes with ,help you to organize the songs, but if you create a folder accidently, you cannot delete it. The battery life is around 10-12 hrs not as advertised.  And some of the best of the products are Good sound quality, FM radio, lightweight. If you can live with the drawbacks, the product is good though not a masterpiece.

<Title>Very Good MP3 Player - but is it right for you?
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[Note: Amazon seems to charge more than the list price for some colors.  If you order from Creative or buy at a Cambridge Soundworks store, you may be able to get a better price.]  I would have given Creative Zen Nano Plus (abbreviated "CZNP") 5 stars, except for two small deficiences: it does not have gapless playback (see #10 below), and the build quality and controls are kind of cheap (see #4 below).  Assuming it lasts, it seems a very good unit for the money.  Here's why I bought mine, and some questions to ask yourself when you're choosing.  [Updated 8/28/2006]  0. Do I want to make a fashion statement with my MP3 player?  Some people will only buy a trendy iPod.  Buying a lesser-known unit like CZNP makes a different statement, and you can choose from 10 colors.  I prefer function over form, but CZNP offers some of each.  I bought an orange one because it is easy to find in my black bag.  1. Do I want to play more than just sound?  The CZNP is a basic MP3 player, FM Radio, and recorder.  It has a simple monochrome display and controls that make it a good choice for playing music, podcasts, and ebooks, and listening to local radio stations.  It can record from the built-in mike or radio, or from a line input, which may be handy for some.  Some players can play videos, show pictures, etc, and cost a lot more because of the required color screen and larger memory.  I don't need these things and prefer not to spend the money needed to get them.  Of course this player can STORE any kind of content, just like a thumb drive, but it only plays audio.  2. Will I be listening to mostly music or mostly spoken content?  When you switch off a unit while it is playing, or pause it and it turns off automatically after awhile, some units will resume at the beginning of the current track, and others (e.g. CZNP) resume exactly where you left off.  If you are playing music, you usually prefer to start the song over again.  For ebooks or long podcasts, I need to resume where it was turned off (like CZNP does), because it is hard to fast-advance back to where you were.  3. What kind of accessories can I get?  Creative has a set of speakers tailored to the CZNP, and there are many generic accessories that will work with it.  By comparison, there are entire catalogs of accessories tailored for optimal use with an iPod (and may not work with others).  I have what I need, but pine for some things available for iPod only.  The best accessory of all is a cable that has a 1/8" stereo plug (like the headphone plug) on one end, and two RCA plugs on the other.  Plug one of these into the auxiliary or CD input of all the stereos you use, and you can quicly plug this in and play on the speakers.  Such cables are available at Radio Shack and most places selling electronics products.  4. How convenient is it to use?  MP3 players vary considerably on how easy they are to use.  The iPod is famous for ease of use, though it does not do everything I want to do.  The CZNP has relatively cheap controls that work well enough, and does what I want.  You don't have to be a computer whiz to use it or its software.  I have been using it while driving with reasonably good results.  It is easy to pause and start it, turn it off, adjust volume, skip or repeat tracks, back up or move forward in the current track, and small enough to hold in your hand and still be able to hold onto the steering wheel.    But if you want to skip to a different album, you have to skip, wait, listen, and skip until you find the first track of the desired album.  Of course there is a menu way of getting there more easily, but you can't use menus while driving.  It is small and light. About like a Bic cigarette lighter except twice as wide.  So far I have found the size very convenient; I don't think I would want it any smaller.  But being small, it might be easier to lose - which is why I bought an orange one.  5. How long will it last?  On Amazon, click the link "See all ... customer reviews", then look for the dropdown "Show:" and choose "Lowest review first" and click the Go button.  There are a number of reports from people who had problems with their CZNP, some bad enough to throw it away.  Some are real problems, others might be a lack of understanding how to use the player.    Despite these complaints, the average review is high.  You'll find about the same mix of reviews for most players.  I decided to take a chance.  My unit will be well-cared for.  If I have a problem, I'll update this review.  6. Can the battery be replaced?  CZNP uses an AAA battery which is said to last for 15 hours and can be changed easily.  The iPod Nano has a rechargeable battery that is not designed to be replaced, which means the iPod Nano becomes landfill when the battery no longer takes a charge in a couple of years. There will be millions of iPods being thrown away simply because the owner cannot make them continue to work, which has an impact on the environment.  There are now battery replacement kits for iPod, with tools and instructions, so this concern is lessened for DIY people, but most won't bother.  7. How does it sound?  The CZNP sounds very good to when when I use good earphones like Koss "The Plug", or when plugged into a stereo.    The free headphones you get with it won't give you the best sound, and you should not judge any player on how it sounds with the included headphones.  Go buy quality earphones for any new player, as this will make a huge improvement in your enjoyment at relatively low cost.  8. Does the player use flash memory or hard-disk for storage?  CZNP uses flash memory.  Flash memory is more expensive per MB/GB than hard disk memory, and flash memory players are smaller than hard disk players.  I would not want a hard disk, which I think is too heavy and too fragile for a portable player.  Get a hard disk player if you want to carry a lot of content, but make sure you have a backup.  Get a flash memory player if you want to hold the content you will listen to today or this week.  9. Does the player have enough memory?  I use Highest Quality VBR, which gives me MP3s usually 200-250 KBPS, and I get about 10 hours of MP3 music.  For podcasts or other material recorded at lower quality, you'll get a lot more.  With that much space I can have some new or favorite albums left on the player, and have plenty of room for content that changes (like podcasts).  If you don't use a computer regularly, you might want more memory, maybe even a hard disk, but 1GB is very convenient for my purposes.  10. Does the player support gapless playback between tracks?  Some albums have music that flows continously from one track to the next.  Examples: Radiohead "OK Computer", Dandy Warhols, Moody Blues.  The listening experience is disrupted if the tracks have a gap as the player switches from one track to another.  I don't know of any portable MP3 player that offers gapless playback (without Rockbox), though it's bound to come.  The CZNP has a brief gap with no clicks, but it is still somewhat disruptive.  One solution is to rip the album as one continuous track.  The Rockbox open-source technology essentially replaces the firmware on your player, and it features gapless playback.  It is supported on a few players, including some iPods, but not CZNP.  11. Does the player require proprietary software or hardware?  CZNP includes software, but since it also works like a USB drive, you can manage content with Explorer / Finder if you want to.  All connectors are industry-standard and you can find matching cables in electronics and computer stores.  iPod can only load music using iTunes, and other players require software supplied with the unit, or with Windows.  The iPod and others also use proprietary connectors, so replacing a lost cable is more expensive.  I would not be happy with such restrictions. Open standards promote flexibility and interoperability.  On the other hand the iPod is widely supported and it's easy to find compatible accessories.  For me, at a minimum, the player needs to look like a USB drive when I connect it to the computer, so that I can load it by dragging files to the player's file system, and the CZNP does that.  I want to have a program automatically create a custom listening program of various short podcasts that play in a particular order to support Radio on Demand, and I want that to happen by simply connecting the device to the computer, with no keyboard or mouse interaction involved.  I have not found such a program, and may have to write it, but I can do that if I want to.  With an iPod I have no choice but to use iTunes (or replace the firmware with Rockbox).  iTunes will not do what I want it to do, and there is no option to use my own or third-party software.  12. Is the player file-based or tag-based?  The CZNP is file-based: it will play songs in alphabetical order for a given folder.  Naming songs with a two-digit sequence number at the beginning of the filename ensures they play in the correct order.  It also has shuffle play, etc.  I had tried the SanDisk Sansa, but returned it because all content is organized and played on the basis of tags, exclusively.  While my music has tags correctly set to play the way I wanted, podcasts don't use tags consistently enough to play them in a particular order that I chose.  With the CZNP you can at least control the order by putting a sequence number at the beginning of each filename.  Tag-based may have some advantages over file-based (though not for my uses), but only if all of the content you want to play is properly tagged.

<Title>NO NECK STRAP in the package
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Despite Amazon's description, the package contents listing, and Creative's own website description, there is no neck strap in the package of the Zen Nano Plus.   When I contacted them, Creative support stated that "A neck strap is not provided with this product". You can, however, purchase one from them for $10.   This is a pretty shady move on Creative's part, and I am a little wary of purchasing another product from them because of this. If you do not need a neck strap, this will not be an issue for you, but if you want one, or just want the package to contain what it says it contains, you should look elsewhere.

<Title>Excellent digital music player-Athlete friendly
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, people complaining about the difficulty of using this player have either not used electronic equipment before, or have a hard time being intuitive. This product is ridiculously easy to use and figure out, although I will say the manual that came with it could be a little more descriptive. However most people under the age of 50 should not have a problem using it.   I am 3-4 day a week runner and I researched the helll out of MP3 players before I settled on this one. A big plus is it comes with a very comfortable armband and a small protective carrying sheath. Another thing I love as a runner is the fact that there are only 3 buttons to mess with while I'm running - two very easy to find AND press volume up and down buttons, and the scroll wheel for switching songs if you need to. It is small enough to fit in your pocket without even knowing it's there (a little bit larger than a standard cigarette lighter). Second, it holds 1 gig of music, which is plenty for the average athlete/gym rat/runner. Third, I bought it on Amazon with free S&H for 65 bones. Can't ask for much more than that. Who cares if it poops the bed in 2 years, it was 65 bucks for a 1 gig player!? When it does die on me, there will be another better player that holds even more music, probably even smaller, for less $ than that. Get into the digital age people, things get cheaper and cheaper every year because the technolgy gets cheaper and the stuff isn't made to last. Frankly, most people are just waiting for their toys to either break or become so old they can have an excuse to upgrade to the next best thing.    It's easy to use, shows up as a USB drive and can act as a jump drive as well, can be plugged into a CD player to rip a CD directly to it, has a mic if you are into recording whatever, fantastic battery life, is incredibly compact, sounds great althought the included earbuds do suck (don't all included earphone/headphones suck anyway? I thought we all knew that), has different EQ settings including a custom one, has shuffle capabilities, an FM tuner that actually works if you live in an area with good reception.... I mean c'mon, your 250 dollar IPOD can't do all that.(Plus it doesn't force you to use ITUNES). You can also reverse the LCD so depending what arm you wear it on you will be able to read the screen.  Don't get me wrong, IPODS are slick, but they are just so limiting with actual usable features. Granted I can't buy a bicycle with a built in Creative Nano docking station the way there are 4 million IPOD accessories, but I don't really need all that either.  This little Creative player has it all for a great price. You can't go wrong if all you need is decent storage, compact size, usable features, and a dirt cheap price to boot. Way to go Creative for showing us you don't need to spend hundreds on an IPOD to get a fantastic, inexpensive, compact player!

<Content>This works great the battery lasts a long time.  The only problem with it is that it says it can hold 500 songs but in reality it only holds about half of that -I think it's due to the length of the music files some may be larger than others-they should tell you that or make it completely compatable to hold 500 songs no matter what.  Other than that I love it-it is so small and the sound quality is great!  I would recommend this product it's great!

<Title>You don;t need to pick "fruit" for quality music
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative have a long legacy in digital sound their media players are much more versatile than the iPods of this world. This player has everything. It is small, has all the features you would expect plus some extras like a superb voice recorder and the ability to take line-in audio and split it into separate tracks. The only thing this audio player does not allow is naming the FM stations on the tuner, but that's it! I have 3 of these in the family (two black one white) and a Zen Vision:M (also awesome) - Creative rules!

<Title>Zen nano is a pretty good deal
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've bought four of these for myself and friends.  They're cheap enough that you don't have to worry too much about losing or breaking them (like you would an ipod). It doesn't have silly restrictions on what kind of MP3s you can play (but you can't play itunes music!).  It's literally as small as a matchbox and great in the gym.  One gig is plenty of music for one outing, and you can always change it.  I got one wet and it kept working.  Down sides:  The sound quality is a bit tinny.  The interface isn't as sleek and engaging as the ipod, but it's not bad.  Two of the four I bought stopped working after about 14-18 months of use, and there's really no way to get it fixed.  You probably shouldn't think of it as something that will last forever... or else you could get one of those 2-3 year replacement warranty deals.  Still, not too bad a deal overall, I think.

<Title>Does the job it's made for
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST OF ALL THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A NECKSTRAP!!! There is a misprint above, it comes with an armband - not a neckstrap. I was aware of this so it's fine with me but thought I would warn others.   In regards to the product itself I read all the professional reviews and this was basically tied with the ipod shuffle for best sound quality in the flash player category. If you are an audiophile looking for perfect sound you should get something more robust, because the sound in these small players can be slightly muddy. How to correct this? As with all portable players you need to toss the headphones that come with it. The Creative headphones are average and aren't really made to stay in the ear during workouts or running. If you are considering purchasing an ipod shuffle they will tell you the same thing - default headphones are always cheap. There's a huge difference in sound quality if you upgrade them to something better so it's highly recommended you do this.   I bought the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones for this purpose. They sound great and stay in place while running. For walking around or light house-work I also bought the Sennheiser PX 100's which have even better sound and are more comfortable for longer use.   The armband that comes with this is great and you don't have to pay extra for it like you would with an ipod. I also own an older 256mb version of this product. It received alot of abuse but still works fine. It also comes with a rubber housing so if you bang your arm against the wall it won't break. Operating the unit is a no brainer, you just attach the USB cable to the player and your computer. It then acts as a hard drive which Windows will automatically read. A little window will pop up asking if you want to open files in the removal disk. Then, all you have to do is drag and drop your MP3 files and you are set. It comes with a CD with software but it's not really necessary. The software does have an owners manual that is much better than the written documentation that comes in the box so you may want to install it anyway.   A prior reviewer complained you could not put songs in folders. This is not true. You can organize your songs in folders on your computer then simply drop them into the player. When you want to change folders during use just press in the wheel and select "skip folder." You can then rotate the wheel to the folder you want. There are many options available, for example you can set it to play random songs or you can play them in order. If you like to play folders in order you may want to put a number in front of each folder or it will play them in alphabetical order.   There are several equilizer presets such as classical, jazz, rock, or custom. I set mine to normal because I read that you lose a little sound quality to distortion if you use a preset. Battery life is good, I didn't count the hours of use but it lasted quite a long time and the batteries are small and cheap so is not a large concern. I wish however the armband had a small slot in it to hold an extra battery. It's a bummer to run out of juice while on the trail or in the gym but that's a picky complaint.   There are other goodies as well such as FM radio, microphone to record voice and even mp3 encoding capability but I have not tried them out. I only use as an mp3 player.   The bottom line is that if you are looking for a player to take with you to the gym then look no further. It has good sound, good battery life, good options, good armband, and is easy to use. What more do you want?

<Title>Best value for your money
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could pick a MP3 player for my birthday. Originally I planned on asking for an Ipod Nano, but I just did not feel good having someone spend so much money on something that I probably will loose or break (I have a whole notebook graveyard).   So after much research I settled on the Nano Plus. 1 GB is enough for a few days of listening, if I pick careful I can even go on a short international hop. I love the external battery, that is something I enjoy after my PDA. And I liked the small, white design.  Now I am using the Nano Plus for close to two weeks and I love it. Great sound, even on the underground train while listening to a low quality download of talk radio! I have some classical pieces that I enjoy hearing and there is full sound, even on the supplied earphones. And the battery seems to last forever, I am already over 18 hours and it still works.   Yes, the casing is a big cheap placsticy. I will just grab a cheap cover next time I am at the electronics store, and for what the player cost I can replace it in two years if its broken.
