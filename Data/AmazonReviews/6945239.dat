<Title>Finally, the drag and drop MP3 player I have always wanted
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the Sony Network Walkman and the Apple Nano Ipod.  Both sucked with the proprietary software to get MP3s on to the device.  This is the best MP3 player out there right now.  The only reason why I gave it 4 starts was due to the USB cable which has a proprietary connector.  If you lose this cable, you are screwed and will have to try and buy a replacement from SanDisk.

<Title>By far the BEST flash mp3 player on the market
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the e270 about two weeks ago and really put it through it's paces.  I travel on a plane about 10 hours each week, so I've gotten some use out of it.  Oh, and I watch tv shows on it too, which is surprisingly tolerable given the small screen size.  Positives: -The screen is way bigger than a Nano, and it's really nice -Plays Video -User changeable battery (when they release it, which I'm sure will be soon) -Flash upgradable using MicroSD (also, there will be full albums coming out in MicroSD compatible "gruvi" cards) -Sound recorder, with easy to use record button -VERY VERY sturdy, with a metal back, that looks great and does not scratch easily (I don't even have a case) -Plays FM radio -6gb for the same price or less than a 4gb nano  Negatives: -The charger is USB only which for 98% of people is not an issue, but if you need one reportedly the Griffin Powerblock works fine, as I would suspect any charger that allows a usb cable to be plugged in -A bit thicker than the nano, but I actually prefer the e200 form factor

<Title>Love It
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a beautiful player, a little bit bigger than the IPOD nano but that doesn't bother me. The fact that it has FM, and can hold pics and video is enough that I can deal with it being a little bit bigger and maybe heavier, but it's negligible.  Good: I like the scroll whell on this. I don't like the IPOD scrolls because I always move past the selection that I want or tab it by accident and select something I didn't want. This, you feel the wheel click so that won't be a problem. The buttons around the wheel is a bit small but I have small fingers so it's not a big deal. The interface is easy, I just dragged my music over and it was fine. Battery life is great. I already watched one movie and listened to ~5 hours of music and I still have 3/4 of my battery.   Bad: You have to use a computer to charge it. When it plays movies, it pauses in between scenes for about 5-30 secs which can be annoying. The screen is a bit small that you can't see the pics too clearly but it's a small player with a flash drive, so that's unavoidable. You have to convert the movies/pictures using their converter, which freezes my computer sometimes and it takes a while for it to transfer movies (~20 min for a 650MB movie). Also, there aren't that many accessories you can buy for it. I've been trying to buy an adaptor so I can use it in my car but haven't been able to find anything. And when you plug it into the computer, you can't do anything to the player.   Overall, I think it's a great player. It's a flash drive, so you can take it running and not worrying about possibly damaging the harddrive inside. I originally had Creative Zen Sleek Photo but returned it and got this one and I'm VERY glad, not that Creative don't make great mp3 players but this one is much smaller and has video and I can exercise with it (assuming I get off my butt and actually go to the gym)

<Title>So far I love it!!
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this from Amazon a few weeks ago and so far I love it.   I had an iPod 30GB video player that died loading songs the first time.  Apple replaced it and then the replacement died the same way.   (Apple gave me a full refund to their credit!)   I'm not sure why my iPod didn't work and so I've been a little gun shy with the SanDisk, but I haven't broken it yet!   Turns out, when Windows Media Player tries to sync with the device - it get's screwed up.  (Hold down the power button for 20 seconds to reset.)  But - when I drag and drop files - it works perfectly.  The album art is not displayed on the SanDisk and the Windows help site has an item on their FAQ about this saying it is a SanDisk problem.  Also, the radio reception is not the greatest, wish it had a little antena or something.  Also, I'd really like a wall charger for it.   Other than that it's perfect!   I REALLY like it - and - I haven't broken it which is amazing considering my experience with iPods.   Update on 7/14/2006.   The Sansa did lock up when trying to load over 700 songs until I did the following: 1)  Changed the USB Mode Setting to MSC from MTP. 2)  Formatted the Sansa from Windows specifing "Fat-32" - You need to be in MSC mode to specify Fat-32 formatting. 3)  Then I changed back to MTP mode and haven't had it lock up anymore.     Maybe with a new firmware update this won't happen, but I read about this tip on the web and it helped me.    Also - the odd song doesn't show up on the player (but IS in the Sansa Music folder when you view it through Windows) and I have to copy it over again for it to show up to play the song.  Also, I wish there was a easy way to merge songs in WMP like there is in iTunes.  And I still am not getting the Album Art to show up.   However, I have to say I LOVE this thing and I've been very happy.

<Title>Do All The People Who Have Reviewed This Product Work for SanDisk??
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>They must b/c I don't know how they're all so happy with it.  I'm not going to write a long diatribe here, but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270.  For starters, it's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services. It is compatible with Rhapsody, but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer. The MTC protocol (see, I told you it is difficult. . . and I'm not that technologically savvy) only works with USB 2.0, not 1.1, which I have.  Also, it scratches way easily. If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it.   The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next, but the scroll wheel is pretty cool.   I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better. The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you're in the gym or on a plane, you can hear all sorts of backround noise b/c it isn't loud enough. (And yes, I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $150 and I'm still not pleased with the sound performance).  I can't totally trash the player, although I'm super dissapointed with it. . .especially in light of how much money I spent on it.  Customer Support has been great. Quick and responsive. The player design is cool. It's small, but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate. The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking.  Overall, if you're looking for a player that's compatible with all of the music to go, subscription-based services, look further than the e270. If you are cool with paying per song, go with the Nano and itunes. Oh, and who cares about the expansion slot. 6GBs are enough.

<Title>Good, Serviceable Player
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This marks my 3rd MP3 player and I have been quite happy with it.  It doesn't have the capacity of some of the larger hard drive based players, but I've discovered that I don't really miss the capacity.  I had a 20 GB  player that I was very happy with until I left it on a plane, but I'm not sure that the extra capacity was worth the extra size, it was over twice the size of my Sansa.   I also have a smaller 1 GB player that I'm giving to a friend now that I have this one, 1 GB just wasn't enough capacity and the player itself was also just too small. The biggest plus I see with this player is that they have FINALLY incorporated the feature I've been screaming for ever since these players first came out, a flash card slot.  With flash card capacities now getting into the multiple GB range, I've been after a player that accepted cards in essence giving you unlimited capacity, as long as you're willing to buy more flash cards.

<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful machine, and I was very excited to buy it. Unfortunately, it locked up twice, once while synchronizing, WMP 10, and once while listening. Both times I could not turn it off, and it was unresponsive. I did not call tech support, because I have little patience for products that don't work as they should.

<Title>Very, very Satisfied
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I narrowed my selection to the 4G Nano, and the Sansa e270.  I selected the Sansa due to 1)Larger memory, 2) Available expansion slot, 3) Larger screen, 4) More Durable, and 5) It was different from what everyone else had.  The unit worked perfectly right out of the box.  The large display was excellent (I can't read a damn thing without my glasses, ^$#& middle age), I don't need my reading glasses to navigate and make my choices.  Sound was just as good as my Discman (I picked up some higher quality earphones, the ones that are included are good, the ones I added were better).  The unit was extremely easy to use, and stored practically everything of interest I had, from Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears to Green Day and Velvet Revolver.  And still has room for more.  FM reception sucks, but be serious, if FM radio was any good after Clear Channel ruined the industry, why buy a MP3 player in the first place?  The only down side is item 5) in my criteria, since its not an I-pod like everyone else, there are very few accessories.  Other than that, I'm happy with my choice, and would make the same one again.

<Title>Video clips?  Not really.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported. However, the video clip implementation is terrible.   They list a variety of supported clip formats. THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device. Everything must be converted. This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files. Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings. Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly. It will not work.   You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.   1. You are supposed to be able to import VOBs. WRONG. It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone. There is no way around this bug.   2. You have absolutely no control over compression settings. If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate. The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.   3. If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these. There is no way to avoid this. If you try to join the files, they will not play.   4. The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.   5. The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.    Pros:   This is really a nifty player.  I like the wheel implementation.  The battery life is amazing.  I have run full color videos with maximum sound and had battery left after 8-10 hours...I did not have patience to test further.  However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future. You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk. If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.   I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.    Update  The firmware is very unstable.  Do NOT try and read data from the unit, or it will go into a nearly infinate loop "UPDATING DIRECTORY".  You will need to reset several times, and if your file is large, wait up to an HOUR for the function to either work or fail.  Very frustrating.  ONLY use this unit with the supplied software and ONLY with Windows Media Player for management.  Anything else is a recipe for potential disaster.  I talked to SanDisk USA support, and they confirmed were aware of some of my observations.  Firmware updates are to fix these things.....someday.

<Title>Not worth it
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the SanDisk SDMX4-6144 Sansa e270 6 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot a few weeks ago and I am very disappointed.  The features seemed to be a better value that the Apple Ipod Nano but the thumb wheel for selection feels cheap and requires quite a bit of pressure to operate.  If you have a lot of songs on the unit, you will wish there was an easire way.  Also, after 2 1/2 weeks of use, the unit froze up on me during a synchronization and I have had to return it.  I am getting a refund and buying a Nano instead.

<Title>iPod lovers beware...
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPOD lovers beware.  There's a new player in town. The Sandisk Sansa E200 series.  Now for the review:  The iPod nano.  You can listen to music and look at photos. 4gb.  $250.  I don't get it.  The Sansa Sandisk.  You can look at photos, watch movies, listen to music, listen to FM, record FM, record VOICE, expand the memory via microSD cards, etc. for less than $250 for a 6gb player.  I have had my 4gb Sansa Sandisk, and directly compared it to an iPod nano 4gb.  Here's my thoughts. 1. Screen is better on the Sansa E200 series, brightness is unmatched 2. Back of Sansa is extremely difficult to scratch, Nano is very easy to scratch. 3. Sounds quality: Equal footing, i couldn't tell the difference between the two. 4.Navigation: I almost prefer the iPod nano on this one.  The Jog dial on the Sansa is a bit too tactile for my taste.  However, I am now use to it and doesn't harm my enjoyment of the Sansa. 5. Sansa e200 series you can import photos...such a small screen its not very worthwhile to put a high-detailed photo on there, but some photos look good. Ipod the same. 6. Sansa you can watch movies. I imported a Family Guy episode, and imported Lawrence of Arabia onto the Sansa.  Family guy episode went great, and fast.  It was only around 15-20 minutes long, and the sansa had to break up the file.  However, the only pause I saw once it transitioned from the first file to the second was a slight "jump" in the film and a small distortion in the sound.  Not bad at all!  Lawrence was the same, but the 4th file didn't copy over at all. Not sure where it went. I tried again, and it copied just fine.  The movie plays great.  Software is okay, but fine overall. 7. Accessories.  This is where any MP3 player looses out.  Apple is everywhere with iPod.  Car stereos, speaker docks, etc.  Time will tell how well Sansa competes in this area. 8. Battery life.  My sansa played music for a total of 18:42.  The Nano (with the same playlist) played only for 14:55.  Thats almost 4 hours extra.  Nice job Sansa!  And the battery is user-replaceable! 9. Software.  I used Rhapsody, Media Monkey, and iTunes to sort and transfer music to the MP3 players.  Itunes only worked with the IPOD, and Rhapsody and Media Monkey were fine with the Sansa. I much prefer Rhapsody than Itunes.  The feel of it, the ease of transfering, the playlist/last listened to features are superb, though itunes is good as well (it just won't work with the Sansa) 10. Stability:  Nano wins here.  The Sansa is on its 2nd firmware release, and a 3rd one promising a LOT of improvements is just around the corner (as of 7/14/06).  The Sansa has locked up once while transfering music, and locked up for 10 seconds while I was trying to back out of a movie.  The Nano never once locked up.  Good job Apple, but Sandisk is giving their Sansa a lot of support.  Overall I love my Sansa.  For the price i paid for the 4gb ($150 on deal, coupon) at almost $100 LESS than the Nano, the Sansa wins by a good margin of features for the price.  I just hope Sansa keeps up with developing new firmware to help out the stability of the player as well as add new features.  This and more accesories.  I talked to Sandisk and they said a compatible speaker dock as well as a car charger/FM broadcaster were going to be released this fall for the e200 series.  Sandisk, i give your Sansa a 5-star rating.  Ipod Nano, compared to the Sansa I knock you down to a 4-star rating.

<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What I like about the sansa e270 is the fact that I can play videos, mp3s and listen to the radio. when I'm walking on the streets I like to listen to the radio, when I'm on the subway train I play mp3s or watch a movie, that's pretty much what I need, the picture thing, I don't care about it. A way to make this mp3 player the best is improving the radio reception and the sound like any sony product. It sounds good, but it will be excellent if it has bass boost.

<Title>I'm so glad I waited!
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been researching and looking at mp3 players for almost two years.  I finally decided I preferred a flash-drive versus a hard drive, and I really wanted a battery that was user-replaceable. I didn't want an iPod, mainly because I felt like part of a herd - - I knew other options were just around the corner.  I've been looking at the Sansa products for quite some time now, and was nearly going to settle for a 1gb w/expandable SD memory card capability.  Then I found the Sansa e270, with 6 gbs of memory and expandable with a microSD!  For just over two hundred bucks, I got more than enough mp3/wma storage, PLUS a beautiful color screen to watch movies/video/pictures, a voice recorder to remind myself to pick up milk on the way home, and an FM radio (with capability to record off the radio - - do people still do that?)!  It has been so easy to convert my cds to wmas and synch them using Windows Media Player.  It even puts the album cover in for me.  It is so cute!  It is black, and sleek, and the buttons are very easy to use, even with my big hands and long fingernails, I don't have any trouble getting it do to what I want it to do.  I am assuming Sansa will be adding more accessories in the near future.  I would love a car adaptor and more selection in covers (only grey and white are available now).  The propietary cable is not a big concern to me, but I hear Sansa now has them available.  The sound is great, too!  All in all, I am quite pleased and very happy with my selection.

<Title>Very disappointed in this product
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've waited 6 months for this production only to find it very dispointing.  I've had an IPOD, Zen, and I've always wanted to search for a better player.  I thought this was it.  The ideas are great.  But the way the product was implented was terrible.  Here's some of the pros/cons:  Pros: Nice color screen, the size is small and feels good in my palm, the recording feature, the photo and video feature, the micro SD feature.  Cons: #1 disapointment of all is the navigation and control of this terrible, terrible device.  the scroll wheel is raised up too high and it is too slow in scrolling up and down.  It is raised up so high that the 4 buttoms surrounding it can't even be pressed.  You gotta use your long nail to press those little buttoms.  You have to rely on those little buttoms that are so hard to press to navigate through songs and FF/FR through your songs.  Besides the Pros I've listed, everything about this thing really kills me and pissed me off.  Now I have to sell it back on ebay since I can't return it for a full refund because I've opened the package.

<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me begin by saying "I am NOT a tech head".  I struggle to get by with most computer related technologies.  I have had no problems learning and using this mp3 player.  I like the fact that I can use the Microsoft software and all I did was plug the player in and the music was down loaded.  I added all of my CD's and was able to carry over 1200 songs with me on my last road trip.  I also use this with my workouts.  I only use the player for music.  I was considering the Apple Nano initially.  The software and Itune monopoly and high cost forced me to consider this product, I am very glad I did.  Alot of people have mentioned that they don't like the "cheap" feel of the wheel; I agree with that.  I also agree that the four buttons around the wheel are marginally hard to get use to.  If you have been considering a flash mp3 player, this one should be at the top of your list.

<Content>This MP3 player is good and easy to use, and easy to download music from your CDs from Windows Media Player. However one big drawback, the Sansa does not have a recharge plug.  The USB plug must be pluged into the USB port of ones computer, which is OK if one has their computer on, however on the road without a computer can pose a problem if one needs to recharge their Sansa e270.  This was an over sight or SanDisk had their head where the sun does not shine when they designed this system.  Hopefuly SanDisk will see the light and continue to give iPod a run for the money.

<Title>Great possibilities, perhaps a QA issue
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned an iRiver cd slimline, philips mini-cd mp3, and an iPod 40GB. I was hoping for something I could take jogging (flash memory vs harddisk or cdr). Out of the box I must say I was impressed with the little 6GB Sansa e270, but over the next two weeks flaws would appear.  One of the things that made me return the player was the order of the tracks; 1) actual track name 2) album (taken from id tags) 3) artist (also taken from id tags). This was a major source of headache for me as alot of my songs had incomplete idtags. I suppose if I had a smaller player (1 or 2gb) going back fixing the tags would be viable, but 6GB (or 8GB if you get the additional 2GB SDcard) seems daunting. I like to just dump my mp3s in to root or some folder I created so I can sort thru them that way, but folders is not an option for sorting. Now there is a playlist you can create ON the player, which is very cumbersome. Maybe if you could create or import them from your PC, but from the player is too time consuming. Compounded by the fact that once the playlist is made, scrolling thru the list is very laggy. This must be a design flaw, as the lag isnt apparent when going thru sorting by track name, album, or artist.  And as others have posted, the player seems to randomly freeze and require a power off restart. As well as the terrible buttons for the up down left right being so recessed by the wheel that it is nigh impossible to press. The wheel does not scroll fast enough thru the list either. An option I find great in iRiver is a 10 song skip, instead of having to scroll thru 1 at a time, which is great for cds (650megs). Something like 10 or 50 would be nice when scrolling thru 6 gigs, not one at a time! You pretty much are forced to use the sorting by Album or Artist option (see above for my pains with the ID tags).  I dont mind the Sandisk USB cable to charge/move mp3s as I have a laptop with me often. But I can definitely sympathize people wanting an wall AC charger for trips w/o laptop. Some people might only have desktops, so charging away from home is an impossibility.  Long and short of it, paid almost 300$ for the Sansa, I shouldnt have to put with these headaches. Currently I am trying a Creatize Zen for my flashdisk needs (jogging).. so far none of the above problems, but its also alot smaller (1gb), and I have had to return it once for failing (after a few days), hopefully this is just a bad unit and not indicative of the line.. (might have to go ipod nano)..

<Title>Good but could be better
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have already owned several large capacity MP3 players. The ones with hard drives always have hard drive failures eventually. I like the large capacity flash memory on the Sansa, no moving parts! I like the way it works. I like the user control, they are comforatble and easy to use. I also like the sound quality. I don't like the software at all, it sucks, expect to purchse a 3rd party alternaive. I also wish there were more assecories. And lastly, I hate proprietary power adapters as this has. I lost mine and SanDisk hasn't even been able to sell me a replacement.

<Title>I love it!!!
<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I absolutely love this product.  It has great sound quality; however, I did purchase a new set of headphones that I could use in the gym.  The functions are very intuitive and it's quite simple to sync with Media Player.  It doesn't get much better than this.  The only drawback to this product would be the lack of accessories as compared to the iPODs.

<Title>Excellent competitive approach by SanDisk!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the SanDisk e270 7/2006 and am happy with most everything.  It is completely flash/EEPROM (NO HARD DRIVE!), and expandable with micro SD cards.  It is easy to use, especially with WMP-10.  Microsoft has a few things with WMP I don't like however.  It's size and strength are very good 8/10.  There are some freezing issues if you don't know how to configure the USB MTP or MSC mode (don't place music on it in both modes).  It also has a lack of pulldown resistors on it's final stage amp output, leading to a 1.25V DC offset that builds up on an internal capacitance when driving high impedance loads such as an amplifier in your home or car  (headphones load it properly).  This makes a loud pop when switching tracks, but eventually discharges after several changes.  I've been told by customer support (which is excellent right now) that it can be fixed in firmware, which will come out next month (pull-downs are now in processors these days, sweet!).  Other than these minor, but fixable things, it's an AWSOME device!  Supports drag and drop without WMA/MP3 conversion!!  NICELY DONE SANDISK!

<Title>Sandisk 6GB Sansa e270 died after 1.5 months.
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player to replace my iRiver MP3 "brick". The sound quality is average, lower than my older player. This morning, after 1.5 months of LIGHT use (40 minutes a day 5 days a week) the player died without any reason. The wheel lights up but there is nothing on the screen. I cannot even turn it off. The power button does nothing.  Stay away !

<Title>I prefer over nano
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sansa mp3 player can play mp3s,vid files, record, play radio. The 2gb ipod nano is about the same price or more than this mp3 player. Only problem is that the lcd blanks out once in a while, this might be due to lack of batteries or something. Once u restart the mp3 player it gets back to normal. So if u wanna get a MP3 player and do not wanna conform with your fellow ipod friends, get the sansa mp3 player.

<Title>Awesome mp3 Player!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is very user friendly and has great sound.  I have throughly enjoyed using it and think I made the right decision.  It does have a few small quirks, like when it is in shuffle play it always starts with the first song in my list and if you have the micro SD card in it has to "Refresh Database" everytime you start but it doesn't take long.  The radio gets great reception, especially compared to the other mp3 player I had.  I highly recommend this mp3 player!!!!!

<Title>don't trust rebate or after purchase support
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player lives up to everything it should be but after purchase support by Sandisk needs to improve.  The rebate offered on line is a nice little extra but it really pissed me off that I just received a post card saying that my purchase was invalid. I checked all the requirements prior to purchasing and again before I sent in the form only to have it dismissed. I have ceased using other vendors that tempt you with troublesome rebates and I think it is time to do the same with Sandisk products. This is just plain false advertising!  Other complaints with the player are that Sandisk does not offer a USB cable for sale separate from the player. I asked Sandisk nicely about this and after numerous exchanges they agreed that they would send me cable as a once only replacement cable; after more then a month I am still waiting.  The worst part of the after purchase issues had to do with dealing with customer support. Mind you, the customer support personnel were very nice but the process of trying to get resolution was grueling.  They needed me to register my e270 but they wanted a serial number that is not easily found. I went through 4 exchanges of email asking for its location and a possible picture so that I could locate it. It turns out that you must disassemble the e270 to get to the serial number. When I asked why they didn't have any instructions as to how to do this, support responded that they don't want to have people know how to take the device apart. HUH! THEN WHY THE HECK DO THEY PUT THE SN IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT APART AND THEN REQUIRE THAT YOU DO SO!  I like the product but I am definitely not impressed with after purchase support.

<Content>the sansa e270 is very sleek with a surprising amount of ability. with 6 gigs i am able to load all the songs i have and still have room for a dvd's movie files. though the screen is small, the picture quality doesn't suffer at all, and remains sharp. of course the only drawback to watching a movie this way is that text can't often be read, but if the movie doesn't have any then you're good to go. this product is highly recommended for its size, form, and function.

<Title>A Great All-Around Player
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this item last week with 6Gb. It's a great device. It has good display and great features.   The *MUSIC* that you want can easily be dragged onto the Sansa. The device automatically gives the playlists of artist, album, etc.  The converter that comes with the item is really amazing. It was a big hastle to put videos on my PSP but the converter makes it so easy to put it on the Sansa 270. You can put pretty much any type of *VIDEO* onto the converter and it will do all the work for you. Im not a big *PHOTO* person but the converter in suposed to be able to do that as well. The *RADIO* can almost always pick up channels very clearly and the recording of the radio is good quality as well. The VOICE RECORDER is very good quality. It is much better than any recorder that comes on a cell phone.  The only few bad things about the Sansa e270 is that it does not come with a wall charger or car charger(i dont think that they even sell them) You can only charge the device by using the USB cord that it comes with to charge it in your computer. Also the Sansa does not offer a lot of storage space or accessories(but you can buy extra memory to put in your expansion slot)  I encourage you to buy this great item

<Title>overall good product for the price
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>when i first recieved the Sansa e270 it was all i hoped it would be: small(almost too small), good sound quality, and a very sleek design.  However, some things that i do not like about the e270 are the "cheap" scroll wheel, the fact that it refreshes the database everytime i plug it into the computer, and the media converter that comes in the package.     Loading music into the e270 was very simple once i mastered the use of windows media player 11.  The device was automatically loaded with all my songs once i connected it to my computer because the windows media player detects all songs and automatically synced with my player.    However, loading video was a whole different animal.  The media converter that came with the player was mediocre at best.  all the videos i had saved on my computer were all wrong types of video formats so the converter wouldnt accept them.  *IMPORTANT* to load video onto my device i downloaded the Videora video converter for the iPod.  This FREE program accepted all my video types anid converted them into a format that the sansa media converter could recognize.    This player is great for the price and i would highly recommend it to anyone with a [...] dollar budget.  Remeber to read the prodect detail carefully because this player may be smaller than you expected.  Also remember to download a program like videora to convert your video file to make them compible with the sansa media converter.

<Title>Absolutely frustrating
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The unit functioned for a week and then died. A day later after holding up the unit to a co-worker and telling them what a piece of crap it was and then tossing it back onto my desk, I noticed that the screen flickered to life for a second. To get it working, I had to rap it on my desk several times. Obviously, the unit is not working as intended or maybe this is the expected quality of an IPOD clone.  The IPOD killer turned out to be a Chihuahua. One female co-worker had an IPOD that went dead after 2 months and Apple took it back no questions asked. Right now I am going back and forth with Sansa support and I already see where it's going from their last e-mail "Please also be informed that any damaged inflict to the device voids the warranty." This means that the scratches from trying to pry the back lid open to get their serial are going to be the excuse they need to walk away from this.  Before asking yourself if you should take a chance buying this MP3 player, consider my experience. A NYC subway full of people with white IPOD headphones listening to music and there I am with the Sansa trying to figure out why my MP3 player isn't working.  ----------------  FOLLOWUP - TOTAL BLOWOFF BY TECH SUPPORT  After sending the exact quote materials from above, they replied with the following:  If the problems that you experience with your device occurs with regularity we will be replacing the device under warranty policies.  Should you have any other concerns and queries please let us know, it is indeed our pleasure to assist you.  Note the term "regularity"!!! One of the girls called Apple and they replaced it in 4 days! I call and they literally close the case in my face! Simply amazing support on this product.

<Title>Impressed
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used my little Motorola MP3 player for a few years until I found something I would really be happy with.  The e270 is it.  I am extremely impressed.  I love the fact that I can drag and drop files onto it without using more software to clog up my computer.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I flashed it to the newest firmware and it really does everything I want it to do.  The little screen is great, easy to read and bright enough on a sunny day.  I figured out how to do my own album art and upload pictures but in the end, it's all about how easy it is to use and how good it sounds.  In those categories it excels.  There are two small issues, one is that every now and then (maybe every 100 songs) a song only plays on one channel, this can be fixed by restarting the song.  I'm sure this is a firmware issue and hopefully it will be addressed at some point.  The other thing is that the buttons around the dial are a little on the small side and can be hard to push. I bought the Sansa E200 Travel Case Kit which is very nice, and a Trekstor USB charger which works beautifully. All in all I am very pleased and future firmware revisions can only make this player even better.

<Title>Pretty Good -- Hopefully Getting Better
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using the 270 (6 GB version) for about 3 weeks now, and largely agree with the positive comments on this site. Sandisk just released a v. 1.01.11 update for the e200 series, so be sure that you go to the Sandisk website and download the updater (all updates after this version will be installed automatically when you sync).  I thought about getting one of the harddisk based players which offer up to 60 GB of space, but they seem to have high rates of problems and disk crashes -- not suprising given the workout these tiny devices are subject to. So I 'settled' for the 6 GB version. That is a huge amount of music, certainly more than I can listen to at a single sitting. I have the equivalent about 68 of my library disks on right now, say, about 40 hours of music PLUS another 20-30 hours of old time radio shows. So a big flash memory drive is the way to go, and 8 gigs would be more than enough for almost anyone. Remember that the e200 series all accept microSD memory chips. Currently the 1GB microSD is going for about $US 55 in local retailers, less online. I expect that a 2 GB chip will be releases shortly at around $US 100. IMHO, only college students that are skipping all of their classes would have the time to fully use more than 8 GB of storage.  The removable battery is a Very Good Thing. All you need is a SMALL phillips electronics type screwdriver to remove the four tiny screws in the back and the battery removes as easily as a cell phone battery. I'm puzzled by the reviewer who complained that he left scratches when he "pried" it open -- no prying is necessary -- the case back splits easily from the front. Be sure to put the screws in a safe place (I use a little plastic bag), because they can easily get lost.  Which leads me to the next point:  The firmware is improving, but is not all the way there. One of the annoying problems that occasionally reported (and I experienced) is a hard crash and lockup -- this happened to me -- and the solution is fairly easy, just pull the battery and replace it after 10 seconds (not something you can do on an iPod). I am guessing it's some kind of operating system programming issue that can be easily fixed in a future update. If and when that happens, I'd give the e200 series an upgrade to 5 stars.  Note that the Sansa relies on the internal .mp3 file tags for artist/album/track information. This means that if you have music that was converted to .mp3 with bad tags, they'll have to be fixed for things to be identified and ordered correctly. I had that problem as I used early versions of RealPlayer, which apparently didn't write tags into the .mp3 files correctly until recently. It took about an hour to rewrite the bad tags with a tagging program that used the internet music info database to retag, after which things worked fine. As noted in other posts, the Sansa e200's conversion codecs for video yield a fairly a large set of quicktime files - a full length video can take up from 1.25 - 1.5 Gigs of space. Given that the screen resolution is very small, this needs improvement. However, it actually DOES do video and movies, and they are actually watchable with decent sound. It would also be nice if SanDisk would support some other common formats besides .mp3 and .wma.  Given that the e200 series has been out less than a year, it seems likely that all of these issues will be addressed shortly.   The best part is that it's not an iPod, and I'm not yoked to Apple's iTunes service if I want to buy content from a competitor. With the e200 series' ability to use microSD chips, I'm guessing that Sandisk hopes to sell movies and other content on micro SD chips at retail in the future. But it also opens up the possibility of easy transfer of home video as many camcorders can store SD format as well and with an SD reader and a computer it is easy to transfer all kinds of content.

<Title>Greatest MP3 Player on the market, it has everything
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted the ability to take audio books and some music with me both for the airplane ride and when I'm at my location and this device fills the requirement perfectly.  I've had my 4 GB unit about 3 months now and I absolutely love it.  I looked at the Nano and others and decided on this unit due to the expansion slot, the FM tuner and the user replaceable battery.  One nit, I wish there was some way to quickly scan forward or backward in a selection.  As it is now, you can easily move to the next chapter/song or move back to the beginning, but I use it for audio books a lot and the ability to scan easily would be a real bonus.  Now you have to menu back, dial down to the scan option, select that option and then scan through the song.  I know this is a nit, but if you want my only reservation about the Sansa, this is it.  Maybe Sandisk will offer this as a firmware upgrade.  Love it.  Buy this unit.  Amazon had the best deal.  I've since ordered two more units for my daughters who wanted Nanos until they saw my Sansa.

<Content>I bought this two days ago, it arrived in my mail yesterday.  I tried to turn it on, and it will not turn on, even my hold key was turn to off.  No where in manual it says, what to do in this case.  I tried their reset method for this unit, after that this mp3 player started, the method is press the menu key for 15min, which was under some other FAQ, and thought lets reset and see what happens.  I was ready to return this unit back to Amazon.  Now that it is functioning, I am impressed with this unit.  The image is crystal clear and sharp, no hard drive to go bad on you, and expand the music library with expansion card, the question is how much music are you going to store before you get bored with the old music?    Any way great product, great price, nobody could beat Amazon's deal.

<Content>Oh if only I could rate this item with negative stars!  What a piece of trash! The design of the player is nice and I love how I can drag and drop files through explorer, but just as I am starting to enjoy my player, it breaks.   The first one didn't last a week. It just stopped turning on by day six. The second one didn't last a week either and it also stopped turning on. Sandisk obviously doesn't care about quality control, since both players malfunctioned in under seven days. And yes, the batteries were charged and I did not in any way damage the player to cause the problems.   I'm returning my piece of trash and requesting a refund that I will probably spend on an i pod. I hate i pods, but I hate being jerked around even more.  Here's a word of advice to the potential customer. Save the packaging. I guarntee by day six your player will break too.

<Content>My first Mp3 Player was a Red 256mb Sandisk. I l;oved it even though it help almost noting. I then stupidly put in an over suffed backpack and ended up cracking the screen and something else as well so it stopped working. A month later I bought a 512 blue one and I dropped it a million times and dropped it in water twice and it still worked! I love these things but I fell asleep listening to it and the headphone jack bent inside and now sound only comes out one ear. So now I've spent weeks shopping for a new one and I kept coming back to this one. $170 for a 6gb video player!?!?!?!?!? UNREAL! so I bought it and got a silicon case for my Bday, only the case is a lent magnet.   The buttons are a bit funky and the screen a bit small but I love this thing so much! I could get a 4 gb Ipod Nano or w/e and miss out on this but Everyone who I know whos HAD an I pod broke theirs in their pocket.    Sandisk rules Ipods Drool. Amen
