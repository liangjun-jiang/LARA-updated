<Title>Absolutely Impressed!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: - Great battery life - High quality output (not amazing, but better than any other MP3 player I have heard) - FLAC Support (and support for a lot of codecs in general) - Line-in/mic/radio recording directly to MP3 - mic is way better quality than I expected - Fast HDD transfer speeds - No 3rd-party software needed (you can just drop files directly to it) - High-quality construction - User interface is easy to use.  Cons: - Ergonomics could be better - Joystick seems like it could break if you're not careful (although I've put mine in my pocket and haven't had any problems).   Thoughts:  I bought this player for the following reasons.  1. I don't want to have to install a piece of software to transfer files to my MP3 player. 2. I have mostly FLAC files, and this is one of the few MP3 players that has FLAC support. 3. I had heard that the audio quality of this MP3 player is higher than that of it's brethren.  So, I wasn't really sure what to expect when I opened the package it came in.  But, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the obvious quality of the player as soon as I picked it up (and I'm not easily impressed).  It feels like you could accidentally step on it and it would be just fine.  I plugged the player in to Sony MDR-V600 headphones, and I wasn't very impressed by the audio quality.  It colored the sound in a way that was extremely obvious to me, and I didn't like it.  After digging through setup for 2 minutes I find that you can disable BBE, Mach3Bass, and 3DSurround (which I recommend doing).  After disabling those options, it sounded great!  I'm in a band with my brother, and a couple days ago we decided to record one of our practice sessions with this player (just for fun to see how it sounds).  I am actually really impressed with the quality of the mic.  It really exceeds any expectations I had for it (especially since I didn't buy this for the mic).  The bottom line is: I view this as the "free man's MP3 player".  It works with tons of codecs, you can run it on Linux (because it uses USB Mass Storage Device driver), you don't need software to sync and it doesn't use proprietary codecs.  On a website Cowon had a link to, I found a video of somebody who created a firmware hack for the A2 to allow you to play Genesis games on it.  If it was another brand, they would probably be suing that website!

<Title>Cowan iAudio X5 60Gb Review
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned my X5 for about 2 weeks now. Hands down, best music player around.  Here's a few reasons why I think that: it supports FLAC, a lossless, CD quality codec - for those who want premium quality sound. It requires no additional software to transfer songs back and forth from your computer.  Just plug in the USB cable (your computer sees it as a hard drive) then drag and drop files, it's that simple. Great battery life. The overall appearance - it's sturdy, scratch resistant, feels heavy and it's well put together. Lots of other extras, like voice recorder, video player, fm radio, USB host mode, etc.  For me personally, audio quality was the most important factor, combined with the portability factor - being able to have access to most your music (in CD like quality) in the car or connected to your home receiver, without having to worry about your cds.  Now for the drawbacks, although none of these bother me at all: it will not play DRM protected files, and the screen could be a little bigger.

<Title>Exceeded my expectation
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got mine today and it is working out great so far. I was able to add my files in no time and started using it already. The best part is being able to drag drop all sort of files without having to install anything. The software that came with it can convert almost all video formats into the one required by the device. Sound quality is great and video quality is excellent . Have not tried the FM recording option yet though, will post more after I try it.

<Title>Perfect alternative to the iPod
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you refuse to be another iPod victim, and sound quality is your biggest priority, this is the product you want.  Ok, it doesn't have all the accesories the iPod has, and it doesn't have the wheel (which is, let's face it, a great idea), but this device saves you the agony of using iTunes, and it works just like a disk unit.   I only use it to keep my cd collection in mp3 format, so I can't say anything about downloaded music.  The sound quality is just superb, and the batteries are really long lasting too.  Plus, it has cool features that allow you to turn audio into mp3 without the need of a computer, and also, you can record voice messages on it directly through an embedded microphone.  It also let you listen to radio.  The annoying thing is the connection.  It uses some stupid attachable thing that can easily get lost and it is not practical (that's why I don't rate the item with 5 stars).  Also the joystick isn't very user friendly, and the graphics are more than elemental.

<Title>I love my Cowon
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got motivated to rave about this because I saw today in the Consumer Reports buying guide that the Cowon PMP got top recommendation.  I returned a Creative Zen because it is too cumbersome to use and would duplicate files loaded on it, or lose them ... God knows why?  It also would not let me record FM from the device to the disk.  The Cowon records FM radio, allows itself to be used as a hard disk. You can leave voice memos, listen to the FM radio, record radio. It is really nice and versatile.  It used many different formats ... I don't really use anything but MP3 at this time.  I have a slight complain about it on the sound quality, it is good, but not perfect, but might be better with better headphones.  The Cowon should also come with some kind of case, and a little eyelet for hooking a lanyard to it for around the neck or something.  The mini joystick takes some getting used to ... but it is so much better than anything else I have seen, and 60GB is great ... I can put all my music on it and all my audio books which can be really compressed a lot.  It is light and easy to use and it does not mess with your file data or the names ... a very understanding and helpful product when other companies seem to be about locking you into a certain system or making sure you do not share high quality files with anyone else.  I give it a 5.  I recommend it over about any other like device.

<Title>Best sounding mp3/FLAC/Ogg Vorbis player 
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned Creative Zen and Ipods, but nothing can touch this thing. If you have nice home or car stereo equipment, this is the player to have.  First, it plays CD quality (FLAC) lossless files, so instead of compressing your music to the sorry mp3 format at an average of 192 kbps you can listen to music as it was intended to at 1411 kbps.  Many will say there is no difference, but plug this thing into your home receiver or car stereo and you can definitely hear it.  Second, (and very important to me), you can bypass the itunes or any other memory resident programs designed to "help" load your music into your player - just plug the Cowon into your computer's usb port and it becomes an additional drive.  You can then drag and drop your files - it's that simple.  It is well build, with a solid feel to it.  It has a line-in recording jack wich can come in handy.  It can play videos, also. The screen is small for watching a movie on it (approx 1 7/8"), but I do not watch movies on this or any other player's screen.  Even 3" is too small! At a time when nobody owns anything smaller than a 40" HD flatscreen why in the world would you want to watch a movie on that little thing?? Anyway, for me personally simplicity and superior sound quality are what I look for in such a gadget.  Now, I do not use my home system cd player any more: I plug this thing into my receiver and have access to my collection in high definition music cd quality.  I get in my car, same thing. No more cd's to lose, scratch, destroy or forget where I put them.  They are all archived on both my computer's drive and the Cowon's. It's sad to see this, but we're all flocking to buy products like Ipod and Zune which do nothing but impose more and more restrictions upon us: buy (or should I say, RENT) music only from their sites, use only their sorry proprietary formats, force us to use their proprietary itunes and such programs, which invade, crash and slow down your computer and so forth.  Not to mention Zune, which will not even play Window Media files!!!.  In conclusion, this product is definitely worth looking at.  It gives you the freedom and flexibility to do a lot of things with your music.

<Title>Bloody Excellent
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I hate apple products and especially the iPods - I wanted something that works just like a USB hard drive when it's plugged into my PC and just works without me having to do lots of messing around with horrible software. This product is it. I can view and store text files, jpegs, mp4s and mp3s, it has a good FM radio in it, it can record radio, voice from an internal mic or from a line-in jack into mp3 format. It is bloody excellent and does everything I wanted it to do and more. The sound quality is even really good, and there is a graphic equaliser that has lots of pre-settings or you can set it up yourself. The only two problems I had with it were: 1. a laptop didn't have enough power to power it over USB so it would not connect, and 2. the jpegs scroll through kind of slowly. I love it.

<Title>Highly frustrated
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After my trusty Archos player's display broke, I figured I upgrade and get me a 60GB iAudio X5. As a journalist doing interviews, I was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3. A friend of mine loves his player, so I didn't even flinch when I saw the price.  Ever since then I regret my decision.  Apparently my player has a software problem. It speeds up all my mp3 files. I tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing. That is when I was actually able to upload mp3s, because oftentimes I received error messages and the player refused to do as told.  So what then: Upgrade the firmware. Sure. If you can make it work and I couldn't. The description online is poorly written. But it's essentially like this: Start with a fully loaded battery. Unplug the A/C cabel and unpload the Firmware. Now replug the A/C cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware. Well all it does is conclude that the battery isn't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else.  I.e. I couldn't get the firmware to update and I tried for the last hour.  Therefore I'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund. And I'll get another Archos - and continue to live with its misely 20GB.

<Title>Beware of DRM file formats
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After careful consideration of sites like Napster and other download music file "To-Go" types. The iAudioX5 will not be recognized or music files(DRM)will not play. Even when the firmware is upgraded to 2.11_b1. Also if you have Windows XP the drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and the max partition is 32G leaving a wasted partition that the iAudioX5 firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition. So if you need to "wipe" the iAudioX5 drive Windows 98(SE)can do this upto 2T in FAT32 or a third party software on Windows XP OS (although it needs to port through USB2.0 as well). NTFS formatting will not work! as the firmware is written to look at FAT32 sectors. Other than that this unit has many features and functionality that surpasses any iPOD!

<Title>Very good all around 
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second iAudio X5 product. I upgraded my old 30GB model for this 60GB. I have to say I really love it. It has almost everyting that you could ask for from an mp3 player. My main reason in leaning towards this product was the lack of necessity for a special software, and that comuters can read and write to X5 like a regular external hard drive. This, plus the folder/subfolder/file system -which is a much better cataloguing method than mp3 tags- makes finding and navigating tthrough your collection much easier. Especially if you primarily listen to classical music it is a big help, since you may have a folder system such as : Classical/Beethoven/String Quartets/Late Quartets/Op 132/the Lindays/xxx.mp3  The sound is very good indeed, I  do not like to use any enhancers such as EQ's or the Jet effects still you hear a robust natural sound. My only complaint is the earphones that come with the X5 which are shaped weird, the ear piece is too large and the right earphone keeps falling off your ear both due to the weird shape and the curiously miscalculated cord.

<Title>Excellent MP3
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>"I originally bought a Cowan iAUDIO X5 30GB MP3 from Amazon. I wanted to return it, only so I can buy the larger GB60 unit, which I did buy. I liked the iAUDIO so much, I decided to keep both the 30GB and the 60BG units. I loaded the 30Gb with music, and gave it as a gift to my older brother. The reception is excellent. I can hear the bass and the cellos to perfection. It took a little learning for a neophyte to learn how to use it; but after it was loaded with music, I couldn't let go of either unit. It is a great product. I recommend it to all neophyte MP3 buyers" Henry J. Zeiter, M.D., F.A.C.S. Author, "From Lebanon to California," at Amazon

<Title>A Great Player
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cowon's iAudio X5 is heir to the iRiver player - a high-end, get-out-and-push type of player for people who are fussy about their music, and who don't mind managing it closely. The sound is excellent, and this is the main selling point. Many players are referred to as "portable stereos". This machine truly is. Where the sound on the iPod is extremely good, the iAudio has a clarity and a lively presence that sets it apart. The iAudio boasts some sophisticated audio enhancement technology, but to be honest, the plain sound is so good that you really won't need to fiddle with it at all. With good headphones you can hear the cough of the violin bow, or pick out each of the instruments in the brass section. It's worth ripping your music at a higher bit rate to enjoy the improvement, or to use uncompressed FLAC instead of MP3 or Ogg. Luckily, there's a 60 GB drive for your large, high-quality music files to sit on.   The controls are easy enough to manage, though it does take a little while to get used to them. All the content is organized in a file structure, just like the folders on a computer. When connected to a computer the X5 shows up as an extra drive, so you can copy back and forth easily. You can transfer any type of file you like using the file manager, and if you don't mind using an expensive player as a storage device, you can carry your work files back and forth as well.  For music, the user interface is also file-based, and the X5 does not keep an internal database like the iPod or the iRiver. It will read ID3 tags to tell you what's in the file, though it also appears to ignore Unicode tags. This means that you're confined to albums (or folders), and possibly to file names. So, if you want to follow a particular thread or a particular genre, this means extra work. The best way to listen in a non-album-based way is to compile playlists, either creating them on a computer with programs such as Winamp, or through mastering the somewhat quirky dynamic playlists. (The dynamic playlist function doesn't recurse correctly, so you have to add one album at a time.)   In terms of amenities, Cowon provides a set of software tools you can use to rip and transfer content, though you'll probably have your own favorites, which you can continue to use. Unlike the iPod, you're not constrained in your choice of software. The most useful Cowon utility would be the video converter.  The device itself is attractive, light and sturdy. The external connections are handled by a proprietary (and easy-to-lose) detachable connector block. You might want to order an extra and put it away, in case these things ever turn out to be hard to find. Alternatively, Cowon makes a dock, which is the most convenient way to set things up. It's inexpensive, though it's optional and has to be ordered separately.   The screen is small, but very colorful and pleasing, and you have a choice of what information appears during playback. My personal opinion is that movies belong on a big screen, so perhaps someone else will comment on the video capabilities. The demo looks convincing enough, but again, my interest in iAudio is ... well ... the audio.  I bought the X5 after many (happy) years of iPods, for no other reason than to see what else was out there. It's always good to try something new, and sometimes you're pleasantly surprised when you depart from the norm. The iAudio takes some getting used to, but overall, it's an impressive and enjoyable machine. I like the fact that it's different, and wow - it really does sound good!

<Title>Three problems in less than a year
<Date>Sat Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Malfunctions: 1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music. 2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward. 3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.  Design issues: It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title). It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it. It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice. The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones.  Good things: I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it). It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. The large storage capacity proved fully necessary. You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).  My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks.

<Title>Actually too much of a good thing!
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought I had a lot of media, so I went for the 60GB.  After "filling" it up, I had only used about 4 GB, so I had to get some more stuff to put on it (podcasts, DVD's, etc.).  Great quality and durability!  A wonderful online community of users.  Some features that it has which I hardly noticed before I bought it, it has an FM radio, and you can use it to record stuff, either from the radio or the little bitty microphone that's built in.  It has another port on it that you can use with a digital camera to unload your camera (using some of those 60GB), so you don't have to lug a whole PC laptop with you in order to take more photos.

<Title>Don't you dare buy any other portable players!
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've owned several mp3 players previously including 60gb ipod. i was disappointed in all of them. most of them died shortly after the warranty expired, maybe they were made to be like that, i do not know. iaudio x5 is far better than any portable players ive had in the past. 1. it's very very very sturdy. once you hold it in your hands, you'll know right away. 2. it plays most audio files nicely. i have V0 mp3s in mine mostly but i did fill it up with some flac's as well. i use mine while i am driving, and i play my music LOUD. and thats when flac's show their true potentials and i appreciate this iaudio greatly. 3. it is very very very easy to use. just plug it into your computer, copy files or folders and put them in the iaudio folder. no need for some crappy softwares. 4. it displays lots of information on the screen. its something that is not totally necessary but it sure pleases my eyes. 5. the playing time is great. i do lots of navigation with mine, going back and forth from mp3s to flac's to ogg vorbis to so on, and it usually stays on for good 15 hours. my only negative comment is on the head/earphones plug-in jack. i wish it was on top of the player, not on the left side. but its all good, i cant have everything my way. ive recommended it to several friends of mine who were victims of crappy ipods. 4 of them purchased this since, and theyre all happy with it. oh one more negative comment: dont know if its just me but the picture view quality is quite bad. i dont need it for pictures anyway so not a big  concern for me =)

<Content>This is an excellent audio player! It plays most every type of compressed audio file, but is one of the few that includes support for lossless FLAC files. The hard drive is fair-sized and the included accessories are very generous: headphones, screen protectors, 12" audio connector cable, USB cable, and charger. The charger dongle/attachment includes ports for USB connections, line-out, and line-in feeds. The design is very accessible, though the detachable USB and power connector/dongle does present the possibility for losing an important component. It is roughly the size of a RAZR phone, though about twice as thick. [....]
