<Title>Worth the money but don't expect IPOD quality

<Content>This is a pretty good mp3 player for casual music listeners and you won't find a better price for all the features that this thing has. It only holds +125 songs so you can't put every cd you ever owned on it but it can hold your favorite songs that you would want to listen to on the go.  The fact that it is a USB storage device, Voice Recorder, radio tuner (you can also record stuff off the radio), picture viewer, and movie player make it an even better deal. The screen is very small but the OLED screen allow pictures and movies to be seen pretty clearly. And just the fact that it has a screen is cool in itself. As for the movie player, you have to first convert regular video files into .MTV files (the software is included) but the process is pretty straightforward.  The only problem is that in order to keep costs down this product was not made very durable at all. I'm pretty sure if it were dropped a couple of times it would stop working, and the buttons seem really fragile.  So if you really want something that will last you might as well spend a lot more money on an IPOD or iRIVER. But a friend of mine paid $300+ for an iRIVER a few months ago and its already old because it doesn't play video files. i, on the other hand, am very happy with this player and even it lasts me 2-3 years it would be worth the price. And at that point a 5-20 GB mp3 player with the same features might only cost $100.

<Content>I purchased a visual land vl 546 2 months ago and it keeps turning itself on and off.  The sound is great if you can keep it playing.  Also they carry a one year warranty, but you have to pay $19.00 plus shipping for them to repair it.  I think thats a rip-off.  Also its hard to get in contact with their customer support.  There's no phone number only an email address.  I think their MP3 players are cheaply made.
