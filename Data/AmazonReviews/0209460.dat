<Title>A Small Piece of Garbage for a Big Price
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product was an insurance replacement for my previous Flashtrax.  I very much regret this purchase.  My photography store only carried these at the time, so I really had no choice since the Insurance Company put them in charge of replacing my goods.  Here are some of my reasons:  1) 8bit file system. Not only do I use this product for my photography, but I use it as an MP3 player and to transport files.  Unless you plan on time warping your computer back about 10 years, to an archaic 8bit file system, the truncation if files is an extreme annoyance. ie: "myfilename001.jpg" becomes "myfile~1.jpg" and Elvis Presley-Rubberneckin.mp3 becomes "elvi~1.mp3"  Finding the MP3 you want; forget about it.  2) File Sorting Lord have mercy on your soul if you listen to Audio Books.  I do.  Let's assume that I have time to rename 150 mp3 chapters of my audio book if 8 letters or less filenames.  Then I HOPE that each file was created/modified in order - You see, the P-2000 sorts files and folders according to DATE and TIME.  It's incapable of sorting files by filename!! You can't create any play lists OR listen to mp3s in order alphabetically or numerically!  3) Slow Copying files from my Sandisk Extreme III 82x 1gig CF card is slow and painful.  Hope you have a back up battery.  4) Highly Proprietary OS. Ok, so using the P-2000 for MP3's is useless, but at least I still have my photography, yeah?  So I've copied a fresh batch of Canon files to the P-2000 and wish to put them in a folder for viewing (they call them albums).  What the?!  Why are all of my files being copied, then renamed to some Epson proprietary naming system!?  My immaculate Canon file naming system is apparently not good enough this lil baby.  Instead of simply renaming the, the unit COPIES the files into the new files with new names taking up a lot of time, and wear and tear on the hard drive.  Also, can you say "bye bye battery?"  In general, using the file system with Windows file explorer is difficult.  Folders (or albums) that you see while using the unit are not the same that you see in Windows explorer  Example, Lets say you want to create a new folder to throw other photos in from you HDD.  Sorry, no.  You have to use Epson's proprietary "album creating" steps to do this.  Apparently Epson is still learning how to use a standard file system.  So now you're created a folder called "Photos from September 04th 2005; logically, you should be able to plug in your USB in and just copy your files over, yeah?  Sorry, no.  Now you have to find the CODE name Epson gave this album in you folder list.  Just finding the folder with the name you gave it would be too easy.  Epson called mine "ALBM0254." This meant that I had to search about 250 folders to find the one I just created.  I hoped "ALBM0254"  was the right one to copy my files into.  The best way to know for sure, is to put one file into the folder, unplug the device from the UBS, turn it on, browse to folder 254, see if the file is in there, if it is then plug it back in and copy the rest of the files over.  If not, well, try again.  5) Bad Battery?  Too bad. According to Epsons documentation, , using the P-2000 without a battery (AC Only) will damage the unit.  So, if my battery fails me at some point, and I have the day's worth of pictures on this unit, I am unable to recover them until I call Epson and order another proprietary battery. $80.  Until then my clients will just have to wait till a new battery shipped out to me.   6) Media Support Not all it's hyped up to be.  I haven't yet found a proper AVI/Mpeg that it can play.  It claims to be able to play QuickTime .MOV files, but the only one that I've gotten to play (aside from the sample it came with) was some weird and obscure music video I found on the net.  As the only playable MOV file that I've found, I keep it on my P-2000, so I can watch it every now and then feel like I haven't been raped by Epson.  If Cavemen had Portable Photo-Storage units, they'd have P-2000s;  Old technology based software and OS  7) Extra Stuff: I was spoiled by the accessories that came with my Flashtrax.  I got a remote control (which I honestly did use) and external Video / Audio cables to connect to my TV/Stereo.  The Epson does not come with those.  8) Technical Support. I have tried to contact Epson (Canada) in regards to the file sorting issues (twice) over the last week, however I have not heard back from them yet.    To be fair, this unit is much sturdier than my previous Flashtrax (after all, cavemen use it), and the battery life is excellent.  The screen and picture are excellent.

<Title>Great Screen, Primitive Software
<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The screen on this baby is gorgeous, but the people who wrote the software need to go play with a few MP3 players and similar devices to get a clue on usability.  The user's guide tells you that you may only copy files to a particular folder on the device; then you have to unplug it from the PC, power it up, and move the files to an Album by punching buttons.  It's been noted that all photos copied to it get rewritten with cryptic Epson file names to cryptically name Epson folders, which makes it next to impossible to totally manage the device from your PC.  The alternative is wearing your thumb out punching buttons to do it on the P2000 itself.  Sorting is done only by date/time, so if you retouch just a few of your vacation pictures on your PC, and then copy all your photos over to show the relatives, you are hosed unless you modify date/time on all photos.  Zoom in is a great feature, my only complaint is there is no single button push to back out to normal size.  Would I buy this one again?  I'd have to look really hard at alternative products.  Am I sorry I own the P2000?  No - I've learned to deal with it.

<Title>Great way to save your photos on the road
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit to save photos while I'm traveling and I can't bring my laptop. I shoot many many pictures when I travel and then when I get home I go through them keeping only the few best ones. Since I shoot large files, 12 megs, I fill up my memory cards very quickly. With this unit I can quickly download my cards and get back to shooting. The display is fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that even though they have made it very easy to download memory cards into the unit, if you want to transfer files from your computer to the viewer it is a bit more complicated. But, if you read the manual closely it does work. There are cheaper ways to save your files on the road, but none that has a display as large, crisp and clear as this one. I highly recommend the Epson P-2000.

<Title>Photographers this is the one!
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just wrote a review of the Creative Zen Vision which I ordered and returned last week because of the incredibly bad screen viewing angle.  No such problem with the Epson!  The Epson arrived a few days ago. The screen is wonderful. Everything the Vision should have been. Clear, sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle. No shimmering at all. Same size, same dimensions (640x480) but has a zoom feature that works very well.  The Epson doesn't have the same tight build as the Vision and the device is a considerably bigger in size, with a slightly cheaper, plastic body. Slightly bigger hard drive. Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot. Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio. I didn't buy the Vision nor the Epson for the radio.  That said I'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision.  Video playback is very clean with no stutters. Sharp image. Haven't tested the music playback much but seems fine. The external speaker is fair for such a device but certainly no substitute for even the most basic of computer speakers.  The device boots fairly quickly (5 seconds or so, much faster than the Vision). Navigation is simple. File transfer is very simple to manage.  The battery drains fairly rapidly (about an hour of playback of photo's) but it does pop up a screen recommending you recharge (nice).  It doesn't come with a mini to RCA cable (the Vision does) for playback from the device to a TV. They recommend you buy one in the manual (gee thanks).  Any photographer should be happy with this device. Not as portable or elegant as the Vision but the screen wins hands down, I kid you not.

<Title>Found a way to view Avis!
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One of my disappointments with the P2000, which I really like, was the inability to view the avis I get from my Canon camera.  I tried converting to mpeg4, but the simpler mpeg4 conversions are visually poor.  Someone recommended the program Video Vault PVP to me and it is easy to use.  All I have to do is tell it I want to convert the file for use on the P2000 (or I imagine the P4000).  The conversion process is very fast, the video excellent, and the compression makes for a much smaller file.  (...)I wish the transfer of a one gig card full of images went a bit faster and there was an external charger available for the unit. Isabel

<Title>Not reliable enough for photo backups on the go 
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice portable viewer but do not buy it to use to copy photos from your memory cards in the field, it is not reliable enough for that.  I stored over 13 gigs of photos on it during a recent trip and two folders of over 300 photos "disappeared".  I could not view or download the photos.  I thought they were lost or corrupted, but I was able to recover them using the $200 OnTrack Easy Recovery Program. Although it was the only way I would have recovered my photos, Epson later told me not to use it.  I also had problems with the battery not charging within the first week and even problems running the unit on AC power.  All this happened in the first month I had the unit, but Epson would not refund or replace the unit.  I sent it to them for warranty service and it came back quickly with no explanation of what they did.  I have no confidence I can save photos to this unit as backup, which is the reason I bought it. If you are willing to spend this much on a portable viewer, it is excellent, but if you want a reliable tool to backup photos on the go, DON'T BUY THE EPSON P-2000 or P-4000, stick with a laptop.

<Title>Great News! It's easy to download movies!
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just bought my P-2000 Yes, I'll be using it to transfer cards while on the road. I shoot 2000 frames a week doing destination weddings.   I also wanted to use it to watch movies; I fly alot. Anyway... I read MANY reviews saying it was very difficult to create a file it would accept. THIS WAS TRUE UNTIL NOW. If you own this unit and want to watch your favorite film simply get VIDEO VAULT PVP EDITION. Google "Video Vault" and you'll find it.  Working with the program is super easy, video quality is fantastic. I now travel with no fewer than a dozen movies. Too cool.

<Title>Needs some improvement, but what an awesome device!
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been a professional photographer for about 20 years, but I did have a hiatus in that span in which photography fell by the wayside. I've gotten back into the craft and for the most part, I have kissed film goodbye - and I would have bet my left arm that would never happen. I just bought a new digital outfit to begin my new venture into the photo biz and asked an acquaintance who is a freelance photographer and who is sent on assignment by such publications as Time & Life. He recommended the P-2000 when I asked his opinion on the best device out there to use in the field to clear out CF cards and after getting to handle one in person, I agreed with him and bought mine 2 weeks ago.  The image quality is STUNNING. There is no other way to put it. Colors are crisp & sharp on the moderate-sized display and the controls are iPod-ishly intuitive and easy to operate.  There are some things I believe should be done to make the next incarnation a 5-star achiever:  1.) This puppy really needs to have a firewire port. Say what you will about USB 2.0 - on a Mac, Firewire is simply faster. I have a USB 2.0 port on my iMac, but this thinig is too freakin' slow in importing images via USB to the computer. This is a device for professionals - I'd say can the SD slot in favor of a firewire port!  2.) The charging port is on the opposite side of where the lanyard attaches. ... so, if you want this to charge while in its protective case, you have to turn the lanyard  in the case and have it charging in an awkward position.  3.) They seriously need to come out w/ an external battery charger. I do not see the point of buying a separate battery if there is no charger other than the unit itself.  4.) The delay between clicking on a thumbnail and/or zoominig in is WAY TOO LONG. Sometimes, it's zooms in fast, and other times it feels like an ice age is going to pass you by while you wait.  5.) It is way too picky on video formats. The example/demo video that came w/ the unit is a .mov Quicktime file - but I have quicktime files that play fine on my Mac that won't play on this thing. Granted, I will primarily be using this as a professional companion in photoshoots, not as a video player - but you get the idea.  6.)  Where you put in the CF card, it needs to be labled more clearly on the orientation so you don't jam it in backwards.  7.) When the disk is full and you want to import the photos into iPhoto - it takes FOREVER. I have imported photos from external hard drives, CDs and DVDs before, but this is the slowest EVER. I shot a wedding rehearsal and the wedding itself - well over 2000 photos in about 14 hours of activities over 2 days. I got home and hooked this puppy up at 4pm and started importing photos. I went about my day, took a nap and about a few minutes to midnight, went to look at the photos and they were STILL importing! Only about 75% had been imported. I don't know if this is a 2000 rpm drive or if it's a USB 1.0 or what its shortcomings are in the speed dept., but yikes, it takes way too stinking long!  Despite its shortcomings, it is a fast downloader from CF to the drive while in the field. Not as fast as I'd like, but decent. I used this device yesterday during a photoshoot in which I took bridal portraits for about 3 hours. I imported over 700 photos and the bride viewed many of them, zooming in on several - and half the battery life remains. This device pays for itself in just saving the cost of larger capacity CF cards over time. Thus far, I am very pleased with this purchase.

<Title>Epson P-2000 Multi-Media Viewer
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this item in the mail about 3 weeks ago and i have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I picked this up so that on my 2 week trip out of the country, i would not have to lug around a lot of heavy electronic equipment (i.e. laptop, chargers, etc...) in addition to my camera, lenses and flash cards.  As travelling by air has gotten a lot more challenging.  this little item will afford me nearly 40 gigs of storage for my RAW images and JPEGS.  I can shoot whatever i want and not have to worry about running out of room on my flash cards.  A note though.  Most reviews state that it takes about 1-3min to download a CF card full of pictures.  i have found that if you have a lot of RAW images, then, it takes quite a bit longer.  it took nearly 20-24 min to download my 4 gig card.  So, i still have to bring my charger and Voltage converter for Europe.  I also noted a lot of praise for the Video Vault program.  I tried it and i found that often on my movies  the sound was off of the video about 3-4 seconds later.  so, i downloaded a free trial of dvdclone mobile (i set it for itunes video and viola'!  No more worries.)  AAAAAAAAAAnd, it was a bit cheaper.    The Epson P has a standard sd card and a CF card slot.  so, it is child's play to pop it outta the camera and plug it in.  the product manual shows you how.  it downloads quickly and reminds you to plug it in if you are going to be downloading off your cards for too long.    the picture viewer is awesome and allows you to zoom in on your pictures so you can spot fuzziness and poor quality quickly!  (instead of looking at a tiny 2 or 2 1/2inch lcd screen.)   Highly recommended!!!.  for the reviewer that lost 2 or 3 files inexplicably and that does not trust this device.  One word of advice, download the card while the charger is connected--you copy the card,then, you page through the images to insure everything is there you want---then, you format your card after you are sure it's there. it says in the manual that if you download stuff on battery and you run outta juice--it might not copy correctly or at all.  i haven't had any problems while utilizing this device to it's fullest capacity.  I now travel with 12 or 15 movies on the hard drive.  When it's time for work, i delete a movie and free up a gig and a half.  or, i delete everything and have nearly 36 gigs of photo fun!!  (i haven't used that much space yet, but, we'll see--italy is right around the corner).  5 stars!  way to go Epson!! (for all those missed connections)

<Content>Pros:  - Field backup of your photos  - Nice display  - Easy to understand and use (compared to, say, your camera)  Cons which, if corrected, would put it in the 5 star:  - Slow to load from CF to internal HDD  - No external battery charger  - Cannot zoom in on camera RAW files  - Price $200 less (might as well dream)  4 stars.  Worth owning.

<Title>Epson p-2000
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Does an excelent job and has a lot of versitility, but is heavy and slow to load the pictures each time you try to initially view them. (This pertains to the pictures that are already in a folder on the p-2000. I would have expected these to be faster to view then pictures being downloaded.) Once you've been through the "slide show" once, the images load quicker the second time. Had no proplems uploading and downloading from my computer. No problems downloading directly from my camera's card. Overall I am quite happy with my purchase. Screen gives a very good image. Very clear and crisp. Worked great while we were traveling. I used it to unload my camera card so I didn't have to bring extra cards.

<Title>Epson P-2000 Is A Good Product
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am basically happy with my Epson P-2000 except for one issue. If you want photos entered into an album on the Epson P-2000 in a certain order for presentation, you can't do it.  Photos are shown in the order and date they were taken on your digital camera.  After spendidng hours creating a 700 picture file on my computer and transfering it to the Viewer in the order I wanted them presented, I learned from Epson Tech Support this feature is not currently availble on the P-2000.  I explained my reasoning for wanting them viewed in a certain order, and tech support said this may be available in a future update. Other than this, I am enjoying the P-2000 to store and view my photos.

<Title>P-2000 is unreliable
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a professional photographer and have relied on the P-2000 and a redundant Dell notebook for photo storage in the field.  The P-2000 corrupted about 10% of files downloaded from several CF cards (Lexar Professional 133x media).  The corruption is transparent until the files are unloaded to a desktop.  The original files on the CF card remained intact and error free.  On a recent wildlife shoot in East Africa I returned to discover that more than 300 of 3000 plus frames were not retrievable.  What makes matters worse for the P-2000 is that it cannot be repaired in the field.  One cannot restore its operating software from an external source and the cost of doing so is prohibitively more than the instrument is worth.  I will not invest in another one, personally.

<Title>Too Many Gotchas
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The P-2000, at first, seems wonderful.  But over time the warts begin to appear.  This device can be attached to you PC as a hard drive.  However, it cannot be USED as a hard drive.  Deleting files, changing folders, defragmenting, or formatting the P-2000 can render it inoperable.  Because of the above, deleting image files is a laborious process.  It took me 1/2 hour to delete, one by one, the many folders I created during a one-month vacation.  Why doesn't Epson provide a DELETE ALL?  There is a known incompatibility with newer Lexar CF cards, and Epson has no plans to correct this problem.  (The Lexar cards work fine in the camera and on the PC).    I recommend against purchasing this, or any other, Epson multimedia storage drive.  Since Epson is not committed to keeping their products compatible with the latest memory cards, the useful life of their products will be very short.

<Title>Support and repair are sub par
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Epson P2000 and family are not properly supported by epson. You cannot send the device to Epson for repair, even under warranty. You have to use an "authorized Service Center." In the Boston area I was given 4 service centers to choose from. 3 had no idea what a p2000 was and would not repair or support it. The 4th was a horror story in itself. Months of effort to get the repair and return. They could not repair it so had to send it to a repair facility (Epson). But had no idea of how to do so. Calling Epson was little help because the help desk cannot talk to the internal repair facility or check on the repair status. Only the Authorised service center can. Months of trying finally had the device returned to me and the screen failed within a short time just after the warranty ran out. I was given the option of taking it back to the "authorised repair facility" which I have sworn will never get my business again. So... I have pulled the drive out of it, pulled my files off of it. and it sits in a drawer as an expensive reminder of what not to trust.
