<Title>My first iPod...
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my iPod straight from Apple a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW!  The capacity is great and fit my needs perfectly.  The sound is absolutely amazing - it's as good as any portable CD player, if not better.  The look of the 2nd generation is very sleek and I'm digging the scratch-resistant metallic feel of it.  While some feel it's too small, I think it's perfect.  It fits in the hand perfectly and is very intuitive.  The menu design is easy to navigate.  I also like the fact you can "lock" the volume bar so it can't go past a certain point and that you can also lock the screen, turn of the backlight, and all the other functions this little gadget has.  All in all, this is one of the smartest buys I've made in recent years and will last me (hopefully) a few years.

<Title>One thing to 'whine' about
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love the new nano, fantastic improvement over first-generation counterpart.  Only caveat: When I purchased it, every time I turned it on it emitted a high-pitched whine (the iPod itself, not the music or anything) that was REALLY grating on the ears, even when listening with the headphones on. I brought it to Apple and they replaced it, no questions asked... the new unit works just fine. I've heard this is not a common problem, but just so you know, listen for that whine.

<Title>Wonderul Design and Function
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a mini that I loved and replaced it with the first Nano. I sold that one to buy the new one and I'm pleased with my trade up. The unit's new case gives me the security I didn't have with the first gen. And the sound does appear to be improved - posibly due to the better design of the new earbuds.  I don't bemoan the lack of Fm radio, voice recording etc. since I bought this to listen to music, books and podcasts. I try to avoid the radio and if I want those other features, I'd buy something specifically for that.  All told - elegant design, simple function control and durability. Oh and the battery life is greatly improved.

<Title>New Nano Rocks
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod nano rocks. I just got one, green, and it is so cool.  Pros: Light, fits anywhere, and it is COLORFUL. It holds a thousand songs and the battery lasts all day. Pictures look nice too. And the sound quality is great.  Cons: Doesn't play video but that doesn't really matter. Might be too small for some.

<Title>maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful product. But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary: iTunes 7 can be excruciatingly slow. I put in a CD more than a day ago to import to iTunes, and it is still not done. I have no idea what to do.  The iPod, which I named Lulu, was plugged into my computer for the first time yesterday, and ever since has been sporting the "do not disconnect" screen.  I have found no support phone numbers to call. If/when I figure out how to use this very pretty piece of technology, I may update my review. But as of now, I am hundreds of dollars poorer and have nothing to show for but red-faced frustration.

<Title>Great product! Phenominal Sound!
<Date>Thu Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm still amazed by the quality of the sound this little monster puts out, especially when I added Sony MDR-V700DJ Monitor Series Headphones that are available as one of the accessories. Whew! Only problem is now I don't want to read books anymore when I'm at the beach.

<Title>HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Title>The Mini Mini
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been reeling over when to buy a new ipod for a long time now. I have a 3rd generation 10gb ipod that I got for Xmas in '03 and it was immediately filled to the brim with music. I have probably used the thing every day since I've had it but the battery isn't what it used to be and I have to charge the thing for a good hour and a half during my work day just so I can listen to it for the last few hours. This has become an inconvenience for me considering that my job is extremely boring and the workplace is fairly loud and I find myself getting easily frustrated without music. The new nano commercial certainly is flashy and very persuasive. I want to point out that the click wheel does not glow up at all-I think that Apple falsely advertises that it does and that they should look into changing this misrepresentation. I am sure that they did this in the commercial for a greater effect but I can bet that people who haven't seen it in person and purchase this item online will be a little disappointed when receiving it.   Considering how fast I filled up my 10gb ipod I was torn between getting the new 30gb model with 3 times the amount of space I had before, or, the nano with considerable less space but a much longer battery life. It was a very tough decision but I went with the 4gb nano because of its long battery life. I know that Apple is going to continuously have new and improved models so I decided that the nano could hold me over until a 30gb model with a better battery life (for music and videos) and other improved features comes out.   The nano itself... I would say that I wasn't all that impressed at first sight of the nano, it looked different than the previous nano and very similar to the mini which I thought looked silly. My impression has totally changed considering the fact that I haven't been able to put the thing down since I got it last week. I can't stop holding it and marveling at how compact, light and sturdy it is (compared to the previous model). The screen is colorful and bright and I am happy with the resolution of the photos (albeit on a really small screen). The new headphones are an improvement since the previous ones didn't fit in my ears too well. I haven't noticed much of an improvement regarding the sound quality but I am extremely satisfied since these are more comfortable in the ears than the previous model, the cord is longer, and they also will not wind up together since they are separated by a handy little piece of rubber that you can adjust to your preference.  Some small gripes...I have noticed that the games tend to slow down at times, not really a big deal since these games get boring within the first 2 minutes of playing them. Transitioning from one screen to another isn't as smooth as on the other models--probably due to the fact that the nano is flash drive based. The click wheel isn't the most stable and certainly takes some getting used to. I have noticed that turning the backlight on and off isn't as easy as it used to be. On my older Ipod all I needed to do was to hold down the Menu button for a few seconds for the backlight to turn on. It isn't possible to do that anymore so you have to make sure that the backlight settings are turned on. I also would like to say that my previous model came with a white plug that you can put into the data outlet to protect the outlet from dust and other hazardous circumstances. I think that the little piece of plastic is essential to the life cycle of the ipod and it should be included with every Ipod model.   All in all I couldn't be more pleased with this item. I would definitely advise you to purchase a case that would shield the nano from everyday hazards. The new anodized aluminum casing should protect this item better than the previous models which were easily scratched. I will probably purchase a case from Otterbox when it becomes available because it appears that it will be the best protection available for this fragile investment. Hopefully I won't regret not getting the larger storage model but as of right now I am 100 percent satisfied with my new ipod 4gb nano. It has all that you really need in an mp3 player.
