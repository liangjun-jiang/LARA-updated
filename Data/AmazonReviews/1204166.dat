<Title>Great little player! 
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great little player. The navigation menu is easy to use and it has 3 choices of animation/wallpaper to chose from.The video conversion software is easy to use so you can take your favorite videos with you and watch them on the go. Loading your files is a simple drag and drop just like a flash card. You don't need massive amounts of memory unless you are going to cary your full library with you. I put 2 30 min cartoons on this player and only used 10% of the memory. Visual land was a pleasure to deal with. They provided super fast delivery and a tracking number. I have not had the opportunity to test the battery life yet and can not comment on that feature at this time.

<Title>Solid gold for your money. Period.

<Content>In front of this miniature miracle, you know what you can do with the rest of the little non expensives MP3/flash memory devices on the market? ALL to the trash can -inclusive the Ip@d Shuffl@- (Appl@ in any second really think that in 2006 we can live without a no screen device?) Dont think, just buy it, trust me. I dont think you can get more with your money. Period. Do I say that this one really play video, JPGs, Ebooks, MP3, MP4?, Voice Recorder, FM Radio? And as a aditional 2 gift: AC USB charger and sports armband holder. Read the details, specifications the times you want, but dont wait until this item goes not avaliable...

<Title>great tiny mp3/mp4 player
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player with reservation, even though there are three good reviews on this one and a couple on other similar players.  The reviewers only wrote review on this product, really was not sure how independent they were.  I took a chance and bought it on price and functions.  I just got this from the mail.  I am really surprised that it only took three days to get it on regular delivery (in NJ)! After ordering, I got an e-mail from the seller indicating some freebies, since he said he is new on Amazon.  The player was shipped with a free tiny USB charger (100-240V)and a arms band (very well constructed, but it is fairly large).   I also checked the eBay store, the listed price is the same, but the shipping from Amazon is $10 cheaper.  Back to the player, the player came from a thick paper box, and I was really surprised how small it is.  The construction is plastic but fairly good, body very light.  It is less than half the size of the iPod nano, but twice as thick.  The battery came fully charged, so without reading the manuel i started fiddle with it.  The pictures was very crisp, sound was good as well.  It shipped with a video file and a music file.  I don't know how useful the video play is, since the screen is very small, and the format is wrong (3/4), so you are basically only using half of the screen to see the video (4/3).  I think the best part of the player is that it comes with two speakers on the side, putting on the full volumn, it is actually fairly loud, useful in many ocasion, there are two earphone jacks, but I don't think it is going to be that useful.  The system language can be switched beween English and Chinese (traditional and simplified). Manuel is written in English but it is clearly translated from Chinese by Chinese, takes some guess to understand but there is no problem. If this thing last, it would be one of the great buys I had made in Amazon. More later

<Title>My player never works properly.
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Maybe it is just a glitch in my player, but I've never used it because it doesn't work properly. I now have a player that I really can't do anything with and Visual Land Inc. does not appear to want to refund my money. They have sent a replacement, but it is not working either. Proceed with caution in buying this player.

<Title>BE CAREFULL, Batteries don't last!!!
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought this little guy in January, started having problems in Febuary with being able to keep the batteries charged.  To my knowledge, the batteries are non-replaceable.  I've kept this little guy hanging around, but now you only get about 2-3 songs out of it before it's time to recharge.  The wall-charger seems not to work since the day I got it.  It only charges via the USB port on my computer.  The display for video doesn't even fill the entire screen as shown on sellers site.  Oh, unfortunate me, I bought two versions of this same player.  Both have battery problems.  Does it work? YES.  Does it work properly? MAYBEE.  Do I like it? NO. I can't use it long enough to find out.  I might like it better if you could replace the batteries.  All in all, its a cheap kick to thrill your friends with, just not real practical.

<Title>video does not work
<Date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You have to use Visual Land's conversion software to Visual Land's format to play videos. I could not get the conversion software to work. They will not answer my E mails. I asked them to help to fix the problem or I would like to return the unit.  They will not answer my E mail.  Do not by this player thinking you can play downloaded videos from sources such as I tunes. It will not work. Disapointing as it is advertised as an MP4 player. I can not reccommend this player.

<Title>Wonderful, until it stops working.
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>All of the features, MP3 player, video player, snapshot viewer, and flash drive worked as described.  After about 3 months of gentle use, I can no longer connect via the USB interface, which means I cannot change my songs, videos, snapshots, nor can I use the device as a flash drive.  Visual Land does not respond to email requests for support.  Buyer beware.
