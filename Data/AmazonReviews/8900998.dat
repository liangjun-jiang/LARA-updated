<Product Name>COBY PMP3520 3.5" TFT Portable Media Player with 20 GB HDD
<Title>Very disapointed with Amazon

<Content>Only plays AVI files. The SMI and SRT subs is a BIG lie. I have not receive any carrying case, hand strap and remote control. And now Amazon replys: Contact seller. And seller (J&R Music) says: It's an error of Amazon's web page

<Title>very disappointed here too

<Content>Bought this device and had high hope to play many different audio and video file formats.  Turned out, it can only play .avi file and nothing else.  Even regular mp3 music files cannot be recognized by the player.  I check the Coby website and there are nothing to support this device, not a manual, not a firmware, absolutely nothing.  Don't waste your money.
