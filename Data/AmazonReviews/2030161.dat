<Title>Great for NetLibary
<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a dissapointing trial of an iriver T10 which did not, to my dismay, handle NetLibrary books and would only play about 4 hours of a book and then re-set to zero(which they don't bother to mention on their website or in the manual), I returned the T10 and bought a Creative Zen Nano Plus. I've already finished a 7+ hour book from NetLibrary - No problems. Works great.  It has less options than the iriver, but fast-forwards much faster - which is good if you fall asleep while listening to your book! If you want to listen to free audiobooks from NetLibrary and don't care about having a lot of extra features that you probably will never use anyway, it is a better way to go. Cute, easy to use, does the job. Volume is a bit on the weak side but I use a casset adapter in my car and can turn up the car volume. When listening at home the volume is fine.

<Content>I was so happy with my Creative Zen Nano that I bought one as a gift.  I love the color choice and the sound is great.  Love the pause button. It came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band.  You do not need to buy one!!  Amazon delivered it in 2 days!

<Title>Very Good Small Player for the price
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a first-time MP3 user, and I love my Zen Nano Plus. It's so small it's easy to tuck in a pocket or clip to a sleeve as I'm going about my business, and the sound is fantastic - far better than CD quality.   I did find it difficult to navigate at first. The directions were confusion and the tiny scroll wheel was tricky enough that I nearly sent the thing back in frustration. But now that I've played with it for a while, I'm enjoying my music in a whole new way.  The earphones could be more comfortable, but I understand that's a common gripe about players at most price points.

<Title>LOVE MY NANO PLUS!
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love to know about new technologies and keep up with them...but it takes me awhile to purchase them...When I decided I needed an MP3 player, I just really didn't need a video or enough space for every piece of music that I ever owned....and I didn't want to spend a fortune. I LOVE MY NANO PLUS!  The software is so easy that my kids use it.  I have plenty of room for my favorite music, theirs and even some of dads! I have no idea how or why the ipods are so great, maybe it's hype....who knows...i do not feel like I am missing out on anything.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love it! What keeps it from being a 5 (I would make it 4 1/2) is the control doohickey. It pushes in to get to menu options and it pushes to either side to scroll through menu options, tune to next radio station/move to next audio item or FF/RW (push to side and hold) while playing saved audio. Frequently, if I want to FF/RW, I end up at the next item or in the menu and vice versa. One might say it takes getting used to, but I find that you just have to use both hands.  Pros: It holds a surprising amount of music, which makes me very happy since it is now the day-to-day alternative to my Creative Nomad Jukebox which has a 20GB harddrive; Love the small size and weight (especially compared to the Jukebox); Sounds great; Audio books can be loaded.  Give me Creative Labs anyday!

<Title>Excellent, but perhaps no longer the best buy
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this product for about 18 months now, and I think it has been the most satisfactory hi-tech product I've ever bought.  Pros: * So light that if it falls out of a pocket, it bounces and dangles at the end of the headphones. And light enough that it isn't even noticable at the gym. * Squareish and fairly stiff, so if it is in my pants pocket when I bend over (and tie my shoes at the gym, for example) it doesn't flex and bend and break like some longer, thinner and more elegant designs would. * Uses a replaceable battery, so all I have to worry about is making sure I have a spare AAA battery around when it is getting low. * Has enough of a display to tell me what I'm listening to and how long it's been playing -- but no wasted money or space on a fancy display. * Tough enough that if my earbud cables violently snag on something, the cheap earbuds get destroyed, not the expensive MP3 player.  Cons * The only major one: when I'm listening to an audio book (probably one-quarter of my listening time), there is no way of bookmarking my spot. So if I want to take a break (or if the battery dies), I have to remember how far I'd gotten and fast-forward, which is an awkward and excruciatingly slow process (relatively). * Display only shows ID3 "track title", so no Artist, Album, etc.; some useful display options are missing, such as toggling to show "time remaining".  The last Con is that at 1GB this is now a fairly obsolete product. If I had to replace it, I'd look for a unit that had better audiobook support (e.g., bookmarking) and more storage -- at least 3GB and ideally 6GB.  But I'm satisfied enough that I'm not gonna upgrade until this unit dies. And I hope Creative Labs has something in the same form factor and hardware, since all my wishes could be met with some smarter firmware.

<Content>Excellent little product; really nice sound quality in a small package; controls are adequate, though could be a little larger.  The small display is OK - - would be very nice if the backlight stayed on a little longer (of course, that would eat the battery faster)  Works great, holds a bucketload of songs and a great little package.

<Title>ZEN Nano Plus RULZ!
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ZEN Nano Plus 1GB is a fantastic flash player for the price.I would have given it five stars but the software that came with the product appeared to have caused a huge conflict with my 'puter and I since reformatted the hard drive and left Creative Labs software off entirely. I'm still not sure if the software was the reason for the conflict however. This product is 100% compatible with Windows Explorer anyway and it gets along just fine without their software. I do recommend getting some upgraded earbuds as I did, (with ear hooks) as the ones that came with it would not stay put. Ease of use, capacity and sound quality are perfect for everyday work use. ~Fini~

<Content>I really like this MP3 player overall.  It doesn't hold a lot for those that want to puit multiple albums on their player but for me it was plenty.  It does seem a little confusing to operate but I am getting the hang of it.

<Content>ive had this MP3 play for about a year. in the begining it was ok for the price but since then the sound on it has been completely shot, the battery door has broken twice and gotten lost, and it can now be split in half. only suggested for short term use.
