<Title>Great Product So Far
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I hate taking my iPod to the gym, putting it my pocket and then have a wire running up to my earphones.  This product has the  MP3 built into the headphones.  Loading is very easy, and it runs off an AAA battery.  It has a lot of nice features too.    The only thing I am concerned about, is will it hold up. I have been only using it for 1 week. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PJHNVA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1626817-9264866">Frisby 2gb Wireless Sport Mp3 Player Headset</a>

<Title>Everything I was looking for.
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been looking for a way to listen to music without the hassle of wires. I got a pair of wireless headphones, but the pair I got cut out, then I found these. I was a little unsure about buying a product from an unknown company, but it was a wonderful buy.   First of all, customer service is amazing. I accidentaly sent the package to the wrong address, one email and it got fixed. Second, it worked just as advertised. Plugged in, put on music, and listened right away. I didn't test out battery life, but I use it at work, and it lasts me a long while, so I wouldn't be surprised if it were at least the 13 hours advertised. Sound quality is great, and functionality is good as well. My only qualm is that transfer is a little slow, but for an mp3 player that works this well, I don't mind at all.

<Title> A Comparison of Frisby and Utronix MP3-playing headphones
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having bought both the Utronix MP3-playing headphones with 512MB of storage and the Frisby MP3-playing heaphones with 2GB of storage (both available here at Amazon), I am in a rare position to be able to compare the two for you.   Having researched the web, I found models from Aiwa, Coby, Nextar, Utronix and Frisby (division of Comsis Computer). TDK formerly made one but has discontinued it due to poor sales.   Clearly, the Utronix and Frisby models are the winners in terms of desirability. While some of the others were less (and more) expensive, they all had less storage space than the Utronix and Frisby models.   Unfortunately, both the Utronix and Frisby models are imperfect but in different ways. A comparison follows.   The Utronix (a comparatively new Swedish company) headphone is sturdily constructed in one (unfoldable) piece that fits one's head and ears VERY comfortably and securely over a long period of time.   The Frisby (American, headquartered in Arizona) headphone is flimsily constructed in folding sections that are NOT very ergonomically correct or comfortable to wear for extended periods despite the rotating earpieces. The connecting bar rubs against the bone of your skull behind your ears requiring you to hook the tops of the bars over your ears in order to prevent it from slipping and falling off. This makes the tops of your ears stick out (hopefully not permanently).   Both models play MP3 and WMA files (the most commonly used). The Utronix model also plays WMV audio from video files and several others which are not often utilized.   How do they sound? The Utronix headphone has 7 different equalization settings. The Frisby has 6 settings. The only one of the settings on either model that sounds decent is the one named "Double Bass" (or simply "Bass" in the Frisby). In the Utronix model, the sound is bright, crisp and clear (and generally SUPERB to my ears!) in both the highs and the lows. The musicians sounded as though they were right there in the room with me (even on a CD reissue of an RCA recording Dizzy Gillespie made in 1949!). If you are looking for full, unexaggerated natural-sounding bass, the Utronix phones deliver. If you are looking for the kind of thumping bass that usually emanates from a home-boy's "Pimp-mobile" (no offense intended), you should look elsewhere. You won't find that kind of bass sound in ANY headphone that rests ON the ear rather than IN the ear.   In contrast, the Frisby model has somewhat smaller speakers in diameter than the Utronix model, but somehow manages to deliver about the same amount of bass as the Utronix model does in the "Bass" mode (or even a bit more). The louder you turn the volume, the more bass there seems to be.  However, the Frisby model seemed to me to be slightly lacking in the upper frequency range, giving the overall impression of being somewhat mid-range heavy. You may want to experiment with the other equalization settings to find your own personal preference. Everyone's perception is different and you may even prefer a less biting brilliance for certain kinds of music.  I ripped my CD's into WMA files (using Windows Media Player) with a variable bit rate of 85 to 145 kbps (the intermediate setting). The exact same file at this rate sounds better to my ears on the Utronix phones than it does on the Frisby phones. The overall sound quality of the Frisby model is, in my estimation, "adequate but not breathtaking".  You may be able to achieve better results by adopting a higher bit rate during the ripping of your CD's to MP3 or WMA files (though it will take up more space on your drives).  Now to matters of playing time and battery life. The Utronix model has a 512MB flash drive which holds about 5 hours worth of music.   Please note that the specifications on the Amazon webpage for the Utronix model erroneously say that it runs on a AAA battery. NOT SO! In fact, it has a built-in Lithium-Ion battery that recharges through the USB port of your computer over a period of 3 hours. Its disadvantage is that in actual continuous use, the Lithium-Ion battery lasts about 4 hours. It is supposed to last about 6 hours. It doesn't. And once it's done, IT'S DONE. You have to take it home and plug it back into the USB port of your computer to recharge it for another 3 hours(unless you have a new car with a new MP3 audio system including a front-USB port). For best results, you should charge the Utronix headphone continuously for 3 hours IMMEDIATELY before use, as it will slowly lose "juice" if stored unused for several hours after charging. The instructions do warn you not to overcharge the battery, more than 4 hours as it may shorten its overall life.   There is NO indicator to let you know when the battery has fully charged.  The Red L.E.D. that indicates it is charging does NOT turn off when it is fully charged. You just have to watch the clock and remember.  The Frisby model runs on a single AAA battery lasting about 8 hours in continuous use. AAA batteries are small and easy to find and a spare is easy to carry in one's pocket. The Frisby 2GB model (they also make a 1GB model for less money) has a music storage capacity of about 20 hours. So, if you have a spare battery in your pocket, you can listen practically ALL DAY without having to repeat any music.   Regarding programmability, the Frisby is VERY programmable and you can choose to play the tracks in the order in which they were loaded or in random shuffle order and some variations there-of. It even has folder partitioning capabilities so you can jump directly to other music genres depending on your mood without having to crawl and wade through many contiguous files to get there.  The lever on the Frisby model that is used to enter the display menues and navigate through them is flimsy and seems as though it might break if handled clumsily or carelessly. However, I have not experienced any malfunctions in two weeks of use so far.   I did experience a malfunction in the Utronix model but it was largely my fault having accidentally pushed two buttons in at the same time on opposite sides of the earpiece. It got stuck in Pause mode while the flashing Green L.E.D. was indicating that it should be in Play mode. I could not unstick it. I had to wait about 12 hours (with the Green LED flashing and without music playing) for the battery to run down so that the mechanism would re-set (yes, 12 hours WITHOUT the music playing). WITH music playing, the battery runs down in 4 hours. However, once it did re-set and the battery got recharged, it was fine. There was no permanent damage done. One just has to be careful not to push in two opposing buttons at the same time.   The Utronix model has no display panel. It has only a Red and a Green alternating L.E.D. to let you know what mode of operation it is in (play, charge or file transfer). It is not programmable at all. The player plays the selections in whatever the order was in which you loaded them. So, you should take that into account while loading them.   I tried using the database fields for each WMA file in the "E" drive on my computer (in this case, the Utronix headphones) by viewing "Details" instead of "List" or "Icon" to re-sort the selections by other fields such as "file size", "duration", "album", "artist", etc., but it seemed to have no effect on the Utronix phones' playing order after disengaging them from the USB port.   As others have observed, file transfer is simple and easy but somewhat slow (as it is with most flash drives that are not assisted by file-transfer acceleration software).   How do they compare price-wise? You can look that up right here on Amazon. I could not find a lower price anywhere else. The Utronix model was about 36 dollars with shipping.  Amazon recently lowered the price on the Frisby model to about $70 with shipping as of August 14, 2007. It was formerly $75. Obviously, the price is subject to change.  I have decided to keep both units as they are useful for different purposes. For short-term, vigorous exercise, the Utronix model is well-suited with up-tempo rock or jazz music. For long walks and picnics in the forest, the Frisby model is better suited with Classical or Easy-Listening music.   I hope this review has been useful to you.   Dan

<Title>Actually, I'm surprised...
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this Frisby 2GB Wireless MP3 player to wear while I workout.  That is pretty much limited to walking and running on a treadmill and a free weight workout while standing, sitting, and laying on a weight bench.  The headset feels odd in your hands because the earphones are heavier than a normal headset (no doubt because of the electronics in the earpieces) and it gives the impression that the band is flimsy.  But the band is really sturdy and has some unique joints that flex easily when putting it on your head.  The headset fits well on my head and I really like the behind-the-neck band.  The earpieces are comfortable.  Overall, the fit is exactly what I was looking for.  Adding music to the headset was simple.  The package includes a USB cable and some software.  I didn't load the software but just plugged the headset into a USB drive and the headset was recognized as a removable drive.  Easy as pie...drop and drag your music to the  headset.  The headset screen gives you information about the MP3 but since it is on my head I don't really care.  I set the mode for random shuffle and listen to what ever I get.  If i don't want to hear a particular song, the toggle switch is easy to find (right on the bottom of the right ear) to toggle to the next or previous song without taking the headset off.  Sound quality is what you might expect - nothing spectacular but not bad.  It is what it is - a $65 MP3 player built into a headset.  It exceeds my expectations in that regard, hence the title of this review.  I have noticed a major complaint with other 'sports' headphones related to headphone failure when they get a bit of sweat on them.  I don't sweat buckets but I sweat plenty and this headset seems to handle it fine.  Water isn't dripping off of them when I take them off but they have had some exposure.  Overall, a fine product in my opinion.

<Title>My Frisby gets 5 Stars, I think
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my Frisby 2GB headset for about a month now.  I used to use an i-River headset with Sony earbuds when I ran, but I wanted something that didn't have the wire running to the headset as it would get caught in my hand sometimes while in stride.  That interrupts a nice run almost as bad as a fall.  The i-River player I had was cutting edge when I got it 5 years ago, but now the 256Mb storage just doesn't match up.     The Frisby headset doesn't have wires at all, but rests around the back of your head. So, one item fixed immediately.  It has a decent sized 2Gb storage, so the second check box is also checked off.     Thus far, I'm very pleased with it.  I attempted to check the 5-Star box, but I'm legally blind, so if I messed up and gave it a different rating and screwed everyone up, I apologize-- it's unintended.     The sound quality from the player is very good, with good bass and treble response, without the scratchiness of mid-range in some of the bottom-end players on the market.  It has plenty of volume, and I find myself playing it at about 40% of max, unless it is very windy outside while I run.     Having the band around he back, base, of your head is odd-feeling for about 30 seconds or so, with the hooking position up and over your ears making you feel as if you like Dumbo, but it isn't actually noticeable at all because the headphones themselves cover your ears. So, it merely looks as if you are wearing headphones.  Once you begin your exercise, you tend to forget they are even on after a minute or so, like earbuds.  I really like my .... pair?  Set?  As I've had it for just a month, we'll see how well it holds up, but so far, so good.  No sign of anything wearing out yet.     One thing about the AAA battery.  I had the 2Gb of music already selected to place on the Frisby.  I thought I had a new cell ready for it, and I put that battery in, then plugged the Frisby's USB cable into the proper connections and loaded it.  That act of loading the 2Gb of music in mp3 format totally drained the AAA battery.  I don't know if that battery was weak, or if it is that strenous a task to move and store the music files in the flash memory, but there it is.  I've used the Frisby to merely play those music files for another month, on the next AAA, so perhaps that one was a fluke.  FYI, I run about 4 miles, taking 40 minutes on average, perhaps 2-3 times per week, so I've gotten perhaps 10-15 hours of play time out of the AAA, I think.  John
