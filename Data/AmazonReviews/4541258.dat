<Title>No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand.

<Title>Creative Zen player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just an absolutely incredible product.  As a musician it is what I was looking for.  It plays with excellent fidelity, records from the internal mike with clarity, records faithfully from the line in jack. Has enough capacity to allow me to carry all the info and music I need to and from gigs.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced recorder/player.

<Title>Great Music Player; Not So Great Video Player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compared to the competition in its price range, this a very good choice for a music player.  It's small and light, and the interface is intuitive and easy to set up and customize.  The OLED display is visible from any angle, but is dim in outdoor lighting.  The display is not very sharp, so this is really not a good player for photos and video.  However, the audio is way above average once you replace the included earbuds with something better.  It has lots of EQ settings and a good FM radio, and the included Creative MediaSource Organizer software makes loading of tracks and set-up of playlists quite easy.  I listen to a lot of podcasts and was disappointed with the included Zencast software, but found that if you turn on the MediaSource "media sniffing" function it will automatically find podcasts in my iTunes library (iTunes makes podcast subscriptions ever so easy) and they can be readily dragged and dropped into the Zen.  As noted in other reviews, USB charging from a computer does take a lot longer than it should, but if you have a USB wall charger it goes much faster.  I don't think I would buy another one of these, but overall I am fairly happy with it for music and podcasts.

<Title>Is there a real user manual for this thing?
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, this is my first mp3 player, so maybe they're all this user-unfriendly. If so, let me know. There is a serious lack of information available for the operation of this unit. The user manual does not supply it. So you're left to figure it out for yourself. First of all, I'm able to download stuff, (except for the five songs I bought on Itunes for 99 cents each), so I'm using it. But you must find out by trial and error how to use the thing. I'm used to devices picking up where you left off when you stop it. But if you don't save your place in a book or podcast, if you don't unpause the unit by the time you're time runs out and the unit shuts down, you have lost your place!! Why doesn't it pick up where you leave off automatically? Are ALL mp3 players like this? If you're interrupted and don't have the 20 seconds or so to save your place, in a bookmark, you're screwed.  Next, to get from menu to menu, you must push the proper buttons in the correct order, which you learn by trial and error, and must press them for the proper length of time (!) or you can also lose your place.   You must also NOT press certain buttons or you'll lose your place. For instance, if you are listening to a book, and happen to press BACK on the tiny joystick, it will exit playing and take you to a previous chapter or even the start of the book!  I'm sorry, but I'm used to cassette players and CD players and I've never had to be so careful in pressing a button on a player before. Are ALL mp3 players like this?  And there is no help from the user manual. None. Not even online.  You're on your own.   This is only the beginning. I have no idea how to make a playlist. And there is no information on how to do so. Not on the Creative site. If someone out there knows of where I can get this information, please let me know. The menu system is clumsy and unfriendly. Everything about the unit is clumsy and unfriendly.   I may buy an apple ipod if I find it is more user-friendly, and just use this unit for....   I have given it 2 stars because at least it works, but I'm not happy with it.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Labs Muvo2 and loved it.  Unfortunately, the hard drive fried after the warranty expired, and I was infuriated by CL's policy of charging for tech support calls.  I swore I would never buy another CL product.  I did a lot of research before buying a replacement and considered the iPod Nano and Zune.  Finally, with my Christmas money in hand, I went to Circuit City, ready to buy an iPod.  I asked the salesperson which mp3 player he had, and he told me he had the Zen V+.  I asked why, and he said that, for the money, it was the best player on the market, and includes a radio, video capability, photos and a huge capacity for storing music files.  He was so enthused that I figured I had nothing to lose.   I brought it home, set it up and was amazed at how intuitive the software was.  I loaded ten CDs in rapid order and downloaded all of my music.  Within two hours I was groovin' to my entire Taylor Hicks download collection (I'm a Hicks fan, what can I say!)  The FM tuner picks up my favorite R&B station, which doesn't always come in even on the best stereo.   I highly recommend this little player.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unbelivably better than the ipod... but...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is an awesome mp3 player, except it has a few problems...  Pros: brilliant color screen makes it easy to see what you are doing, even if you are using it outside where there is a huge glare  I dont care what people say about the stupid thumb navigation being too small... its fine. if I made the mp3 player, I would have chosen a different mechanism to scroll and stuff... but there is no real problem with it  Look at the size of this thing!!!! its TINY!!! its AWESOME!!!    Cons: i have had it for 3 weeks and it has frozen 4 times. 3 out of the 4 times, I very simply resseted it and it was fine, not really a problem unless you don't have a small paperclip.   Here's the big con you have been waiting for: one of the times it froze, I reseted it and it turned on again and it looked fine, until it froze again. OH NO! I repeated the process of finding a small paperclip and reseted it. IT FROZE AGAIN WITHIN SECONDS OF ME TURNING IT ON!!!! i repeated this process many times, but it was no use. I emailed the creative labs support thingy and they gave me a simple solution. Here it is if this happens to you. reset it, and when you turn it on, it will go through the regular startup screens of the creative symbol, and saying Zen V Plus. When it says the creative symbol, hold down the play button and a "recovery menu" comes up run the "cleanup" and then "reboot". it worked for me, so it should work for you.  last couple of cons:  video is bad because of the small screen  line in encoding is hard to use  Thats all for now!

<Title>Here's the Major Problem.........
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed.  I have had my Zen since October, and like everyone else I initially fell in love with it.  I really loved the fact that I could download all my 2-year-olds music to make car trips so much easier!  I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.  However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source.  And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything.  It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.  It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod.  Creative really needs to work on this major design flaw!  Don't buy this unless you want to be really frustrated!

<Title>Very Nice Little Gadget
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my wife after owning the 30GB Creative Zen Vision:M for a year. I am a fan of  Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer.

<Content>I first saw the Zen V Plus in Glamour Magazine, and thought, "interesting, I wonder how it compares to the ipod". My brother got it for me this past Christmas, and now I don't go anywhere without it. I love the size and how idiot proof it is...i'm not very smart when it comes to gadgets, but even the downloading cds on to it is childs play. The only downside is, the first time i used it, it froze on me and I had to wait for the battery to die to get it to work. Other than that, its great. And it hasn't happened since. Buy this product! Its worth every penny you spend on it.

<Title>Definitely one of the best MP3 players out there
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen V Plus after browsing through what seemed like hundreds of MP3 players, either flash based or hard drive based. I read reviews everywhere too and finally decided on this product. After a month of using it, I have no complaints whatsoever - all my music, videos, and pics are easily transported onto my player, and the sound is GREAT! I would definitely suggest buying a new set of headphones though; the ones attached aren't that great and probably won't fit your ears.  The FM feature is great too! Of course the reception depends on where you live and where you're located. But generally it gets good reception - unless you're in a cave or something.  The screen is definitely nice, and the menus are really easy to navigate. You won't regret buying this product!

<Title>Terrible Documentation
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Physically attractive, with many interesting features, the Zen suffers from serious limitations.  Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone  connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment.

<Title>Great Buy for 1st MP3, Great for Books & Music & More
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my Zen V Plus 4 GB.  I wanted a durable MP3 for work outs/travel and this little guy has lived up my wishes.  I wanted an MP3 that would work for audio books as well as great music. The bookmarking works well if you have a 12 hour recorded book with no chapter or time breaks.  Music is rich and clear.  The FM radio was an added bonus that I use more than I thought I would.  Small screen is clear and bright with amazing resolution.  Downloading my Microsoft Outlook contacts was a snap.  The firm ware has froze up a couple of times but a hard reset with a small straight pin has never lost any data.  Only negative would be the lack of ANY kind of user guide.  I spent more time surfing for a manual than I should have.  If you just play with unit most features are found quickly.  Hint: hold down the back arrow and several bookmarking, play modes and creating play lists are avalible.  I hope this rechargeable battery last more that 2 years but time will only tell.  Great buy for the money spent(code for "I think iPods are way over rated for the price").

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Title>Good player for audiobooks
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use my mp3 players for listening to audiobooks & podcasts, and I'm trying to find "just the right one".  I've been using this one for a month now, and it's turning out to be my favorite so far. As I've found with the many players I've tried, there seems to be no commonality to these things but the power switch.  This player works with Overdrive books from the library and books from audible.com.  I haven't tried Netlibrary, but think it would be good there as well.    Documentation provided for its use is dismal; you need to be willing to spend time and just figure out on your own how things work.  You can find help in the user forums here at Amazon, or the Creative forums.  An installation CD is included with the player with lots of horrible warnings: "DO NOT connect your player to your computer before setting up the software."  Interestingly enough, further along in the booklet, it is mentioned how to use the player with a computer that doesn't have the software installed.  Since I don't like to install all these specialty programs if I can help it, I've found this player will work just fine without the Creative software - Windows Media Player will work with it fine.  Overdrive and Audible each have their own programs that you need to get their books, and they will handle the transfers to the player.  Suggest you try with or without the special software and see which you find works best for you.  The player has a bookmarking function, something that is really necessary for audiobooks, not so much with music. The bookmarks, however, are not at all intuitive to use, and figuring them out took several visits to the forums mentioned above.  Now that I know how to use them, I still find times when I have to make more than one try to get it done.  The good news is, I'm finding it's not really necessary to bookmark all that often.  When listening to a book, if you just turn the player off (without pausing first), when you next turn it on it will resume playing from the point at which it was powered down.  So unless you want to listen to part of one book, then go on to listen to something else, bookmarks aren't necessary.    The battery life for a fully charged player seems to be only about 8-10 hours, which is a bit shorter than I'd like, but it's OK.  The player has a little "joystick" for navigating around the menus - I've seen reviews that don't like this, but I do like it.  It's easy to navigate with. The screen is nice and readable.  Since I don't store photos or watch videos, I can't comment on those aspects of the player except to say it's supposed to do them.    Main things I like:  4GB storage, a nice amount for carrying several books with me to listen to.  Nice readable screen, easy to navigate to what I want to hear.  Bookmarks if I need them.  When turned off, resumes at where you were - also keeps the volume at the same level (I have another player that always returns to its preset volume which is higher than I like when turned off then back on - that's annoying). Small size, nice looking player.  I still feel that I'm in the learning stage with this player, but feel I've discovered the main things I need to know.

<Title>Good value player, but wasn't as flexible as I hoped.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very nice little player. It's easy to hold and does a lot for the money.  However, I hoped to be able to use it without special software, just drag and drop folders to the device.  While you can drag songs from your hard drive to the player, your folder structure isn't retained when you navigate the music on the device - you just get a long list. If you want to make "folder-y" playlists, you have to use software to do that, either the software that comes with it or sync with Windows Media or the like.  Not what I was hoping for.  It is possible to create playlists using the device itself but the process is rather tedious.  If you like Windows Media player and managing your music and playlists with that, this will work perfectly for you.  The sound is good, and the line recording feature is great.

<Title>Died After 10 mins of use
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been waiting for years since the mp3 craze started to find the one that was just right for me before purchasing.  The Zen V Plus has all the features that I wanted.  So right out of the box I downloaded about 1 gig worth of my mp3s to listen to it on my commute to work.  I listened to what I downloaded for about 1 min to make sure it was transferred ok.  Seemed great.  The next morning after 5 more minutes of use I heard these REALLY DANGEROUSLY LOUD high pitched chirping sounds while the music was playing.  Then the player just froze.  I reset it and it shut off ok, but then on restart it would always freeze on start up.  I contacted their customer support and they told me to reinstall the  latest driver, firmware, and application s/w.  I tried to do that, but when reinstalling the firmware the player simply freezes also.  Customer service people told me that I must have did something wrong and could send it back if I pay for shipping and if they found it was a problem I could have fixed they would charge me. Perhaps I just got a player w/ some corrupted memory, and I could probably get it working if I tried long enough, since I am a computer expert, but I really don't have time in my schedule to devote to fixing a product that should be working right out of the box.  Thankfully I bought it from amazon and returning it was simple.  Granted it would be a great product (way better than the Ipod) if it worked.  But from all the reviews I've read I'm not the only one having this problem so there is something wrong w/ their quality control at creative. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always research a product before I buy it if it's a purchase over $100. The only two bad things that I could even slightly be picky about:  1. The small screen which would make it hard to watch videos (a feature I've yet to try since it is a mp3 player, not a DVD player.)  2. The Zen freezing and having to be reset.  The latter almost dissuaded me from buying this player. After reading about how often and how difficult it was for some to reset I got scared. But, I took the plunge since it was the only REAL drawback and if that did happen, I could always get refunded. Well, I've had my player for about a week now, and it's frozen twice (after disconnecting from the computer). Resetting it was simple. The first time I took a sewing needle, stuck it in the hole and reset. The second time I was at work and used a paper clip to reset it. The hole is so small that you can't help but to hit the button correctly. After resetting, the library rebuilt itself and continued playback like nothing had happened. Not a real drawback, IMHO.  4 of my friends have the Ipod Nano which cost about $60 more than mine while having less features. 3 out of the 4 envy my Zen. The line-in encoding is nice, though I wish it pulled the track information instead of just labeling it "Line In Recording (Date)". The FM Radio works very well. The customizable backgrounds, I love it. And the simple "drag and drop" or just "sending it to" the player for your files on the computer... couldn't be better.  I'm thoroughly and impressed and satisfied with my player for the money.  Not to mention, it looks better than the Ipod and it's scratch resistant. Just what I need. (Though, I have the leather carrying case. So cute!)

<Content>The Zen V Plus is very small yet packed with tons of computer power. I would say it rivals quite well with the Ipod Nano. I love the brilliant display, the pictures option for wallpapers, the built-in FM radio, and the durability as it is very compact.

<Title>Good product except freezed in a week
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.  Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.   Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player.

<Title>Nano Trump card
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The other reviews covered most of what you would want to know if you were considering this player, I'll breifly express my opinion and include some technical details not found in the other reviews.  This player is amazingly robust, small, and sexy.  Having owned an Apple Nano prior I really appreciate this players "stance" of being shorter and thicker.  The unit is about twice as thick as a Nano, but less then half the height.  For me with larger hands this unit is much easier to operate.  Some people complained about having to reset their unit, having had this for 2 months now I've never had a problem.    Technically, the unit stores the location of several songs and movies you've been listening to in its memory.  This is great for videos and podcasts where you may have to put down the device inbetween listenings.  The syncing software works well with the exception of some video's you have to convert first before putting on the player. the included Zencast software (for subscribing to podcasts etc.) works very well and also allows you to sync within it.  Finally you can also use the device as media storage device for other files if desired.  The ability to throw music (and charge) the player on any PC is a huge advantage of this player (and other non-Apple products), I'm grateful to get away from the lock-in that is Itunes.

<Content>I love this MP3!  It is small and easy to use.  We now have two in our house and will order another.  It is easy to load the music, create playlists and use the player.  Color on screen is great and I love that there is a radio on it too.  Sometimes it is nice to listen to that.  Another great Creative MP3

<Title>Another broken player...
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After following startup directions exactly, charging for the requisite 6 hours, using the Creative software installed on my computer, my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback.  Today, when trying to shut it down, the entire device froze.  Tried to restart it, followed the steps to reset it... no luck.  Now, I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery.  Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player.  Also, a note to other potential buyers, the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand.

<Title>Be warned
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased 3 of these players b4 xmas for my kids on the recomendation of the worker at walmart(big mistake,I know).All 3 of them have had major problems.I am so pissed about these players that I am writing my first product review ever.Player 1 had a firmware crash on day 1 (Christmas)!It went into recovery mode and couldn'nt get out of it.Luckily I was just within the time limit to take it back to walmart for a refund.I wish I had just taken them all back.Less than a month later, the on/off button on player 2 pops off and won't go back on.So now my daughter gets to turn it on and off with a pen tip. Now this morning,35 days after opening, my other daughter tells me her players firmware crashed(player 3)!Again,can't get it out of recovery mode. I search the web and find a link in a forum about mp3 players.It took me to a recovery tool from creative for this problem.I run the program,and it gets the player working again but there was an error on their site so the program wouldn't complete! Now when you turn it on it has to rebuild the library every time.Custom settings reset every time. What a pain! As you can tell I do not like this product. These are just the major problems.If you are buying this product to save a few bucks over the competition, you should also know that the headphones that come with this player are horrible.You will spend another $30+ for a decent set. I replaced player 1 that I took back to walmart with a sony walkman that I ordered on amazon.Oh my God,the difference in quality was amazing!From the look,feel,and above all the sound,sony really came through.The screen is bigger,the headphones sound great and the buttons are sturdy and easy to use,and it wasn't much more money!In closing, don't make the same mistake as I did.Educate yourself on what is available b4 buying.

<Title>Great design, but a lot of bugs, poor quality, and warranty repair costs 1/3 as much as a new player
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: Great design Really like the design of the software Great features, if they only worked Small size  Cons: Poor quality Many bugs involve daily resetting Warranty repairs(3 months after purchase) are 35% the new price, and that is full warranty coverage per Creative Labs. Customer Service... felt like the service a bull gives a cow Need to buy ear buds as the one with it are the 10 cent ones  Life of my Zen V Plus: The resetting was a pain, but tolerable since I constantly made sure I bookmarked the location and could easily get back to it (Audio books).  The ear buds are junk as are most you get with players.  Eventually, the player screen slowly faded over a few days and then stopped working after just over 3 months of owning it.  I had been careful and knew it had never been damaged or even dropped.  It was always in padded plastic case.  I call Creative for the warranty and this is where it got really bad.  It took 2 weeks just to get a RMA from creative to send it to them for warranty repairs.  I sent it with all the info.  They then contacted me 2 weeks later and said they hadn't gotten the receipt.  So I faxed another copy of it.  They said it didn't come through.  Long story short 3 more faxes from different fax machines, 4 times e-mailing it as an attachment as an .mdi, .pdf, and .jpg file and then screenshots of circuit city's order history page and they finally got it.  A few days later I get an e-mail requesting I call and provide payment for handling and diagnosis before they'll even look at it.  I looked at my warranty and saw it said nothing about having to pay for anything, but shipping to them.  They have clarified that it did say I wouldn't have to pay anything.  I am now stuck deciding if I want to pay half the cost to get a new one or suck up my loss and go get a different player.

<Title>Weird static-sounding background noise between tracks
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this I was really impressed with the fact that the buttons are really quiet. There's nothing more annoying than being at the library and being able to hear every little click on someone's phone or mp3 player.   So, I decided to plug my headphones in and listen to the sample music, just to see what it was like while playing music. At first the sound quality was great, not knock-my-socks-off but very impressive. However, as soon as I shifted to the next track I heard... a strange noise. No, not a beep from the player. Not cell phone interference. Just... noise. Sort of like a record before the music plays, but a little more electronic. I thought that maybe this was just a bug, but then I switched to the next track and the next. Same thing.  I'm not that picky when it comes to mp3 players, but it should be a given that the player performs the function of playing mp3s well. It doesn't. I am returning this tomorrow.   Note: I had the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Creative Zen Vision: M</a> and it worked great. It didn't make weird noises when I changed tracks, and really that's the bare minimum when it comes to mp3 players.

<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL BREAK WITHIN 6 MONTHS.  THE SCREEN WILL JUST DIE AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO FIX IT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT OR NOT, IT WILL JUST NATURALLY BREAK. IT IS SOMESORT OF PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS MP3. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MP3 IF YOU BUY IT.  BUY AN IPOD, SANSA, A ZUNE, IT DOES NOT MATTER, AS LONG AS IT IS NOT THIS.  ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY CREATIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE I ALSO BOUGHT HEADPHONES THAT DID NOT WORK.  I REPEAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK.  THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN TO ME, IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, AND DOZENS OF REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ ONLINE.  THE ZEN V PLUS WILL WORK FOR ABOUT 6-12 MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT THE SCREEN WILL COMPLETLY BREAK AND THE PLAYER WILL STOP WORKING.  I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN MP3.  PLEASE PICK A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

<Title>Decent choice for music and audiobooks
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a new player that would support both Yahoo! Music Unlimited subscription downloads and Audible books.  The choices are few.  I already had a Creative Zen Nano Plus, which I loved, but didn't work with Yahoo!.  The Zen V Plus has done very well at integrating with Yahoo! software and I easily added over 500 songs (automatically synchs my playlists).  But, the Audiobooks are hard to find on the menu (only available through the Genre section), and it is touchy about keeping correct place in the book.  When I tried to fast forward, it kept skipping to the next track, and then would restart at the beginning of the track.  If I press PAUSE before shutting down, it tends to skip backward as well.  And the battery life is much shorter than my Zen Nano.  So, for just music, it is a nice product.  Handling of audiobooks could use some improvement.

<Title>GREAT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the 6 plus months that I've been using my Zen V Plus 4GB I had no complaints, sound quality is excellent, features and menu very good, really stylish, I put it through an entire New year's party and everybody was happy with the music, and comments could go on an on... It froze only once after I hit the reset button it's been working fine.  Recommendation: buy the car or wall charger for it (from Creatibve though because there are some immitations out there that could give you a lot of trouble) it will save you a lot of time and the need to look for your computer to recharge (because it won't charge in any other computer different than the one you have the software installed on)  I'm going for the 8GB one next!

<Content>It's not the absolute best but it's up there I guess. The only problem I've had is that it tends to freeze from time to time and the only explanation I could find from the manufacturer's site is due to corrupt data. Now, I don't know how could that happen except maybe when I converted my CDs to .wma/mp3 formats but I've never had that problem with other creative products. Bummer.  I'd still pick this over all the other choices out there right now though.

<Content>I got my Zen V Plus about 3 weeks ago and if froze a few times the first couple of days. I downloaded firmware and it has only frozen up twice since then while I was trying to bookmark a book which is very difficult. Yesterday the power switch fell off and is lost and I have been trying all day to get a response from their customer support by e mail and phone. All I have been able to get is a auto response via e mail that says they will respond within 24 hours. I was never able to hold long enough to get to speak to anyone in their customer service dept. The player has great sound, poor battery life, freezes often and seems to be poorly constructed. I wish I had shopped around a little more.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player.  After reading the reviews, I thought hard and long about purchasing this player but ended up purchasing it in the end.  AND I am so glad that I did.    I loaded up 748 songs right away.  Songs that I ripped from my own collection of CDs.  I also loaded up photos and videos from my recent trip to Hawaii.  I had no problem doing this and the software was self-explanatory.  Basically, drag and drop into the ZEN V Plus folder.    And to top it off, I synched the ZEN with my Outlook contacts.  No Problem.  The ZEN menu system was easy to navigate.  I could easily find the music that I wanted to play and the photo/videos that I wanted to watch.    I love the small compact feel to the ZEN.    So far...so good.  I am glad I purchased this product.

<Title>Documentation please!!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first mp3 player was a basic 1 gig Creative player. Great sound, easy to use with Windows explorer. Unfortunately, this device has virtually no instructions on how it handles mp3 files and the software is just as bad. I expected to categorize my music using folders, sub-folders, etc like on my computer. No way! I finally realized after several emails to creative that the player doesn't work that way. It uses "tags" associated with the mp3 files and the firmware to categorize your music. Unfortunately, nearly all of my ripped cd's had no tags so everything was a mess. Fortunately, I was able to add tags to the mp3 files without re-ripping my entire 350 cd collection. Better documentation explaining file handling etc would have saved hours of aggravation. Also, allowing a windows directory approach would be far easier. I recently discovered that a different brand player uses the same approach and also lacks documentation on how files are categorized, etc. The more indepth general manual did mention in a footnote that files are categories by tags, but didn't explain how they are added or how to edit them. What a pain. Overall, a great sounding compact player that should come with an AC charger.

<Title>Awesome Player - Great Price
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I checked as many online reviews as I could before deciding, and the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB was both highly regarded and going to give me the most bang for my buck.  I was not disappointed.  Don't let its' small size or spartan appearance fool you; once you get the hang of the menu system, it is both easy to use and intuitive. It sounds great, though some of you may want to get a set of higher end earphones.  It appears to be fairly durable; so I'd expect it to stand up to just about anything short of outright abuse.  I've used a variety of MP3 players over the years and this one is by far the best.  The bottom line is that it's done everything I've expected of it and I highly recommend it.  I can't comment on the included software, as I use Linux (openSUSE 10.3), not Windows.  You can either reformat the Zen as a MTP device, or go to the Packman repositories and install Gnomad 2 and any associated dependencies to use it as a native PDE device, which is what I did.  Works flawlessly!

I carry it on my neck with the supplied lanyard when on the train and while riding a bike and I can't be happier. Again, sound quality is very very very good (I use Sennheiser headphones). The only thing I can think of that is probably better on iPod is the scrolling speed. Using the joystick the scrolling speed/control has less sensitivity. The joystick is very comfortable anyway, and control is very good so in my opinion it is still a 5 starts device. In my opinion the price is a steal as well (and I don't work for Amazon :) )

This is so much better it holds so much music and the battery lasts, for me, at least one week and thats with everyday use. I like my players small and sleek, its very compact but the screen is still large enough to see. I really enjoy it and i have many other friends that feel the same way.

<Content>The Creative Zen V Plus at this price cant be beat by any other player.  I have had my Zen for about 3 months now and all i can say is wow. So many more features than the competition and at a better price.  Pros: -Price -Line In is Crystal Clear -Microphone -and more  Con: -It froze on me twice (which is to be expected from any MP3 player)

<Content>Love it! Much smaller than I expected. Easy to use while running. Much better than the Zen Micro I had previously, which had the touch screen. The toggle does need a  fingernail to use, so it might not be as easy for someone short nails. Headphones do not have good sound and get muffled sounding when you sweat, so I use different ones.

<Title>Breathtaking
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zen VPlus and wow, it was simply breathtaking.  Where do I begin?  Firstly, I tried ipod from a friend of mine & it was great from every aspect, but I wanted the sound quality to be a bit better. I own some Creative stuff so I hoped if I go for a Creative MP3 player, it should do the job.  And it did! The little player has excellent sound quality - full spectrum with an exceptional s/n ratio. I am very satisfied with it.  Pros: - The player nicely fit in the hand. You'd find you'd like to keep it in your hands even when you don't want to use it. It's like a toy. - The device is very usable. The menu is very convenient. And the 2 buttons + joystick behaves exactly the way you think. Some people say the joystick button is a bit tight and gives a cheap feel. But I did not find it so. - When you look at the player, it looks totally anonymous. All product information is mentioned at the back side of the player. Even the root menu item reads, simply, 'menu'. I like this very much. Because if the player is very attractive, with its sophisticated artwork, it captures some share of attention which otherwise should have gone to the song itself. When you listen to music, the player should support you, by not capturing your attention and let you focus on the music. This player does it very well. - The screen quality is great. Creative has used OLED, which is not as bright as LCD. But the OLED display is viewable from every angle, unlike LCD, and also consumes less power. The ability to view from every angle is a great thing. - The ability to play video, the FM radio and the ability to record from Line-In audio adds much value to the package. - The sound quality of the FM radio and the recorded audio (from built-in mic) are extremely good.  - The casing and the screen are covered with a scratch-resistant layer. The player was dropped once with a big impact which made me to lose all hopes before picking it up. But the player works fine and still I was not able to find the scratch mark of the impact! Seems like it is truly scratch resistant. - The software kit was very convenient. You can manage play lists, etc., very quickly.   Cons: - Would have been better if a battery charger was included. The USB-charging takes some long time. But this was not a big issue.

<Title>Great Mp3 player . . . When it works.
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a replacement for my Zen Nano Plus that died a sudden death just after a year.  I figured I dropped it too many times, or something like that because I know I give "pocket electronics" (i.e. PDAs, cell phones, Mp3 players) a very hard life.  Well this one never left my house, though I will admit I put it through its paces.  My biggest problem with it is the buttons on the side of the joystick.  Whenever I use them, it almost feels like I have to use TOO much pressure to activate them.  I would expect something like this from a device that was 1-2 years old not one 3-4 weeks old.  Besides that, I love my player.  The screen isn't big enough to watch full-length movies, but I won't be doing that anyway so that doesn't matter, the pictures show fairly well, sound quality could be better, but I don't just listen to music; I'll read or do other things while listening, so sound quality doesn't bother me.  Also the battery life is repulsively short.  Even if I have a full charge, I'm lucky if I get 6 hours of listening time.  When you take everything into consideration, this player isn't good, it isn't bad either, it is your everyday, run of the mill average mp3 player, and I was highly dissapointed by that.

<Title>battery life is short
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>his model seems to have a battery life of about 9 hrs so it's not really 15 hrs. To extend the battery life one must not use the equalizer, use lower bitrate songs, and lower volume yet it still has a short battery life so if you're planning to go on long trips it's not good. The annoying thing is that the headphones are a bit too big and uncomfortable for my small ears. The creative media explorer software was easy to use to sync music from my pc but there were some files that couldn't transfer with the smartfit option. The smartfit option allows me to compress the file that are transferred to the zen. The error that I got was that the music files in question might not be an audio file. Those music files transferred successfully when I disabled the smartfit option and transfer them as mp3 files. overall I feel this product offers a lot for its price but I would have liked a longer battery life. The charging time was not 6 hrs, it was actually about 3 1/2 hrs for me so I think that 's acceptable compared to the ipod or sansana.

<Title>Little player, little enjoyment
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If I had to do it again, I'd spend a little more and get an iPod.  Extremely low output when used as AUX with stereo systems.  My screen kept getting dimmer and dimmer until it went completely black, luckily within the warranty period of 3 months.  Creative was not horrible to deal with from customer service stand point, but is that why you'd buy a player?  I'd rather have one that doesn't require additional work in a few weeks.  Not bad for using around town, workouts or even on the slopes, but don't expect this to be the best of what's available.

<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I didn't want to give in to the ipod monopoly.  I was excited about the fm radio, but you rarely get reception.  The organizer is just a waste of space. I never could figure out how to set the clock on it.   But for about a year,it played back my music which is really why I bought it. Then the screen went out and I could only play the last album I listened to over and over. I downloaded updates and the recovery tool from Creative, but nothing worked and eventually the player stopped working all together.  What a waste of money. And even though I didn't want an ipod, every accessory out there is designed with an ipod in mind.  Sometimes, you just have to give in.

<Content>I purchased two of this mP3 player- one for my daughter, the other for my neice. I had done much searching and reviewing before purchasing this product through Amazon. Amazon had by far the best price. My neice at first insisted she wanted an Apple IPod until she saw the Zen and all it's functions, not to mention the 4GB holds more songs than an Apple IPod 4GB. My daughter and my neice were both very pleased- it's size, durability, and all the functions suit them just great. I would definitely recommend this product.

<Content>Bought for my daughter in Sept but display began fading after a couple months and finally died in December. Annoying that it lasted just past the 30 day Amazon return, but not much more. Per Creative the cost is $25 non-refundable for "labor" diagnosing returns.  That is outrageous! Over %25 of product cost for them to make it right (assuming they honor the warranty). Due to the lack of medium term reliability with the added insult of paying for warranty service, I will never buy another Creative product.

That's right, me. Creative makes a crappy product, and when it does not work, I get stuck with the trouble and expense of returning it to them.  During my research to fix this problem I came across other people who have the same glitch as I do, so apparently this is not a one-time-only deal.  Buyer beware!

<Content>This is my first music player.  I like it a lot for playing digital books, that I download from my local library. (Most public libraries are not compatible with iPods). It has a bookmark feature that's very helpful.  The only downfall I see, is that the player freezes up when fast forwarding.  You have to have a pin handy to stick in the little hole to reset it.

<Title>Don't buy this...too big of a chance of getting a bad one. 
<Date>Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my husband from Circuit City.  I thought it was so neat looking and my kids have had other Creative products, so I ordered a Zen V for myself from Amazon.  The one I got had to be returned to Amazon since it froze and could not play a whole song through (Amazon, btw, has WONDERFUL customer service/return policy).   When we went to load songs on the Zen VPlus I bought my husband, it froze after about 60 songs (about .4 gb in) and the only way to reset it was to format the device.  I tried everything including downloading new firmware etc.  Sadly, I was not able to return it to CC since we didn't realize it was not working within their return period.  I did return it to Creative, paying $8+ to mail and insure it.  They sent another unit and it HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.   They supposedly have sent my complaints to a supervisor, but no one has responded yet.  I have a unit that should hold hundreds (or thousands, even) of songs, and we can only load on about 60 songs. What a RIP OFF it has proven to be.  I think that Creative is just going to monkey around with this until my warranty expires.

<Content>The power switch on the Zen V Plus doesn't always work. This occurs usually after it's been sitting idle/powered off for over 6 hours or so. If you play with the switch for about 10 minutes or so, it will power on. This and the fact that it doesn't integrate natively with iTunes are my biggest concerns. Regardless if you use PC or Mac, just get the Nano...it integrates with both iTunes, WMPlayer, etc. and I haven't heard any complaints from friends that own the Nano. Stay away from the Zen.

That too is suffered by many people (Search Google here too). Creative has only 3 months of labor warantee and products break so you will have to shell lot of money even if your hardware warantee is 1 year, what a trap!

<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I chose the Zen V Plus for a couple of reasons, not the least of them being its fantastic price.  It just seemed to do so much more than the iPod for so much less.  I couldn't put it down!  Sadly, very shortly after I got it, a small crack that had been growing steadily in the joystick finally gave way, splitting the thin plastic.  I exchanged it for another, hopefully less problematic one.  With both players, I encountered sporadic freezing, but on the second one, the reset button didn't work.  I gave up and just sent that one in for a refund.  It may just have been bad luck, seeing as I know others who have not encountered these problems, but be forewarned:  the plastic seems quite fragile.  If it weren't for the manufacturing, I would have given it a full 5-star rating.

<Title>Creative Zen - So Far, Fantastic; Update the Firmware Before Using
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Zen V Plus for about 2-3 months, and it's been working beautifully so far. I first chose the Zen instead of the iPod because I did not want to be bound to the iTunes interface - I'm a drag and drop sort of person.  One thing I did as soon that I got the device was download and update its firmware on Creative's website in the Downloads section with the January 07 release, as I noticed that there were plenty of complaints about the firmware. So far, no faulty firmware or freezing problems.  It's survived a few field trips, being passed around by excited middle schoolers (who, much to my chagrin and amusement, immediately coined it Tamagotchi-like and cute, among other similar adjectives). In addition, many commented that it was better than an iPod, due to the FM radio capability and higher capacity hard drive - many of them own the iPod Nano 2GB (in fact, me and a close friend are the only two to own a Zen product)There are minuscule scratches on it, but only visible if you go in for a nice close up.  The voice recording worked for entertaining us for hours on end, though the quality was a bit mediocre, and could have been better. While the subtitles were impossible to read, we did have a nice time with watching some smaller clips of anime and other media. I wouldn't recommend  watching a full episode, though, it is a nice thing to have on a field trip with you for the price versus a video iPod.  One of my friends who owns an iPod comments that one of the better things it has is the precise volume control, just clicking the up/down button on the side. He notes that he has tried changing the volume on his own iPod, and when distracted, accidentally clicks the wheel the wrong way and nearly blows out his eardrums (hyperbole, but it's a strain on your ears nonetheless).  This is surprisingly durable. I've knocked it onto the floor, banged it a couple times against an upright bass (music festivals include the major lugging of our string instruments), and some other incidents. One worth mentioning happened only today.  I was in the bathroom of my home, and had my earbuds on, listening, with the Zen on the counter. I'm a klutz, and Murphy's Law is evil - so of course, I slung my arm around to grab my towel to wipe my hands - and the Zen went soaring into the sink, still draining with about a quarter inch of soapy water. I quickly yanked it out, slightly wet from the incident. I quickly shut it down, and wiped it off with a towel. Hoping for the best, I waited for it to dry before turning it on. And lo and behold, it was still working and functioning correctly.  Granted, it wasn't in the water for very long, or even what you'd called completely submerged, but the damage that could have happened didn't. For that, I'm thankful.  The only time I've had to reset this was when I decided to view a video that I hadn't converted beforehand and the device froze. Fortunately, the reset button quickly remedied the freeze and I learned to not be too impatient when transferring media onto these that I know probably won't work correctly.  Of course, I've only had it for about three months, so I might be back with a few corrections. I wonder how well it (namely, the joystick) will hold up in the future.  Pros: - Smart Volume (great for keeping the volume from blowing your ears out and still achieving phenomenal sound; this can be disabled and enabled as you wish) - Great capacity for its price - Durability - FM radio - Voice Recorder - Customizable color themes and backgrounds from .jpeg pictures loaded onto the device  Cons: - Small video size - Tiny screen - Long charging period - Bass amplifier renders slightly scratchy sound; better off without it - Seemingly delicate joystick  Overall, it seems that since I haven't had the problems others seem to be having, might just have to do with updating the firmware. I can't say the same for the joystick navigation in times to come, but so far, this is one tough little device, and I hope to enjoy it for months, at least, to come.

<Content>This player works but it crashes and needs to be plugged into computer to be brought back up with its reset button. Screen is hard to see in daylight and sometimes impossible to see. Sound quality is good. Case broke where lanyard is attached, I was shocked. I have to say I would not buy this player again along with the Ipod which I found this is not up to the task of being used in a mobile situation. I have an old creative zen big 40gb hd model that has out lived 2 ipods and now is still in better shape than this one. It still is working today but I do not have much hope for it at this point.   UPDATE: This player is now dead as I had fallen asleep with it in my pocket with the headphones. It seems that one of the ear buds crushed the lcd while in the pocket. I am very displeased by this and it seems to me if you can have a cell phone last 3 to 4 years of every day use why can i not get a mp3 player last 1 year of intermittent use.

I use it every day at work and listen to books during my drive time. A warning when loading your music from your PC, don't let windows media manager do the auto sync. I ended up with about 500 pictures on the Zen. To make room for the books and music I had to remove them all. The only negative I have is trying to figure out how to rewind the books so I can listen to parts I miss. The radio works ok but did take a bit to figure out the best way to get to the stations.

<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wore out my Creative Zen V 1 GB(after almost a year), so I upgraded to the Plus with 4 GB.  I love it.  It's easy to use (since I'm not real computer literate) and it has lots of memory.  Right now I have 3 books on it I downloaded from netlibrary (for free) and 4 Christmas albums that I ripped from my collection and that only takes up just over 1 GB.  You can download pictures, videos, listen to FM radio and use the voice recorder to name a few of its functions.  Now why would you buy an Ipod?

<Title>Great product with excellent support for anyone with half a brain
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little player is very nice,with an incredible array of features and functionality.The manual is not buried deep in the creative program folder,as mentioned in one review.Go to program files/Creative/Creative ZEN V Series (R2)/Manual.Create a shortcut on your desktop,for easier access,if you'd like.It's a very thorough manual,with very clear instructions.The Creative website also has further assistance,such as firmware,the latest of which is 1.32.01,which improves the album art display.Audio quality is excellent,Video is easily converted with the software program.FM radio,voice recording,line in recording etc.Of course it has limitations,but for $99.00,I know I've got my money's worth.It's not on a par with my Cowon D2,but I have to give this feature packed device two thumbs up or a 5 star rating.You'll have to quantify that your self.

<Title>Zen V Plus - brilliant
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ZEN V Plus 4GB Black/Blue I've had the zen for 3 months now and am delighted with its performance, it exceeds what I expected.  It does everything creative claim for it.  I use it most days both around the home and out and about, sound quality is great.  It hangs around your neck on the included lanyard and when you've made your selections it is small enough to tuck inside your shirt or in a top pocket so is unobtrusive.  The screen is a bit small for videos but having said that it plays them very well and its easy to convert them with the included software.  The included software works fine but after reading some other reviews I bought a copy of media-monkey which integrates perfectly with the Zen. So I would pass on that recommendation. You can download a trial version to try it before you commit.  One bonus I didn't expect is the line in. I've connected it to the headphone socket of my hifi and can digitise my vinyl collection without any special links to the computer. Works a treat, Brilliant!  Another bonus is the voice recorder.  Press the record button on the side no matter what you're playing at the time, hold it like a microphone, speak your notes and then resume playback.  Its so easy,  would even make a reasonable interview tool in a non-pro environment say for a student.  With the proviso that a model with a larger screen would be better for video, I would recommend the V Plus. Suggest that if video is important to you, you try the new ZEN otherwise the V Plus is superb.

<Title>Tech Support Responded Quickly Even Pre-Purchase
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted the Zen V Plus to use for audiobooks, as it seemed the best-featured and best-reviewed of the players that have been tested and work well with NetLibrary (free books through many public libraries, including mine). (I also used reviews from Amazon's question section, where someone had asked about the best player to use with NetLibrary. This was by far the most common response in my price range, and the most common response in any range by a smaller margin.) But, a couple of the other reviews here worried me; I didn't want to buy a dud with poor tech support!  So, I visited Creative's site and asked their tech support directly to respond to this concern before I purchased. I sent my e-mail to them at about 7 pm, and by 2 am had a very friendly reply, including this paragraph:  "Please also note that when you purchase a Zen V Plus, you will get 60  days of free phone support and 1 year email support. Should you  encounter any issues with your player or have any questions on how to  use the features, you are free to email us and we will be more than  happy to assist you."  I also explored the extensive knowledge base on their website. I'm pretty comfortable with my computer, so someone else might not find an online tech support database like that as reassuring as I do, but looking around, I felt like I could probably find the solution to most common problems there without having to wait for tech support. Add that to the two months of telephone support and the quick turnaround to my inquiry e-mail--which I sent to tech support, directed to the folks who would respond if my player froze up (which was what I'd read here in a couple reviews), not to any sales department, etc.--and I'm going to put my money down.  If their tech support had any problems before, then those problems seem to be resolved now.  Just thought I'd share that experience in case anyone else had the same reservtions about quality and tech support that I did, based on other reviews here.

<Title>Changed  My Life
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my Zen for 7 months now and use it everyday.  I have it about half full - some music - a couple of audiobooks at a time - some photos.  It has only frozen on me 3 times in all those months.  I love the little size, the no scratch case and the ease of the software included.  What I don't like is that I can't reorganize my files once they are loaded.  Once in a while I'll misplace a song and I can't find it.  Also I broke off the on and off switch when my nail got caught on it while I was exercising.  I still can get it on and off using a pen - but I never did like that switch.  I like the "joystick"  better than the ipod navigation pad.  I bookmark my audiobooks but I can't get it to rewind if I need too.  Still for the $$ that I paid, its just what the doctor ordered.

<Title>Half a product in the box
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product specifically to be able to download audio books from the library, as well as listen to music. The Zen V Plus is one of the few MP3 players with that capability.  1st problem - the instruction manual is over 60 pages, 12 in English. None of which give adequate instruction on loading music into the player.  2nd problem - it is incompatible with Windows Vista. I sent an email to tech support. Received a quick & complete reply. I was told that I needed to download 4 applications (99 Meg) to make the unit compatible with Vista, to be able to download audio books & manage files.  In addition I was directed to a website to gain instruction on "How To" download music & audio books.  I believe that a "complete" product should be shipped when it is sold. This one is sold as a music/audio book player with voice recorder & picture viewing.  I think Creative should be ashamed to put it on the market.

<Content>This is a nice little player you have a voice recorder,you can listen to the radio,hold pics and videos too. I loves the size that was one of the main reasons i got it .  there was one problem with the player though ,  I have a 4gb and it worked until 3or 4 days it froze I didn't know what happened then i found the reset button, you have to use a paper clip (an ear ring works too) it has always been doing that . Its been about a year and the player still works and freezes on me. I also ask someone if they have a paper cilp or an  earing and they never do, so i just taped a paper clip  on the back of the player.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid $100 in total for my 4GB Zen V Plus. Much less than I paid for my daughter's Ipod Nano. It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  But the sound quality, ease of use and how light it is just works.  I really love mine and now my daughter wishes she could have gotten mine instead.  I have seen some complaints about the controls for someone who has big hands and I can see how that might be a problem, but isn't for me and I am just the average girl.  I would reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a 4GB. Be sure to shp for a bargain, because they are out there.  Truthfully if you can get a bargain on the 8GB Why not go just a little bigger and have more space.   I do wish it was just a little bigger and a had a little bigger screen, but for the price and the size this is awesome!

<Title>Little, compact, but great!
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After doing a lot of research on MP3 players I chose the Zen V Plus 4.  I was surprised at how small it really is, and even questioned my purchase at first, but I believe I chose wisely.  Some people who have seen me wear the Zen V around my neck have asked, "Is that the 'I've fallen and can't get up thing?"  Funny.  But that is how small the Zen V really is.  The device is easy to use, easy to navigate, and extremely easy to rip music. Don't even bother with the instruction manual.  It doesn't tell you anything! This is the only complaint I have about the Zen V.  The manual is too confusing, doesn't contain important information on how to use all of the tools, and is written in too many languages.  That aside, by experimenting with the Zen V I was able to quickly manage it.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to make changes with the equalizer is simple too.  The earbuds take awhile to get used to, and they aren't the greatest, but they provide good sound quality.  Tending to march to the beat of my own drum I did not want to get an ipod, and I am glad I didn't.  I am very pleased with the Zen V Plus!

<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zen 2 months ago and I just love it. I like the fact that it's so small. I can put it in my pocket and listen to tunes any time and anywhere I want. The only time it froze up on me was when I was trying to hook it up to play on my car radio with an adapator I bought at a store. The adapater sucked all the juice out of the battery on my Zen. Once I hooked it up to my computer and recharged the battery it worked just fine, and I haven't tried hooking it up to my car again. I also haven't had any other problems with it freezing up. Could be because I've never used the software that it came with since I use Napster. Bought a cover to protect it and a small digital camera case to keep it in as well. Like everyone else, I absolutely hated the ear buds that came with it, so I bought different ones.  This product has been everything I wanted and more, and the price was perfect for me.  I could not be happier.

<Title>Not an Ipod Yet but a good 2nd Choice
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone compares each mp3 player to an iPod and since I own 2 iPods I am going to do the same thing.  The Zen's controls are OK, the little joystick in the center can be a pain if you have bigger hands or if you are trying to do 2 things at once (i.e. drive and change songs).  But it gets the job done.  The menu's and organizational software is good and it works well with Windows Vista.  The big plus is the services that it works with.  Yahoo's music service is great and if you are into music over the long run it is a lot cheaper than iTunes.  All in all my suggestion would be get and iPod if you have no mp3 player.  Get a Zen is you don't want to deal with iTunes or want a music subscription service.

I spoke to the two people who had the Zen when this happened and they told me that I am lucky it even turns on, because both of their Zens stopped working completly. I DO NOT recomend this product. An Ipod is the same price and from what I have heard a lot more reliable.

<Content>This is my second Zen player...wanted one with more GB so went with the 4 GB Zen V and I've had it now over 4 months.  The controls are easy to work, especially if you like tactile feedback.  The joystick is not too small and I have typical male-sized thumbs.  I've dropped it several times accidentally and the screen held up, no problems at all.  Battery life is really near 15 hours.  I just got back from a very long extended vacation with drives of over 700 miles on several days and it was a lifesaver.  Not a single problem ever with either Zen I own.  I'm just waiting on the 8 GB to go down in price :)  Update: After 8 months, still great.  It's only locked up on me twice...once I reset it easily, the other time I had to let the battery run down.  Still, only 2 locks in 8 months.  My next MP3 player will be a Creative product.

<Title>Disappointing after less than a year.
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zen V Plus as a Christmas present in 2006. When I first started using it, I was extremely happy with what I had got. Everything worked nicely, the screen was good, sound quality was good. As much as   The first time it froze up on me, I didn't know what to do at all. I found the reset button, and then I had to go searching for an earring or other small object. This has happened numerous times, and it's an extreme pain to have to deal with every so often.  Secondly, the joystick may seem like an improvement to others, but to me, it's quite a pain. Personally, I have a lot of songs on my player. When I want to find a band or song that falls between J and O, I have to hold it down for the longest time just to find the right song. Then, I usually wind up passing it and having to go back, which requires more thumb pressing. Once in a while, I'll push the stick the wrong way, and lose the list. When I go back to the list then, I have to start back from the top once more, just to find that one song.   Up until a few weeks ago, I thought the joystick was the most of my problems. Over time, my screen started to get darker. I thought it might have been lack of charging from my end, since I had a tendency to bring it with me to school, and then forget about it in my bag until the next morning. I plugged it into my computer, with that lone cord they give you, and nothing improved. I gave in, and went to the main Creative website and found out what was wrong: for some reason, the screen on the players sometimes get darker, and darker. Eventually, then all go black, and you can't see anything at all. The only way to fix this, is to send it in for a new one. Now, I'd be fine with this, but it requires you to have saved the receipt and I received mine as a gift, so I don't have the receipt.   I had really high hopes for this one after having a few problems with my old iPod. Experiencing this makes me want to return to iPods.  If you are considering buying this, consider it carefully. And as others have said, it has it's pros but it has many more cons.

<Title>Not for compulsive organizers, freeway drivers, the particular
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player so I could simplify my music-listening while I drive up and down I5 each weekend.  IT WAS A MISTAKE.  I've had it just over 24 hours and I've already had to reset it at least three times (yes, I updated the firmware).  The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press "pause" then "play" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.    The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.    The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The "alarm" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?    The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?  So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say "The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me" but I'm not totally sure that's true.  If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had. I'm just glad I didn't buy a bunch of expensive accessories for it before I realized how much I hate it.

<Content>I've had this player for three months and it has never frozen on me.  This is my first MP3 player and so far, I am very pleased with it.  Using the software to rip CDs was pretty easy and intuitive.  Making playlists using the software was easy.  The sound quality is quite good, in my opinion.  The headphone shape could be better (they have a tendency to fall out of my ears if I try to walk around with them on).  I haven't tried to put video on this, so I don't know how easy that is yet.  I have downloaded some Zencasts, and that was easy.  However, I do think people should know that they are very unlikely to be able to put 2,000 songs on this player - I believe 1,000 is the maximum one could put on this.

<Content>I bought this for myself, and the very same day I bought it, I was scrolling through my list of songs and it froze. I waited a minute, then tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't even do that. When I returned it that night, the light was still on. I couldn't figure out how to get the battery out, either. Getting songs on it was easy, but mine wouldn't create playlists without putting all of the songs in that entire section (album/artist) all on the playlist instead of a single song like I was trying to do. Apparently I'm not the only one with a messed up version of this product, so I'd highly recommend getting something else such as a SanDisk. I currently own the SanDisk e250 and love it.

<Title>Do not purchase for Audiobooks
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Update:  I have given up trying to use this product for audiobooks.  The more I have used it, the more frustrated I have become.  It is too late to return it.  It will go in a drawer where I don't have to look at it.  I am resuming my search for a MP3 player good for audiobooks.  Previous comments:   I purchased the Zen V Plus to use for audiobooks.   I have recently discovered online libraries with free audiobook downloads.  Alas, these books are not ipod compatible.    There is no comparison between the ease of use of my video ipod and the Zen V Plus.  With the ipod, I can move from book to book and rarely lose my place.  Turn off the Zen V Plus in the middle of a chapter and I can almost guarantee your place will be lost.  Moving forward or backward in a chapter of an audiobook with the ipod is simple with the click wheel. With the Zen V Plus, it is an exercise of frustration.  You move around the interface using a small toggle.  Try to advance more than a couple of minutes and the Zen will "freeze up".   The unit can not even be turned off.  The only solution is to reset it by inserting a paperclip to "rebuild the library".  Also, there is a distressing tendency to "skip" to another section of the book.    (Searching Chapter 21 becomes Chapter 4)  Forget the estimated battery life of 15 hours.  While searching for your lost place in the book, battery power drops rapidly.  However, I will keep the unit because of the 4 GB and the nice little screen.  With more and more libraries offering downloadable books, hopefully a unit designed to accommodate audiobook listeners will be forthcoming.

<Title>Disappointing in so many ways...
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product has significant flaws that mark it as a work in progress.  I like the compact size and feather-weight. I hate the software.  I *did* download the latest software/firmware from Creative's site and successfully installed it.  * The "Zen V Series Media Explorer" is but one of the numerous applications that the CD installed on my laptop.  It looks like Windows Explorer and allows me to "cut" or "copy" a song that was mistakenly placed in a separate folder from the rest of the tracks on the album, but then it won't let me paste it where it belongs!  "Paste" is grayed-out!  It puts songs & photos into whatever folder it sees fit.  Once a file is on the device, you can't move it to the proper folder!  The Organizer, a redundant application, is worse and should be called the "DIS-organizer."  If you put a collection album (like "hits of the 60's") on it, each song goes into its own folder.  * It plays MP3's, but when copying music from a CD it only does it in Windows Media Player format (*.wma).  To convert to MP3, you have to BUY software.  * The CD also installed useless "craplets" from Yahoo on my computer.  It also tried to change my web browser's home page to Yahoo and sign me up for special offers.  Watch those check boxes!  You have to catch those and un-check them to avoid Yahoo's "generosity."  * It doesn't come with a wall- or car-charger!  I spend enough time on the computer and don't want to sit here just to charge it.  (Note: The iPod doesn't either; it comes only w/ a USB charger.)  *  By the time I buy all the stuff I need for it, I will have spent what I would have spent on an iPod.  iPods get bad reviews, too, but I know more people with those and might give iPod a try.  * Creative's idea of customer support is relegating us to a "discussion group" on their web site.  The discussion groups are terribly messy and are for families of products.  There isn't one for just this product.  Some of those groups had over 10,000 posts.  Good luck.  * It's not loud enough.  I have the volume near the maximum most of the time.  It's a pain to find a song.  There's just no way to organize what you've stored.  It's a mess.  I could go on listing more problems with their applications, but I think you get the point.  Update (11/25/07):  (1) I put a bunch of my CD's on it and when I went to an album, sometimes only one track showed up!  The rest were elsewhere or not there.  (2) I copied some pod-casts (in MP3 format) to the "recordings" folder and the copy task-bars ran to completion, and the MP3's showed up on the recordings folder with their explorer app.  Guess what?  Those weren't on the device at all!  (3)  I copied some pictures to the pictures/people folder on the device, and some to the pictures folder (above it).  It wouldn't let me move those down into the pictures/people folder!  THIS THING IS UNUSABLE!  I really hated it and took it back.  Going to try a Zune or iPod.  Their crummy software absolutely ruins it.

<Title>Creative doesn't seem to like their customers
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had it 24 hours and I'm already disappointed. The documentation is minimal, and what exists is scattered around in web pages, 2 printed booklets, and a PDF file installed deep within the program files folder on your PC, so there's no single source for basic documentation. Support is available through email. (The site says to check your manual for a 24-hour phone number, but the manual says to their web site.)  The CD ripper that comes with the player does NOT rip to MP3 format. Apparently, they used to charge you $10 to be able to do that, but now all you get is sent to a dead link on their web site.  There's a discussion forum if you're interested in workarounds.  All in the all, the device itself is perfectly adequate compared to its competition, but given all the negatives, you might as well buy a comparable brand that's much more customer-friendly.

<Title>I love it!

<Content>I recently purchased the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Nano. So far, I have been very pleased. I have a neuromuscular disorder and I am able to grasp this player more easily than my friend's I-Pod. I am able to use the joystick with no problems as well. The software is easy to install and work with. It is easy to recharge and the battery life is excellent. I have been pleased with the sound quality. And, it is just plain "cute."   A few minor "cons." Screen is hard to see in bright sunlight and the smooth exterior sometimes gets a "smudged look."  An excellent buy for the money and I would purchase this product again.

<Title>Piece of Junk!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Looks good, easy to add / delete songs videos photos etc, thats about the only good things about this product. Used it about 4 times since i bought it off Amazon, of the 4 times, it froze on me twice, once it freezes none of the functions work, cannot switch it off etc. the only way to get it working again is to reset the unit, which can be done only by a paper clip / pin (which is difficult to get on the subway or bus). Cannot return the product to Amazon as its past 30 day period, so stuck with it as long as it works.... thinking about contacting the manufacturer, may not have much luck there either. Remember to buy a box of pins along with this unit, looks like you will need it often.

<Title>DON'T BUY
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player worked ok for about 3 weeks - just occasionally freezing.  Then it started freezing several times a day, and the cursor would scroll down any menu without anyone touching the toggle switch.  I couldn't choose any selection with the toggle because the cursor wouldn't stay on a selection.  I returned it to Amazon & they exchanged it.  They were great!  Amazon's return department gets 5+ stars. The new player was fine for about 4 weeks & now it's again freezing constantly, but the reset button won't work.  To reset, you have to let the battery run down fully, then recharge.  It's really a shame, because when it's working it's a neat little player.

<Content>We liked this product until after a few hours after we got it, it stopped working and froze.  The reset button did not work.  When searching the net for answers, I found many instances where others had the same problem.  It was not Amazons fault but the Creative company who needs to do some tweaking on their product.

<Title>Zen V Plus for audiobooks
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's a bit of a learning curve with the Zen V Plus, but after you master the controls and learn how to use the menus, it works well for downloading and listening to both books and music. I use it mainly for audiobooks, and my only complaint is that if you pause for more than a short time, or turn the player off, it goes back to the beginning of the present track if you haven't set a bookmark (which sometimes is a little tricky). There is also a fast-forward function which you can use to return to where you left off, but sometimes when you hold this too long, the player freezes up, and you have to push the reset. Over all, however, I give the player high marks. It does what I want it to do, and is a low-cost alternative to the I-Pods.

<Content>This MP3 player has more functions than even a $300.00 iPod. I am well pleased with it's performance for only $99.00. I would like them to put a rewind / fast forward on it though. I listen to audio books and if I miss something I must start that track over from the begining, which could be a couple hours long.

<Title>Is this player worth even $25 to me?
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When switching over to a flash player about four months ago, I decided to go with the Zen V Plus.  My Zen Nomad had done fairly well over a few years with just a few hiccups.  I have become increasingly unhappy with the player as time went on, and am furious at the moment.  "Design"  The play button's integration into the casing itself does not provide a good enough reaction.  Often I found myself pushing Play and nothing happened.  I would have to really focus my mind on pushing in just the right location to get it to respond.  The joystick is not awful, but also not good.  I was not fond of scrolling through menus with it and did not like having to push it down to represent a selection.  It works though.  The volume buttons on the side are fine as well as the power slider.  "Pocket Player"  The whole point of a tiny mp3 player is so you can put it in your pocket and not have to look at it.  Therefore, these players need to be easy to use as if you were blind.  This particular player almost accomplishes this.  The only problem I had was with using the little joystick to move backward or forward a track, as it was easy to make a mistake and go the wrong direction.  Other players with dedicated buttons for backward/forward are usually simpler to operate blind.  "Audio Book Usability"  I don't normally listen to music, I do audio books instead.  One thing I loved about the Zen Nomad I've had is the way it keeps track of where I am when I pause it to turn it off.  The Zen V does not do this.  If you pause the Zen V, then shut it off, the player will restart you at the beginning of the track.  There is a way to keep you at the same place you were at: you must simply shut the player off first.  If you are currently listening to something, then turn the player off, it remembers your location.  However, when I am listening to a book, I often pause it for some reason, like to listen to someone else.  During that break, it might be 10 seconds, it might end up being 10 minutes, you never know.  The player automatically shuts itself off, and when you boot it back up you have now lost your position.  Turning it off directly is not a good way to keep your position in a book, pausing is much better.  "Screen"  Not great.  The screen has low resolution, things appear very pixelated.  I do not fault the player much for that, since I only care about being able to read the text easily.  However, it was apparent early on that the sides of the screen were getting darker quickly, which can be seen even when the unit is turned off.  Nothing is displayed on the screen unless the backlight is on.  Which means, to see what is currently playing or to look at the menu or anything, you must first push a button to make the machine think you are doing something.  I prefer if you can look at the screen at any time and tell what is playing.  Approximately three months from ownership, the screen died completely.  The player still plays music, but as I can no longer look at a menu at all to change the selection, the player is now worthless.  "Help Request"  I began a help request with creative after going through their website and doing every single thing possible on their troubleshooting pages.  The website is a major chore, as after every link you click you have to re-enter your product information, "America" "Music Player" "Zen" "Zen V Plus".  This was really annoying.  I sent a detailed amount of information when giving a description of the problem I was having, a dead screen, and 24 hours later I got a response saying that it does sound like a problem and to request an RMA, then listed possible charges that would occur.  Charges?  It is just over 3 months old and still under warranty.  Then, I loved the bottom of the email which said why don't you go buy an accessory for your player here?  Going through the website again for the RMA, they want to charge $25 for labor.  Labor?!  The thing is broken, this is a parts issue and the player has a 1 year parts warranty.  I just wanted it replaced because it broke.  I emailed my complaint about $25, they responded 24 hours later again and said that the $25 is so they can test the player out and make sure it is broken.  I understand their reasoning to an extent, however this bugs me to no end.  I went through their troubleshooting for them, I just want a replacement.  By the way, this second email referred me at the end to a handful of other products to buy as well, just to make me even angrier.  Now, I had to make a decision.  I was never pleased with the product from the start, it was not great, but I could use it.    My question was this: is this player worth $25?  I know I could not get a comparable player for $25, so it was do I want to spend $25 and still be unhappy with the product and hope that it does not die again...or spend more for something else?  I decided to go for a different brand.

<Title>Problems with Creative software
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the player itself, but the software has caused nightmares in my case. I already had another Creative MP3 player (NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra) but needed something more portable and with an FM radio. I though these two would work OK together, but the Zen V Plus software wouldn't even install properly.   Every single module to be installed on my PC raised some sort of "DoInstall failed to launch setup.inx" error message. The installation failed, and looked like it rolled back changes. But the software shows up in my Start menu - and the applications won't uninstall. On top of that, I am now unable to use the software I was using with my old player.  Worst of all, I am also now unable to uninstall other applications from my computer because this player's software screwed up something in the installer software. I contacted tech support, but have gotten no response from Creative at all.  Back to the store with this one... The player's fine, but don't get this if you're going to install two Creative products on the same PC.

<Title>Impressive. Great for audio books. One small bug.
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zen V Plus mostly for audio books and long podcasts and I'm impressed and generally happy with it. The bookmark feature for mp3 and wma is a winning feature for me which is lacking in most other players.  I find the controls easy to use but its important for a new user to take the time to read the manual that is installed from the cd. It has much more information than the paper booklet.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the fm radio works. The photo and video functions are better than I expected.  I have one issue with it. If I pause a track and then shut down, it is back at the beginning of the track when I power back on. This is mostly an issue if I pause and don't get back to it soon enough. It automatically shuts down after 5 minutes and loses its place. I can get around it by shutting down while playing instead of pausing if I don't think I'll be back in time although power off / on is not as convenient as pause / play. I think its a firmware bug that I hope will get fixed some time. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this issue.

<Title>Zen 4 GB player
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my daughters 15th birthday and she just loves it.  We didn't look at the size when we were looking to buy so I was surprised when it was so small ( 1/1/2 by 2 1/2 inches) but she was  happy when she opened it up and saw how small it was. The amount of gigs is perfect for a first m3p player and the battery life is longer than the nano by ipod. It is nice that skins were offered and we did purchase one.   We own a larger 30 gig Zen and have for over a 18mths and have had no problems or issues with it. This is of course what influenced us to take a look at the smaller Zen. We were happy with the specs and the comparisons we made so, when she took over our Zen we decided to buy her one.  The only comment we have with the purchase is that we found it two weeks later while browsing at our local electronics store for less regular price. ( something that has never happened with past purchases)  But we have been purchasing from Amazon for over eight years and have had only one  return (marketplace purchase) and Amazon made that easy because of their guarantee.We are always very satisfied with our purchases and can trust our online business with Amazon so we never hesitate to look here first when deciding to buy online.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After abusing two iPods to the point of death, I decided that I was ready for a new MP3 player.  From the moment I held the Zen in my hand I knew it was the MP3 player for me, interface unseen.  The form factor of the Zen V plus is just magnificent.  It feels like a perfectly formed little pebble in your hand.  The interace is easy to use and the colors are very bright (I could still make out the screen in direct sunlight from a reasonable distance).  Although the buttons are somewhat awkwardly placed, the orientation of the display can be changed in the options - try rotating it 90 degrees.  The buttons make a lot more sense like that.  The video playback, voice recording, and FM capabilities work well, although they are mostly gimmicky.  I found the audio quality to be slightly superior to an iPod, and it had no problem powering my set of Sennheiser headphones.  I can't talk enough about how durable this thing is - as I mentioned, I broke my two previous iPods fairly quickly.  I have dropped this thing on carpet, concrete, rocks, etc. and there isn't even any scratching.  I just put it in my pocket and go.  The included software is simple and straightforward, and the 4gb hard drive makes me update my music collection more often.  I certainly wouldn't go any smaller, but I don't miss having 30 gb of music I don't listen to either.  Unfortunately, Creative has followed the trend of other MP3 producers and has not included a dedicated charger, instead relying on USB 2.0, which takes roughly 4-6 hours.  If you're looking for a great music player with immensely appealing physical design with high durability and easy to use software, look no further than the Creative Zen V Plus.  Keep in mind that other hardware difficulties listed under this review refer to earlier released models like the 2 GB and the average electronics  product has a 3-5% failure rate.  I would make this purchase again without hesitation.

<Title>Solid, Small, Capable MP3 player
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen V Plus is a nifty little device that accomplishes a lot of audio tasks. It is an audio player and recording, and also displays JPEG pictures and small video files.      I found the usability of the Zen to be very good for it's size. You have to hold the "On" button for least one second to activate the player and this prevents it accidentally turning on by mistake in your pocket. The battery management is also well designed: the display dims a few seconds after you press any of the buttons. If the Zen isn't playing, it automatically turns itself after a few minutes. By virtue of these features, I found that I get hours of play before the unit needs recharging which is done by hooking up to a USB port on your computer.    Sound quality is very good: I was surprised given the Zen's small size and very light weight. In fact, the unit is so small and light, you'll want to attach the strap to prevent yourself losing it. The display is bright and readable. One thing I especially like is that Zen only plays one folder of music at a time and then stops: it doesn't keeping playing one folder after another endlessly like other players do. It's like playing only one CD or record at a time. There also is a "set bookmark" function for going back to an exact spot in a recording.    The included software works well for transferring and managing files on the Zen. While the unit is not straight Windows drag and drop, the Creative Media Explorer accomplishes the same thing. This software also rips music from CDs and is supposed to convert video files to play on the Zen but I couldn't get the latter function to work for my video clips.     The buttons on the Zen are a little on the cheap side but work well enough. There is a "lock" button that is integrated with the "On" switch: this keeps you from accidentally pushing any buttons during recordig or playback. The Zen also acts as a line-in recorder at 128 or 160 kbps recording rate, and has a built-in microphone also. Sound quality is good with line-in and decent on the microphone. I think these features alone are worth the purchase price. The Zen plays FM radio, but you can't record from it with this unit.     You can also display your favorite photos one at a time or in slide show format. The Zen also acts as a portable flash drive. To use this function you need to select from an internal menu to decide how much space to give the new data partition.     As far as "freezing-up" is concerned, my unit froze once when I first used it, possibly due to an incompatible music file that I transferred, and I was a bit miffed. This is simple enough to correct but you need a very small pin to insert in the side of the unit. This causes it to rebuild the file list which takes a few minutes. After doing this once, my unit has worked fine ever since.     The paper manual is a bit skimpy, as others have noted, but the online manual is sufficient. Holding down the "Back" button, the one with the little left-facing arrow, on the Zen shows you additional options for each function. One slightly amusing feature is that the Zen shows you messages like "shutting down" or "processing" in a separate DOS-like window superimposed on top of the main window. It's reminds you that the Zen is, in fact, a small computer. The Zen also contains a calendar and a nice-looking clock with alarm that, while not sounding a beep or buzz, turns on the audio player to a random track or the FM radio. It can do this from a completely shut-down state but you need to keep the headphones attached if you aren't looking at the display.       Overall, I like the Zen V Plus and found that it has become a constant companion for air travel and around the house for a variety of line or microphone recording uses.
