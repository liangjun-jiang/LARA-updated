<Title>Big, heavy, and few extras
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yes, the color screen is great, but.... It's embarrasingly large, and even heavier. The ear buds won't stay in your ears and it didn't come with a protective carrier or clip of any sort. No FM, no voice recording. For the money, i think there are better picks out there.

<Title>Great Purchase---Love it.

<Content>I just purchased a Toshiba Gigabeat MEG-F10. I love the idea of being able to take my music everywhere I go and don't have to carry tons of CD's with me. Also I can carry photo's of my family. All in one little Audio Player.

<Title>Not recommended
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Regret purchasing it.  It is not user friendly as the iPOD. Like the old Sony software, Toshiba seems to be afraid of people stealing copyrighted music where it becomes a pain to load in your own music.  There is no drag-and-drop which would makes things a lot easier.  Toshiba can correct the problem like Sony did by updating their software, making it more intuitive.  Until it does, which is not likely, I do not recommend you purchasing this product.

<Title>best photo mp3 for the money!!
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great mp3. The screen was better than I hoped for and the photos are drag and drop, nothing easier. This is an amazing little gadget and I don't care what any reviewer tells you this thing destroys the nano and is on the same page as ipod photo. Matter of fact, if you consider the price I paid at J&R (one hundred sixty for the 10GB) This is a far better deal than any ipod photo.    lets review--- 10GB, Photo capable, amazing 2.2 inch color screen--- show me something that even comes close for one hundred sixty--- didn't think so

<Title>Bulky and does not play audiobooks from audible.com
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item some days ago but returned it later on to amazon. I purchased it because it was a lot of space for the money. A 30GB IPod almost costs 50-60% more and I didnt have a big collection of audio anyway. But the controls are not user friendly and most importantly I returned it because it did not play the audible.com format which is the most popular audiobook format. When I bought it, it was really from a reluctance to buy ipod because the ipod was so common place but I finally succumbed and bought the Nano which I realized is a fine product after all. Also keep in mind that because this has a spinning hard disk its not a good idea to use it in the gym, especially on a treadmill. Its better to buy a flash drive based product that does not have moving parts, thats why I finally got the Nano.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 player!!
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Toshiba Gigabeat it an AWESOME MP3 player! The software "gigabeat room" and the the controls on the player itself are VERY user-friendly.  my only complaint is that the battery does not last more than 10; not 16 hrs as advertised. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS B/C THOSE PEOPLE WORK FOR APPLE, AND THEIR JUST PISSED THAT TOSHIBA CAN MAKE AN AWESOME AND AFFORDABLE PRODUCT!!!
