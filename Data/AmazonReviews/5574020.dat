<Title>Good MP3 player for the Price.
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was shopping for a 1 Gig MP3 player and heard horror stories about Hard drive ones. I was going to snag the SanDisk Embedded 1.0 Gig one, but Amazon had a $30 rebate on this puppy. Yes, people will say "You get what you pay for." This MP3 player is not bad for the price. I received the player today. I had to charge it before using it using the Rapid charger. It took about 30 to 45 mins to charge it fully. The cool thing is that it even charges when you plug it into your USB port. It comes with no software but you really do not need any. The tricky part is that wheny ou plug it in and turn it on, you have to hold down the power button which is also the play/pause button. It will say USB connected. Windows will see it as a hard drive and you can copy your files right over. The interface is fairly simple to use. There is a big OK button that doubles as a directional button which is kinda strange. It plays mp3s well and is the perfect sized a little smaller than a cigarette pack. If you are looking for something bigger, I would definately go with the Apple IPOD or the the Dell DJ. If you are just looking for something inexpensive that will hold you over, this one will do the trick.

<Title>Nice, but as with most no-name brands...lacking
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this item because a) I do not have an MP3 player and b) it is very cheap for the storage size. I can say that it is worth the price (about $100).   Here is my list of cons for this item: 1) Does not integrate with Windows Media Player... you can play files off of the drive, but the Sync tab does not work with this player.  2) Unit does not use file-based playlists. You cannot use your M3U or WPL playlists with this unit. To create a custom playlist you have to manually type in a name and select the files. Then there is no way to rearrange the playlist once it has been created. You can still play all the songs that are on a particular album as long as the ID3 tag is correct without creating a playlist.  3) The unit does not sort the tracks correctly. I believe it sorts the tracks "1 10 11 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9" alphabetically when playing in "Album" mode, but not numerically. Sometimes the order is totally random. Not a big deal for me as I usually like to play the tracks in random mode. In "Artist" mode it sorts the tracks alphabetically by song title.  4) Controls are a bit confusing. Some buttons have dual functions, but those functions are not obvious or are not labeled. For instance, the MENU button takes you back to the menu, but also acts as a STOP button if you hold it down for 2 seconds. REC button doubles as A-B section repeat.  5) Controls are not consistant in the menus. For instance, the LEFT direction on the joystick can be used as a "back" button... except when you are in the options menu where you have to select from a list of values. In the Contrast menu the slider is a left/right bar but you have to press UP or DOWN to change it.  6) Menu does not let you see the whole artist's name. While navigating to the file you want to hear you are presented with a list of artist's names. Only about 12 characters are shown. Likewise when you view by Album, only 12 characters. Songnames use a different screen layout and the songs scroll to the left to show you the whole name.  7) HOLD switch is smooth and hard to move with finger. You really have to use your fingernail.  8) Joystick control is hard to use without using your nail as well. It's also easy to accidentally press the joystick down when you don't want to.  9) Unit has to compile the library database everytime you disconnect the USB. This takes a minute or 2 and you can't use the unit until it's done.   Here is my list of pros. These are just the ones I feel stand out: 1) Good selection of playmodes. You can shuffle, repeat, suffle-repeat, etc.  2) Adjustable EQ. Has 4 presets and 1 custom EQ with 5 bands.  3) The lithium battery is charged via the USB cable (slow) when plugged in or by the A/C adaptor (fast). Very cool.  4) Screen layout is good. Shows progress of current song with current song number and total songs in list. Battery indicator, volume, and playmodes.  5) Line-in and built-in Mic for recording. Recording options are very limited, but nice to have as a personal voice recorder.   I hope this helps people decide if this unit is right for you.  J. Smith

<Title>Great product!!
<Date>Mon Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For the price, its a great deal! 100$ for a 1.5GB HD! Actually, you really only get 1.31gb but still. It accepts ID3 tags from your music and automatically organizes it for you. Just make sure your ID3tags are v2.4 or they wont be recognized. It has no internal speaker so the only playback for the music/voice rec is through  headphones or something. Its pretty light, not too big, fits nicely in your hand, and it looks slick. Overall, great product!

<Title>Crappy MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Buy this mp3 player ONLY IF:  1.  You have filled out the Id3 tags on all your mp3's 2.  You listen to your mp3's while sitting down and not moving  Moving around and any sort of contact with this mp3 player causes it to freeze (won't turn off unless you reset it with a paper clip).  There are much better choices out there!  Especially flash-based mp3 players.

<Title>Not as bad as some say
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I understand some of the complaints I've read from others, and I think they are mostly from bad individual units.  I've had mine for a couple of weeks with no crashes or major problems.  It does skip if you put it in your pocket or another loose area and move around.  I hold it in my hand when running, or put it on a solid surface when exercising and have no problems.  It's small, light and fits perfectly in my hand.  It also works perfectly with my computer speakers.  The buttons are fairly self-explanatory.  My hold button doesn't stick, but there is only a tiny symbol on the screen for when you do lock it.  It can be easy to forget you locked it, so don't automatically assume it froze like I did the first time I used it.  You can create numerous playlists but each are limited to 40 songs.  While you can't change the order without deleting and readding later, the shuffle feature is nice.  But, if you only want to play a playlist, you need to make certain that the playmode is set for folders and not the entire collection.  It's true that if your songs aren't properly IDed, you get them plopped into the unknown folder.  Not a big deal for me since I always update my info.  It is good for the money.  I have 245 songs on it now and plan to fill it.  While it may not have the reputation the new iPods will earn, it has a screen so you are not blindly navigating through your collection.  For those reviewers who said it skips and crashes excessively and the buttons don't work, obviously something is wrong with your unit.  You have a warranty against defects, so use it!  Mine is perfect.

<Title>Perfectly Acceptable mp3 Player.
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is just a random unorganized tangent about this MP3 player, so don't look for a professionally organized review.  I'm a busy man, here.  I wasn't going to be buying into the Ipod craze but I wanted something cheap that held a fair amount of space being that I loves my music...$118 later along came this at my door step.  If you're a bells and whistles whore and want an mp3 player that puts on a fireworks display while simultaneously making you a pie and performing liposuction, spend your money elsewhere or just carry around your hard drive and a pair of headphones with you.  This does all the basic stuff with a few double functioned buttons with a purtty backlit screen.  It's about the size of a standard Cell Phone, too.  Just in case you were wondering.  The joystick is somewhat annoying to use at times, such as when I'm upping the volume and end up skipping ahead a track by mistake.  But that's only happened one or 2 times now, so it's not a dealbreaker.  You can't see the entire songs or artists name as you're menu cruising?  Oh no!  If you need more than 12 characters to identify what band or song it is you put on your own appliance, seek help.  'Golly...who could this band called 'Stone Temple...' or 'Rage Against...' be?  If only I had THE FULL NAME!'  Granted, it's a nice thing to see the entire name while you're showing this off to friends, but come on people.  Yes, the player does update the complete library when you're done uploading music and can take in excess of 30 or 45 seconds when it's packed , boo hoo.  God forbid some people exhibit the lost art of patience.  All in all, this is just peachy keen with what I use it for:  A)  Listening to music while galavanting around campus from class to class.  B)  Listening to music while I'm putting in late nights at the computer or math labs.  Buy it immediately if this is all you require.  The only true con that I can really think of is that while it's in my pocket, it detracts from my natural buldge.  11 Thumbs up.  Or by Amazon's system...5 stars.

<Title>Good for the price
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for about two months now.  Its a great little with some aggravating elements to it that might be too much for some people.    Pros: sounds great to me (I replaced the ear buds with a better pair), easy to transport songs into it, decent equalizer, plays WMA files, pretty small and compact but feels like a decent quality, screen is clear and bright.  Cons: the "shuffle" mode does not randomize every single time and there is no "resume" mode.  This means that when you're in shuffle mode and you choose the same song to start with as you chose last time (since its just easiest that way), it will play a similar (if not exactly the same) group of songs.  To get a totally random song order, you need to start with a new song, which is a bit of a hassle.  Mine has skipped some if I had it in my pocket while running, but in my hand it has worked fine.  Mine has pretty much worked as advertised and I am satisfied with it.  That said, I'm pretty sure flash player prices will be plummeting so its not a bad idea to wait either.

<Title>A complete waste of money
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit about 3 months ago. Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest I can give it.  I would've gone lower if at all possible.  As far as the player itself, I found the flap that covers the USB port to be difficult to get fold back to get the plug into, and equally as difficult to get back into place without flopping open again.  The control buttons are too small and difficult to manipulate unless you're looking at them, and the "joystick" in the middle is stiff and not easy to manipulate.  The headphone jack is on the side of the unit, rather than the top, which makes it bulkier to put in your pants pockets.  Overall, I wasn't impressed with the controls at all, they weren't designed to be easy to use without fumbling a lot.  The display isn't bad, and the backlighting is nice and bright.  That's about the best thing that can be said about the unit.    I have one of the original 32 MB Diamond Rio players.  It has been through hell and high water, and still works great. However, I was wanting more memory and I started looking around for a reasonably priced player.  Against my better judgement, I ordered this unit, despite not being able to find any user reviews on the company or product.  Once I received it, I charged it fully, then loaded it with songs.  Used it that day at work and it worked well.  After the battery died, I took it home and put it on the charger.  After that, it wouldn't power on, it wouldn't charge, nothing.  Not even the reset button did anything.  After 3 days of attempting to contact the company's "help line" (to this day, no one has ever answered the phone), I called the main office number and got a hold of an employee.  After giving me useless instructions, I was finally told to send the unit back to the company.  After a few weeks, I received the unit back.  Now the power comes on, but the hard drive is fried and I can't store any new songs.  So I contacted customer support again, still no answer on the (no)help line.  So I emailed the original employee back that I could not load more songs on the unit.  His reply was to tell me to check if my USB was working.  Had he paid attention to my email, he would've seen the screenshot I included of my computer's device manager screen, showing that XP recognized the harddrive in the unit, but that the harddrive was offline and not working.    To make a long story short, I now have to send the dang thing back yet again.  With all of my numerous tech gadget geek purchases, I have never EVER had such a difficult time with a product or with customer service.  It's unreliable, the controls are at the very least an annoyance, the company's "customer service" is a total joke and if you do consider buying this product, do so at your own risk.  I really do not recommend it.

<Title>Hey, it's cheap and very nice!!
<Date>Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like this unit a lot; $99 (minus $30 rebate pending) is a GREAT price for a 1.5GB storage unit, much less an MP3 player.  For the bad news first, cons (with explanation): - the buttons/switches are definitely something to get used to, and a valid issue.  It's not quite intuitive, but then I'm coming from a Rio Cali that wasn't very intuitive when I'd first started using it, either. - having to do playlists on the device rather than more conveniently, on the desktop (although if you just shuffle, then it really doesn't matter much).  It doesn't seem there's much in terms of firmware upgrades or support on PD's site, either. - no clock of any kind (except a track counter during play) -- makes it a little more difficult to use as a runner, which is my primary use.  My Rio has a day time set and a stopwatch. - no FM tuner, which is not much of a negative, considering how BAD the FM tuners are on most devices. - no easy belt clip/armband spots, meaning that you'd need a holster of some kind.  Many other devices come with sleeves or clips.  Now the good stuff, pros: - price is out of this world for a 1.5 GB storage device - easy drag-and-drop interface because device shows up as a hard drive (Rio's software wasn't bad, but this is MUCH better) - good sound (which depends much more on earbuds than device) - record feature, which is a nice one for miscellaneous use. - small, light design.  It fits easily in the palm of your hand, and it's SO light.  Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this device wholeheartedly.

<Content>This player is really easy to use with the drag and drop feature; it's like an additional harddrive on ur PC. 1.5GB(actually 1.3) mp3 player for $70!! best deal ever. Good looking interface, good LCD display, small and light weight. Has good sound quality too. One downside is that the controls are a little confusing at first, but i got used to it in 10mins, and after that, it's smooth sailer all the way..i recommend this player!

<Title>Great player, if you're lucky...
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player could be the best deal you can get right now on an mp3 player; priced at $70 if you include the mail-in rebate. It has a good amount of space for the price, and all the functions of it work well, the size is good, though I might have liked it to have some bundled software instead of having to use drag and drop. Also, it can be annoying to tag everything with ID3 2.3 or higher, but tags can easily be converted with many programs. However, this unit has been known to freeze from time to time, and one of the times it froze for me (3 days after I got it) it began to make a buzzing noise even after i reset it, [...] Some people didn't have this problem, so if you're willing to take the chance that mine was an isolated incident, this is a really good player to buy.

Although it freezes some times and you have to reset, although the playlist really sucks, although the jogdial sucks as well, although it's heavy, ugly and huge, still it's worthy for that $70, after all, if you can not bear it any more, break it down and get the 1.5G harddrive will still be a good idea.

<Title>It's defintiely not a I-Pod
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this on Amazon for $65 (includes rebate) + free Philips multi-media speakers so at that price - it is a very good deal.  But I would never pay the full sticker (approx $120) for this MP3 player.  The thing only works well if you let it play songs continuously without interruption.  It freezes if you fiddle with the controls too much and the only way to get it unstuck is to hit the reset button so carry something thin and sharp with you at all times.  Also, the rubber cover on the USB port no longer covers once you use the port so now it just flaps around.  This happened the 1st time I transferred songs.  The Play/Pause button is on the side so if you hold the player like I do, you'll accidentally pause in mid-song very frequently.  Also, the controls are not intuitive - it takes some getting use to.  Final word - if you want a quality MP3 player, get something else that will set up back at a couple hundred $.  If you can live with the quirks AND you get a deal like I did, go ahead and give it a shot.

<Title>faulty piece delivered
<Date>Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this MP3 player by seeing very good deal ( 1.5 GB Mp3 player for just $65). However, the device never worked. First time itself, it got froze (after charging). I navigated the manufacturer's site for trouble shooting. With the great surprise, they have exactly mentioned the same problem that I was facing and its resolution too. But, their resolution never worked. I contacted customer care, and after hearing my problem and effort to trouble shoot the device they just told me that send back device for replacement or for refund. I was disappointed. I assume that there are faulty pieces launched in the market, and manufacturer/seller were knowing about it. That's why such a costly MP3 player came with such a great deal.  With my bad luck, I am the person who got the faulty piece.  I would strongly not recommend anyone to buy this product as there MAY be a chance to receive the faulty piece.

<Content>I bought this before travelling to Cancun to have some tunes for the beach and was really pleased with the performance. It arrived the day I was leaving and I very quickly and easily transferred about 100 songs right before leaving for the airport. It's pretty easy to use and quality seems pretty sturdy. The only thing I would change is instead of the little joystick control on the front, Perception should have made the silver ring around it the primary control module (a la iPod) it would make the handling so much easier. Also, you might want to invest in earbuds with volume control... it picks up where the player's volume may fall a bit short. Overall I am very pleased with this player, especially for the price!

<Title>A good player for broke guys
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just purchased the perception digital's 1.5GB mp3 player. I had done a lot of research before buying it as they were offering 1.5GB for $98. I was pretty reluctant in the start. but i must say this player surpassed my expectations.   Pros: low priced, mp3 decoding is good, SNR > 90db which means a clean and clear sound, 5 band equalizer, voice recording, supports drag and drop mechanism which means we dont have to install any alien software to download files. can be used as a external HDD to store files. comes with a external power supply to charge the player quickly (it can also be charged through the USB port), it has a line-in function which i havent seen in many players, it shows the current equalizer mode, shuffle mode, battery and volume on the screen.  cons: very ordinary looking, the joystick is clumsy and it makes navigation really difficult. the head phones which come along are  worthless so i had to buy new one. and its Made In China so i dont think its very durable. but other than that no serious cons.  overall i think this player does the job and is surely worth the money. I would recommend this player to anyone interested in buying a good mp3 player for a less price.

The flap for the usb IS hard to take off and doesnt set right when you put it back on BUT i found out that you can just pull the whole thing off, and put it back on without a problem and it fits perfectly.  The headphones SUCKED and broke the first week i got them but with my new sony's it doesnt have any problems.  Awesome deal, i'd buy it again.

<Title>NOT 1.5gb really!

<Content>You can use its 1.5GB capacity only if you format it using the FAT32 format; then you can just use it as any other external hard drive but the player wont play any songs for you ... when you format it as FAT (FAT16), the player will play MP3s but then, you can only use 512MB of disk-space. So the 1.5 GB is really misleading ...  Other than that its a decent player ... not as flashy as an I-Pod but does its job ... I also did run into some weird errors with the player a ciuple of times ... once it wouldn't power down at all (so i just left it on and let the battery run dry) and another time it wouldn't stop displaying the "searching for updates" screen (used the same remedy) ...   not the best MP3 player but i guess its not so bad either.
