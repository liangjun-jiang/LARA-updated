<Title>Must Have for Digital Music Fans!!
<Date>Wed Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Much as the iPod replaced the Walkman, I think the MG has chance to replace the iPod.  Two weeks ago, I thought my iPod was a perfectly serviceable music player -- sure it was tethered to my PC, but what was the alternative?    I've since been using the MusicGremlin.  I'm frequently traveling, so it's been great to be able to download new music in coffee bars, from other Gremlins, hotels, airport lounges, etc, etc.  It offered me freedom and flexibility  I had previously found lacking in digital music.  The playlists are also a great feature -- new music that I wouldn't have heard automatically shows up on my Gremlin every week, introducing me to new bands that I never would have found otherwise.   I don't agree with the critique of the interface.  The additional functionality of being able to pull down any song I can imagine requires a few more menus than a simple iPod, but I found the interface to be intuitive and easy.  Highly recommended.

<Title>What You've Been Waiting For!
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All you need to know is--over 2 million songs immediately accessable from wherever you are!  No computers, no waiting.  Pretty sweet.  All you need is your MusicGremlin unit, a wi-fi signal, and your choice of songs.  It's seriously the next generation of music listening, until they create a brain implant, that is.    Simple to use--right out of the box.  Punch in a tune title and within seconds it's playing in your ears.    Yeah, you can push a fave song to a friend, yes, the screen is very sharp and displays album art, but it's the music.  Instant gratification in a music listening device.  Ipod bows to the MusicGremlin.  Why are you still reading this?  Scroll back up and add it to your cart, NOW!

<Title>Leaves Something to be Desired
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is great for people who travel or spend a lot of time on the go.  However, one thing that is missing is the ability to easily transfer your existing music from your computer to your Gremlin.  It does not come with any software and runs off of the Windows Media Player (with an included USB cable) so unless all of your music is already on that program, it's going to take some doing to get it transferred to the Gremlin. Although it would be perfect for someone who is just starting out in the MP3 world and has not yet built a large library.

<Title>Terrible!
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device isn't cheap. After setting up my account, I downloaded 4 albums of songs. I went to play an album, the menu froze up. I tried the power button - no go. I hard reset with a paper clip and still nothing, its permanently stuck on the a "please wait..." screen. Forever.   Had the thing for about 4 hours and now its dead. Same with another  friend of mine too.   While it was working, it wasn't that great to be honest.

<Title>Great idea, good v 1.0 implemetation
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The concept is great - being able to hop onto unsecured WiFi networks and grab music when and where you feel like it.  I never had an issue getting on WiFi networks and the d/l speeds were fine.  I have a number of gripes - many of which can be fixed with a s/w upgrade, so I bet this will only get better.   1) you can't download an entire album using your subscription pass - you have to d/l each track individually.  Kooky 2) There is no auto-shutoff - at least not that I could find 3) you cant charge via USB if the battery is low - in other words, if your battery is low enough to shut the unit down, you must use AC to charge it.  this is super annoying. 4) the unit could be a little slimmer - it's nice and light, but it's a little big.  5) there are some playback issues - if you hit the play button while a track is selected in the music catalog, it goes back to playing the already playing track.  it should just play the track you've selected.    overall, I really like the unit and love the ability to 'send' music to the device using the [...].  i'm definitely an early adopter, tho, who puts up with software glitches - not everyone might be so forgiving.  I look forward to the new software updates.

<Title>A little rough at first, but now I love it!
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the MG-1000 when it first became available because I loved the idea of being able to download music without having to be tethered to a computer (especially appreciated not having to clog up our computer with music files in order to get them onto an MP3 player).  I had some initial glitches -- partially self-inflicted, as I got confused and managed to inadvertently set up a new MG account that overrode my original (valid) account.  At first, the MG folks couldn't figure out what I'd done, so I had to send the device back to them to get the problem cleared up.  They sent me a replacement device (with all of my previously-downloaded music transferred over -- very convenient!).  I noticed when I got the new device that the instruction manual contained more details that could have helped me avoid my problem in the first place.  Unfortunately, the replacement I received had some issues.  I recognized this on another person's review:  The device would freeze on a menu and couldn't even be shut off without pushing the reset button (via a paper clip or a safety pin).  I reported the problem to the MG folks, who had me send this device back and then sent me a 2nd replacement.  I am now thrilled to report that the 2nd replacement device is working perfectly.  I find that it is fun to play back my music via the shuffle function, as I can't predict what song will be next but is sure to be something I will like.  I love being able to order new music via my device at a moment's notice.  I subscribe to the monthly service, as that gives me access to the widest variety of music, and the available selections are updated regularly.    The only "issues" I have now (if you can really call them that) is getting connected to Wi-Fi, since access in my neighborhood is pretty much restricted to going to the public library.  However, I find that I can queue up the songs I want to order whenever I want and then download them all via Wi-Fi on my next library visit.  When I am in range of a free Wi-Fi connection the device works great.  I can also download songs from other MG users via the Community function.  I don't use this much, but being able to view the tracks others have downloaded gives me lots of ideas for music I'd forgotten about and would like to have.  I can also turn off this function if I prefer to have privacy.  I've also noticed that new features have been added to the menus since I first got my MG-1000.    Sure, my experience was rough at first, but MG has become much more user-friendly and only seems to be getting better.

<Title>Great Concept, Awful Application
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Gremlin In August of 2006 and i loved it...keyword, loved. 3 weeks after receiving the player and downloading songs to it (over 1000) i began getting software failure messages. After 2 days of these messages and constant system lock-up I went straight to the company. The representative was extremely helpful, saying once he received my product he could get it back to me within a weeks time and even re-download the songs i had already obtained...very cool seeing as how long it takes to pull out 1000 songs and he doesn't really have to do that. Well, three weeks later i get a brand new gremlin back....songless. It seems he couldn't bring up my songs because of blah blah blah. Anyway, I got it back so i was happy. It has been working well...until today! (3-6-07) After coming back to my computer from my lunch hour, I turn on my gremlin and half the screen is blotted out. I can only see the bottom half. That makes 2 Gremlins that are garbage in a matter of 6 months. Has this company never heard of craftsmanship?!?!I am quite infuriated which led me to write this venom filled review. I highly suggest AGAINST purchasing an MG-1000. To those of you that do, good luck. And those of you with similar problems, please leave another review. I would love to know if i'm the only one going through this.

<Title>Great MP3, great alternative to iPod
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After going through three ipods over the past four years, I knew it was time to make a switch elsewhere. After scanning some reviews for the Zune and iRiver, I kept constantly seeing MusicGremlin pop up in the Zune review. I deicded to check it out...  First Impressions out of the box: -Pretty bulky shape, but feels hollow inside -Kind of a goofy button layout  After charging my battery, I then signed up for the $[...] a month unlimited download subscription. It was very easy to do straight on the Gremlin website, and on the actual device all I had to do was enter my login and password...and I was going already! (Process took about 5 minutes). I have wireless internet network in my house, and after entering my WEP key, I was already connected. I was already downloading music after having the device for about an hour.  Another thing - since the Gremlin connects wirelessly to an online network, it automatically downloads software updates every time they come out. For instance, the outdated Amazon review says that the player doesn't have an EQ sound changing function. However, with the latest update, you can choose from rock, pop, jazz...etc...For the EQ. Another thing I saw in other reviews - people complaining about having to have their device right next to the router to download effieciently. Maybe I just have a good wireless network, but I could download music onto my Gremlin from about 100ft from the router.   So far, I haven't had any problems. The wireless connection feature is excellent, as is the unlimited downloads, and the battery life is fine as long as you charge the battery on a daily-semi daily basis.   Pro's: -wireless connectivity -decent storage capacity -great customer support (downloads software updates instantly) -unlimited downloads for a monthly fee -very easy UI to adjust to  Con's: -rather large device -average, but managable, battery life -for such a large device, the storage could be slightly bigger  Hope this helps!
