<Title>Beautiful hardware - Terrible software
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This potential "ipod killer" can hardly stand up on its own (feet) because of terrible software design. The player itself is beautiful and the designers ought to be proud of that but the software is a huge letdown. In the age of drag and drop mp3 players to have a propreitary software that is nonintuitive and full of bugs is a crime. I did all the updating but the transfer part kept hanging up on two mp3 files while allowing me no chance to exclude them. I finally deleted them and tried again. Everything seemed to transfer fine but the player itself would not play with the announcement "retry synchronization." Further attempts locked up my otherwise stable home-built, superbly cared for machine running windows 2000. Even though I'd be [...], I'm returning this thing.

<Title>Value MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For its price, it would be hard to pass up on an MP3 player with 5 GB of memory with the style, size, and ease of use.  Controls on the player are intuitive and easy to use.  This is a plug and play device that doesn't require much to operate.  The touch pad lights up when it is touched and is responsive.  The headphones leave a lot to be desired and should be upgraded with a 3rd party set.  Conversion of music is relatively easy.  Drag and drop is a limitation since this software does not allow it.  Songs must be checked to be synced.  However, with the nearest competitor priced at $159 with rebates, it is a small price to pay for the inconvenience.    For someone on a budget, I highly recommend this model.  For an audiophile or IPOD afficianado, there are better alternatives.

<Title>A Fantastic MP3 player
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I work at a RadioShack and we just got these in a week or so ago (mid September.) We had been getting a lot of inqueries about the iPods we carried but no one wanted to pay the price for them! Then we saw these in our add and they looked fantastic. They showed up and everyone that works at the store wanted one.  The included earphones have good enough sound and are designed like the iPod earbuds. Saying they are uncomfortable or comfortable is a matter of ear size and shape but most that have demo-ed the unit have liked them. The face looks sleek and high-end but you may want to get screen protectors or the cases for the m:robe that look a lot like the cases for the iPod. The unit itself has a really good sound but if you like really deafening yourself you'd want to get the updates that give you even more volume. Its always a good idea to get any free updates for whatever product you have. If you're going to carry it in your pocket use the HOLD button and it won't allow input from the touchscreen. Super fast transfers with USB1 or 2. A few hang-ups with the transfer software but was fixed with the updates. Great amount of space (5 GBs! around 1200 songs in MP3 format.) Bottom line: If you want an MP3 player and don't NEED 40+ gigs of space this unit is perfect. Fantastic price even at its higher prices online. Great quality, great accessories, always new firmware/software updates that continue to improve the unit, and a customer replaceable battery! The included battery is said to take over 500 charges and is easily replaceable and inexpensive. Take care of your unit and you'll love it forever!

<Title>Another case of great hardware and the crappiest software
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Another case of great hardware and the crappiest software. Come one people, I know about lab testing, but they had to find out that this software is the junkiest, and buggiest thing ever.  With the looks of the hardware, this could've been the IPOD competition, but with the software it's got, forget about it!

<Title>Great player
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unlike other people that have reviewed this item, I have found no problems with it. This unit comes with a cradle which I thought was a fantastic accessory to include in the package. The unit is very compact and lightweight and easy to navigate. The touch screen can make it somewhat difficult to land on a certain artist sometimes, but if you don't hit it the first time, you will the second, it's not rocket science. As for the software, I have had no problems unlike some of the other reviewers. Yes, it would be nice to just be able to drag and drop, but the m:trip software was easy to install and once you play around with it for a bit, is fairly easy to sync with the player and add music to. Any bugs previously mentioned in other reviews I believe are fixed if you download the updates off the site. They also make it easy to edit your mp3 id tags in case it is missing information such as Artist name and Album title, which is a must for organizing your music on the player. I've had previous players(Dell DJ, Archos Gmini, etc)and this one so far takes the cake. And at a mere $99($130 before rebate at radio shack)I don't see how you could pass this up.

<Title>terrible
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my mrobe mr-100 for 3 days now.  I have gotten 3 different errors on it, the latest being a fatal system error, which apparently requires my sending it to olympus to fix.  I am not a computer retard.. i know a lot about them.  This is quality hardware (the same cpu as the apple ipod the pp5020) but absolutly crap for software.  By software i mean the music managment software (mtrip) and the firmware and software within the mrobe.  It really pisses me off that a player that costs over $100 can have such poor quality control.  Save your money for another month and get an ipod mini.

<Title>Very Nice Alternative To Ipod
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In this day and age where it seems everyone has an ipod it feels good to have something noone else has, which is the m:robe 100.  Coolness factor is definately there and I've gotten lots of attention from ironically ipod owners themselves.  The player itself works fine, just as well as any other player.  The sound can be a bit on the softer side but it's loud enough for when I want it to be loud.  The only weakness is again like people have mentioned, the software.  It's not very user-friendly.  However, it's something that hopefully you won't be doing often, like me, so you'll only have to deal with it once.  Other than that, it's great.  Remember to get better earbuds because the one's included are like the apple earbuds, which aren't very good.

<Title>Super, Cool, Sleek, DESIGN- Purse Size 
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Creative Labs 256 MB MP3 which was enough for my needs because I don't get a chance to listen to music for long periods of time. I brought my husband a Creative NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player for Xmas and he loves it. We use it when we do long distance driving. I really liked his player and it was in my opinion much better and much cheaper than the IPOD. I was looking for something with the same features only much smaller. I looked at the IPOD mini and it was too costly for only 1GB.  Then I SAW IT! Radio Shack had this really cool looking MP3 player for just $99.00 after rebate and besides the awesome look, it was 5GB. It was the exact size I was looking for to fit in my small purse. I like the fact that it displays what song is playing, who the artist is and you can even search while the music is playing.  The only complaint I have is that you have to use the same computer to download the music or it will wipe out whatever is loaded when you do a sync with the crappy software. The volume is fine for me as I am not trying to lose my hearing anytime soon. Thanks to the previous reviews, I did learn about the updates for volume control which I will be checking and downloading. The ear buds are not worth complaining about because I always use my own earbuds. Let's face it, you usually get crappy headphones with most systems anyway. My advice, tape the plastic that comes with it on the face until you get a case for it so that it doesn't get scratched up. Everyone who got the IPod, did so because of the fad. This is better than the IPod mini and I would highly recommend you get this.

<Title>Value for the price
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like another reviewer of this item, I work at a Radio Shack.  We too recently got in the M:Robe.  I now own one, and I found that the following comments are true:  The volume is much too low when you get the thing out of the box. That was very discouraging for me.  However, like several of its other glitches this is easily solved by going to Olympus's website and downloading updates.  The volume is fine now that I've upgraded, I like my music loud and it certainly provides.  When it comes to upgrades you'd better have easy access to your USB port, because removing the cord from the base while it's plugged into the AC requires either long fingernails or surgeon tools.   The software is a pain.  You have to sync up the player to your playlist every time you want to add new music, and that can take a long time.  However, once done, the player is easy to use. Perhaps for the next version Olympus will realize that Mp3 transfer through explorer is a much easier option.  However, I did notice that one glitchy track I had (it had skips on it even as an Mp3) was fixed when I played it on the M:robe.  So maybe the software does have a benefit!  When you set the player on random it can take a couple of seconds for it to decide which track to play next, that is unless it does what it loves to do occasionally, which is playing the next alphabetical track or two before picking at random again.   The headphones are highly average, even for earbuds.  Mine came out of the box with uneven cord lenghts.  They work, but $10 can buy you a much better pair of Sonys.    I gave the player 4/5 stars because I would have liked to have a radio with it.  Also, switching tracks is a bit cumbersome, but once you figure out how it makes sense.  The keypad is very sensative, but responsive as well.  That all being said, once the thing's software is updated the player works fine and there aren't any major complaints, and you are getting a good deal - 5 gigs usually runs $100 more. And lets not forget how cool red looks on black!

<Title>If you are even considering this player -- just buy it
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Radio Shack had the M:Robe in stock for $130 less a $30 mail-in rebate.  I have had this MP3 player for only one day, but price/performance deserves a 5-star rating.  That, and I also believe it is the best looking and most durably constructed MP3 player on the market.  I don't think you need to hide it in a case, because it is constructed of metal and glass.  It is not going to get scratched up.  I read a lot of reviews of the M:Robe before buying it.  Some earlier ones complained about it not playing loud enough, or freezing up.  These problems have been fixed, so as soon as I got it out of the box, I applied the latest software updates Olympus has come up with.  Just do it!    Here is the quickest way to set the M:Robe up:    Attach AC power cord to transformer, and transformer to docking station.  Place M:Robe in docking station.  Attach USB cable to docking station and position near your main PC.  The M:Robe will start to charge the battery.  This will take about 3 hours, so you have plenty of time update software and upload CDs.  Load the enclosed CD and install the m-trip software.  It will give you an option to scan your hard drive for music.  Do it.  I only had 4 sample music files in the Windows Media format, and I deleted them from the PC hard drive as allowed from the m-trip software.  You should also register the product as you install the software.  Olympus ships the product with version 1.0 of the PC software and the M:Robe also has the lowest level of firmware installed.  You want the latest updates, so....  Open Internet Explorer and go to the web site: [...]  Uploaded m-trip Music Manager Update v1.06, and m:robe 100 Firmware Update v2.17, and follow the clear instructions they provide to complete these tasks.  The web site provides six different uploads.  You only need the top two, so don't bother with the others.  So now you have the latest software.  Start feeding music CDs into the m-trip software.  It only takes a couple of minutes to upload each CD.  By the time the battery is fully charged, you will have a pretty good collection of music.  Now sync the M:Robe with your PC and you can start playing with this little portable music wonder.   The touch-sensitive controls work easily and smoothly.  It takes some getting used to, but it is all intuitive after a short while.  Play with the equalization settings.  I found they all made the music sound worse, and that no equalization worked best, but you be the judge.  The ear buds supplied with the M:Robe are pretty awful, but hey if you can get this player for net $100 from Radio Shack, that leaves you some extra cash for good ear phones.  Best points of this player:  It looks great with its flat black glass front and bright red control lights.  Olympus did a great job in designing this unit.  Worst points:  The m-trip music management software is not the equal of i-tunes.  For me, who listens to entire albums at a time, this is not an issue.  If you think you can compose a better play list than the original artist, get the i-pod.

<Title>Almost There
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first thing I noticed when searching for MP3 players online was how sexy this little machine looked. The red on black screen is absolutely gorgeous and, in my opinion, looks better than all the other MP3 players on the market, hands down. Most other reviews on this site will agree.  The next thing I noticed was how affordable this MP3 player is. At the time I had also been considering purchasing an Ipod Mini (though those soon became obsolete) which had the same amount of space but cost nearly $100 more. I brooded over my purchase for quite some time before I stumbled across an M:robe in the local Radioshack and decided to take the plunge.  My M:robe was every bit as sexy as it was in pictures, if not moreso. Additionally, it felt like a sturdy piece of machinery, rather than the cheap plastic-y feel of some electronics these days.  However, I quickly came to realize that the bundled software for this MP3 player, Olympus M:trip, is more than a hassle and for that reason alone I would not recommend this brand to anyone else. Now, if they were to revamp their software, I would be a very strong advocate of this product.  The software was bulky and I didn't immediately understand it. Several things really bothered me: there were icons with no explanation, the search feature is bloated and you cannot "tab" through the program meaning you must use your mouse. Also, while the software tries to look sleek, it falls slightly short and looks cheap instead.  Originally I added my entire playlist, only to wind up with errors because it was too large and between the player and the software, it didn't know where to cut off. Unfortunately, trying to solve those errors only because worse and I wound up with an empty library in the software but all my songs were still on the hard drive and had to be manually deleted through "My Computer." Furthermore, this was a solution I stumbled upon myself as even technical support was of absolutely no help (but when is it ever?)  On the plus side, the software does allow you to add lyrics to your songs and set up many playlists as well as adding your songs to their predefined playlists (such as "Favourites") but you are not able to edit playlists from the player itself.  There are also your typical browsing features on the player itself: by artist, album, genre, year, etc; and you can browse through your music in several ways: recently listed, top 20 9the player generates this by analyzing the songs you listen to most) favourites (the playlist set up through the software), your personalized playlists, unplayed tracks etc.  Of course you can also choose to listen to your music randomly, though I find it to be less random than one would think based on the name, on repeat or in several different music style modes. All in all the player options are everything I want and nothing I don't.  Aside from the software, which one can get around though I haven't tried it myself, there are a few issues I have with the player itself. For starters, the touch screen looks nice but quickly smudges and scratches so that the player loses some of it's attaction quite quickly. Furthermore, I find that sensitivity of the touch screen varies largely. Some days I need to really push to make the buttons response while others I can accidentally brush over a button and it responds. Lastly, and this might just be a personal issue, but I tend to use my MP3 player outside and in the winter it becomes quite cold here and I cannot operate the touch screen using gloves.  One thing about the player that is impressive is the sound quality and I find the sound goes up loud enough for me, though others might argue. I do wish the lower sound setting were quieter though as it's still too loud to listen to the player and hold a conversation at the same time.   I also find that the switchover time between songs can sometimes take a little longer than I'd like but it's nothing I can't live with. Lastly, I am quite annoyed when I switch to playlist view and sometimes it shows my playlist from the beginning and other times it shows the playlist right around the song which is currently playing. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what controls this and can never get the playlist position I want.  Last, I've encountered an interesting glitch with my player, once shortly after I bought it and once over a year later. The music will stop, the touch screen will stop responding though the screen will still be on, the player becomes unchargeable (and when I tried to do that as a way to "get it back" the player itself heated up alarmingly) and it only half-responds to the power button. Both times, eventually the screen turned off and I let the MP3 player sit (the first time for several days, the second for several hours) and it eventually worked again with my files and playlists in tact but the battery was drained.  This is quite disturbing and I cannot say why it would do that, I guess as long as it works again, I'm happy.  Speaking of the battery, I find that it takes quite a while for the first 2 bars to be drained but once you're down to 1 bar, the player will die quickly. You can charge via the dock, plug it into a wall, or via USB connected to a computer. I find the best charging results from each of these activities respectively. Charging by USB can register a fully charged battery but will quickly drain of power.  Overall this is a sleek player which generally handles well and has everything I want and nothing I don't, including a unique name, but it is held back by it's poor software and some glitches (which ranges in severity).  I would definitely buy another Olympus MP3 player (had they gone the route of MP3 player only, rather than the combined camera/MP3 player of the M:robe 500) but I would be more cautious about it.

<Title>cute, but REALLY fragile
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the cutest mp3 I found when I was looking around, and also the cheapest, and when I first got it, I was really really happy. However, when I started getting new songs to add, the software screwed me over and deleted all my songs. I had to start from scratch again. Sometimes, it freezes on me, and also, the controls that light up break a lot. Also, the mp3 gets scratched very very easily, and even in a case, it looks like i beat it every night. Maybe I am just not careful enough, but one day, it was near the bottom of my backpack. when i took it out, the screen was cracked in three places, and though i can still use it, I can not read the song name, artist, time, battery life or anything. I am really busy; i don't have time to battle with my mp3 everyday. Over all, the sound quality and design is really good, as well as the over all song capacity and price, but the way it gets scratched so easily and has so many irritating small problems ruined it for me. Only buy this if you are ready to take care of it extremely well, learn the software and read the manual from front to back.

<Title>great, but software lacking.
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is one of the most awesomely put together player, but the software leaves you craving more.  PROS -very easy to hold in your hand -great sound quality -touch sensitive -straight forward menus -sturdy player   CONS -Software is atrocious -Touch sensitive -Lacking special features  CONCLUSION I would highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a MUSIC device. It has no special features, which I'm fine with, but they are always fun to mess with. You may have noticed that i put touch sensitive on both lists. This is because it is great to use when you want to, but it is so sensitive, that unless you keep the hold on at all times, it WILL change songs or pause. You have to even be careful reaching across the player to turn on the hold button or else it will go back a song. Again, I would buy this item again if i had the chance.  ALLEN
