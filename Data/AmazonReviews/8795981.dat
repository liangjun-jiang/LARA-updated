<Title>Best Mp3 Player.
<Date>Mon Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>There is nothing in the market to beat the Ipod. I tried a Nomad Jukebox, before I bought my ipod (15gb - Windows firewire). Nothing better than it. I have most the songs loaded from my Comp and it works like a charm. This is the best mp3 player I ever had. could have /should have bought the 30Gig one...but i am really happy with the space on the this one.

<Title>My favorite thing....
<Date>Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really, really love my iPod. I've had mine for about 7 months now and use it every single day. So far, my colletion is only about three and half gigs of MP3 files so everything fits onto the hard drive very comfortably. The battery life is more than acceptable, even though I use the backlight almost constantly. There are a few words of advice that people should consider before they buy one. First, you simply must have USB 2.0 or Firewire to use this. In theory, you could use this with USB1.1 but the transfers are painfully slow. You could just as quickly burn your music on a CD to take somewhere. Second, MusicMatch works for synchronizing with PCs but there are much, much better programs such as XPlay. Third, this thing will scratch!! You should really pay a little more for the carrying case by Apple. I really wish I had because this masterpiece of consumer design is now very dinged, scratched, and beaten...but it still plays beautifully, which is what counts most. Like I said, I use it every day and learn new reasons for loving it every time I turn it on. It is impossible to be dissappointed by iPod.

<Title>You've bought a MP3 PDA with a disk drive and a buggy OS
<Date>Wed Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Check out the IPod's support website and you'll see what I mean.  The other issue is:  Do I really want to WORK this hard to play a few tunes when I go jogging?  I don't want to download any firmware or resynchronize, I just want to turn the device on and play music.  I don't want to obsess about whether I really have enough charge to last a few hours, or not, maybe.  I just want to turn on the device and play music.  If you stay with this product, you might begin to wonder if you're doing product research or OS beta testing for Apple, particularly if you're one of those people who discovers issues with sleep mode, non-recognition of your IPod device by the computer or the software, or can't seem to charge the battery enough even though the PDA says it's sort of charged, maybe.  In my opinion, these are BASIC issues that a company should deal with in a product BEFORE sending it to market.  Imagine having to constantly worry about your computer laptop not working because it may not be able to figure out if it has been fully charged or not?  What happened to the idea of: &quot;I put in a battery and the device runs for X hours, and then I recharge the battery&quot;?  Imagine paying three hundred plus dollars for a piece of unfinished technology and feeling a debt of gratitude.  Doesn't make sense.  For this price, the device should work.  If I have to work this hard to make it work, it had better cost under a hundred dollars since I'm doing their job helping them get the bugs ironed out.  Take a look at all the comments with the positive ratings which make such obsequious concessions to a flawed product.  The reality is this is not a finished product.  It looks nice, but in practice, it's not a finished product, at least for this Windows user.  I get better results with MP3s stored in SD memory on my Windows Pocket PC.  Try again, Apple.

<Title>More than expected !!
<Date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought a 15Gb iPod last summer for $385. Well... I wont spend too much time talking bout things that everyone might have known (large capacity, small size..) but I have some highlights that really made me prefer iPod than others:<p>(i)Personally, i think synchronization is the most important of all for mp3 players. Why getting a 60Gb mp3 player if u would have to wait for an hour everytime u sync with USB? Synchronization is never be better in other mp3 players. First of all, ipod can be connected thru FireWire (which is really really faster than USB!!). I'd switched to use iTunes for Windows and it really enhances synchronization. I was using MusicMatch before but synchronization is much slower compared by using iTunes (Using Music Match, i have to wait for average of 20 mins to let Music match get organized before sync, but using iTunes, i only have to wait for about 1 minute before it starts synchronizing) <p>(ii) Lazy to organize your songs ?? Most people do not have time in organizing their songs (especially if u have more than Gigabytes of songs from thousands of artists and albums!)and in this, iTunes really helps. Just click on 'Preference' in iTunes, 'Advanced' and click 'Keep iTunes Music folder organized'. iTunes will then organize all your songs according to their albums and artists, and everytime u made changes in iTunes, they will change it in your file name as well. You only have to name them once, and that's simple (Recalling when i was using Music match, i would have to rename all songs in Musicmatch, and the file names as well!)<p>(iii) Smart playlist (again, only for iPod and iTunes user!). I realized that most mp3 players do not provide convenient playlist. In iTunes, you can create so called 'smart playlist', which enables u to create unlimited amount playlists according to your preferences. For instance, u can create a playlist that would only include songs that are rated '5 stars' (Those u like the most). Not only that, everytime u made changes, iTunes will automatically update your playlist as well. (for e.g., when u changed a song from 5 stars to 4 stars, that song would be removed from the 5 stars' list and added to 4 stars' list). There are much more options to choose, for e.g year of publication (so u can listen to songs of the year), songs that u never played before, genre, bit rate..etc<p>(iv) Thanks for the FireWire, I can play songs in my iPod from any Macs in school, friend's house..etc. Once connected, the iPod acts as a hard disk, which enables me to choose and play songs from iTunes on the computer. For sure, it's much easier to choose a song to play in a music player rather than on a mp3 player. Besides that, it charges my ipod when i connect it to computer, thus I dont have to worry bout battery life when listening to iPod in school.<p>(v) Transfering files into iPod is very convenient. Once connected, I can open my files in iPod, transfering it to other computers or vice versa, with blazing speed (Usually just take seconds to transfer). Imagine having 10/20/40Gb of files in your iPod and bringing it wherever u want.<p>(vi)Touch sensitive buttons (which others dont have!). All buttons are touch sensitive and it's so convenient to click or scoll.. , and besides that, the non-moving parts enhances the anti-shock period and prevent from dust, liquid etc from entering ur buttons.<p>(vii)Why wake up with beeping alarms if u can wake up with your favourite music from iPod?? Imagine waking up with your favourite music everyday... i doubt u would 'snooze' this alarm.<p>(viii)This may not applicable to most of u, but it really surprises me when i realize that iPod could read and display chinese characters when they play chinese songs. I wonder if others could do that.<p>Cons: I should have bought the 40Gb iPod.. as I didn't expect file transfering to hard disk is that simple. (If u do the math, it's more or less costly to buy an external hard disk in such a small size!)<p>Enjoy your iPod.. u'll definitely LOVE it!

<Title>Revolutionary
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Wow. My 15GB iPod has got to be the greatest invention since the LP. Mine currently holds a couple hundred hours of music with plenty of room to spare for more. This means that I take my entire CD collection to work with me every day -- and it weighs just ounces. I find I can typically get about four hours of use out of the battery, but I've also recently taken to plugging my iPod into its base station (on AC) and plugging that into my stereo via a Monster cable. I may donate my CD changer to Goodwill before the year is out.

<Title>Apple's well-designed marvel
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have had a 15GB iPod for about 3 months now, and it has served me very well. I started out with a SlimX mp3/CD player, but switched because of the fact that as much as I had been changing mp3 CDs on it to listen to different music I may as well have brought my entire CD collection and had better sound quality to boot. The iPod has solved all those problems. I have a PC with Windows XP, and while some complain of problems with Windows, I have yet to experience them. MusicMatch was a little cumbersome, but since I downloaded iTunes the iPod works absolutely seamlessly with my computer. Mac's AAC compression format really does blow MP3 away--important to audiophiles like me, who want portability and sound quality at the same time. iTunes is designed to help you get the most out of your iPod, and it even syncs playlists you make on the iPod with your computer (something MusicMatch didnt' do). The FireWire interface is lightning-quick so I can watch an album load in the space of 15 seconds. The size is nice--I have 80+ albums on my iPod and it's only about 1/3 full. I do use the iPod to manage my calendar and contacts, something few reviewers have mentioned and which comes in very handy. (Syncing this calendar and contact information is a pain on the PC, but it pays off when you need to quickly find a phone number on the road.) I use the dock and a cable to plug the device into my stereo, which saves me the trouble (and expense) of burning CDs I have created or downloaded. <p>There are, however, some things about this device that I simply don't understand. For example, the chrome that makes up the back of the iPod and the front of the remote is plain silly--just something to get dirtied up and uglied with fingerprints (the chrome on mine looks absolutely hideous at the moment). Much as I like the touch-scroll wheel, I wish the other buttons were conventional: I don't like having to use the Hold switch just to fumble around in the dark to find the Menu button (which controls the backlight). The hard case, while it does a great job of protecting the iPod, prevents you from seeing the screen or using the buttons, requiring you to use the remote which just adds more cord to get tangled up. Before iTunes I had the problem of gaps in between songs on live albums and on my beloved Mahler symphonies: iTunes solves this with the &quot;Join CD Tracks&quot; function, but I wish I could keep the individual tracks and not have to deal with the little hiccup between them.<p>If you are looking for a way to carry around a variety of music in one small device, and you don't mind shelling out the big bucks for it, then this is for you. The ability to carry around your entire record collection in a thing as big as a deck of cards seems silly, but once you have it, you are spoiled. Apple has created a well-designed, functional product that is sure to please any music-lover.

I was getting so sick of carrying all my cds around!!<br>I know Ipods are the expensive MP3 palyers but if you buy it at auction it is worth it given the quality and how easy it is to use. The firewire makes it so fast to update change or add music to your Ipod. You can make as many lists as you want to listen to your music.<br>The earphones are great, I also have a Radio Shack titanium Headphones but Irather use the ipod earphones since they are so small and give such great sound. I sometimes connect my Ipod to my home stereo and what a sound and I never have to change cds I just make a list and play it for as long as I want and hear as many different songs that I want!<br>I also use my Ipod as a portable hard drive, a calendar, and an address book.<br>Awesome little gadget!

<Title>Flabbergasted !
<Date>Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As the title of this post attests, I'm truly marvelled at this product. Apple is and is going to beat all the competitors in the MP3 player arena. WOW, this product is sleek from the moment you see the box. And once you open the box and see how much care Apple takes care of presentation, you'll realize that you made a good investment. The player is SO much compact  and lighter than I expected. I used to own a Creative Nomad Zen (20 Gb) and sold it because it was rather bulky and the controls were really clumsy. in contrast, the iPod is very intuitive and yet powerful. The design is outstanding, and the features is more than worth the money. The sound is superb, and the EQ is very decent just as the included headphones are. <br>If you look at the Price-Value relationship, iPod offers the most "bang for the buck," if you pardon the cliche. With organizer, clock, calendar, games and 15Gb of soage this unit is by FAR the best value. You won't regret it for one second! It will make a believer out of the most skeptical person. If you have the money...do not hesitate and get this unit.

<Content>I previously kept all of my music on Minidisc because I wanted something small that could change music quickly.  Now the iPod is small enough and holds ALL of my music, plus it's very easy to use.  I'm using mine on a mac with the new iTunes music store which really makes purchasing music quick and easy.  Finally, the mac version supports the new mp4(AAC) format for small, high-quality music.

<Title>Positively awesome!
<Date>Fri May 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>When I buy electronics, I usually look for items that serve multiple purposes (ie I waited for a DVD player until Playstation 2 came out so I'd be gettng two machines in one).  My husband and I have been looking to upsize from our current iMac since we can't upgrade the video card, and 8 mb just isn't enough for some of the programs we're running.  Since we'd been wanting an MP3 player, and we also wanted to be able to transfer the iMac's information onto an external hard drive, we figured this would serve both purposes well.<br>Although I'm not much of an audiophile, I really love the clarity of the sound that the iPod offers- so if even I can tell the difference, it must be pretty drastic.  Transferring music to the iPod is really very simple: Launch iTunes, put in the CD's you want, select the songs you want iTunes to import, and when you're done with that, plug the iPod into the FireWire port, and it automatically sends the songs to the iPod.<br>A word of warning to those with lower-end Power Macs: importing songs from a CD to iTunes can take a long time.  I'm currently running on an iMac with a 450 mhz processor, and each song takes from 1-2 minutes to import.  But despite this, sending the songs from iTunes to the iPod is extremely fast- I sent 59 songs from iTunes to the iPod, and it only took maybe 30 seconds.  <br>From reading the instructions included with the iPod, transferring songs from the PC to the iPod is relatively simple too, although it takes a couple more steps to do so on a PC than it does on a Mac.<br>The new design of the iPod is excellent as well.  The buttons are extremely touch-sensitive, but I have found that they are only sensitive with fingers, not objects such as pens.  I was able to adjust the volume and switch from song to song with my fingertips effortlessly, but when I tried to use the top of a pen, it wouldn't go.  I think this is a very helpful feature, especially if you're going to be carrying this in your pocket, purse, etc. <br>Just as a word to the wise, if you are considering purchasing an FM transmitter to listen to the iPod in your car or personal stereo, a better option is to use a cassette adapter, like the ones that come with CD car adapters.  The FM transmitters have a lot of static, whereas the casette adapter replicates pretty closely the crystal-clear sound in the iPod itself. <br>Some people may wonder why to purchase the iPod instead of a lower-end MP3 player and there are two major reasons: ease of use, and the large amount of drive space avaiable.  If you have an emergency situation where you need to transfer a large amount of information from one computer to another, the iPod is ideal: just connect the iPod to the computer and send the files to the iPod.  Of course, you can't open these files on the iPod itself, but it's a great extra hard drive in a pinch.

<Title>iPOD on PC is initially unusable
<Date>Fri May 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple really needs to be hit with a silly stick for shipping the brand new iPOD with what possibly has to be one of the worst mp3 management applications musicmatch.  Firstly, it doesn't work correctly under windows 2000.  Secondly their dock and undock application is extremely fragile under W2K.<p>This is how it works.  To a PC, the ipod looks like a 15GB SBP2 hard drive.  That's right a harddrive.  While it is connected to the PC it disables all menu functions and remains in hard drive mode.  This part is fine.<p>Apple ships a dock/undock util which doesn't quite do the right thing.  If you use the built in MS hotplug device tray util things work much better.  The apple util only removes the drive letter, not the 1394 device.  The microsoft one removes the whole subsystem, a much cleaner way to go and less error prone under WIN2Ks less than stellar 1394 stack.<p>Music match.  Lord what an unstable application.  Like many windows apps it's all glitz and no stability.  I spent 3 hours trying to get it to work with the iPod.  I reformatted the iPod at least 4 times.  No files would transfer to the iPod.  Only play lists.  This was a horrible out of the box experience.  I bought this as a gift.  I'm not a neophtye, I know how this stuff should work.  Especially having seen the OSX work just beautifully in comparison.<p>Solution ?  Download ephpod, as recommended by other users on Amazon.  This app rocks.  It's simple, reliable, stable and it works just beautifully under W2K.  MM may have bells and whistles, but as a device manager it fails miserably.  Apple should buy ephpod and ship that as the standard device manager, because right now the iPod is pretty much unusable under windows.  It might be better under XP but I'm not using XP so that's not all that helpful.<p>The iPod itself is beautifully presented in almost japanese style understated packaging.  The device itself is a modern miracle and has much to recommend it.  10 out of 10 for the ipod itself.  1 out of 10 for music match.  Apple I do hope you are listening.

<Content>Locked up and overheated. The Apple store had great difficulty trying to reset my Ipod - after many tries - it finally reset. They charged me a 10% restocking fee to return it- since they were able to reset the ipod. I could tell it was defective. I have always stayed away from Apple as a PC owner. They have always abused their customers dating back to the earliest Macs with the motherboard scandals. If one owns a Apple computer - they 'got you' like in th old days of the PC. It is like owning an exotic car - it just has to look good - whether or not it works is not really important. It is the style that matters!

<Title>Great Design but problems with audio quality and battery
<Date>Tue May 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought a 15GB ipod and after three days I decided to return it. The design is absolutely great and it was one of the aspects that stopped me from returning it at the beginning. Furthermore, being able to store all my CDs was also great However, I am a minidisc user, and the main problems I found with the ipod were the audio quality and the battery life. I get around 14 hours of battery life from the minidisc, but only 6 and a half with the ipod. Furthermore, although the sound quality of the ipod is pretty good (much better than other mp3 players I had in the past), as soon as you use the equalizer with bass intense songs the audio is distorted (I tried different headphones). I read another review complaining about the same and I have to admit that is true. If you disable the equalizer, the distorsion disappears, but of course, you loose sound quality. I played the same song with the minidisc and the ipod at the same time and kept changing the headphones from one to the other, and the sound from the ipod was not as rich.<br>I will wait for the next ipod version and hopefully they will correct these two problems.

<Content>If you're a Mac user, this is a great product. It works wonderfully.<p>However, if you're a PC user, there are better products to use. I'll give it to Apple; the design of this product and the very intuitive UI are very strong points. In fact, those were what won me over in the first place. I brought it home, and tried to get it to work for several hours (8-10) without progress. I kept getting errors, and eventually called Apple's tech support, which were VERY professional and helpful. Turns out, though, that the iPod didn't work with my firewire card. So I bought the one they recommended, and still ran into problems. So I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for the Creative Zen, 20 GB USB 2.0 version, and it's way better. The sound has less noise, the battery life is almost DOUBLE the iPod's, and has almost all the features of the iPod (it's also got more space).<p>So, in short, for PC users, the Creative Zens are so much better, if a little more lacking in style.

<Content>I didn't buy the my ipod from amazon the way I normally buy my stuff. But I don't think Apple is properly prepared to deal with Windows users. At least, not from where I am sitting. First expect to pay whatever for the amount for the ipod. [$$$] for me (15gb) expect to pay another [$$$] for the firewire card then spend all night trying to get the thing to work with Win98. As  of this writing the usb wire has not been released. The Software included with the ipod nicely tells you it doesn't function with your OS. I tried ephpod and macopener and they don't work with the latest ipod for windows because ephpod will error out. And if you use macopener and recreate the directory structure with ephpod, the ipod won't boot. Musicmatch the mp3 jukebox that comes with the ipod will work with Win98 but the plugin for the ipod won't. In short if you want a portable mp3 solution and are a windows98 user run, don't walk AWAY from the ipod.
