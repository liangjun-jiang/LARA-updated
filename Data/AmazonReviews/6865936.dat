<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

<Title>Simply Brilliant
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

<Title>Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

<Title>not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

<Title>THE biggest revolution
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

<Title>What the shuffle should have been!
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is exactly what Apple should have been working on instead of the Shuffle.  I've purchased several Shuffles for myself and my family, and absolutely love them.  But, I have the same compliants as everyone else, no screen, small capacity, different accessories from other iPods, etc.  The nano addresses all of these concerns without sacrificing the sound quality that first drew to the Shuffle.  The nano's small size, vibrant color screen, standard iPod connector, long battery life, and large song capacity make it the most attractive option in the iPod line.  The lack of moving parts inside improve the sound quality, battery life, and durability of the device (it uses solid-state memory like the Shuffle, instead of a micro-disk like the larger iPods).  Additionally, the color screen, photo llbrary, and built-in Podcast support are welcome features.  The nano does suffer from the one drawback inherited from it's larger cousins - the device is beautiful, but the case tarnishes and scratches easily.  I'm looking forward to purchasing the iPod nano "tubes" to cover and protect my nano once Apple releases them.  Overall, the best technology value I've encountered in a long time.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute.  Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil.  In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle.   Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces.  Weight is another jaw-dropping figure.  The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.    Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable?  Don't be!  The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable.  Why?  The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player.  The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.    Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.  The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.  Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic.  It features a nice resolution, and color.  You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music.  There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.    Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.    Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular.  Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>I didn't think it was THAT small
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is the gutsy move by Apple to replace their bestselling iPod mini.  What will previous generation iPod and iPod mini owners think of the nano?  Pros:  * Flash memory, not hardrive based which means no moving parts and no skipping or momentary delays when selecting a new track  * Incredibly thin.  The commercials don't do it justice, you have to feel it to believe it  * Sexy new black option without including Bono worship  * Lots of new features, a world clock with all sorts of timezone, a screen lock to keep out iPod leeches, and a stopwatch.  * Lovely color screen  * Built tough, will survive all sorts of drops.  The exception is the scratching on the Lucite.  You most likely won't bend it sitting on it.  Cons:  * Shows scratches much more readily than the iPod mini's brushed steel look.   * Fairly expensive for the capacity.  2 gigs for $200 and 4 gigs for $250, a bit disappointing for those who were expecting a 6 gig flash release from Apple  * Screen is too small to show detail in pictures  * No firewire port  * No TV outlet for showing off pictures yet  * So thin you might leave it in your jeans... through the washer and dryer cycle.  I highly recommend buying the iPod nano, especially for iPod mini owners.  Its great for gym and travelling and other bumpy rides.  I also recommend getting a case for it so you don't get it all scratched up.

<Title>Sets a new bar for music players
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have always been a loyal creative customer till now. Apple has redefined the mp3 player space, with this release. A 4gb flash player for 250 dollars is a really good deal, considering other vendors currently sell a 1 GB flash player for 120 bucks. Samsung has provided a sweet deal to Apple, allowing them to price the player at such aggressive terms. The biggest surprise of this player is the nice lcd screen that comes with it. It is very sharp and very clear. Apple should update the ipod nano, to allow it to host video clips on it. Nano has an included solitaire game , that is very sharp and clear on the LCD screen. Nano will shake up this space, and will quickly become the defacto king of music player space. Though in the long run, there is no reason, why cell phones will not have 4 GB flash chips to hold the songs, video clips etc. I bought the black nano, which interestingly was shipped directly from shenzen, china. I recommend the white nano instead, as the black color shows the fingerprint imprints very easily. Highly recommended. Apple should have included a case with it, as it is so small, that U can lose it very easily.

<Title>VERY cool...but not for everyone
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 80% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.  ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $50, you can upgrade to a Photo that has 5x times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is--it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.  Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their petite size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300.  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>Apple iPod Nano Review
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this iPod nano 4GB Black on September 8th and I recieved it September 12th. I was expecting Apple not to discontinue the widely famous iPod mini but I guess they did. Rumors and speculations said that Apple was going to make a 8GB mini with a color screen but in the end they discontinued the line all together. The nano isn't perfect though. The gigabyte to price ratio is horrible and the battery life isn't that good. The 2GB nano is $99.50 per gigabyte while the 4GB nano is 62.25 per gigabyte. Much more than the iPod mini's. The battery life is rated at 14 hours. I got up to 16 to 17 hours which is good but my friends said their new iPod mini can get up to 23 hours! The design is sexy but, the smudges and scratches attract a second after you peel off the protective paper. The mini had a case that didn't deter any real scratches and smudges. You have to buy a case for this iPod while you didn't have to for the mini.  But, it's a fresh start with the iPod line and it's right now my personal favorite. 4GB holds around 1,000 songs, I have 939 songs (on various qualities, etc.). It comes with the iPod CD with iTunes 5 (the new one). iTunes 5 is nice cosmetically (Apple changed it a little bit) but, there is no major change. There are color choices with the nano: Black or White but black is a little bit better looking (but shows smudges and scratches more). The prices are $199.99 for 2GB (500 songs) and $249.99 for 4GB (1,000 songs). The screen lock is pretty cool I have to admit, I just set up my code and if someone tries to use my iPod, the iPod screen will be locked out. Another thing which is nice is the thickness. It's the smallest iPod in depth (.27") but it isn't the all around smallest iPod. The pictures are small but, this isn't a picture viewer to be honest with you. You should buy the accessory to put the pictures on our television instead. Another problem I have with this iPod is the accessories that come in the box. It just comes with the iPod nano, headphones, USB 2.0 cord, iPod CD, Manual, and a dock adapter. iPod has really been cutting back ever since they released the 4th Generation iPod but, atleast that came with FireWire while none of the iPod's now do. All together, this iPod is beautiful but if your a power user (like me) you will not like this so much. The iPod mini has some advantages over this one but, this iPod has advantages over the mini too. So, if you're getting a new iPod and you just have about 400-900 songs, this iPod will be perfect for you.

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is the best value. It is only $50 more than the 2-gigabyte model, so you get twice as much storage, for only $50 more. Don't forget you can also backup important files to your iPod, so you may find some extra space valuable. The 4-gigaybtes is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and the white-colored iPod Nano will match many other Apple products. However, the black iPod nano is an intense and sleek finish, beautiful in person. It might show scratches and fingerprints more easily, but it looks so great that it may be the most popular color choice of this new player.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>Nano vs Mini - not bad tradeoff
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BACKGROUND: i currently own: 4gig Nano, 30gig Photo, 512mb Shuffle... Use PC & Mac... Note, I am NOT recommending the 2gig Nano @ $199.  =======  BOTTOM LINE =======  BUY THIS NOW IF: (1) need a `exercise' music player, (2) this is your second iPod, (3) don't need over 2-4gigs of music (500-1000 songs) (4) if you're NOT willing to wait till the holidays (Nov-05), cuz most likely you'll get a price drop... and a 4gig Nano at $199 is a NO BRAINER PURCHASE...way beyond 5 star rating, MORE LIKE 7 STARS!  WAIT TILL HOLIDAYS IF: (1) want to get the absolute best deal, (2) this is your first iPod, (3) you are buying this as a Christmas gift.  ***Keep in Mind***: 4gig Nano will most likely drop in price to $199 during holidays, while a newly introduced 6gig Nano should be $249 ***NEXT PRICE DROP DURING HOLIDAYS 2005*** nano 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $14/hour battery time &lt;highly recommended> nano 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $18/hour battery time &lt;recommended>  ===== VALUE ======= PROS: (1) size - amazing! (2) weight/portability - amazing! (3) color screen, (4) faster interface - due to flash memory, (4) unbelievably cool looking. CONS: (1) @ $249 for 4gigs, more expensive than Mini for storage and battery (per-gig and per hour battery), (2) No significant new innovation other than size/appearance, (3) no FireWire - slow updates, (4) no iTalk, iTrip, or any top-connecting accessories that use remote control port.   NOTE - CURRENT PRCING:  nano 2gig @ $199 =  $100/gig OR $14/hour battery time nano 4gig @ $249 = $62/gig OR $18/hour battery time mini 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $11/hour battery time mini 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $14/hour battery time  ===== DETAILS ======= 1) SIZE/WEIGHT: Simply amazing... you can see for yourself...I really cannot convey to you how much `coolness' is packed into this tiny lightweight package... Super thin... about half the thickness as the Motorola RAZR.   2) COSMETIC CHANGES & SCREEN: Color screen is smaller than other color models, fonts smaller, click wheel smaller, still scratches and smudges like the rest... headphone jack is on the bottom (a good thing) and still displays album art... screen resolution is clearly less than the iPod Photo  3) PHOTO QUALITY: Not very good, still syncs w/ my iPhoto and Adobe Elements... but pictures have less resolution when I compare my 30gig iPod photo and the Nano side-by-side. PHOTOS ON MY TV: Not available.  4) MUSIC: Really no improvements here... but no steps back either.  5) USB 2.0 UPDATE TIMES: Slow for initial load (full capacity)....normal FireWire iPod on Mac is about 1 second per song (no FireWire use on Nano) ...USB on Mac is 2.5 seconds/song... USB on PC is about 2-3 seconds/song... longest test was PC formatted Nano, updating on a Mac = 4-5sec/song!!! ... hopefully Apple will soon enable FireWire connectivity for Nano.   6) BATTERY LIFE: Didn't really run above spec in my tests: ~14hrs w/ no backlight.... 10hrs31min w/ backlight set at 5 seconds...and normal amount of navigation.   7) FUNNY QUERKS: (1) No FireWire updates, but seems to charge via-FireWire, (2) Screen "washes out" when viewed at an angle... same for the iPod Photo or Mini, but not as severe.   ===== SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX =====  A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing photo albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) SLIDESHOWS: without the TV-output capability, there is no use for this on this iPod... sux.    D) ITUNES 5.0: Cool new feature is ability to create `folders' for your playlists... if you have too many playlists, then this feature is great... but the navigation does not translate to your iPod Nano... you still have to use a million playlists on the same scroll column.   E) NO AC ADAPTER: You must charge from a powered USB 2.0 port... note, most USB 1.0 ports are not powered, nor does a 1.0 port update your songs.

<Title>It would be five stars were it not for iTunes
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wonderful design. Aesthetically appealing. The quality of the sound is excelllent. Size is amazing.... the screen is wonderful... the list goes on ...  HOWEVER..... in order to do anything, you have to go through iTunes, and there's no direct mapping of ripped files and folders to transfer... Album covers are not automatically retrieved like MS Media player.

<Title>Before you take the plunge ...
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the iPod. Always have. At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano black.  Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).  Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology. It's tiny (it feels even smaller than the photos suggest), has great sound quality (better, I think, than any other iPod I've owned), and the display is gorgeous (even though tiny).  For me, the mini (now defunct, but bargains still abound) is the better choice given its sturdiness. I'm not up for museum-relic care for my electronics, which would certainly help if you own one of these.  Another beautiful, functional gizmo from Apple.  Just know what you're getting.  Some websites claim the nano is sturdy. I can tell you, from first hand experience, it isn't.  So, you be the judge. (Sure, the thing still played, but replacing the screen will set you back at least $90, and, even on the web sites in question, the screen broke.)  (Oh, and if you see someone taking shots at the iTunes software, don't believe it. It's the best music software out there, and its integration with this--or any--iPod is a joy.)  __________  Follow up ... Apple has admitted a problem with some of the nano screens and is doing the right thing: replacing the units with new ones. BRAVO!

<Title>Is it fragile
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anybody worry about breaking this one can go &lt;A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here&lt;/A> and read their review. A quote: "At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering."...

<Title>CLOSE TO PERFECTION
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>WOW!  Everyone who has seen my black 4G ipod has ordered one, even those who hated ipods for no reason.  This is an amazing engineering feat, I have no idea how they fit all that in to a player the size of a credit card.    It's got a beautiful color screen, syncs with your outlook contacts and calendar, stores photos, games, clocks, and best of all it's got iTunes.  I really don;t see how they could improve on this besides maybe getting a protective coating on the black nano.  It does scratch real easy.  And contraty to what was posted, you can get 2 lines of free laser engraving when you order from the apple store online.  Also, the battery lasts plenty 14 hours, who wants to carry around bulky AAA batteries around all the time.  I think the competition might just have to close shop pretty soon.

<Title>Amazing technological leap doesn't even look real!
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You have to physically handle and hold the new iPod Nano to believe it is real. It is approximately 1 ounce in weight, so almost unnoticable on your person - whether it's in a pocket or an armband. The small color screen is stunningly brilliant in brightness and color definition.  The black iPod shows fingerprints more prominently than the white version - but ooh la la, it is most sexilicious to look at! I'd personally love to see one of these in red as well.  Because they are so new, third party vendors haven't had much of a chance to make cases and other products for the Nano.   There are only a handful of already existing products out there that are already compatible with the Nano...  Available FM Transmitters: Forget the iTrip and those of that ilk - current versions won't work with the Nano. Your choices for now are the Belkin (which is buggy) and the Monster iCar Play Plus. The Monster version isn't cheap, but it's an integrated charger and FM transmitter and is one of the best out there.   Available Cases: The Apple branded armband - looks like a glorified bandaid in the case, but looks decent when you wear it Apple branded Tubes - good luck finding one, most Apple Stores still haven't gotten any in stock Apple branded iPod Socks - designed for the older iPods, they work fine with the Nano - but can cause minor scratches  Available Speakers that Charge: The JBL OnStage - fits fine, sounds great The Bose Sound Dock - is visibly off-center, but fits fine, sounds freakin' awesome Altec Lancing's IM3 for full and mini - fits but sound is lackluster Klipsch - sounds great... Nano is greatly dwarfed, however by such large equipment... akin to building a superdome around a book of matches.  By the time you read this review, 10 other vendors will have probably already submitted their patents and copyrights to lawyers for new gizmos.  Apple has announced that the new configuration of how the Nano connection is set up will be the NEW standard for all forthcoming iPods... this will help vendors make products more quickly and without quaking in their boots that by the time they get something to market, it will be outdated - and should encourage lots of new development like we have yet to have seen thus far in the iPod accessory industry.  The Nano adds a World Clock, a stop watch and a combination lock to the "extras" menu. The famous silver back collects scratches and fingerprints exactly like its counterparts - but this is a known - get a case to protect your investment. Contrary to what another reviewer posted, the Nano is not "fragile" - far from it. There are no moving parts - so you could probably use this as a hacky-sack for an hour without fazing it.   At least one consumer has published their own abuse study of the Nano, running it over with a car and throwing it from a moving car at 55mph before finally rendering it useless after a 40 foot drop onto cement. The screen makes it a tad more vulnerable than the shuffle... but it's a sturdy piece of industrial art.  My less than perfect rating is for the following:  1.) No firewire support - even if you have a dock connector to firewire cable, you won't be able to use it - it is USB 2.0 only. What is Apple thinking? Hello! Remember your loyal Mac users who prefer FireWire?  2.) Sole earphone jack is too close to dock connector - using a splitter probably precludes charging it at the same time.  3.) No extra jack or connector on flipside so remote can be added while it charges... so if and when the vendors make recorders, remotes and other goodies for the Nano, you won't be able to use them in tandem with a charging solution.  4.) No bluetooth. Why is this an issue? More and more items are becoming BT enabled. One application I can think of right now is a Nano finder. The Nano is almost weightless and very thin - if you misplace it, how are you going to find it? If it had BT and you had (for example) a Nano finder on a keychain, clicking it could send a signal to your Nano to make audible clicks. Just an idea. This review loses a star for the other reasons, however, not this one... but come on, Apple!  5.)Still no way to get custom logo engraving via Apple unless you're a corporation with a large order... third party vendors are now doing laser engraving so you can put photos of pets, kids, yourself, your logo, etc. on the back of your iPod - but Apple offers no such solution. Considering that stamps.com allows you to make your own legal US postage with a photo of your pet, and they are able to prevent porn and other objectionable imagery through, there is no reason why Apple cannot make this accommodation.  6.) Limited (still!) photo capabilites. Compact Flash cards are like diamonds - the bigger they are, the more they are per carat (or rather, per MB). The iPod Photo camera connector connects a camera just fine - but not to the Nano! There is no explanation for this - it still uses a dock connector, but won't work w/ the Nano. The camera connector isn't that great to begin with, because you can ONLY use it to connect an iPod to a camera, not to a compact flash or multi reader... so if you're out in the field taking photos, you can't take them until your photos download and you waste your battery in your camera. If you could attach a card reader to the connector and download photos for storage on your iPod while simultaneously shooting more photos with your camera using a different card so you can swap without losing precious shooting time. Camera connector shortcomings notwithstanding, it doesn't work with the Nano. I know I already stated this, but I'm still frustrated.  The part of me that loves Apple's innovative technology and design wanted to give this incredible gizmo 5 stars - but there is still overt room for improvement and I know Apple can do this!

<Title>The Black Lacks?
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just go the iPod Nano today, and so far I'm loving it! The whole thing looks surreal (to amazing to be real). The Nano plays like a dream. The controls and menus are the same as the original iPod and the iPod mini. The player is so small too, smaller then the pictures lead you to believe! I only have two really big complaints.  1) The black does show every minuet scratch, and scratching it is not hard. I haven't scratched mine yet, but a few of my friends have. I am going to try keeping the temporary clear plastic cover on the front of the player. Hopefully the scratched will only be on the plastic and when the Nano Tubs come out I can just peal off the plastic and slid it in. I think Apples decision to release the Nano Tubes 4 weeks after releasing the iPod Nano was a really stupid one!  2) The Black iPod nano comes with WHITE EAR BUDS!!! The ear buds are the same ones you get with all the other iPods. I mean come on, if you are going to make a black iPod Nano then at least make the ear buds match. It kind of ruins the whole black look when it has this white wire coming out of it. Everyone that has looked at it said, "What's up with the white buds? They don't go!"  It's easy to operate and fun to play around with. The thing does feel flimsy but I haven't accidentally test its durability yet so I'll have to get back to you on that one. Over all I do like my iPod Nano, I just wish I could protect it from getting damaged.  BEWARE THE BLACK IPOD NANO HAS WHITE EAR BUDS!!!!!

<Title>GREAT ITEM
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm sure many of you out there have ipods...it seems like everyone walking around these days has one. So as many of you that have them, most of you probably know how easily breakable the mini's and regular ipods were. The new nano's however has no movable parts, but still functions like the regular ipods. and because it only weighs 1.5 ounces, you can catch it by the earphones, so it will never clatter onto the ground and break (as did mine). Apple controls over 80% of the mp3 player market -normally, that is something which is impossible to hold on to. But introducing this item, they might have even strengthened their hold on the market. In fact, apple is so sure of the nano, that they are discontinuing their best selling product -the mini. Maybe there is a reason why everyone you see walking down the street is listening to an ipod. To see it, is to fall in love with it, credit cards -beware. [...]

<Title>Nano needs materials rethink
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device.  This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt.  The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected.  I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front.  Damned annoying.  Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it.  Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?  My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed.  You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you won't buy one.

<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is by far the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.  It scratches soooo easily, it makes it look a year old after the first week.  It is ridiculously small, i almost lost it twice, why is it so small?  its so impractical.  A few other points, you can only charge it when your computer is on, which sucks if you or going on a vacation or something.  The earphone slot is on the bottom, which almost forces you to buy the ipod earphone accessories that apple sells, as well as the case and probably the dock as well... -.-  If you are going to buy this, don't count on the initial $249 being the final price. you will have to pay 30 for the cases 40 for the earphones and another thirty for the dock.  altogether it will be $349 plus tax >:( not good.  look but do not touch!!

<Content>I just got back from a trip to Europe and I must say I love almost everything about my nano.  The battery lasted the entire 12 hour journey with room to spare.  The size is terrific for travel--no larger than a small stack of business cards.  Sound is great and the flash allows for near instant response and mega durability.  The only negatives are that it scratches a tad easily and I wish the screen was a bit bigger or it had video out...next version I hope.  All in all, I'm really happy I bought my nano.

<Title>Get This Instead of The Nano!!!
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try to make this short and sweet. This is about the Sansa E200 Series Mp3 Players.  The ipods can't even compare to this...   -Superb mp3/wma playback and features  (includes custom eq,album art,playlists)   -FM radio (includes radio recording with pause and resume function)   -Voice recording (with pause and resume function)   -Picture viewer  (includes thumbnail view, indivdual view, slideshow with song playback)   -Video playback - don't worry about any problems because the videos are SUPERB quality  (includes video converter,play/pause,fast fwd./rew.,depending on what video you put on the player,they can be either fullscreen or widescreen)   -1.8" screen! (almost double the size of the ipod's)   -colorful screen and menus (who wants basic white like the ipod's)   -battery life (average of 20 hours)   -replaceable battery (in case it dies/doesn't work, you can get a new one, unlike the ipods)   -scroll wheel (works very wheel, and it's large enough to use)   -other buttons (don't worry about them being small,they're just the right size)   -ways to put data on the sansa (can be windows media player or by dragging and dropping files onto the sansa's drive/folder)   -size (about same size as Ipod Nano,but a little thicker so it's easier to hold in your hand)   -price ($150 for 2gb Ipod Nano, $160-$190 dollars for 8GB VERSION WITH ALL OF THESE FEATURES!!!! Even if they both did the same things,you get 4 times the memory for about $15 more!!)   If you don't know what mp3 player to get, get this one, you will NOT be dissapointed.   NOTE: the only con is that the Sansa may get finger-printed because it's smooth/glossy.  NOTE: if you take care of the Sansa, it willl NOT break or scratch.

<Title>Frustrating because of ITunes software and support
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can only load music into the Apple Ipod Nano through your computer on a program called ITunes. Loading the software onto your computer can be a major problem. I downloaded it and it refused to open. Apple's literature and online "support" was useless. Simply stated it is not user friendly, it does not tell you what to do in plain English. As usual a GOOGLE search with a few key words produced a number of boards loaded with people with the same problem. Thank goodness these people are kind enough to post solutions. In this case it has to do with the fact that the ITunes software has to operate with another program, a player called Quicktime. If both of these programs are not properly installed you will have a problem. The solution seems to be to first remove both programs entirely, restart your computer, and then install Quicktime (alone without ITunes) first before installing Itunes (alone without Quicktime). That's how I got it to work after 2 hours of repairing, installing, uninstalling, etc. Another problem is that it will not work (that means WORK after installation) unless it is installed and operates with "administrator privileges" meaning that if a child is using it they must have "administrator privileges" on the computer.  Second problem- After you finally get ITunes to run you learn that once files are downloaded onto the Ipod Nano the only way that they can be removed is through Itunes with the Ipod connected to the computer. You cannot delete them directly from the Ipod. Again instructions and support are not user friendly. They tell you to look somewhere on the screen (they are not specific) for the Ipod icon to start the delete process. What they don't tell you is that it only appears for a limited time upon the initial connection of the Ipod to the computer. If you don't find it before it disappears, you must disconnect and reconnect for it to reappear again, there is no way of just bringing it up on the screen again. And the deletion process is far from simple once you find the Ipod icon.  Basically this thing is nothing more that a portable computer jukebox. The process of loading and changing songs in it shouldn't be so difficult.

<Content>I have been waiting for years to get an iPod, and since my recent purchase of the nano, I am extremely content with it. The features the iPod offers are limitless and I can finally carry around my music without switching CDs or waiting for a song to come on the radio. This is one of the best things I ever purchased in my life and I am completely not exaggerating!

<Title>Fact - iPods Do Not Play Mp3s!
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't really feel like going into a lot of detail about the problems I had with this horrible product, since I'm sure all of the iPod-attics will rain down thier bizarre cult-like craziness on me, but here goes anyway.  The first set of problems came when I found that you can't just plug the player into your computer and drag and drop files onto it - like every other mp3 in the world.  You are forced to use iTunes, which changes the file format of the mp3's into a special Apple file format.  This angered me, as one of the reasons I bought the thing is so I could transfer the mp3s that I loaded onto it onto all of my friends computers.  But that's not possible thanks to Apple's insistance on changing my mp3s into thier own speacial file format.  This led me to the realization that marketing this product as an mp3 player, is false avertising, because it does not actually play mp3s.  Next, after deciding to do what the iPod told me to do, I had to update the software 10 times before I could get a song to play on it.  I tried to call customer support for help at one point and..... let me just put it this way, there is no customer support.  After many hours I got the thing working and got some songs on there.  At this point I was actually excited about the product, because I was under the impression my problems were over.  After a couple of days the battery started going dead after only 1 hour of use, even when fully charged.  Grudgingly I called Apple back and, after waiting 2 hours on the phone, was authorized to send it back for a replacement.  When the new one arrived I had the exact same problems setting it up that I had had the first time.  10 days later the unit stopped working all together and would not even power on.  I am still in the process of trying to get another replacement and I'm beginning to think that I'm not getting one.  This has been an absolute NIGHTMARE!  Never buy anything from Apple, they suck and they are crooks!

<Title>What i've been waiting for.
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an ipod nano at Best Buy, a 4gb one that costs 250$. I bought the insurance and bought the holder so it wouldn't break. It looked awsome and i was ready to jam! I hooked it up to my comp, loaded on about 500 or more song and a few pictures and started jamming, it rules. When u played a song u could look at the album cover, play games, or look at pictures u put in there. It was the best ipod yet. But then i realized it is fragile. Without a case if u drop it on a carpet it will scratch it or might ever crack it. But i always keep the protective case on. With the case this thing is the best ipod yet, and it holds just the right amount of songs, 1,000 songs. All in all i think its awsome. I highly reccomend it to any one who wants to update there ipod or wants an ipod nano, but make sure u BUY! the protective case or u will end up breaking it. If u want something cheaper get an ipod mini 6 or 4 gb, they are still good and are very sturdy.

<Content>I always envied the size of the mini, but I enjoyed my album art too much to make that trade down. Hauling the 20GB around was cumbersome when I just wanted to run a quick errand while listening to music. With the nano, I get the lightweight and album art. It's so perfect that I didn't even wait to sell my 20GB before purchasing one. I couldn't wait.

<Content>This is gorgeous and beautiful piece of art to look at but there's a major flaw: it scratches too easily.  It scratches easily when in a pocket with nothing else and eventually makes the screen unreadable in short time.  Look up discussions at the Apple support website or ipodlounge.  I recommend waiting until the second generation on this one.  All the best.

<Title>Great device
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[...]  The nano scratches no more easily than any previous iPod.  I have had mine for a couple of weeks and have yet to see a blemish on it.  If you take care of your iPod, it will take care of you.  Keep it in a safe place, store it in a case or a cloth bag of some sort when you aren't using it, and clean it occasionally with a microfiber cloth -- these are the steps I have taken to keep the various iPods I have owned clean and blemish-free.  Common sense will keep it (and all of your electronics, for that matter) healthy and easy on the eyes!  An example:  Two nights ago, I was sitting on my couch with my laptop in front of me and my nano plugged into a USB port to charge.  It was wrapped inside of a cloth Sony Minidisc bag at the time.  My dog, an 8 pound Yorkie, decided that now would be an awesome time to play.  She hopped up on the couch and severly trounced my new iPod.  Her weight and her claws, however, did no damage to the iPod because it was inside of something designed to protect it from such things.  If my dog couldn't damage the nano while it was inside of a thin cloth case, then I have a hard time believing that someone managed to mangle their nano's screen by leaving it in the pocket of their blue jeans or a cotton hoodie.  At any rate, this is a fantastic device worthy of the name iPod.  The sound quality is wonderful, the screen is sharp, and the click wheel makes it instantly familiar to anyone who has used an iPod in the past.  Thanks to the flash memory, photos and music load quickly, and the menus are snappy.  I have not been disappointed with the nano.  Highly recommended!

<Title>Save the waiting and your money,buy an iPod photo or mini!!!
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod nano no longer than a week ago, it is amazing absolutley fantastic, its a beautiful piece of machinery.... but it sucks. Its great in sound quality, etc but the second day i had it the screen scratched, im ok with that I was pretty pissed but i got over it. The 5th day i had it it scratched the screen again. And the final straw was when the screen cracked completely and ruined the whole thing. this was because my cat jumped on the table it was on and it happened to fall off. So great all my money is gone to waste, i demanded a refund and got my money back. I went out and bought an iPod mini. Ill wait until I know for sure that these nanos are gonna be safe to walk around with. All the iPods are superior in holding up with a little abuse. But when you make silly mistakes like leaving in on a table that happens to fall apart it really makes you angry because you wish these things had some durabilty... The only reason im not completely panning this fragile electronic is because it looks good, it sounds good, and the battery is ok. On the other hand its as fragile as an eggshell. How can you carry that around everywhere? Stick with the iPod Photo or Mini for now.... you'd wish you had when your nano turns to a scratched up cracked mess.  Wait a year or so I say.   By the way.... that tv ad for the nano where the hand is playing around with the nano with his fingers flipping it around, is bs!! If that dropped your screwed, so I dont reccomend you do what the hand is doing in that ad!!

<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are pondering whether or not to get the Nano...JUST GET IT.  It is worth it.  Everything about it is better than other mp3 players out there.  Yes it scratches, but you can always buy a case.  With the case, the Nano is still small.  Sound is good.  Extremely easy to use.  Expensive, but well priced when you consider its capabilities and its the first of its kind.  Ignore the negative reviews, this is the best that is available.  I would only not recommend this if you had over 5 gigs of music.  Even so, this is still a good product if you can narrow your songs to 1,000.  Again, there isn't anything else better than the Nano...

<Content>Why would I want anything more? It holds 1,000 songs. Ever thought how long it would take you to listen to 1,000 songs? I can store millions on my PC and change the Nano's content when ever I need to. If I want to watch video I will watch it on my TV. This versatile little item takes a lot of licks, holds more than enough music form my purposes and is extremly light. Best of all I can plug it up to noise cancelling headphones when on flights, my car stereo and my sound system at home.  My only concern is how to get the battery changed when it needs to be. But I guess the Apple Store will sort that one out when it comes time.

I've got 2 iPods and 1 mini and they are all scratched.  Even the two that came with the old slide case that Apple used to put in the box.  Fact is, if you buy an iPod it will get scratched.  End of story.  As a matter of fact anything you buy that will be a portable item will get scratched.  Don't believe all of these people when they tell you it is fragile.  One person complained it broke when it fell of a table.  Well DUH?  There was an idiot a few years ago mad because he dropped his 17" Powerbook off the table on its power cord and broke.  I want to drop these people on their heads and see if they break.  Maybe I can take them to the hospital and trade them in for something a little more durable.  An anvil perhaps.

<Content>NO STARS! MINUS SEVERAL BILLION STARS ACTUALLY. The demand for smaller and smaller devices has finally come to a dead-end. This product is way too fragile for the consumer market. Indeed using it as displayed in the advertising will get you a damaged Nano with Apple saying - 'Yes, well we may advertise people putting in their pocket, but we never expected anybody would. I'm afraid keeping the Nano in your pocket is considered abuse of the product and therefore *NO* WARENTEED replacement or FREE REPAIR is available. DON'T buy it or any other Apple product until they stop screwing the public like this.

<Content>This is a cool device. You will love it for the featues and the size.   I told myself I wouldn't mind the scuffing and scratching that comes from everyday usage, but I became upset when I decided to wipe the unit clean using my breath and my cotton t-shirt (like I do frequently with my sunglasses) and ended up with scratches all over the screen!  I've owned cell phones, pda's, and all kinds of electronic portable devices, and I have NEVER seen something so succeptible to scratching! It's only been two weeks. I can only imagine how bad it will be after a year.  To the skeptics out there who own one, try it!  If you get this unit, be sure to apply some sort of protector or the screen will be illegible in a few months of everday usage.

<Content>Interesting...I love this thing. It kinda fit with my lifestyle. I have one MD player and it's kinda too big for me so i think my next MD or MP3 player should be sth small.I was gonna buy MINI but when i went back to apple weasite again i saw a new little creature NANO and i fell in love with it :). 1000 songs are kinda a lot for me. If i would like to listen over tnan that, i'd rather stay at home with my stero :)   - fragile : i guess so... smaller things always more fragile than biger things:). I'm a dog lover as i know smaller dogs also more fragile than bigger dogs ..Same as Ipod :). when we accept to deal with it (Adopt a small dog or buy a Nano) just carefully use it i think it wouldn't be a problem :). A golden rule for using any electronic devices  "DON'T DROP IT, IT'S TOO FRAGILE TO BE DROPPED" :)   - Scratch so easy: i'm kinda think it depends on each individual. So how easy of scratching is depends on how careful the user is , as well.  Relax & Enjoy the innovation  Have fun....Love dog & Peace (^_^)V

I recieved my iPod nano today; From me not even touching the box i knew it was a great product. The box is a simple very small box with a picture of it on it. All the accesories are in it and the Nano. The Nano is smaller then you'd inmagine from the pictures. The sound qualitly made me dumbfounded, its just beutiful, vivid and rich. The screen quality is great not as good as a PSP's but very good. The only downside is probably that when you transfer photos from a PC all the photos have to been in one folder or it will write over the old ones. Im very happy and recomend it.

<Content>This was my first mp3 player.  I sort of waited and watched things develop.  No complaints.  I like the size, sound and user interface.  A few things to remember when buying an ipod - the purpose of this player is to sell itunes, it does not support drag and drop of mp3 files from your hard drive.  You must use the itunes software to load your mp3 rips on to the ipod in order for the ipod to recognize them.  Also the size (at least of the 4 GB model) is a lie.  You only have 3.7 GB of free space for music/pics and other files.  Great player if you don't mind having to use itunes software.

<Content>I love the ipod.I've had an iphoto for a while now and its great. I got a "nano" expecting the same quality albeit with a little less memory and bulk.It works but after only a short time 4(days)it looks like its been through a war.Despite treating very carefully the thing is covered in marks and scratches.I disagree with some of the other comments listed here where people ask what do you expect.I expect after four days that something I pay over $200 for looks relatively unused.I'll be returning mine.Hopefully I'll get my money back.Don't get me wrong, I love ipods but this is a disappointment....at least the screen didn't crack as a friends allegedly did.

<Title>Great Technology But Handle With Care
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased an Apple 4 GB iPod Nano several months ago. I paid a little more than $[...] for it retail, and received it a week after placing my order.  The first thing I noticed is how truly small this iPod is. They aren't kidding when they say it's small. Actually, it's about 1/2 the height of a new pencil. Because of its small size, it can be difficult at times to navigate through the various menus. Not to say it's an extremely difficult task. Just more so than with a regular sized iPod.  In addition, the small size of the Nano makes it very fragile. I wouldn't recommend carrying one around in a pants pocket. I also wouldn't recommend dropping the Nano. It's very fragile by design. In fact, there are times when I try not to push too hard on the face for fear I'll break the product. In addition, the face scratches easily, so it's best to keep it protected at all times.  As for the technology, I'm very happy with the amount of songs the Nano can hold. I've been adding a few songs a day since I purchased it, and still have 2GB of free space remaining. I'm currently at 1.5 days of continuous play. I'm guessing I could probably get 2.5 or 3 days out of it when full.  I'm also happy with the number of accessories currently available on the market for the Nano. I had no problem finding an FM transmitter so I can listen to it in my ride.  Aside from these good things, there is one big problem with the Nano, and iPods in general. It's the iTunes software. I've had numerous problems synching my Nano on a PC based machine. Several times I had to reset my Nano because the IPOD would not release from my machine after releasing it via iTunes. And heaven help you if you fall victim to Auto Synch on an already fully loaded iPod. Manual is always better in my opinion if you value the music you've stored. I also have found the big brother component of iTunes to be troubling. But that's an entirely different story.  As for the Nano, I'm happy with mine. Unfortunately, I'm overly protective as well due to its fragile design.

<Title>great innovation from apple.
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this was overall the best mp3 player i've owned.  It was easy to navigate, had a relatively long battery life, color screen, and more.  It worked great together with itunes.  The only drawback was fragility, but it was nothing a good case couldn't fix.  PROTECT THE SCREEN! if you don't, it will get scratched and maybe broken, pricy to fix.  A great line of accessories, also.  The new line of 2nd generation nanos have new and better features, but i'm sticking with my 4 gig because it is tired, true and still going strong after a year.  Make sure you read the instructions for valuable info on how to reset and other much-needed things.  Also, one last thing.  If you have just switched to itunes seven and it prompts you to download new ipod software, make sure your songs are backed up because it erases them.  Have Fun!

<Title>Piece of junk
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband bought me the Nano for my birthday. It has never worked properly. The second it is unplugged from the power source, it goes to sleep and cannot be unfrozen until the battery drains completely, usually a day. This is apparently so frequent a problem that it is the #1 troubleshooting topic on the Apple support site. The Nano cannot transfer from mac to pc, despite the USB hookup. Customer service is virtually non-existent.  On-line support consists email suggesting articles to read.  The end.  I decided finally after six months and 20 days to send the thing back, something I did not want to do because my Nano is engraved. Because I crossed the six month line, I have to pay $33 for shipping and handling because it has to arrive in THEIR box. The disclaimer page removes virtually all responsibility for anything needing repair and includes (starts off with) the promise to charge $100 for diagnostics unless a miracle occurs and they think the problem is actually on their end.  If they actually fix the problem without charging me $100 or more, I will eat my Nano..

<Content>Yes, it's shiny, and may show scratches, but this is not an object you throw around?  right?  I love this version, and I've bought 3 others as gifts.  I prefer this one so it will fit into the iMac extreme/neoprene sleeve.  The one you can wear on your arm or wrist during workouts.  I was worried the 2nd generation version was too thin to stay in the armband.

<Title>Worst MP3 player out there
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: Good-Looking  Con: The entire IPod  I have never owned an ipod, and i still know just by the specs that they are horrible. You can only use files that you have paid for and downloaded from itunes. Period. This would still be ridiculus even if Itunes was a decent program. People give good reviews for these ipods simply because they havent tried anything else, because the ipod is so popular. Every part of the ipod is terrible and i would reccomend any 20 dollar MP3 player over it. I doubt you'll listen to me as there are so many other good reviews out here, and youll probably be very pleased with it until you see another non-Apple MP3 player in action.

<Title>Be Careful
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently ordered a silver 4GB for myself and a black 4GB for my husband.  The silver one has the new case which is much sleeker, lighter, and has curved sides.  The black one is in the old "body style".  I think Apple must have had a bunch of these laying around and decided to use them for the supposed new generation. Since silver is a new color, this was not an issue.

<Title>Great Item
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am enjoying my new black iPod Nano a great deal, and I wish I'd been able to get one before now.  The sound quality is excellent, and the iPod itself is relatively easy to use.  I have a little difficulty reading the screen because my vision is poor.  However, I am usually able to make out the menu items even without glasses, and the click wheel is very easy to use.  My husband and I had some difficulty with using iTunes.  We didn't know that we needed to create separate playlists for the two of us, so all of my song choices were also copying onto his iPod when he would update it.  We have pretty much decided to look for a Dummies book on iPod use so we can have a clearer idea of how to use iTunes and how to transfer songs from CD to the iPod.  Overall, however, this is an excellent product.

<Content>On Feburary 10 2007, I will have had my Ipod Nano for approximately one whole year.  Not once have I ever dropped this thing (I bought the protective case the same day) and I have never experienced any real problems out of this product.  My one and only complaint is the lack of battery life.  Why after 10 and a half months am I only getting about 2 hours of battery life out of this thing?? I refuse to send it in for a battery replacement so that the same thing can occur once again next year.  I think that I will just purchase the Zune which has so much more to offer than the Ipod and I will advise all others to do the same. Besides, Microsoft rules over Apple anyways!!

<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was real excited to open presents on Christmas morning and find the one thing I wanted... an iPod! All in all I love it! But here are some things you need to keep in mind: It's small and fragile- I love the size, cuz I can put it in my purse, no more crappy CD player! But I highly recommend getting a case as soon as you get it. Earphones suck- This may just be me, but I can't stand those ear buds. With the soft covers they came with, at least it's tolerable. If you really can't stand them, I would recommend using your own earphones that you're used to. Battery life is short- The battery life is only good for about a day. If you're like me, you'll use it up every day! I would recommend charging it every night. Well there you go. It's a great product, you just gotta take care of it!

<Content>Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue". Apple finally admits it.  So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.  To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement for the DEFECTIVE product.  I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option.

<Title>iPod Black Nano Is Sweet-But the Scratches...........!!!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received my black iPod nano (my first ipod or anything Apple) six days ago, September 22. Let me tell you, this little baby is sweet..but as a first adopter, I think I may have got hosed on the casing.   I put this in my pocket, with nothing else in the pocket like keys, change , etc., and wore it around town a few days (of course, showing off a bit). By the end of the second day there were scratches all over, deep ones, on the black casing, and worst of all , the screen. Also on the back silver casing.   I was distraught, but fortunately found some blogs that told me to use Brasso (NOT other polishes, which did not work). The Brasso made it new again, no damage! (note-don't use it on the spin wheel).  FYI, KEEP THE PLASTIC COVER THE NANO COMES WITH ON AND USE IT..I THREW MINE AWAY LIKE A FOOL!!! This will help until you get a case.    Besides the problems with the case (I will defintely buy a new case soon, I love it!! I have had it go FIFTEEN HOURS with no charge! I have about 600 songs on it, my contacts, and calendar.  Here are some suggestions:   * Everytime I sync the calendar/contacts, it adds another duplicate set of contacts. I need to figure this out or maybe it is a built in flaw.  *Having the calendar sync is nice. Built in alarms also.  *Have not done much with pics, but plan too.  *This is my first ipod, I am sure others have similar features, I love the ability to look up songs by ALBUM, ARTIST, RECENTLY PURCHASED, RECENTLY PLAYED, TOP 25, GENRE, etc. Nice feature.  * Volume is good, when played real loudly some minor distortion.  * Color screen and 4gig flash is awesome!   *Recharging via USB is a breeze! Hint: I bought the Apple power chargerto hook into outlet via USB, if you are are the road and don't have a computer power source you need this. NOT included in package.     All in all , I am pleased, with the size, battery life, color screen, and features. Just wished Apple had used some good material on the casing.All in all, four stars, if you wait until Apple corrects the casing, or use the soon to be on the market cases, you will be fine. I have also heard the PDA clear screen protectors work.

<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Black iPod nano since last Friday and I have to say it is fantastic. I was skeptical about how nice the screen would look being so small but it is crystal clear and beautiful. Pictures and games show up really well with great detail. Putting songs and pictures on it through iTunes is a little annoying because I was so used to my creative zen player being able to drag and drop everything easily.  Its size is just amaizing and is perfect for when I go jugging. I bought a pink armband and it works really well. Navigating the menus is very easy and the shuffle songs feature works really well. Most other MP3 players I have had tend to repeat the same songs but with this one it is very random. Excellent little device, I can't wait to see what else apple comes up with.

<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Im new to iPod having got on just fine with my Archos Mp3 player for the past 4 years - so this review is not from an 'iCult' member who thinks Apple can do no wrong.  The size and weight is undoubtably the biggest selling point - it does feel great to hold in your hands and you can't help admire the design.  No adapter plug is a huge let down - having to charge it via the USB cable is a hassle.  What's the point of having a 'go anywhere' MP3 player if you have to lug a laptop around with you to charge it??   Sure you can shell out another $30 for a plug from Apple, but shouldn't an adapter be included for this price?  Another hassle is the reliance on the iTunes software to upload tunes/files etc onto the nano - I guess you iPoders are used to this, but with my Archos I could just plug it into any computer with a USB port and drag files onto it without prior loading any software   Plus - Small size - Lightweight - Good sound  Minus - No adapter plug!!   - you need the iTunes software to put files onto it

<Title>Nice Upgrade from iPod Mini
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As soon as Apple introduced the iPod Nano it caught my interest as a small, convenient MP3 player perfectly made for air travel. Because of its 4 gigs of memory and smaller size, the Nano can be easily slipped it into a shirt pocket, play hours of music, and be forgotten. Despite the fact it was fairly evident that scratches could be an issue due to the glossy surface, I purchased the black version since it matched my Etymotic ER4P earplugs and cord. When the Nano arrived I left the original clear film protector on the front of the player and purchased skin covers until something better could be found.   The sound produced by the Nano is excellent, it is very difficult to tell any difference from other iPods. The Nano has also perfomed equally well with iTunes, music downloads, and the computer interface. However, there is one performance issue that has been troubling, and that concerns battery power. The Nano is advertised as having 14 hours of battery strength, yet after three weeks of use it appears to have the same power range as its predecessor the iPod Mini. That issue has been a rather significant disappointment so far, but hopefully the battery will become more efficient with usage. Overall Apple has done quite well with the new iPod Nano, just treat it gently as you would with any other electronic device and it will meet most expectations.

<Content>This nano is one of the smallest players on the market today. Despite the small form factor, at 4GB the iPod nano holds more than any other flash player out there, and comes in a package nearly a third the size of other MP3 players with the same storage capacity.  Pros: Slim; intuitive; under-rated 15-hour battery; vivid color LCD; rich sound; games; now works with Outlook; skip-free; fast write times; no need for partitioning to use as USB Mass Storage Device.   Cons: Non-replaceable battery; no FM/voice/line-in recorder; doesn't replace 6GB iPod mini's storage capacity.  Verdict: Slim, stylish, and fully loaded, the iPod nano is a great deal for a flash-based MP3 player.

<Content>The nano is definitely the way to go. I've got room for 1000 songs - who needs anymore? I just put my favorite songs on there and am up to 175 or so (as of 11/9/06). I think the black ipods look more elegant than the white ones, plus they seem to be less common. :D Which is good.:D I love the size and the simplicity of the process. Of course, it's NOT the ipod to watch movies on because the screen is so small, but even the video ipods have smaller screens. If you're gonna watch a movie, watch it on a TV.   Everyone wishes for an everlasting battery, but this battery is not bad. Mine is relatively new, and I've heard that the battery juice goes down with age, but right now I'm very happy with the life of the battery. I don't use the ipod for hours on end - I DO have a social life.

Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze.  Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen

<Content>.. or any album, (e.g. many Dance, Classical or Progressive Rock picks) where the tracks run together seemlessly. In other words, NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK. Instead you get a split second of silence interrupting tracks that should run together without any disturbance.  Completely unforgivable for a 5th generation product from the Market Leader!  Bad Apple!  Gary  P.S. The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song. But the popular LAME encoding method for MP3s embeds a value containing the proper length of the track into the file so that the decoder can tell when the file should be cut and the next mp3 in sequence should start playing.

<Title>Going for my third Ipod
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So.. I bought a Nano. took it with me to work, was waiting in a doctors waitingroom while I opened it. Its amazingly small and light. I was a little shocked to read that there is no AC adaptor, and a little annoyed that there is not even like a demo song on it or anything. An hour, and several games of solitare later, the back has one fairly major scratch and a lot of fingerprints, and Im thinking of returning it, but wondering if that scratch will stop that. I leave the plastic protective dealy on the front, and take it home. It took me about an hour to master the itunes dealy, and I get some music on it.  At this point, I plug in my oldschool koss headphones that I love, and am immediatly blown away by the sound. about 20 minutes later, I discover podcasting, and realize even If i return the nano, Im going to have to get something to replace it(this being my first non-cd mp3 player). So I gave it a few days, slung it around a bit. More scratching, but it didnt realy flex, so I figure its probly pretty durable. Im loving it, but wishing I had a 4 rather than a 2 gb.  after a week, I take it to work with me, intending to take it jogging after work. But when I pull it out, the screen is missing about half of its lines, in the middle. And, the volume control dosnt work. click wheel does, but no volume, and its stuck on blast. It was wrapped inside of a folded handkerchief, which was inside of the cloth bag I got with my oakleys. Dont know what happened, but now Im thinking "well sh*t". I am out $200.   I took it back to the store, and they were gracious about the return(thank heaven), but persuaded me to get a second one. that was this afternoon. I got home, and decided that I really want the 4 gb, not this second 2. And I want to avoid the scratching issue, so I will try the silicon nanotubes. Since I hadnt even opened the second one, I will be returning it first thing next week, in its sealed package. I can wait for a 4 gb to be available.  I ordered it(my third nano, a black 4 gb) direct from apple this afternoon, with a set of the "nano tubes". I learned with the first one... When it arrives, It will be staying sealed in its package untill the cases I ordered with it arrive. Even then, I will be leaving the plastic cover on the front, inside the case. And I will be finding a hard case for rough travel and storage(when its gotta go in a backpack, or when I am road tripping). I think a nice soap holder will fit perfectly. Yay cheap, eh?  I think the screen thing will be biting apple in the arse. I also think that they really should look into a more durable scratch resistant coat. you cant proof it, and I like the mirror finish, but a little bit of work on this would likely yield big for the product line.   With that said, I am loving the idea, and the product. I will have an use an Ipod Nano, probably for as long as the product line Exists. perfect size, shape, etc.  My only 2 regrets are that there is no FM, and that I can't get a U2 Nano. That would make for a truely kick behind product combo. maybe a future version. I would easily shelled out 2-3 times the cost for a scratch resistant, radio recieving, U2 Ipod Nano.  Oh.. and someone needs to push a little on the availability of the nano Accessories. 4-6 week wait for some of that? no good.  Buy a Nano. Try a Nano. Im not just just the president, Im a member(now)

<Title>where is the volume for my hard rock?
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ok, i am a bit disappointed with the scratches, considering i have even made sure there is absolutely nothing else in the pocket than the black nano. but is it only my hearing or is the sound very low? even when its turned as loud as possible its still very low. and i am aware of the "soundcheck" feature. but is it possible that it turns all the songs at a similar low level as the one it used to measure to begin with? On the plane to Riga last week it was impossible to hear music through the noise of the engine. and thet surely never happened with my sony discman. or is the american apple so scared of being sued for messing up peoples hearing that they are acting as "parents" and put the max volume at a safe level.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP-3 type player.  I chose Apple because I felt it was just easier to use with the iTunes as opposed to Napster. I love my Nano. All of it, the iTunes, the Nano itself is so easy to use.  The music quality is excellent and the size is almost impossibly small.  I've heard that the glass over the color screen is susceptible to cracking if you're not careful, so obviously, I'll be careful.  I love the random shuffle, the different playlists, the genres, artists, etc., all the different categories you can play with.  I've had this for 4 days now. I was reluctant at first to get one of these. But the convenience of storing all of your CD's, selecting which songs you want and never having to fuss with changing the discs is just so nice.  I bought the splitter cable and can hook it up to any  stereo system.  The 4GB model just seemed more sensible to have given that I've already loaded 500+ songs into it and my CD collection is relatively minimal.  I like the flexibility of adding more if I want to and not worrying about the space.  A really great buy.

<Content>the real question when you are picking out an mp3 player  - is not what brand you want. duh, you want apple!   -is not what kind of ipod you want.  You want a nano. the newest, the slimest, the coolest.     -its not if you can deal with scraches or not.  If you are buying an ipod, use it for function, not fashon.   The real question is  What color do you want!  White  Does not scrach as easy  looks just like a real ipod!  white can go with your wedding dress!  Black  sorta scraches not like you care looks cool, black is very sleek idunno, black is different for an ipod  Yah, i hope my review helped a lot of people with the same problem as i had.

<Title>Nano - 5 Stars Apple - minus 5 Stars
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Being the only person in the family without an ipod I decided to buy a nano when the black ones became available so today while wandering the local mega mall I stopped at the Apple Store and picked one up.  As a first time buyer/user I was very disappointed by the lack of documention for the itunes software and the lack of a case or at least a clip for the nano.  The itunes software instaled easily enough even if it took a dog year to load but I was surprised when I played my first mp3 file using itunes and it has so much processing lag that it has an echo making it unusable to listen to even mp3 voice files. This problem cannot be blame on my computer as both windows media player and winamp work perfectly.  Also the itunes software is not intuative. It took me five minutes to figure out how to get mp3s that were on my laptop onto the nano and I'm still not sure exactly what I did to get the files to load on the nano. Guess I'll have to ask my daughter.  I was also disapointed by the lack of a case. Steve Jobs is ripping off his customers. It wouldn't have cost Apple $0.25 to have included a small cloth bag to keep the nano in or for $0.50 they could have included a plastic case. Guess I'll have to build the altiod case that I saw in a ipod forum till real cases become available.  There also is no clip. This is a real short coming as the nano is so small that it will easily slip out of your pocket and there is no good way to keep your nano secure when using while working out at the gym.  That said the nano is a 10, no question. Apples greed though tempers my enthusiasm for the nano.

I no longer have to carry a bulky cd case or get pissed because my cd started skipping or drop my cds or keep switching cds everytime my mood changed, ahhh, i could go on and on. I bring it everywhere, especially to work so I can listen to my micheal jackson when someone starts yelling at me! At first I was skeptical that I'd spent too much money on a music player, but then I considered all i've spent on batteries and replacing my cd player or buying cds. This is well worth the price. AND It's a perfect way to ignore people! I'm just trying to control myself so I won't start dancing like a buffon in the streets...I sing at the top of my lungs when i'm alone though, hehe.

<Title>Very cool... great sounding and every accessory you could ever want.
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Nano a couple weeks ago for just under two-hundred bucks. I have the black version. I also purchased Sennheiser CX300 earbuds to upgrade from the decidedly vanilla sounding earbuds that come with the Nano. In addition, I also picked up a black leather Belkin folding case to protect my investment. I really couldn't be happier with this purchase, as a musician and a music lover in general. The sound quality is actually quite superb. In my opinion, I think it's best to encode MP3's at high variable bit rate since this player will show the flaws in lower encoded music. I'm just beginning to get comfortable with the Itunes software. It still seems overcomplicated compared to most flash drive players. It would be nice if you could simply drag and drop from your PC or laptop to the player, but it's not an option. Reading the help files will help you to understand how to use the software feature functions.  The Ipod itself has many features including a contacts list, timer, many EQ presets and more things that I can't remember off the top of my head.  I hear that the 8gb version will be or has been released now. I guess for the extra 50 bucks it may be worth it to some people, but for my money and to remain within my budget constraints, I decided to spend that money on the headphone upgrade which was well worth it. The Sennheisers are better than the stock earphones - Hands down. They also play much more efficently requiring less power from your IPod which also increases your battery life. If you can find a set, pick them up, it's well worth it. The battery life for the Nano is rated for 14 hours, but if you tend to play with it a lot and skip around playing different tunes from different playlists, you will burn up your battery quite a bit faster than that.  The IPod is much smaller than it seems to appear in pictures and is also very thin. You could have this in your pocket and easily forget about it so be carefull not to run it through the wash!  The desirability factor is high with this player, everyone wants one these. IPod has instant name recognition and you have to make sure you don't leave it laying around or someone may just slip it into there pocket and now you're out a couple hundred bucks and you'll need to reinvest in a new one.  Overall an excellent player. Very sexy and stylish with excellent sound quality. If you can afford it, get one. Or steal someone elses if you're slick enough.... just kidding. But seriously, this is well worth the money for anyone like myself who can't stand to be without music while on the go. You can also purchase an FM transmitter to allow you to play through any stereo that has an FM tuner, that way all stored music is accessible and can be amplified whether you're in the car or at home and want to listen to your tracks over your home stereo system. Like I said, get one. You'll be happy you did.

<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nifty little device. The only advice I would give about it is to go to Apple's website to order it, because you now have the option on their site to get a Project RED iPod.  A number of companies are participating in Project RED by donating a percentage of their profits towards the purchase of anti-retroviral drugs to help fight AIDS in Africa. The Project RED iPod is also bright red, which also stirs awareness for the cause, as I believe red iPods are otherwise unheard of.  So, yeah. Get an iPod, listen to your tunes, download my band when our album comes out. And, while you're at it, do something good for other people (apart from Apple's shareholders, who I'm sure are doing just fine). Support the cause.

<Title>NANO excellent despite software problems
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my new Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Black in most respects.  But clearly Apple clearly has a problem with these devices unexpectedly going into "Alvin and the Chipmunks" mode (unintelligibly high-speed playback).  This is the second one in a row I've had with this problem.  And I've seen a lot of feedback on this in their forum.  I think the problem is in the software, and so that holds out some hope that Apple may have a fix for it.  In the meantime, I just stop and restart when that happens.  I mostly listen to audiobooks; and the iPod nano is otherwise great for this purpose.  In particular, I exploit very frequently the ability to re-position myself (down to the second) within the current book at any time.  That's an invaluable feature that I haven't seen on any MP3 players.

<Title>Can't beat the design!
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I resisted the dark side for years, but someone special bought me a black 4GB Nano as a gift and I'm a convert.  The form factor, ease of use, and reliability are unmatched.  Really, it's hard to imagine comfortably using anything smaller than this.  Of course, having "only" 4GB is a trade-off because it's not going to hold your entire music library.  The only major gripe so far is the weak accessory support.  The Tubes aren't out, the lanyard headphones are sold out, not much in the way of screen protectors yet.  Things to realize: (1) yes, it's fragile, so don't sit on it; (2) it's so small that the risk of losing it is considerable; (3) USB 2.0 is a must--according to the manual, 1.x may not work and Firewire is good for charging only.

<Content>I purchased an iPod Nano 2 weeks ago. When I brought it home, I had forgotten something. A case to protect it. I had to call the Apple store to ask if they made a case and they said, "No we don't. We are coming in soon." Why is it taking so long for Apple to create a case? My iPod isn't scratched yet because I left the wrapping on it. If you buy a product that is so fragile and scratchable, wouldn't you want to buy a case? Come on Apple, make a case already. P.S. Keep the wrapping on your iPod, so it won't get scratches. Take the wrapping off when you buy a case.

The Zen Micro is awesome and holds much more music and is not real big either. Everyone talks about how cool these are. My friend has one and I convinced him that he wasted his money. Well, I think they suck because they don't deliver. Anyway, if you want to look at pictures (which is what a computer or camera is for) or want a small player that holds very little music, here you go. If you want something that is worth the money, buy a Zen Micro.

<Title>Highly Recommended with one big caveat......
<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just received my Nano from Apple and was very impressed at first sight.  Of course the design is great, since this seems to be Apple's highest priority with it's products.  I skipped on buying any of the previous iPod versions since the third generation model of the original (just before the "click-wheel" was introduced).  I was waiting for something to justify spending so much money on so little memory (my cd collection is HUGE so 4 GB is a drop in the proverbial bucket) and I decided this was it.    I love practically everything about this product.  The screen is great and I haven't had the problems others have reported (although I'm treating it with kid-gloves).  I have left on the protective plastic film that comes on iPods until I can pick up some sleeves, and this has prevented any scratching.  In fact, everything on this is great except for.........THE MAJOR PROBLEM----  Transfering songs is amazingly slow because it doesn't support FireWire.  Perhaps i'm spoiled but the USB connection is so noticeably slower that I have cannot give it a full fledged 100%, gotta-go-get-it recommendation.  I guess it's okay if you don't constantly fill it with new music, but since I do, I tend to care about this issue more perhaps than others.  I'm hoping this can somehow be changed in the future, but until then I'll still use my old, big iPod for traveling when I need to take a lot of new music and files with me and my Nano for going around the city (NYC) casually.  Other than that, the black Nano is probably the coolest thing i've purchased in the last year.  I just hope they don't try to make it any smaller because then no one will be able to read the screen.

<Content>I have heard so many complaints about the scratching, the lack of storage, and the lack of accessories. The only justified complaint I can see there is the scratching issue. Apple should have used a little bit more tough of a polymer coating. That's ok, and I'll tell you why. SPECK CASES. No one has ever heard of this company, and its ridiculous. They make the best cases for any iPod, including the nano. www.speckproducts.com thats it. Check it out. Back to the iPod, its beautiful. The flash memory is amazing, seeing as it can handle alot more bumps and bruises (If you have a Speck Case). About the complaints of not being able to hold enough songs, well, i sorta see your point, but its not that bad. 1,000 songs should keep you satisfied till oyu can replace some. Another  idea, stop downloading the entire CD!! Just get the good songs, not all the fillers. It is totally worth it, and get the 4GB. BUY IT! lolb

<Title>Amazing technology!
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First the good, then the bad.  After using this for a week I still cannot believe the incredibly tiny size!! I know it's hardly any shorter than the iPod Mini and not that much narrower, but believe me... the thinness of the device REALLY makes it feel small and it is incredibly lightweight. I can have it in the shirt pocket of my SILK shirt and it isn't even noticeable!  As for durability, I haven't had it long enough (or tried dropping it) to find out, but I read an online review of the iPod Nano recently and they put it through all kinds of abuse and it still worked. Anyway, even though it is so tiny and lightweight, it actually still feels like a well constructed, solid, good-quality device. It doesn't feel cheap at all.  Just so you know... THE SCRATCHING ISSUE IS NOT A PROBLEM anymore. I was told that it was just the first run of iPod Nanos produced that had this issue. The one I bought is fine. I've been carrying it around for days now and there are no scratches. There are, however, a multitude of fingerprints all over it (they are most noticeable on the silver back) but no scratches yet (knock on wood!) At least the fingerprints are removable!  Now, I can't really comment too much on the battery life because I never use it for more than a couple of hours before I connect it to the computer again (and of course, this charges it). But just as a test I tried setting the screen backlight to "always on" and setting it on repeat play, and it still took several hours to drain the battery. And I usually have the backlight turned off (set so it only turns on when I hold down the menu button) because the color screen is actually still reasonably visible under average lighting conditions (like on the bus, etc.) without using the backlight at all. This should extend battery life significantly.  But... there are a few things I don't like about the iPod Nano. First of all, I find that if I use any of the EQ effects (especially Bass Booster), over half of my songs are distorted. And I know that this is not a result of the MP3 files being ripped improperly because they have always played fine on any of my previous MP3 players (non-iPods), with various sets of headphones. I bought a 20GB iPod about 2.5 years ago which had this same problem so I took it back and decided not to buy iPods for a while. When I bought the iPod Nano I was assuming that they would have fixed this problem by now, but I guess not. But, since I REALLY love the tinyness of the iPod Nano and can't resist it, I've decided to live with keeping my EQ effects "off" to avoid the distortion. I'm going to see if I can get some better headphones with more bass.  Another thing I don't like is that the iPod Nano cannot play regular AAC files that were created with another program. It will only play AAC files (.M4A) that were either purchased online through the iTunes store, or ripped from a CD using iTunes. This normally wouldn't be such a big deal except that I had prepared the AAC files ahead of time. Since I had to wait a couple of weeks for a 4GB iPod Nano to be in stock, and I had read that the iPod Nano could play AAC files, I spent a lot of time converting all my 128kbps MP3 files to 64kbps AAC files (so I could still fit most of my music collection on the Nano). After all this work, I discovered that the iPod Nano couldn't play them and am in the midst of re-encoding them from CD. And to make matters worse, since all my original CDs are in storage since I moved, for each album I have to burn an audio CD-RW first, then label all the tracks manually and rip it again through the iTunes software. I would think that for any previous iPod owner this probably won't be an issue if you've already got your AAC files, unless you want to change to a different bitrate. Personally, I can hardly notice a difference in the sound quality between my 128kbps MP3's and 64kbps AAC's, so having this option is a definite plus for me.  One thing to keep in mind if you purchase an iPod Nano: it will still cost you more money after you buy it! First of all, the battery will only charge through USB or an optional $30 accessory adaptor so you can plug it into the wall. So, you're either going to be spending $30 to buy the adaptor to charge it from the wall outlet, or spending more money on your monthly power bill for having to keep your power-hungry PC turned on all night while the iPod Nano charges off the USB.  Other minor problems: - volume can only be adjusted from the "now playing" screen (a dedicated volume control wheel on the side would be nice! - you need to connect it to a PC (and leave PC on!) to charge it - most songs have distorted sound if you use the EQ effects  Anyway, it's still a good player and I still can't believe how TINY IT IS! I still recommend it as long as you can get past the minor shortfalls I mentioned above.

<Content>I have the IPOD 30GB Color. I've managed to fill it half way. That's around 5000 songs. I became very paranoid that I'd lose it somehow via theft, dropping, etc. 5000 songs took me a long time and the thought of losing it has been on my mind for a while. My salvation arrived in the form of the NANO. My new 4GB nano is my traveling ipod, my cutting the grass ipod etc.  My 30GB is now a permanant part of my home computer audio. I've backed it up and thus the collection stays safe. With the NANO I decide what I want to listen to and transfer it over from the 30GB (you need a utility to do this) or copy over some CD's. The NANO is really tiny and with the memory being flash instead of a hard drive, less moving parts makes it more crash proof. It's a great product at a great price. Apple delivers once again.

<Title>Itchy and Scratchy
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I am walking to work, listening to music on my iPod, all is well.  But to adjust it, I must get it out of the protective cocoon I have devised.  Just like so many other folks, I proudly handed my new iPod to friends and family the first day I got it.  Then I looked at it -- Ugh!  It looked like I dragged it along a sidewalk for a mile by the headphones.  I went to Decalgirl and got some skins to cover it -- but too late.  It is not ruined but....  How does Black Nano work?  Well, the synching with iTunes, etc., works fine.  And the sound is OK but I agree with others that anyone interested should look seriously at the Mini.  The Mini is tough, has loads of accessories (including cases!), and works well.    And finally -- when is Apple going to ship a complete product?  For $250, the Nano should come with decent headphones, a travel/home charging kit, and, most of all, a protective case.  If Apple had any sense they'd throw in $10 worth of iTunes songs as an intro to that service.

<Title>What a great invention
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Remember the days when you actually had to carry around a big bulky walkmen and all the cds to go with it? Well I do and let me tell you I dont miss thoughs days one bit. This ipod nano is great and lets you carry just about every song you own and is super small and portable. I carry it just about every where I go in the store in the car, I mean theres no place this thing cant go. The only complaint I have about it is that the battery doesnt last for 7 or however many hours it says it does, your LUCKY if you get 2 full hours of continuos playing. But other then that this is great and totally worth the money only if your a major music listener. And I highly recommend you getting a protective case because it is fragil and scratches easy, and you would want one that protects the entire body of the ipod including the wheel and screen, otherwise you'll be sorry. But the ipod is a great divise and I've already gotten my moneys worth out of it and I'll be using it for many more years to come.

<Title>One of the best inventions yet
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a lot of years of using a cd player, it is quite nice to carry something as compact as an ipod/mp3. It is amazing what technology has managed to do.  For anybody wishing to buy an ipod I would certainly recommend it, you might pay more for it than any other mp3 but it certainly comes with some great extras, like the itunes program where you can look up songs and then download then for just 99c each. Now when you look at buying an ipod the only question is how many songs do you want it to hold and what do you want to do with it, like listen to music or watch movies on it. Now the only other question is are you ready for an ipod.

<Title>Didn't work 
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While this is a great invention- when it works, it was very disappointing that the IPOD shipped was totally defective and had to be replaced. This required a trip to the Apple store over 60 miles away after ruling out it wasn't a problem with the computer.  The only explanation, sometimes there's a bad one.  But, This was a new purchase after the initial IPOD my daughter owned died after little over one year of use.  It seems that the quality and longevity of the ipod is not there.  For the price, I would expect the ipod to last longer than 1 year and this defective item doesn't inspire confidence in the product.

<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never buy a CD again.  This black nano is a watershed moment in my music listening career.  20 years ago I bought a huge CD player for a hundreds of dollars and could only get very few CD's at record stores.  For much less I get so much more with an IPOD Nano.  Totally intuitive design, flawless execution.  I reccomend this for anyone who is a music lover.  I especially dig the Nano because I can run with it no problem as it weighs only a few ounces.  I feel bad for people who are still carrying CD players around the lakes that I run around on a regular basis.  They all should have this product.  It is really fantastic.  JVD

This IPOD is for anyone that loves to exercise, easy to take with you and makes time go by faster! I think you MUST get a case to protect it, it is very delicate... Only thing I don't like is how you control turning the volume up and down, the buttons are so touchy

<Content>This is such a lovely piece of equipment, i've owned this for like 8months now and i think i can review it fairly. This device has accompanied me in the worst conditions and it has never let me down, it looks great, sounds great, and most of all is so tiny and light u don't even feel it in ur pocket. I've jogged with it i've ran with it its really great. The only withdraw with it and this is why i'm giving it a four star is the battery, i wish the battery would stay a little bit longer than it does. They say 14hrs on the apple website but that isn't true if u count the time u waste searching for a particular song or changing from one album to the other or one artist to the other it'll end up like in 8hrs. Also i wished that apple would supply more accessories with it. Like come on? why doesn't it come with a decent protective case and a power adapter? it just isn't fair. A piece of advice if u are buying it, get a protective case it'll save u so much trouble, it'll break ur heart if it gets scratched, there are plenty of nice cases around the web.

<Title>Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my 4 GB iPod nano less than one year ago (it is still under warranty). However, recently, the screen does not show up (even though it does light up). I called customer service and I received an email and followed all the steps to restore my Ipod. Unfortunately, it did not bring about any changes. So my phone call was then directed to a manager named Janet, who I had to wait for half an hour to speak to. I explained for something that costs 250, it should at least last more than a year. I did not want to have to deal with the hassles of sending my Ipod back and receiving a receiving a refurbished Ipod that is only under warranty for another 3 months. Although, I am under warranty, it still costs 30 dollars to have it shipped/serviced for that "new" refurbished Ipod. The other option available is that I pay 59 dollars to have the product under warranty for another year (and then the shipping/service to have it fixed is waived). But what I'm saying is, "How can a customer have faith in a refurbished product when a brand new product could not last an entire year?" Janet, the manager, said that this was the only option for me, even though my Ipod was still under warranty. The "warranty" that they advertise is apparently, up to them to decide on the spot (they get to use their discretion). I was then placed on hold again for another half an hour, only to be directed to customer service to have them tell me to go to a website to process the return myself anyways. I have lost complete confidence in apple products and apple customer service; had I not invested so much in my Ipod I would thrown this Ipod away a long time ago.

<Title>Slick!
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The black iPod Nano is perhaps the most slick portable music player I have ever seen. It looks far better than its white version, but it does scratch easily. If you want a good and sleek music player that lasts long and continues to look good, I would suggest wait till its accessories come to the market (most importantly, durable covers similar to the ones for the Mini). I would think they should be hitting the market fairly soon. However, if you want a new toy to brag to your friends about, get it now before every other person is seen with it! (PS: For those who own a Bose sound system for the iPod, you'll be glad to know that the Nano is compatible with it...you don't need to spend anything extra!)

<Title>The Perfect Replacement For Your Mini
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With the Nano's release I saw the perfect replacement for my aging iPod Mini.  I'm rarely this pleased with purchases.  Simply put, this iPod is superior in every way.  Prehaps most importantly is the Nano's weight and size.  Looking at pictures doesn't do it justice, you have to really hold one in your hand to realize its true size.  I found the lighter weight was a noticable improvement over the Mini when I'm out running.  Additionally the battery life is superior and the screen is sharper and brighter (not to mention being in color.)  While I had read some warnings about the ease of scratching the screen I've yet to have this happen.  Additionally the price of these Nano's is higher than the Mini's they're replacing.  Overall another excellent product from Apple.

<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned an iPod mini for about 5 months now, and when the nano came out I was considering selling my mini on ebay and then buying a nano. Thank's to my friend buying one that he dropped on carpate and haveing it break in half and another person I know do the same thing but have the screen only stop working I decided not to. The iPod mini is durable I dropped mine on brik pavers and it only has 3 scrates and it works perferct and it wasn't in a case it dropped because it fell out of the belt clip that came with it. Try to find an iPod mini somewhere, and save yourself. But if you do go with the nano I'm not to blame for the horrible design flaw when your's breaks.  P.S.- I forgot go to somewhere with them on display you can see that the black scrates easily so get white I you decide to ignore what happend to the people I know.

<Title>Durable Flash Drive, Great Design
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Nano is great, I absolutely am a huge fan of it.  With flash drives manufactured by Samsung, it offers great durability.  So no more spinning components, as your data is stored in its flash drive.Of the old i-Pods that break, it is mostly due to a burned out hard drive.  Flash drives will certainly offer us people the durability.  Some testers have gone as far as dropping it out of a 2 story house and also dropped it out of a car going 30 mph, and while it did away with the screen, the drive was still intact and running.  As far as scratches, I would recommend keeping it out of your pockets (especially your back pockets, if you were to sit down, that would not be good!), away from any objects such as keys and coins.  At 1.5 oz., it is not exactly a tank, but also not brittle.  Also get a plastic clear cover (with screen and scroll coverage) to avoid any scratches, after all, you will be viewing great quality color.  I would recommend getting a cover ASAP. Check out www.decalgirl.com for a great selection of plastic covers, they are only a few dollars.  I would recommend a clear one if you want to still "look" at the beautiful nano.  I usually wear it around my neck, as its real light (fits great in a shirt pocket), and what a better way to floss your newest Apple toy. Industry sources have noted that Apple bought out Samsung's overstock of 2 and 4 gigabyte flash drives, and rumor has it that Samsung is manufacturing 16 gigabyte versions as we speak.Be sure to look out for 16 gigabyte nanos in the near future.  Bravo to Steve Jobs on another great creation, "I am truly smitten."

Pros: - almost cresit card size - decent interface, click wheel in nice. - Parchute game is cool - pictures and album art on display - compatiable with (book tapes)...via clunky interface with itunes  Cons - Apple iTunes is no where near as good as windows media 10, and if you have an Ipod you are married to it. Windows media lets you choose dozens of music stores... with iTunes your stuck paying apple the highest prices. - no recording capability!! - no FM - can only charge battery with USB port without buying a $49 wall charger. - really really fragile. - no support for Napster's subcription service (big drawback)    If I were shopping for a small MP3 player I would consider a Creative or iRiver model over the Nano. Better yet the discontinued 5GB Rio Carbon has been selling places for $99.

<Title>Decent very decent, but expensive
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like the nano. I was originally a shuffle owner but it crapped and I traded (thank you extended warranty) for a Nano. If I hadnt had the credit, I would think the Nano to be a little pricey, but there is a premium for flash-based players.    A few things: Just as everyone else has said, the plexi-glass-like face scratches if you look at it funny.  I wrap it in single layer of glad wrap (leaving the ends open) and it seems to work fine; apple aint getting my $30 for a piece of plastic, aint no way.  Battery life is markedly lower than advertised 14+/- hours. Seems to hold around the advertised amount of songs.    Funny enough, my biggest complaint is the weight.  Yeh its light relative to the ipod 20/30 G.  But it is 2X heavier than the shuff.  And I think it is unnessarily so.  The shuff is basically all plastic which makes it incredibly light, which I loved.  The nano has a metal back to stay consistent with the other ipod designs.  This, I think has made it heavier and also contributes to the breaks on impact when dropped.  I would love to see a feather-light plastic-back nano, thats my only beef.   Oh, yeah dont get black it shows all kinds of finger prints etc.  Stick with the white baby.  Also, the black comes with white earphones not black, way to think that one through, Apple.

<Title>Protection from Scratches
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I haven't bought an ipod nano yet but I will buy it soon enough because it simply looks fantastic and you can't find another mp3 player so small and beautiful like this one. However I've heard all these stories about the horrible scratches it gets easily and I decided to take my precautions in advance. I searched on ebay for ipod cases and it came with a bunch of results, I picked the cheapest one there was and I used the "buy now" option cause bidding for a case is just not worth it. The one I picked costed only $1 plus the shipping cost which was apparently more than that but still way cheaper overall than any of the other cases. The item which arrived included 4 silicon see-thru cases in different colors (one of them clear) and a stripe. The material is very endurable, slim and elegant and I'm very happy I got it. I'm very hypochontriac when it comes to electronic devices, I'll probably leave the plastic around my ipod as well. This item shipped from Hong Kong from an idependant seller and it was sealed, not used at all. There are many sellers like that on ebay. The stripe it came with is a very convenient way to carry it around. You should definitely look for a case like that on ebay, don't waste your money on expensive cases because the quality is the same and they rip you off. The 4 cases and the stripe I got are excellent and only at the price of $1! No kidding!

<Title>Nice piece of equipment but sound quality lacks a bit
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>People who are saying the sound quality on the Nano is excellent obviously haven't had much to compare it to. The Ipod Nano itself, the construction, software, and ease of use is very good. The capacity is great for such a little flashed based device. However, I own an Iriver IFP-999 and the sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of the Nano. Iriver players offer 3d sound capability which the Ipod does not. This feature significantly improves your audio experience especially if you own high end earphones (like Shure, Etc,). You have to hear it to believe it, the difference is quite astonishing. Also, I noticed that the Nano tends to have distortion on songs which need some bass like Dance, house, and hip hop. It also tends to distort at high volumes with regular music. The EQ on the Nano works ok but I tried every setting and still could not get it close to sounding half as good as the Iriver. The Nano's sound quality is just good. If the quality of sound is not your top priority then I would say go with the Nano. If you already own an Iriver and are thinking to go the Ipod route you will be dissapointed if sound quality is most important to you. Its a shame b/c I would of liked to have 4 gigs capacity and I do like the software on the apple but I am too spoiled with the Irivers sound. I still give it 4 stars due to the fact that its so mall and looks really sexy. Software works flawlessy as well.

<Title>A great leap forward
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Without a doubt, iPod Nano is a big improvement from iPod Mini. I sold my Mini the day Nano came out. Here are my bullet point cons and pros  Obvious Pros (that everyone already knows) * Much smaller * Color screen. The screen is very bright and much more pleasurable to navigate around compared to Mini.  Not So Obvious Pros * Robust. Because Nano uses flash memory as opposed to hard drives in regular iPod or Mini, Nano is immune to shock. I dropped it from my shoulder height while playing, and the music played as usual. And there is nothing wrong afterward * Transfer speed. Again, because of the flash memory, Nano is able to transfer files 1.5x faster than Mini  Cons * Very vulnerable to scratch (especially the black version). I keep the protective plastic at the front, plus a self-made paper wrap to protect it. * Expensive accessories. Speaking of protective wrap, the currently available ones are way overpriced. That is why it led me to make one from paper myself. * Incompatible accessories with Mini. Because of the removal of the extra hole near the head phone plug, many Mini accessories are incompatible with Nano. One noticeable one is Griffin iTrip (the FM transmitter). I guess accessory manufacturers will come up with more Nano accessories over time. * Slightly shorter battery life than Mini. 14 hours v.s. 18 hours (official numbers). However, I have no problem with that 4 hours difference.  I like it a lot, but I have to give it a 4 stars for all the cons. I suggest you buy the 4 GB version instead of the 2 GB. For extra $50 you get twice as much the space. And if you plan to bring it when you travel, and you don't have/want to bring your laptop, then you better buy an AC converter for recharging, as it is not included in the box.

<Title>Cool Design, Mediocre Sound, Scratches Easily
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Nano definitely has plenty of cool factor.  The portability, convenience and style are excellent.  Has a very cool "name that tune" game which takes clips from your database of songs and samples them.    However, the sound quality is mediocre at best.  The Nano must have a small amplifier because the deep bass is lacking, and the mid-bass is distorted at all levels.  The amp "clips" which leads to bass that is truncated and harsh.  Even the shuffle has better bass than the Nano.  This may not be an issue for most people, but I have long been an audiophile and expect better quality sound.  Additionally, there is the scratch factor, so if you get the Nano, expect it to age quickly.  Nonetheless, I am going to keep mine, as I bought it for convenience and portability.  When I want to really listen to the music, I will listen to my home system.

<Title>Normal use scuffs, but nothing that hinders its wonderful functionality
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The nano is not features heavy since it was designed for frequent use of its key function, which is playing music.  In that respect, I've found everything about the nano to be designed for greatest convenience.  I own an older player with a radio and voice recorder, which I thought would be really cool, but I never use those features with any frequency for them to be worth it.  Initially I was annoyed that I couldn't nest folders/playlists, but I realized that the automatic iPod categories such as Artist and Album are a much better idea since it is easier to scroll through long lists with the excellent and responsive clickwheel than it would be to scroll and click through various nested folders.  More importantly, the clickwheel is the only design I've seen that allows the user to access every feature without changing hand position or using two hands.  The simple design also minimizes the need to feel out which button to press.  It is, however, a bit easy to accidentally turn up the volume, so using the hold button is not really optional.  The LCD is beautiful, though sometimes I wish I could adjust the backlight brightness to conserve battery, since the default setting seems to be an 'under direct sunlight' setting that is almost like a flashlight in complete darkness.  I just adjusted the backlight timer to the shortest possible, so it is not a big deal.  Battery life is around 7 hours for me (with frequent skipping and volume adjustment), which is good enough considering it is a lithium ion rechargeable.  I have not found the charge to be long at all.  The first charge was less than 3 hours and subsequent "fill 'er up" charges (the battery is usually halfway drained) have been only a hour or so.  At any rate, my computer is always on at some point during the day and it's a simple matter of remembering to plug the iPod in while I'm on the computer.  If I go on a trip, I always take CDs and a CD player just in case I end up purchasing a CD on the trip and want to hear it, so I haven't felt the need for the power adaptor.  Uploading music has also not taken as long as I feared it would.  Ripping tracks into the format I wanted was the real time-consuming part, but uploading to the iPod took only a few minutes (for the 4GB model).  The only explanation I can think of for the long charges and uploads is that possibly the USB port on the computer being used is USB 1.0 instead of USB 2.0, which is the optimal speed for the nano.  I use the iPod primarily as a temporary high-quality repository for songs that I feel like listening to at the moment and I change the playlists pretty often, so maybe I don't mind the frequent computer connection as much as some others.  If I were to really nitpick, the nano isn't my ideal player, but there are no ideal players on the market, and for a flash player of its design, storage capacity and physical size, it's well worth it, especially considering that the customer support for other players seems non existant.  I read many reviews before purchasing my nano and the other choices seemed far riskier, what with short warranties, easily broken parts, unpredictable touchpad sensitivity, and software/firmware craziness.  I've used iTunes on PC as well as Mac, and it's never given me any trouble.  It's true that there are things that you can't change about it - like appearance - but I haven't encountered another music playing software with search (this is why mp3s need to have info entered) and sharing functions that are as convenient and powerful.  Furthermore, at least you can uninstall iTunes on a PC, which is more than I can say for WMP on a Mac.  Again, iTunes is not perfect, but I'm not so stubborn that I can't adjust.  As for the scratching issue, it sounds like people are looking to buy a piece of jewelry, not a music player.  I have a black nano, and yes, there are very slight scuff marks on it, but that's what you would expect from normal use for any piece of plastic.  Functionality isn't affected in any way, and that's the real reason to buy this player.  Personally I like to carry mine in a coat or a shirt pocket, where there isn't as much movement and wear as a pants pocket.  I'm not sure why people expect Apple to refund or replace their dropped nanos.  The manual for any electronic device will state dropping it is a disaster and not covered under warranty.  You cannot drop a product you're not supposed to drop and expect the company to accept responsibility.  It's unreasonable to expect the sort of treatment people seem to be demanding.  Apple has been very accomodating so far and in general their customer service is far better than that of most other large corporations.  Let's not kid ourselves; $250 is a lot, but in the consumer electronics market, it's hardly high-end.  If you suspect the nano will be too small and fragile for you, or if you've dropped other portables before, simply do not buy one.  The nano was meant to be small, not rugged.

<Title>One of the worst electronics you wont want to buy
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an IPOD Nano 4GB a few days ago from Amazon and after it got delivered, I couldnt bear it for more than 2 days and sent it back for a refund.  This is one of the worst music electronic items anyone can think of buying.  The ear bugs are extremely bad. Sound quality that comes from these headphones is extremely bad. The volume doesnt go high enough. Which means you really can not rely on this and will have to buy your own separate headphones.  Next, the organization of files on the IPod Nano is extremely bad. First of all, you can no longer just copy paste items from your computer and paste them into the disck of IPod. For any single write onto IPod you have to use itunes. Apple has tried to make sure everyone uses itunes as they want people to use their product. They do not realize how ugly the itunes is.  It doesnt matter if you want to put or delete files from the ipod, you always have to use itunes. You can not just browse the IPOD folder (as a usb drive) and delete or add files (songs or pictures) there.  The equalizer settings are bad and there is no dramatic effect in the sounds when you change the EQ. Apple has done no effort to improve quality.  All the song files need to be in ONLY one format. Either you choose mp3 or aac. itunes will then create a copy of your songs into that format and burn that onto ipod. This results in multiple copies of the same song on your computer and is highly annoying.  You can noway organize the files on the ipod the way you desire. It is not possible to create custom folder structure and store files in your folder structure. For eg. you wont be able to create custom folders like of any name of ur choice, say "John's Favorites" or "My secrets". Ipod creates its own folder structure based on the song's genre, artist, or album.  The screen is super small and has a very bad resolution. If you try to see pictures on it, they look ugly. Any cellphone has a better resolution and quality than a Nano.  Further you can not play video.  It comes in a box with no printed manual. You have to install a software to find the manual. Further that manual is just a .pdf file and is not specific to the Nano and talks about using Apple IPODs in general. I am a computer professional and I found the user interface of the nano extremely ugly and non-user friendly.  I would not recommend anyone to buy the nano. This is a very useless product. I would say it is just like a stupid ipod shuttle and shouldnt be priced for over 100 bucks.  I will never be buying any IPods again. I would say try the Toshiba, Sony or HP music players.  I believe it looks cool but thats it. It has nothing else but good looks. Usability is very poor. Anyone who uses an Ipod in front of me looks like a fool to me.

<Title>best ipod yet !!!!!!
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start off by saying that the only reason i gave this 4 stars is that ist does not include necessary things like a wall charger adapter. I have been through all the ipods that apple has released, and let me tell you, this is the best one. It is slim and stylish, and with 4 gigs  of space a real stunner being so small. Sound quality is great since it has a flash drive and it doesn't skip around either. Don't forget that it also includes a nice velvety free case. And don't listen to all those people saying it breaks to easily...i have had mine for a while, and as long as you don't rough around with it it probably won't break. However it dos scrach easily so i suggest keeping on the plasticy cover that comes with it because it works just fine and at the same time protects the ipod. If you are looking to buy an ipod for he first time or are just upgrading get this one!!!!

<Title>love my 4GB iPod nano
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've only had it for three days but we're already inseparable. Why four stars then?    The Good: The best thing about the iPod nano is the tiny size and the ease of use. The click wheel - a wonderfully responsive, touch-sensitive feature, allows you to scroll thru menus, songs, and change the volume all with the thumb of one hand while cradling it in the palm. The menus are all fairly intuitive too so you can figure this thing out right out of the box. Even if you can't it does come with a quick start booklet to guide you. You'll also want to check out the sixty-odd page features guide that's included on the CDROM this ipod comes with.  The Bad: The headphones it comes with are terrible -uncomfortably hard for one thing, and the large rounds were clearly not designed to fit easily in the average human's ears. They wouldn't go in even if forced, and my ears aren't particularly small. Luckily I have Sony earbuds that provide far superior comfort and sound quality. Also, my nano is black and the provided headphones are white. Eek! That's the high-tech equivalent of wearing white shoes with black stockings.  (You'll find that a lot, if not all, of the ipod accessories are also white, like the tiny USB Power adaptor you might find yourself wanting if you go on vacation, etc. and aren't dragging your computer with you, and you want to recharge your iPod's batteries by just plugging it into a wall).  Another reason for deducting a star - batteries drain out quickly if you play a game while listening to music (probably because the backlight has to stay on constantly or you can't see what you're playing; this is a huge drain on power).  When I'm just playing songs and not doing anything else,  the battery icon reflects a full charge far longer than if I'm multi-tasking with it, so it might be true that you can get 14 hours (just playing music) as Apple claims before having to recharge.    As a lot of people know by now, certain stuff you'd want to come with the iPod doesn't, like the USB wall charger, and Apple charges thirty bucks for that! That's another reason for a missing star.  The Stuff You Should Know: Some tips for preserving battery life are available on apple.com but I will just include them here so you don't have to hunt this down.  Set the backlight to go off after no longer than ten seconds   Turn the equalizer (EQ) to "flat" to override any EQ settings you made in iTunes (for some reason this is also a drain on batteries)   Make playlists in iTunes before downloading songs to your iPod (it's especially nice to have pre-organized playlists when you're stuck on a plane, etc. as you will save yourself the need to constantly use the fast forward button to skip around and search for songs, which is another big drain on power). You can also just scroll through your library without fast forwarding, as songs are fairly easy to find. But playlists just make life easier.  Consider compressing audio files before downloading them. You can find out about that on apple.com and search on iPod and iTunes support. If, like me, you already have a library full of audio files over the suggested maximum of 9MB, I am not sure what you can do about that!  All in all, it's a great thing to have. I plan to expand on this with a Bose iPod sound dock and get the most out of my nano that I possibly can.

<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great mp3 player, incredibly small and unlike some people have said, this thing is extremely durable, I've stepped on it, dropped it, sat on it, and it still looks brand new.  The only thing I will say though is get the white version, I had the black version but it was just ugly to look at, fingerprints, dust, and scratches are too visible on the black ipod, on the white one however you cant see any sratches or fingerprints unless you really want to and hold it at an angle or something, it's just more pleasant to look at your ipod and not see a bunch of fingerprints and blemishes.

<Content>Pros: + Impressive design. Simple and very elegant. + Good support and integration from 3rd party.  Cons: - Poor battery life. The UP TO 14 hours is realisticly 8 hours for new batteries. (Lets hope the battery last for a least a year) - Locked to iTunes. No every machine has iTunes installed. - One-way sync means no backing up your music. - Easily scratches. - Overpriced accessories. - No radio. - No recording. - Restrictive file format support. - OPTIONAL charger!!! For the price, who are we kidding.  IMO, the Nano is not worth its value. Apple should be very proud of the campaigning job they've done with the Ipod.

<Content>This is truly my first bad experience with an apple product. Out of the box this puppy works great- however as soon as the ipod software updates the software on the unit- its dead in the water. Windows can't find it- and itunes won't run it. This happens with the june 28, 2006 update- and it happened on TWO different ipod nanos (returned the first one thinking it might have been defective) and it happened on TWO different computers. Support from Apple was non existant, and a tech support actually hung up on me because they were closing. Until Apple sorts out the bugs- avoid this device. A truly disappointing experience.

Other than that, easy to use, easy to figure out.  Oh, one minor annoyance, you have to constantly flip the "hold" switch to keep your ipod from randomly changing songs/settings (the wheel is very sensitive), and then switch it again when you do want to change a song etc.  Otherwise Love It!!

<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I reviewed this ipod nano black a while ago and i just want to say that the people that hate this because of the scratches just shouldn't buy it. It is made of the same material as the 30/60 gb ipod video black. It has nothing to do with the size. It is really hard to find a case for this right now but they will come in two weeks. A way of taking off scratches is using a bit of brasso. Brassol is a liquid that gets rid of scratches on plastic materials such as ipods. Works extremely well with the black version. It costs four dollars at any store such as home depot. Use a bit of it will cotton or iklear (anything u want that is soft) and keep ur hand on it for around twenty minutes. (...) Use it once because it could probably leave blemishes after around the fourth time. Just think of it as a second chance to keep ur ipod in store bought condition. After you've done this, keep the ipod safe until u get a case. The ipod nano is an amazing piece of technology and you shouldn't complain about the scratches when there is so many ways of getting rid of them (toothpaste even, doesnt get rid of all the scratches). Good luck and don't complain lol.

<Title>ALWAYS use Amazon!  Bad Apple of the bunch quickly replaced...
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I placed an order for the White Nano on Amazon.  When it arrived I could not properly install the device on my PC.  I received several "file is corrupt" messages.  Throughout the many installation attempts the nano kept powering on and off.  I gave in and called Apple Support; I was stunned to find out that nano owners are only 'allowed' one free support phone call- that's definitely a sour apple.  I was walked through the installation process and the nano seemed to be behaving itself.  After charging and transferring songs over to the iPod I disconnected it and headed out.  *The nano was defective-music would play for somewhere between 14seconds-to 60seconds then power off!!    Much swearing and several temper fits later I called Amazon.  I did not want to call Apple again as I have read several times that all replacements from Apple are formerly defective iPods that have been refurbished; for my $250 bucks I didn't want to inherit someone else's CrApple!  Amazon cheerfully agreed to send me a replacement(black nano-white was not available for 1-2 weeks) at no additional charge, and even refunded my original shipping that I paid. Best part is, I received the replacement THE NEXT DAY...  Replacement works flawlessly, iTunes and iPod work together seamlessly.  There has been much chatter about scratches, I've left the original plastic film on it and have had no problems-even the metal back has not scratched.    I will definitely continue to use Amazon..

As a simple IPOD it is not a bad device, but with a screen to small to really see pictures (and I have VERY good eyes) and with memory gone it is not as good a value as the discontinued Mini.  still it is an ipod and you get all the advantages of it, but for my money I'd go with a used mini.

<Title>Hip and cool and fun, but sound quality is secondary
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a 4GB Nano because I wanted a flash player I could use while exercising, but that's not the only reason.  I also was curious about why the iPod in its various permutations has become such a cultural phenomenon.  I'm an older guy who can remember when the only "portable player" was a small Japanese transistor radio, so I've seen a lot of changes in audio technology during my lifetime.  The original Sony cassette Walkman was revolutionary in its day; the first portable cd players, with their virtually nonexistent antiskip functions, were considered a marvel. We've come a long way, baby.  For years now I've been content to use a good-quality portable cd player for my on-the-go music, along with Etymotic ER-4P canalphones, a tiny, twin earplug-like device that makes the headphones packaged with any commercial portable seem laughable by comparison.  In the past few years, however, I have watched as the "iPod revolution" totally transformed the world of tiny audio, to the point where it's now virtually impossible to find a portable cd player with good sound quality. Portable digital players rule!  So I decided, what the hey, I'll give this new technology a try! I bought my Nano, along with a small leatherette case to ward off the apparently inevitable scratches this player suffers if you don't cover it up with something protective.  Proving that you can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, I quickly learned how to use the iTunes software, and I began loading my cd's onto my computer hard drive and, in turn, into my Nano's flash memory.    Two weeks into this Brave New World of Nano, my verdict is mostly positive, but definitely mixed.  First of all, this thing is, indeed, FUN.  Having a tiny, card-like device packed with hundreds of songs (or classical "movements") induces a definite feeling of power and control.  At your fingertips!  The fact that you can create "playlists," add or remove music quickly using the  provided USB connection cord, and adjust the EQ with a just a few touches of the "clickwheel," induces near-giddiness sometimes. The battery life is impressive; it's not the 14 hours Apple claims, but it's lengthy enough that one seldom has to worry about the battery running down unexpectedly.   I haven't loaded any digital photos, podcasts or audiobooks, but hey, I feel good knowing that I can!  So indeed, I think I understand why people are so smitten with this little gem of a device.  HOWEVER--the news isn't all good, and the most significant "bad news" involves what I consider to be the bottom line for any device that plays music, i.e., the sound quality. Most people "rip" and encode their music either as Mp3 or AAC files.  By eliminating what is considered "less important" music information, these compression systems allow digitized versions of musical files to be far smaller than the full versions represented most commonly by WAV files.  It's through the use of file compression that one can fit the advertised "1000 songs" on a 4GB Nano.  Although some fans of compressed formats swear that no human being can tell the difference between compressed and uncompressed musical formats, don't believe it.  The old saying, "there's no such thing as a free lunch" definitely applies here. Fortunately, you can choose to eschew file compression by navigating into the iTunes software and selecting to encode music using "Apple lossless format." All iPod owners actually should do this at least once, encoding the same song using both AAC and "lossless" technology, so that they can discern whether the difference is significant to them.  To me, it is, so for much of my music I have chosen to use the "lossless" format, meaning that I don't get nearly as many minutes of music on my Nano as I would have using AAC.  But the fact is that even using "lossless" format, the sound quality is not quite equal to that exhibited by even a fairly inexpensive portable cd player. I'm probably nitpicking here, but prospective buyers of this device should know that one is, in fact, trading audio quality for small size, convenience, and design "cool."  Caveat Emptor.  Two more points regarding sound quality: first, those distinctive white earbuds that are packaged with the player are not bad by  "included in the box" standards, but their rendition of sound is mediocre.  Anyone who really cares about sound quality should save up to buy a better set of earphones.  If you truly care about sound, bite the bullet and buy some Ultimate Ears Super fi 5 Pro in-ear monitors (they apparently were engineered with the iPods in mind) or a pair of the new Shure earbuds that are also excellent.  These will seem incredibly expensive, but if you listen to a lot of music, it's an investment that definitely will prove worthwhile over a period of several years.  Second, keep in mind that the software/firmware that drive the iPods has limitations that some users will find irritating. Yes, I'm an Old Guy, but over the years I've developed an affection for certain kinds of electronic, nonstop dj mixes of dance music, the kind in which one song blends seamlessly into another. I also still listen to the Grateful Dead, well known for their ability to segue from one tune to the next.  And keep in mind that even some more mainstream "pop" artists, including the Beatles, have utilized the nonstop blending of tracks in their albums.  Well, the iPod can't handle nonstop. It invariably inserts a small gap in between tracks, even if one is not intended.  You can minimize this using the "crossover playback" function, but this really is not a satisfactory solution.  You also can record cd's as one joined track, but then you lose the iPod's celebrated display of individual track names.  In fairness, this is an issue that seems universal among digital players (with the exception of the now-discontinued Rio Karma 20 gb player).  But until Apple comes up with a firmware upgrade that addresses this issue, the lack of "gapless playback" will continue to indicate that in some ways the new, hip digital players actually represent a movement backward in sound reproduction technology.  Overall, the victory of tiny digital players over previous formats, including CD, represents the triumph of convenience and cool, with sound quality apparently emerging as a secondary consideration for nearly all buyers. So I confess: there's a part of me that's bothered by the fact that in today's world, style, image, cool, and technology-as-fashion-accessory has become more important than actual sound quality in the marketing success of portable audio devices.  I know, I'm a curmudgeon; I can't help it.  To conclude: on balance, I like my Nano, and I use it almost every day.  When I want to hear music as it was intended to be heard, however, I use my old iRiver SlimX cd portable (no longer made).

<Title>Very Delicate MP3 Device that is way cool
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This device is fantastic.  It holds a ton of music... 1000 songs is quite enough room to enjoy a whole genre of music (and I have +10k Mp3's)... it is very sleek in design, and quite small, and nano like...  so a quick Pro and Con:  Pro:  1.  Small.  This is great to throw into your pocket (but put in a case!)  2.  Menu's on the Nano are really easy to use, and has a lot of options that are not useless... calander is nice.. as well as the clock.. but the most attractive is the ease of use for getting to your music.   A slow monkey could figure this one out.  3.  Good/Great sound.  This device has good pump to it.  Not much else to say other than that...  4.  Battery... well, this is a pro and a con... the battery is adverted as something like 18 hours.  There is no way you can get even close to that.  I get like 6 hours top.  And, even though apple once again lied about the battery life (I have owned four other Ipods of which never made any of their adverted battery lives) 6 hours is still very good amount.  -what gets me is this... I can't figure out why it is that the nano doesn't get 18 hours.. I mean, there is no moving parts... the screen is nice, but it isn't that super bright.. and it is small... hmmm.  5.  Flash memory.  I have always... always.. been a major fan of flash memory ever since I first read about it a couple of years ago.  This has made the nano a big time operator in the field of Mp3's.   6.  It looks great.  Why do all the other Mp3 players look like they were made in a 198o's communist country?  They are way ugly.  WAY WAY UGLY.  Matter of fact, apple is not all that great in the internal design or ruggedness of thier iPods.. I have replaced 3 of the four I have bought.. so they stinko when it comes to durability - but they look so much nicer than the way ugly stuff offered by Dell, or any of the other ones (creatives stuff is just missing a gene)... Sony is supposed to have a model out using flash, but have not seen it yet.. lets hope they can construct something that is not just way ugly.  So, apple whups up on the competition in many areas, but one area is the appearance of the product... Who wants to spend 200 dollars on something that looks like S$$T??  Not me.  And apparently not millions of other people.  Cons.    1.  Battery, see what I wrote above.  Like I said earlier, it is enough battery for me at 6. hours.....  but it would have been nice if it would have got close to the adverted battery life ...  2.  It is prone to scratchness and difficult fingerprinting.  But, having read about that, I bought a case... and the fingerprints are hard to remove.. which is annoying... materials could have been better chosen I think...   3.  I think the usb could have been  used better.  Not crazy about the hook up at the bottom of the nano.. why not just regular USB hook up, instead of this crazy wide thing?  Silly.  The Hook up on the shuffle is superior to this.  but o well.  Overall a great device, but not five star.  I like it a lot, and when I get through with it, I will most likely toss it in the bin and get another.  UPDATE**************  I bought the case/skins from Apple.  They came in a case of five, and I picked out the lime green one to put on.  It was skin SKIN SKIN tight.  Very hard to get on, but once it was on, it was very sleek.  Actually, when you show someone the nano, you will have to tell them that the case is already on, it is that tight.  And, it is rubberish... and grabs the hand when you touch it.. very good to keep it from slipping out of your hand, etc... when moving.  I really REALLY recommend these cases, due to them protecting it, and over all 'cool' factor.  I place mine in my pocket and have had no issues with the case on it.  ++++++++++++Another UPDATE ++++++++++++  I liked the apple skins, they were nice... but my wife went out at christmas and bought me and INCASE case for my ipod, and it is vastly superior to any case I have had for any of my iPods, and I have had four of them.  So, do yourself a favor, and protect your iPod with Incase cases.  They are under 30 dollars and are made of leather and are quite rugged.  Have had mine since Xmas o5 and it is March o6 now, and no signs of wear as of yet.  Quite good.  Have fun

<Title>Do you have any advice for me?
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have never owned an IPOD (the system forced me to rate it, to submit this)- but am more than ready now.  But, I can't decide between the nano and the video.  I will not use it for video or photos - just music and primarily at the gym and on the airplane.  The nano's size really appeals to me, but I am wondering about storage size - will I regret buying an IPOD with only 4GB vs. 30 GB?  Any thoughts?  Any other advice on accessories?

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a bit dubious about buying a product from Apple, since an apple computer my sister owned crashed twice, even after extensive bug searching. However, I was pleasently surprised at the quality of the product. However, I give it only four stars for only a couple of reasons. First, the directions weren't as clear a I hoped them to be. I hooked up the iPod before installing the iPod software. Big no-no. IT gave my computer a massive system error-which fixed itself thank god- and I had to wait for six hours for the battery to run down before I could get it to work. A sticker on the inside saying something like "WARNING! CONNECTING THE NANO TO YOUR COMPUTER WILL GIVE YOUR COMPUTER A SYSTEM ERROR AND POSSIBLY MAKE YOU GO INSANE" That'd be great. But, aside from that and a few small tics over the durability of the iPod, I loved the little gizmo to death.  When I opened the little box with the nano inside, the nano was so thin-because it was slightly sunk in to the case-that I thought it was a picture of the nono, to whet my apppetite for tech. Apple isn't lying. It is actually slightly SMALLER than a number two pencil in width. Because it's so small, you don't even have to buy an armband for it. Just stick it through a belt buckle and it's snug and tight.   You can waste away hours listening to music, viewing photo slide shows(on a side note, I still haven't figured out how to get photos onto the thing)and playing the incredibly addictive games. And with 14 hours of battery life, this thing just keeps going and going.  The screen is excellent as well. Though it is small-only 1.5 inches diagonally-it's bright, colorful, vid and the image on it jumps out at you.   And again, this machine is simply beautiful. Although tiny, it still packs a wallop and is definitely worth the rather large price.

<Content>I bought a iPod Nano two months ago, and it suddenly stopped working.  However, unlike my other portable electronics and cell phones that I have dropped numerous times over multiple years, m iPod had never even been dropped.  However, when I took it to the Apple store, they said that they refused to do anything about it but told me that I could get 10% off a replacement product.  I strongly recommend avoiding this product.

<Title>The (near) Perfect Sound Machine
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The first review I saw on this site was disappointingly unrealistic. It stated the black Nano iPod scratches easily. I've owned one since they came out, and any scratches I've acquired were justly deserved by my throwing it in with PowerBook security cables and firewire cables in my backpack. I've read that some LIMITED number of the Nano's did have some extra vulnerability to scratching, but Apple has been replacing them, and no more are manufactured. Now to the real praise:  This thing is a monster! I love it, I've never heard such good music while carrying so little weight. It is magnificent! I can easily put it in my shirt pocket while still having a Palm there and several pens. It's display is beautiful, it doesn't take time to warm up like the disk based iPods, it's great, get one!

<Content>So far this is a big improvement over the mini. It is much smaller but the display has more info and is clearer. It tells you whether you are in shuffle mode or regular and it also tells the album of the song that is playing. No real complaints. One minor annoyance, Apple includes a case in the package that is totally useless.

<Title>Battery time wrong
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my Nano, but do not expect to every get 10 to 12 hours of running time.  If you turn off EQ and turn off the backlight the most you can expect is 7 hours.  When Apple talks about this kind of playtime they means you never turn the machine off instead put it on play until it runs down in 12 or 14 hours.  When you turn off your machine and put it back on, rewind the machine or shuffle it the battery goes downhill. There is no truth in advertising.  However, with this said the machine is a delight, the sound is clear and I would not trade it.  I keep a  clear cover over the screen to protect it from scratching.  I hope this helps.  Don't send the machine back when you only get 7 hours.

<Content>I have a 20GB 4G Ipod an dgot this Nano for my wife's birthday. I short words: I WANT TO KEEP IT. Its the ultimate portable tool for your music. We have it set up for workout and roadtrip mixes only and it works fantastic.  This little toy is somewhat fragile so DO GET PROTECTION FOR IT. I got the apple leather case for it and so far no complaints.  The Nano is also great for working out and running outdoors. I used to work out with my bulky white one, this one is sleek, light and hardly noticeable.  if you are a gym and sport junkie GET THE NIKE ARMBAND. This is the best armband out there, its made of Nike's dri fit cloth and machine washable!!! Best of all, fits tight around your arm. Good work apple... give us more!!

<Title>Nifty Nano Gadget
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I admit, I like gadgets. Most guys do. I ordered my 4GB Black iPod Nano directly from Apple - because they offer free personalized laser engraving and free shipping. Also, I got $20 off the price by using the educational discount. Search for it on the Apple site - it's not real obvious at first but it could save you a few bucks. I don't even rememeber if I had to enter my student ID number. I heard you can ask for the educational discount at the Apple stores as well.  I placed my order and tracked my iPod Nano all the way from Shenzen China to California (only 3 days). First impression: The packaging is top notch, matt black with a foil embossed Apple logo. The iPod box feels like you just bought something of value. In the box is the iPod Nano - very small and recessed in its own little cubby, an iPod dock/USB cable, a dock adapter (more on this later), a CD with iTunes on it, manual, and a pair of small earphones with two pair of foam earbud covers. Oh, also in the box are two white Apple stickers - I guess so you can stick it on your car and help advertise for Apple.  Bad news first: You'll get a little frustrated with the foam ear bud covers - they aren't exactly easy to slip on no matter how nimble your fingers are. As stated in other reviews - you will notice that the Nano is very prone to small surface scratches. Also the polished back is very hard to keep clean and free of fingerprints. As I wiped my Nano with an eyeglass cloth - I made small scratches on the display window. Can't get softer than an eyeglass cloth. Another minor gripe is that I ordered a black iPod Nano - the cable and earbuds are white, as is the dock adapter. My major gripe - according to the Apple web site - you have to send your iPod Nano back to Apple to have the battery replaced. Maybe in as little as two years. We'll see if its worth the $50-$60 charge. Another minor gripe is that there are not many accessories (holders, cases, etc.) for the Nano yet. Hopefully that will change.   All that aside, this is a nice, cool gadget. VERY small and easy to use. If you have friends, they will be impressed. Its not obvious, but you need to depress any button on the click wheel to turn the Nano on. You hold the Play button down for several seconds to turn it off. The screen is in color and easy to read. I was already a long-time user of iTunes and think its the best player out there. I DJ on occasion and have over 250GB of music in MP3/MP4 format. I plugged my Nano into my computers USB port and did a drag and drop of all the songs I wanted. I left it plugged in for 4 hours to charge the battery for the first time. Some people will say that 4GB is too small - but 4GB is enough to hold around 2.5 days worth of continuous music without ever repeating a song. I don't want to carry all my music with me - if that were the case then I would carry around my neck my 300GB external hard drive! :-)  The sound qualitiy is really good for such a small device. Even the small earbuds that were included sound pretty good. Plenty of volume and bass. It will take a minute to get used to the click-wheel - it's pretty sensitive. There is a Hold switch on the top of the iPod that will disable the click wheel. You'll use it - since just dropping the iPod into your shirt pocket will change the volume.  Surprisingly, there are games on the Nano - Solitaire, Parachute, and even a Name-That-Tune game. It uses your own music and plays a short clip of a song. You select the name of the song from a list as you try to beat the clock. Also included is a stopwatch, calendar, and photo viewer.   So far I'm impressed with the iPod Nano. I also just purchased an iPod hard-wired adapter for my car. I also purchased the Universal Docking Station for the iPod (then I will be able to use the dock station adapter that came with the iPod Nano). The Universal Dock has an infrared eye on the face of it and is compatible with the Apple remote control. I will hard-wire the docking station into my Mercedes and then I'll be able to control my iPod Nano via remote control. The iPod will also charge while I drive. The docking station is compatable with the whole iPod line with a docking connector. So if I decide to change to a larger iPod, it should work in my vehicle.  Hope this helped. -g

<Title>So it scratches, I'll live
<Date>Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a first time iPod owner, i am obviously thrilled.  I've owned other mp3 players, and nothing i've seen compares to the almighty iPod.  I got this little guy for my birthday, and you couldn't pry it from my hands with the jaws of life.  The sound quality is fantastic, the colors on the (somewhat small but definitely bearable) screen are vivid, and the storage capacity is just right for me.  That being said, there are a few glitches.                                                                                                                           First, the obvious:  We've all heard about how easily the damn thing scratches.  At first I was bummed, but my skin is on the way so problem solved.  The screen hasn't cracked or fallen out, and the shiny metal back will inevitably grow dull over time.                                                               The only problem i've had with the actual functionality of the nano is skipping; If i try to rate a song in the first few seconds of play, the thing goes crazy.  It's also frozen four or five times in the two days i've had it (this might have something to do with the fact that i've been home sick and have therefore been fiddling with it nonstop, literally).                                                                                                                          Overall, I'm hooked.  It's the best mp3 player i've personally owned (quality wise), so honestly people, can't you live with a few scratches?

<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Ipod Nano is a dream come true for people who appreciate new technology and enjoy listening to unlimited music along with interactive photo features without limitations.  Key Features -	Music (1000 songs) -	Photos (25,000), Watch slideshow with Music -	Organize Music (Playlists, Album, Artist, Rating, Genre etc etc) -	Album Art -	World Clock -	Games -	Synochrize contacts, calendars -	Stopwatch -	Screenlock  It's only been 3 days since I have bought the Ipod Nano 4gb in black and believe me when I first bought it, I was extremely impressed by it's very sleek and small packaging, which says a lot about any product in this day and age. When I opened it I was even more shocked and surprised like most people, of how small and slim the Ipod Nano was. It was unbelievable and I was thrilled to own such a smart item with excellent functions and performance.  I did my research before buying this product and a lot of people said that it is easily scratched but it still didn't put me off from buying it because I wanted to buy it ages ago but due to high demand, it was always out of stock when I wanted it. Therefore, when I bought it, I also purchased a rubber protective sleeve to prevent any scratches. I put the sleeve on right away on top of the cellophine protector on the front of the Ipod to ensure that it stays good as new, at least for 6 months...Lol  I have never bought or used an Apple product and this was my 1st and I found that the Ipod Nano is very user friendly because it only took someone like me 5mins to install the software provided and transfer my music collection immediately, thanks to the simple instruction guide sheet. All products should be like this SHORT, SIMPLE & PRECISE when it comes to User Guides!  Previously, I have been using the 256mb Creative mp3 player, which only held around 40 odd tracks so I purchased the ARCHOS media player a few months ago for 15, because I have always wanted to store my favorite CD collection and playlists on to one single device. But although it had all the capabilities of storing music, photos and video recordings, I found that I never seem to use it often because even though its meant to be a pocket video recorder, it still feels too BIG to carry around everywhere, especially for listening to music! There are far too many bundles of wires in the process of recording and transferring music, videos and photos with the Archos. I have hardly used it and I am hoping to sell it soon because I am extremely happy and satisfied with the Ipod Nano because I have now stored my favorite CD collection and Playlists in one sleek and small device, which I can now take with me wherever I want. This just shows that the quality of a product doesn't always mean it's good if you pay a high price!!!!  Although I prefer transferring my music through DRAG & DROP, I don't really think the iTunes software with the Ipod Nano is bad at all compared to what people have said about it. I think it is very easy to organize your music collection in a few simple steps and I think it is very creative for people who want to arrange their music to their own requirements. But it would have been nice if Apple had also enabled the DRAG & DROP feature for music...!  Overall, I don't normally write reviews online but the Ipod Nano has made me very happy and I thought it deserved a review because it is one of those items that tempt you to tell the world about it. It has got several features which can keep you occupied whenever you're bored!!!! I can't imagine anyone buying this product and regretting it, it is truly the NO.1 GIFT of the year and future, especially at a reasonable price of 79.00! You definitely can't go wrong for what you're getting in return....!!!!   I SIMPLY LOVE IT....!

<Title>There Is Simply NOTHING That Can Compare With This Gadget Guru's Dream Come True! The 4 GB Nano Is A Technological Wonder!
<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you're reading this review, you're likely preparing yourself to buy one of the COOLEST and Most Powerful electronic products ever to hit the market. It doesn't matter whether you've been familiar with Apple products since you were a child, or whether you're the kind of person that just likes to keep up with the very latest electronic marvels on the market-in either case you'll be extremely satisfied with your new iPOD.  I fell in love with it before I even made the purchase. I read the reviews and did as much research as possible and then waited for it to come on the market. It's truly one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's also a purchase where I feel I got a true "Bang For My Buck!"  Apple produced another wonder in the electronic marketplace. You might be buying this for yourself or thinking of buying it for someone that you Really, Really care about. Either way, you're making a purchase that you can feel mighty happy about and for a long time to come. If you're worried that you will not be able to keep up with the latest technology and want to wait for the next version-join the rest of us but please use this review to make you feel even better about buying your brand new Apple 4 GB iPOD Nano.  The Apple 4 Gigabyte iPOD Nano is pencil thin-like and it also happens to just "look good!" I wanted to write a very honest review that would hopefully help everyone, especially those that are "on the fence" and need just a little nudge from somone who understands technology and knows when he spots a great deal. It also happens to come from someone who never really cared for Apple computers, however I'd be crazy to let my computer preference get in the way of an awesome and affordable product-the Apple iPOD 4 GB Nano! I've grown to really appreciate Apple computers and the iPOD 4 GB Nano takes my relationship to a whole new level.  There is plenty of information available to you in regard to the specifications of the new iPOD. You can simply go to GOOGLE and find thousands of bits and pieces of information that will be helpful in making your purchase, but I think it's sometimes beneficial to hear from someone who HAS the product and wants to share his/her own personal experience with it. Please remember to always take all the time you need to make your purchase, whether it is for yourself or if you're purchasing it as a gift. I just can't imagine how excited someone would be to open a package and find an APPLE iPOD 4 GB Nano wrapped inside the bubble packaging!  You'll learn all about the 1000 Songs it can store and play, along with it's ability to play a musical slideshow with up to 25,000 photos! Doesn't that ALONE sound incredible? It can store thousands of contact information and even act as a stopwatch or world clock. The display is beyond what I ever imagined in something this size. You'll soon learn that you can organize all of your music by several different categories. For example, mine has a category for easy listening music that I enjoy listening to and I can even separate the easy listening music by artist or album.  There are too many features to mention. As I'm trying to conclude this review I keep getting bombarded, in my mind, with additional features like the great games that are included. Can you believe that all of this techbology and great sound can fit into one product. Apple did a great job and I can't wait to finish this review so I can ride my bike and listen to my newly categorized music on my Brand New Apple 4 GB iPOD Nano.   Thanks for reading my review and for allowing me to try to give you some additional and helpful information-at least in part. I appreciate your time and would be happy to entertain any questions at my email address, HORSEPETE@aol.com.  Sincerely,  Pete Cannice Scottsdale, Arizona  (...)

<Content>Oh my god where have you been all my life. I haven't felt this way since the invention of the Sony Walkman back in 1980. The nano is simply amazing. Tiny, so simple to use even a caveman can do it. Holds so many cds it is mind boggling. Make sure you do get a sleeve protector of some type to keep it pristine. I got the one by Belkin with the arm band for jogging.

<Title>Just Great
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipod nano is a fantastic product. I've had it for over 6 months and it is still running perfectly the same as I've taken it out of the box. I have kept it in good condition, i.e. never dropped it, and also i still have the original plastic wrapper on, hehe. But I have a case for it so it doesn't bother me. Anyways back to the nano. What I like about it is the size and capacity, which is a perfect blend for a perfect product. I store around 800 songs at a time which is good for taking it on the street car or to school and even on out-of-town trips. Many people speculate in considering to get the ipod video where there really isn't a reason getting it unless you need the higher capacity or video playback. But heres the good part, the ipod nano does video too. Thats right, the IPOD NANO DOES VIDEO. All you have to do is do a simple installation of ipod linux which comes with a video player. I store on average two music videos including my 800 songs, or if I want to dump some songs out i would put a south park episode which looks great by the way on the nano.   Anyways, many people wonder about the ipod's durability, and I would say that it is strong enough to last a while, unless you are one of those types of people that through around their gadgets.   Pros:  - Color screen - Great capacity for such a small device - Extremely thin - Somewhat durable (don't believe all the haters out there) - Amazing GUI - Great synchronization software and speed - Never skips - Lasts as long as the other ipods (don't know about shuffle)  Cons:  - It does scratch easily - Video buffer automatically turns off the video every 13 or so minutes (but I guess that's linux's fault, not the nano)  Overall the ipod nano is a great product that I would recommend to anyone that wants the best in portable audio that is small, fast, user-friendly, and supercool! (sound like a real fanboy there :P)

<Content>oooooooh my gawsh this nano is SO cute. its so completely perfect--almost as if it was MADE for me. im a big music person, y'know, and the nano is small and short just like me. =P so i loove it! yes, so maybe they scratch easily. but PUH~LEEEEZE is a scratch gonna stop you from listening to your music? i didnt think so. i mean you DID get an iPod to listen to music. scratches dont defect your songs or change it in any way. i mean you wont be LOOKING at your pod so much as LISTENING to it. DUHHHHHHHHHHH! plus all u have to do is get a case if your that worried about it. i mean, you wont be able to see the scratch. i personally &lt;33 the socks bcuz its like 5 bucks for 6 little cute colored knit socks. but aaanyways. yeah, so, i definately deeeeeeefinately recommend nano's if you like cute small amazing lil gadgets. &lt;333333333

<Content>I recently purchased the Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Black and am very happy with this purchase. It met all of my expectations for the iPod. It has good battery life (about 3 hours), good organization of songs (by album, song, or artist), and is VERY transportable and compact. The only thing I don't like is that the black edition smudges easily, which is easily fixable with a case.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.

<Content>This is my first ipod and i love it so far. I don't know why i just did't buy this earlier. I went through 3 mp3 players, all creative players. DONT GET CREATIVE. All of them broke down on me in 2 months. On to the actual ipod now.     Pros: color screen photo viewing nice sleek design itunes is simple to use easy navagition cons smudges easily scarches easily  As you can see, this ipod is a perfect mp3 player for anyone> The reason i gave it four stars is because the scratching issue After 3 days of babying my ipod, it had like a million scratches. But then i got it a case and and everything went fine. I wish this thing came with a wall charger. It would make things easier. I'm not a fan of leaving on my computer on for three hours. But all in all this is a good player and i would reccomend it to any1. This thing hasnt failed me yet.

<Title>former Ipod Video owner, who now has the Nano
<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a 4 GB Black Ipod Nano. I love it. Don't get scared because it gets many scratches. I was aware of the complaints and I left the plastic covering on the Nano. The screen is just as clear as it is without the covering. I had an Video Ipod, but it died on me after 7 months. Although the video held more songs, the Nano did not have a hard drive. This is what made me buy the Nano; instead of another Video . In case you didn't know by now it has flash memory, so you don't have to worry about getting your hard drive ruined. For some odd reason I'm getting close to 14 hours on my Ipod, usually people are complaining about the battery life, but i'm happy with the battery life.  Both the Video and Nano have color screens, and they can also hold photos. They both have click wheels.  Advantages with Video - Hold more songs  (30 & 60 GB) - Duh.......... plays videos & movies  Disadvanges with video - lighter than the older generation of Ipods, but much heavier than the Nano - Hard Drive ( I can be very clumsy) - movies  can drain the battery drastically ( what's the point of having your Harry Potter movies on it if you can't catch all of it on one charge) - scratches ( I had to learn the hard way. I left the plastic cover the Nano and I don't have to worry about scratches)   Adavantages with Nano  - far from the weight of the video - duh........ very small - flash memory   Disadvatages with Nano - can only hold up to 4 GB (1000 songs) (Despite some people, most of us don't even need all the memory) - no video playback ( Who wants to look at movie on that small screen, anyway) - I happy with my battery life but......... if you don't look at any movies or videos on the Video, you'll have the same battery life as the nano. ( I would expect since the Nano is smaller it would have better battery life than the Video, not exactly) - scratches ( Even though I learn my lesson with the Video and I left the plastic cover on,  I know people have this problem)  Overall I prefer the Nano mainly because of the flash memory, not the size. If Apple would create a Nano (1,2,4 GB) that can hold as much songs as the Video (30 & 60 GB) then I would be first in line at Walmart at 3 AM  Thank you for reading my review.

<Title>good but not perfect
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received a 4gb black Nano as a gift (from my boss - how cool is that?). I like it a lot, but my disappointment with its flaws would be a lot stronger if I'd shelled out $250 for it.  The good points we all know about: tiny, light, superb UI, good capacity, good sound, "cool factor". And, uh, you can install Linux on it.  :D  There are bad points, however, and for me some of them are significant. (I switched over from an iPod Shuffle 1gb and am using the same (Phillips noise-canceling) headphones, which makes for a pretty fair comparison between the two devices.)  First off, I could care less about scratches; it's a music appliance, not jewelry. I keep mine in a pocket without change or lighters and it's fine.  The Shuffle is slightly louder. This won't matter to most people but I work in a datacenter where the ambient noise level is very high, and for some songs that were ripped at low level, maximum volume on the Nano isn't quite enough.  The display screen is great for song info and album art but seems a bit washed out for photos. Perhaps it's the downsampling algorithm the Nano uses when it imports photos. Not terribly important either.  The battery level meter on the Nano display could have been programmed a bit better. From fully charged it drops to the next level within a couple of minutes. Now I know it's not technically "full" anymore, but it's still a bit disconcerting. The battery-level bar also turns red quite early, when there's more than an hour of play left. Again, disconcerting and unnecessary. I much prefer the Shuffle's way, using a single LED that goes from green to yellow to red. You see green until yellow appears with about an hour left, and when you see red you've only got a few minutes. In other words 90% of the time you see "all's well", and when you really need to recharge, it tells you so.  Now, the biggest flaw with the Nano, for me at least: battery life.  Apple advertises 12-16 hours, but that's a sad joke. I use the device heavily, pretty much continuously, at work. The indicator turns red after 4 1/2 hours and the device needs recharging after  6 hours. I've been through this cycle several times now and it is consistent. It recharges relatively fast (plug in when I go to lunch, and it's charged when I get back in an hour), but it's disappointing not to be able to get through a whole shift without a recharge. The Nano also seems to lose juice fairly quickly when idle/turned off. Put it to sleep full, and check it the next day and it's at 75%.  By contrast the iPod Shuffle hardly seems to use the battery at all. I can easily get through a whole (11-hour) shift without even getting to yellow on the indicator. If I don't listen continuously through my shift I can go days before recharging, and the Shuffle has sat idle on a full charge for over two weeks and still been green when I picked  it up.  Now I realize (hello!) that the Shuffle doesn't have a display at all, nor a click wheel, nor does it store photos, nor can it hold nearly as much music as the Nano. The Nano is beautiful and a joy to use. But its versatility and utility are hampered by its short battery life. If you want a whole day's music and you're not going to be near a computer, say, hiking or boating or skiing, the Nano is going to disappoint you. If you can make a playlist you enjoy that fits in a gigabyte, for heavy users the Shuffle is a better bet.

<Content>I bought a black Nano I'm extremely satisfied. The device is beautiful -- however also VERY prone to scratches.  Take out your new Nano and admire its great engineering and sleek design...then slip into a protective shell case and leave it in!  *You MUST buy a case/shell for this device*  Several companies are making sleek Nano shells which give access to all ports (headphone, dock connector, hold button, click wheel) as well as providing LCD protection.  I'm partial to the thin "Speck Nano SkinTight" line available right here at Amazon.com  Once your Nano is protected, toss it in your bag, drop it, use it in the rain, NO WORRIES!

<Content>Well just got my Ipod Nano couple days ago, I also bought the protective screen cover (film) for my screen and the click wheel and the small button in the middle. (Japan makes them, which is nice) Yea I put on the film and the silicon case right after I opened it.  So I don't have to worry about scratches.  It will say new for the rest of my life or until i keep it.  One bad thing is the stock earphones.  I had them couple of days and it's already broken! I recommend it but becareful with the earphone that came with it.  They are pretty weak!

<Title>Very classy...
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Coming in two varieties; a 2Gb and 4Gb model both are available in black or white. However using the mini name just wasn't going to cut it and this device is amazingly small. Think two iPod shuffles but only flatter and weighing a svelte 42 grams and you start to get the picture.   The casing is split in two sections, the iconic silver backing found on all the iPod models and depending on your model either a shiny white cover or shiny black cover. Apple has opted to make the click wheel themselves this time and that means that it's a rougher texture than iPod users will be used to. As to whether that's a good thing or not, we think this actually helps.   Concerns over the scratchability of the player are rightly so and I would recommend anyone thinking of buying one to invest in some sort of protection from day one. I took it out of the packaging, put it in our pocket with some change and a mobile phone. Five minutes later I took it out again and it already had a faint scratch on it.   Connecting to iTunes, users will be able to opt for the same experience as previous iPod models and there is even an Autofill option that will randomly fill your iPod with tunes from your collection if you've got too many to fit on the 2Gb or 4Gb offering.   2Gb will get you around 500 songs and 4Gb 1000 tracks as long as they aren't all 13 minute John Coltrane numbers.   Because of the photo-viewing element, you can also sync the nano with iPod Photo on an Apple Mac. As with previous models you can opt to sync your entire photo collection or specific rolls or albums.   The main cause of amazement is that the nano has a screen built in such a small and thin device. Taking a leaf out of the iPod Photo, the nano features a bright colour screen, if not a bit on the small size, but still able to view image you've transferred via your computer.   Digital photographers however will be upset to hear that the Apple Digital Camera connector doesn't work on the nano nor can you get a cable to be able to view the images on a nearby television. Viewing back you images on the screen is more likely to be a reference option rather than something worth straining your eyes over.   Those bored of the music can head over to the in-built games, challenge themselves at their own music collection with the music quiz, play miniature solitaire or even bricks - Apple's version of Breakout.    VERDICT  There is no doubt that this is going to be one of those must have devices if you haven't already signed up for the iPod revolution. The sleekness of the device means it will garner oohs and aahs from all over, heck Mrs Pocket-lint got excited by the smallness of the box it came in let alone the player itself.   What makes this a winning combination is the iTunes software and how easy it is to use. Okay so the catches are that you will be tied into Apple's iTunes Music Store and the Apple file format for the foreseeable future, but when it's this good, who cares?   Our final and most important piece of advice however to any would be buyer; make sure you get a protective case from day one, else your shiny new toy will have more scratches on it than a funky renegade dj's record collection.

So far i have over 200 songs, and am still filling it! i have a few photos, contacts, and notes etc. this is the most beautiful ipod i have ever seen in my life, and since i heard about how it is scratch prone i have left the screen guard on, i got 2 cases. (armband, flip case).  Plus the regular one that came with the nano, this ipod is the coolest, sleekest ipod i have ever seen, the songs are perfect and the photos are magnificant, i would recomend this to anyone looking for a slightly but pretty durable ipod that is thin, sleek, and for those of you ( us) that don't need ( or know ) 15,000 songs.  Black is a beautiful color and i have never seen white which i suspect is just as breath taking...  anyway before i get lost in my words im going to get back to my ipod.  Thanks for your time.

<Content>I just got my iPod a month ago and love it. I know all of the controls and everything. I left the plastic on it until I get the case I ordered last week. The only problem is too many scratches. I have tried my hardest to keep it safe from scratches. The new iPod may have video, but it is very wide and scratches the same as the nano. This iPod nano is cheaper. The new iPod holds 15,000 songs which is too much to hold. Who would pay all of that money on iTunes for music?   15,000 songs @ 99 cents= $1,485,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  pros  + small and compact + choice of black or white + 1,000 songs and 25,000 photos + clear crisp sound  cons  - scratches TOO easily - no charger? sold seperately from Apple at $39 - headphone jack is at bottom which is usually on top from recent models  I recommend this iPod out of the mini and the new one...

<Content>IPods are Rip-offs   The iPod's not the only music player you can get, It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met. If they just knew what the other players had in store for them, They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.  The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites, But why not get a better player with more gigabytes? Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices, Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.  The Sandisk Sansa E100 has many, many things, An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings. Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not! The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.  The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal, It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal. Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player, For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.      There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space, It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place. FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy, The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.  The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video, Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow. The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter, The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.  So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time, The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime. They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool", Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.   Facts  1.	Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player. 2.	The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference),

<Title>What to know...
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a lot of thought, I finally caved and bought one of these to upgrade from my old Muvo. I'm clearly a big fan of portability and unobtrusiveness in my mp3 players, so that played a big factor in my decision.   Here are my thoughts:  The Nano is small, it is very chic/beautiful (for people who go for that kinda thing), the screen is nice and the click wheel is very, very functional. It's quite small and it really does everything I need it to without being bothersome size-wise. I was quite impressed by the whole package. I was also very glad I decided to get the black model because I think it looks better.   This is not to say the Nano is not without weaknesses. First off, pretty much everyone by now should realize the nano is not built like a tank. I invested in a nice leather cover, and it has definitely made things easier for me. I got it on almost immediately because the nano definitely shows scratches. Another issue is that the iPod doesn't have the greatest battery life. They claim something like 13 hours but honestly I'm not quite sure what they were testing. They probably did not turn on the backlight at all and/or listened on absolute minimum volume. I'd estimate I get more like 10 hours out of the Nano (maybe I'm off, seems like 3 days of average use), which isn't as good as I might have hoped but also is in no way a deal-killer.   All in all, despite its flaws, I am fairly happy with the Nano. It is approximately what I thought it would be, and it does what I need it to do (I'm a college student and this thing pretty much goes everywhere on campus with me). Just know what to expect.

<Content>I just received the Nano as a graduation gift and the size, the beauty, and the sound of it really did impress me.  However, my previous MP3 player was a Creative Muvo and I miss many of the features on that player such as radio, voice recorder, and a much longer battery life.  If you're looking for an mp3 player for around the same price I recommend the the Sandisk Sansa e260 or e70.  It sounds just as good as the ipod nano, is almost as small, and includes all of the features above including a larger screen.

<Content>Who cares if it gets a few scratches...It is by far the best looking MP3 player on the market.  Not to mention it is easy to use even being that small.  I love it for jogging.  Downfalls are that I wish it had more storage space, I'm finding it hard to choose what to take off  when I buy new songs

<Title>So far so good

<Content>Like Homer Simpson, I am not easily impressed. But the Nano has left me totally amazed.  I have books and music loaded into mine and find the ease of going from one to the other is actually fun. THE SOUND IS AMAZING!! I followed the suggestions of several other raters and bought a protective case.  So now worries there.

<Title>It died after one month and all the replacements BREAK
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first ipod broke after a month, it died, it did nothing.  I called apple, mailed it back and received a replacement.  The SECOND replacement, did not work properly, I sent it back.  I received replacement number 3, its dead, it does nothing.  I have called customer service numerous times, and they have tried to reset it, I switched cables, I have tried everything they have suggested to me, its still dead.  The customer service I have received is appalling, I have been 'disconnected' a number of times.  I wish I could return the whole thing and get my money back!!!        DONT DO IT I would also like to add I purchased the ipod in February, I expect to be given a new one this month (June) so every month I get a new IPOD that ultimately breaks, its infuriating and ridiculous.  I HATE IT  I spend more time trying to get them fixed then I actually get to listen to it

<Title>A Worthwhile Buy
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The small size is possibly the most appealing feature of this iPod, but the sleek black look is nice as well.  Of course, like the other iPods, the shiny surface attracts fingerprints, but the great availability of cases for the iPod nano can help counteract this.  The only reservation I have about this iPod after almost a year with it is the fact that it doesn't hold quite as much music as I would like.  But you can edit it, instead of putting all the music you own on it, just your favorite songs, or something.  Unfortunately, this is a time-consuming process.  Also, my iPod nano tends to get locked up frequently and I'll have to restart it.  All the same, the iPod nano is a great option if you don't want to spend the money to get one of the other iPods.  I'm glad I purchased it.

<Title>The new nano
<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having used a black 4gb nano for the past few months, I have scant few complaints. The screen is phoenominal, the size is amazing, it sounds great and holds my entire library of awesome music. You'd be hard pressed to find a cooler gadget than this, and technically speaking I've had no problems. Battery life is about 10 hours off and on, which is totally fine by my book. The one complaint I do have is that it is quite prone to scratches, I'd invest in a clear plastic coating for frontal protection, or perhaps the Agent 18 shield (which I have and love) to protect it from a hurricane. If you are even considering getting this iPod, do it. You WILL NOT regret it.

<Title>Mass Transit Commuter's Dream
<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is quite simply the best digital audio player (DAP) on the market for mass transit commuters, particularly when it's coupled with the Apple Lanyward Headphones for the iPod nano.  I have found larger DAPs to be cumbersome and difficult to manipulate.  I've always found the wiring of the earbuds and the weight of my previous iPod to be especially annoying.   I now carry the nano around my neck suspended from the lanyard headphones and tuck it underneath my clothing and rarely notice it's presence.  To control it, I simply slide my hand under my jacket or shirt to adjust the volume, pause the audio, or flip tracks.   The quality of the audio easily rivals any existing Apple iPod and certainly all other brands of music player.  The screen is also very bright, and crisp.  I initially kept the peel away plastic coating on my nano due to the many reports of easy scratching.  I recently encased it in the Agent 18 clear plastic case and have been very happy with it since it works nicely with the lanyard.  I take the nano out of the case occasionally to examine it for scratches and it's in great shape!  The battery life is also excellent since I only need to charge my nano every 3-4 days - listening to it for about 2-3 hours daily.  The only downside to the nano is its capacity of 4GB, but I've become accustomed to more carefully managing my playlists.  This is hands down my favorite gadget of 2005.

<Title>Fragile... yet Beautiful!    A review by a non-iPodder
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that I'm coming to the iPod Nano from the world of flash MP3 players, this is my first iPod because I was waiting for Apple to make a decent flash MP3... and they've finally done it! So here are the things I love about my iPod Nano after about a month of use:  1) Making playlists on iTunes, this is a wonderful feature that you just don't find outside the iPod world! 2) Beauty, the iPod Nano is without doubt the sexiest MP3 player alive today. Apple really knows how to make beautiful products. 3) Sound is great. 4) Love that click wheel thing, another great idea by Apple. 5) Beautiful big color display makes navigation easy and fun. 6) Good battery life.  I know much of that is old hat to the iPod world, but for me coming from a world of Muvo's and iAudio these are wonderful features. Now for the bad news, why I didn't give the Nano a 5:  1) Fragile!! Doesn't Apple understand that part of the appeal of a flash player is ruggedness? I'm scared to take this thing outside or even put it in my pocket without protection.. I immediately went out and spent another $30 for a decent case which leads to 2) Where are the accessories? My iAudio's and Muvos came with cases and lanyards and armbands. iPod Nano: nothing!! The most expensive player I've bought to date and the one most in need of a protective case and I have to go and spend an extra $30 for what should have been included!  In summary, this is a wonderful product and a delight to use and behold. However, Apple does need to get a clue about durability and accessories imho!

<Title>Apple hasn't learned yet
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seems apple would have learned by now, knowing they serve the musician/graphic artist community almost exclusively, to use ogg vorbis! And why no mic yet or even a plug for one? It wouldn't be difficult for them. Heck, they could easily include a small camera like in the new imacs but that would be taking it a bit far. Sure apple has the advertising blitzkrieg, the easy to use look and feel, but their quality is going to the dogs. When they try to please everyone, inevitably this hurts us all. They built their empire on the people with substance, the artists, musicians, teachers, and all the other poor people that desire quality of life above all.  It's easy to see where mac is going, the way of the dinosaur. Unless they shape up, stop being so greedy and egomaniacal, and start serving the people instead of profit margins, they are just another titanic. Shape up or ship out!  It's hard to say this all since I have been a loyal fan for so long. They have not included ogg vorbis, they have not pushed open source software, they don't really know the future as they say. They are still living off the past. They are biting the hands that feed them. This could change and I really hope they do. They will have to or they will, like I said before, go the way of the dinosaur.   For all you people that don't know, which is most of you. All those mp3's, aac's, windows media, real media files you have on your computer that you have fought for so hard with your wage-slave existence. All that money you have spent has gone to you only renting those files from their masters. Whenever you use those formats and not ogg vorbis, you are killing yourself. Any day these private corporations could put out a statement saying, "HEY, we want 15 percent profit off all the songs you put into OUR codec" ... This could possible mean hundreds if not thousands of dollars for some of you and possible the loss of your whole music/video collection. Just don't go there. These people don't care about you. Use open source (ogg vorbis) if you want to survive with minimal harm. It's kind of like shopping locally and buying organic. Get a clue. Cancer is expensive.  Ipod Nano: 1. No ogg vorbis support. (ogg vorbis is the backbone of society like gold used to be the backbone of your dollar bill for all you cogs out there) 2. Battery life is nill. 3. Replacing the battery is expensive and possible often. 4. Very limited in playing other formats as well. Elitist. Narrow Minded. Suicidal. 5. Good price for what it does have. (Even though we all live in debt and another great depression is very near on the horizon. Do your homework.) 6. Small size. 7. Good Design. 8. Very Handy. 9. Could be a power symbol for all you insecure types to buy into to boost your dwindling self esteem.  10. These little players are isolating everyone more and more and more everyday. (can you say "night of the living dead") It's kind of insulting to see people with players on just like it's insulting for people talking on their cell phones.  11. Again they don't support ogg vorbis. This is the most important defect. If you don't know about this, there is probably alot more you don't know as well.  12. They could also support open source imaging/video like "theora"  All mac would have to do is update their software! It's so easy! COme on MAC!  If survival isn't important to you. And you like to do what you are told. If you think agent smith in the matrix is more like what you want in life (rigid supporter of the old ways). If you are spineless from society holding your hand so often and replacing your mind with todays NEW IMPROVED garbage. GO ahead and get one. You will get exactly what you deserve.   If you want to evolve and continue life on the planet, use open source software as much as possible. Get an Iaudio G3 2gb or an iriver This is what you are missing when you do what you are told and buy into the hype.  Iaudio/iriver/etc.features: 1. line in inputs,  2. Built in mic 3. 50 hour battery life 4. easily changeable battery. 5. tougher, can be dropped numerous times  and still work. 6. Support Ogg Vorbis Format open source software. 7. Won't make you look like so much of a tool when you are using it.  Diversity is survival of the species.   I say you keep your old ogg/mp3 player and hold out till apple gets off it high horse of destruction. You'll thank me later. Go buy a used iriver or iaudio for way less and you will be way better off. All that glitters is not gold. Or better yet, start using your old tape players again. Maybe you could just listen to music at HOME off your computer. OR learn to play the guitar or hum to yourself like sane people and not buy into any of this stuff at all. How much backbone do you have? Are you all going to run to go get your implanted microchips as well when they come out with an apple logo on it?   Like I said before, all apple would have to do with the inano for me to give it a 4 star is update the software to support ogg  vorbis and other open source software. I know they have attatchments for line-in inputs for mics sooo... IF they did a software update, I would probably get one. Until then, I'd rather listen to the wind. http://takepills.org

If you are into sports, try the ipod shuffle, it's smaller and easier for exercise.  Also, I got my ipod for 10 dollars off a promotion on premium ipods site.

<Title>4Gb iPod Nano is pricey, but may be worth it (read on)...
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>UPDATE: I have ended up buying an iPod Nano afterall.  My first review was from my initial experience and what I learned from a few other owners.  But after getting a chance to use one for a full day, I came to realize that some of my earlier complaints about the Nano needed revisiting and so I decided it was time to buy it (note: the $50 extra for 2 more Gb is worth it!)  #1: Durability - overall, the unit is well made. The "click wheel" is smaller than the standard iPod, but still works as well. It is a very small device, so it is easy to drop it. I have heard it is fragile upon dropping onto a hard surface. Also, the shiny surfaces are scratch prone (both the glossy plastic front and the chrome back). So the best way to avoid these kinds of problems is to cloak the Nano in a casing of your choice (see below). Once you do that, you're good to go.  #2: Form factor - it really is "just right".  It's small enough to fit in your pocket and yet large enough to hold comfortably in your hand.  I'd actually prefer it to be slightly thicker and accommodate 8Gb!  But for what Apple did with this device design, I have to applaud them.  It is solid feeling, yet light enough to strap on your arm and not really notice it is there (great for the gym or running!).  The iPod Nano will display album art, but the screen is a bit on the small side... I made my own album images for my songs (300x300, so you see them well, easily found on the Internet by searching Google Images) and associated them with my music in iTunes.  When you load the songs onto your iPod, the images automatically go with them.  #3: Cost - Comparatively speaking, $249 for a 4Gb MP3 player is STEEP, considering what the unit delivers and the sparse included accessories.  When you go out and buy a protective case and other necessary items, like a USB POWER ADAPTER so you can charge the iPod when not connected to a computer (yep, can you believe they don't give you this?), a DOCK (they give you the CABLE only!), and upgraded headphones (if you find the earbuds annoying), the cost will add up to quite a hefty sum if you buy the accessories from Apple.  I've found good non-OEM accessory makers out there (check closely on auction websites), so you can definitely do better.  #4: Sound quality - Overall, it's very good (depending on your environment, sound file quality, and ear sensitivity).  Most MP3 players do not send relatively much power to the headphone jacks, so they give you cheap ones to mask this.  The default earbuds with the Nano are OK--certainly good enough for a workout session in a noisy gym.  But if you're an audiophile and require top grade sound all the time, you may be disappointed.  I recommend testing out the Nano in the Apple store with your own preferred earbuds/headphones to judge for yourself.  I bought a nice set of over-the-ear headphones that the Nano drives reasonably well.  I am considering getting a portable headphone amplifier for long trips, though.  #5: File management - you have to use iTunes to get songs onto your iPod.  That's ok--iTunes is a decent music management program.  However, it works seamlessly ONLY if you use Apple's proprietary AAC encoding.  This will take all of your MP3 files and convert them to AAC, then load them into the iTunes library.  The file size is a little smaller, but the sound quality is not consistently good.  To convert files back to MP3 format, you'll find a noticeable sound quality loss.  Personally, I REFUSE to lose music portability and so I'm sticking with MP3 format.  In order to do this, you have to sacrifice the iTunes synchronization feature.  I think this may also explain why when copying songs onto my iPod via playlists, I end up getting duplicate songs--the iPod does not seem to know how to link an incoming playlist to songs that may already be on the iPod.  Very annoying.  I find I have to periodically clear my Nano and completely reload.  But that's OK--even with the 4Gb Nano, it's not a very long time to reload it.  #6: Battery life - I have to say that this is the first device I've had that has a very even power meter display.  Most of the time battery powered devices (like cell phones) will indicate a full charge for a long time and then drop off quickly.  The Nano power meter diminishes very evenly.  In fact, when the meter hits the "red" zone, your iPod can go for another 3-4 hours.  I conducted my own power test--I fully loaded the Nano and let it play from a full charge.  At the end of 12 hours, it was done.  Ok, not the 14 hours that Apple claims, but close enough.  Keep in mind, this was undisturbed playing and at 3/4 volume level.  The backlight of the Nano takes up a lot of power, so I keep mine set to a 2 second shut off (the default is 10 seconds).  ACCESSORIES:  If you plan to use the Nano for working out, I recommend getting a case that will allow you to strap it to your arm.  I bought a silicone-gel kind of case for the nano that has openings in the back for a velcro strap.  Works great!  Definitely get a wall charger (so you can charge the Nano independently of your computer).  And if you want to use your iPod with a stereo system or to have it propped up nicely on your desk, get a docking station.  I have a friend that bought a car FM transmitter for the iPod so he can play it through his stereo--it works pretty well.  I really do like the Nano.  But I have to admit that I have a few grudges:  the tiny 1.5" screen (I think 2" should have been possible), the lack of a brightness control (the Nano becomes a flashlight in the dark it is so bright--unnecessary, as I'd rather save the power), tiny storage for what you get (an 8Gb chip should fit in this form factor), and lack of built-in features like FM receiver and direct memory card file transfers.  I bought my Nano primary for exercise, with the intention of getting a larger PMP (portable media player) for storing my complete collection of music as well as favorite photos.  It's important to set aside the Nano "coolness" factor and really look at this device for what it should deliver on FOR THE PRICE.   If your main purpose for getting an MP3 player is to hear music during workouts, and you don't need a large library of music with you when traveling, then the Nano may appeal to you.  However, if you are ok with the standard iPod size, I recommend going with a full size iPod or a Creative Labs device (Nomad Zen or Zen Vision).  TIP:  When you first get the Nano, utilize the protective film already on the front as a screen protector, by trimming it in between the screen and the click wheel (your case will protect the rest).  If you do it carefully, the film will remain nicely in place without air bubbles and will last a good long while.  Eventually, after the film acquires enough scratches, buy the screen protector film readily on the market!

<Content>It scratches, it's expensive for the storage size, not good on durability, it is made by apple, the iTunes store is horrible.  Now we have all the negatives lets look at the nano. Scratches well anything with a screen will scratch so get a protector for it, try invisible sheild works and adds no bulk to the player. Expensive for the amount of storage, it weighs an once and is as thin as a pencil, you are not paying for the storage you are paying for the small size. Durability, it has no moving parts, next complaint... it is made by Apple, yeah and your point is... Itunes is horrible? Ok it is the largest store around and it was the 50th to the market so how can it be that bad the songs are less than $1.00. this thing is great and iPOD's have the best add ons in the business. You will not find a better player period....

<Title>iPod nano Scores High
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The term "bigger is better" no longer applies to one of the latest additions to Apple's new iPod line.  Measuring 3.5" x 1.6" x 0.27" and weighing 1.5 ounces, the new flash-based iPod nano offers a great product for consumers.  Described as being "100-percent iPod" the nano comes as either a 2 GB with 500 songs ($199), or a 4GB with 1,000 songs ($249).   	With the nano, comes all of the standard accessories that include the signature white headphones, a USB cable, manuals, an iTunes software disk and a dock adapter.  Features include holding three days' worth of music, 14 hours of playing time, compadability with the music service iTunes, the touch-and-go click wheel, and a color screen display.  The ability of updating photos and songs through iTunes is an interesting part of the nano.   	"Nano-only" features include being able to set numerous clocks around the world accordingly, a stopwatch that allows users to store stats and record time similar to a stopwatch, and the addition of the screen lock, which enables users to "lock" the iPod by implementing a code that acts as a password.  These three additions add a unique and favorable touch to the nano. The ability to create a "lock" that involves both the internal and external part of the iPod is likable, as well as the stopwatch option.  But I find that the most informative and creative nano-only feature to be the ability to create clocks, letting users know what time it is around the world.  	Although impressive, the ability to store and access photos is unfavorable due to the 1.5-inch LCD display, making the screen smaller than most cell phones.  Another issue that can't go ignored is that the outside covering of the nano is highly vulnerable to scratches and marks, and in my opinion, prone to breaking and other abuse.  The smallness factor can't go ignored either, but is appealing to most users.    	Overall, if you are looking for a "cute" and different approach to the iPod market, the iPod nano would be a great product to buy.  The iPod may be small but makes up for it in many other ways.  Its distinct features and user-friendly display and photo capabilities make the iPod nano a whole and ideal product.

<Content>The black Nano comes with a white headphone set, which seems strange. It would make sense that the headphones would be black.  The design is nice, but the directions are minimal. I still don't know how to turn it off. I have windows 2000 software on my computer, but the Mac CD does not recognize it.  If must only recognize a certain version.  Sound quality and ease of finding music is where Mac excels.  For the money, and for the quality of the product, Mac is charging a steep price considering they haven't worked through the details.

<Title>Powerful features, small size
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have resisted jumping on the iPod bandwagon for a long time. I have instead bought several Rio players (including the very small 5 GB Nitrus)... but then I saw the Nano in person on the subway one day and couldn't believe how sleek it was. This mp3 player does not disappoint. It is sleek and thin, has a bright color screen and is really very sturdy. As others have stated, the glossy finish on would probably show the smallest scratch but I have been very careful, keep it in a case, and have yet to have any damage. The best part of the Nano, as someone who was not an iPod user, is the interface. It works with a powerful menu system, making it very user-friendly, and has all the features of the biggest iPods in a tiny package. Though the iTunes software does have a few quirks, once you take the time to figure out how everything functions, it is an excellent way to manage your collection. Some of my favorite features include the ability to set the sound level for a particular song higher or lower compared to the others and the fact the iPod starts back exactly where you were (for example, in the middle of a song) when it is turned off and back on again. The click wheel also works very well and is touch-sensitive for controlling the volume and scrolling through menus. The instructions, though simple, are very good. (To the user who doesn't know how to turn off his iPod: simply press and hold the play/pause button.) The only real downside is the earphones aren't great (upgraded to a pair of Sonys) and the connectors are all at the bottom of the player. This means you need to find a case that has a space for your headset cord to be inserted or need to put your player in the case upside-down. Obviously I am very happy with my purchase. Oh, and the best thing compared to my previous players is that there is no skipping. The Nano uses flash memory instead of a hard drive, so you can jog, run, whatever, and songs do not skip. (I have the black 4 GB Nano.)

<Title>Just What I've Expected
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano IPod is amazing! It super thin and stores music at an incredible rate. What NI love about it the most is how it updates the library on the Nano automatically once it is plug up to your computer for charging. It is a perfect companion to run with. If the music wasn't playing you wouldn't even know you where running with it (because it is sooo light). I've had my IPod for two weeks now and I can't get enough of it! When I first turned it on I was amazed by the sound quality of songs I've played on my computer with headphones. I mean, I heard instruments on songs that I never knew where played on songs I always play. Sound effects that I never picked up on from songs where fun to discover because I never heard them before when they where played on my computer. The headphones really isolate the music and blocks alot of the sounds you would normally hear with other standard headphones.   I would recommend this product to anyone...especially runners.

<Content>I had no plans of buying an iPod Nano black after looking at the features offered by Creative Zen Vision M, but I needed a mp3 player and Creative was in great demand requiring atleast 6 weeks of waiting (atleast in Amazon. How do I know that? I waited for more than 4 weeks for mine... eventually cancelling the order).   Anyways, I would suggest you all to buy transperant full body shields available in market (I bought mine from SHIELDZONE, there are probably other companies aswell). The full body shield is virtually zero thicknes, protects your precious, iPod, from scratches. It takes not more than 10 minutes to install and is ready to use immediately. Now that I have the shield on my Nano, and have also not compromised on the looks of the same, I am on lookout for cases (preferrably black silicone) to wrap around it. Will update you guys when I find one.  And for all you guys who keep complaining about the scratches, get intelligent, buy some screen protector the day you order for iPod. Its worth those couple of bucks.

<Title>Great!
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it, in fact I don't think I've seen her without it since!  My only complaint is the black one tends to scratch VERY easily, I mean VERY EASILY!  But there are a lot of cute little covers you can buy for it.  It's so light & small that it fits everywhere, holds lots of music & sounds great. Worth every penny!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like the ipod nano. It is great quality and has excellent sound. It is as small as it was promoted to be, but no fragile. I dropped it 3 times the very day I had it and still plays great. My only problem I have with the nano is that we cannot put our music in the order that we want it. It goes in alphabetically and then you have to create a playlist of songs that you want to listen to in whatever order.   The so called manual is a little pull out guide which isn't really helpful and after 2 months I have just been forwarding to whatever song I want to listen to because I still cannot find how to create the playlist.  But like I said thats my only gripe. Everything else is great with this. I only wish I had waited to get the video ipod. But I'll stick to this one for now. I still haven't filled it up with music yet. Have over 1GB left.

<Title>almost great...
<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I upgraded from my first generation 20GB iPod because it was a little too bulky for the gym. My Nano is great. I bought the armband. It's comfortable and safely holds the Nano. The only problem that I have with my Nano is that it scratches much too easily. I only use the armband for the gym. I have a special pocket for MP3 players in my winter coat. After only a few times in this pocket the plastic on my Nano had visible scratches. These were not deep, but certainly detract from the look of my Nano. I would highly recommend buying some type of case for the Nano. Alternatively, the white Nano may not show scratches as easily as the black Nano. Finally, in terms of performance and sound quality, my Nano is outstanding. I would have given the Nano 5 stars if its face were as scratch resistant as my original iPod.

<Title>one annoying glitch
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first iPod of any kind I've ever owned so I can't compare it to the others. I do like it, though, and I've had it now about three months.  Like many of the other reviewers have noted, it does scratch easily, the battery life is maybe half of what is advertised, it's hard to get the connector out while the phones are plugged in, and the ear buds are uncomfortable bordering on painful.  There is one other glitch that I find annoying. I frequently use the "hold" switch so that it won't turn on accidentally and start playing when I'm not using it. However, if you plug it into the connector while the hold switch is on, the unit turns on and locks up. The screen light is on, the last song played is displayed and paused, and no amount of clicking or turning on and off will get it to unlock. The only thing you can do is let the battery run completely down and recharge, which takes many hours. I'd love to know if anyone else has encountered this problem. I guess remembering to switch off "hold" would help, but I don't always remember.  With all those problems you'd think I would hate it but I really do like it. On the plus side, the Nano is unbelievably lightweight and compact. The display is bright and easy to read and the sound is great. The wheel is simplicity itself and an amazing engineerig feat. I find myself using the Nano even in places where I have access to full stereo equipment.  One note to Apple: If you're going to make a black iPod, how 'bout some black headphones?

<Title>Not Perfect but Very Good
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When the Nano was announced my significant other wanted to go to the Apple Store to get one since her 40GB G3 was at end of life, I decided to take a ride with her, no arm twisting required.  When saw the black Nano and they said they had one 4GB model left, I couldn't help myself so I came home with my 3rd iPod...  It smudges, scratches and they don't have a lot of accessories out for this one just yet.  Did I forget to mention that it smudges and scratches easily and they have very few accessories?  It does not have the special remote/headphone jack, only a standard headphone jack so you can say goodbye to your Griffin iTrip.  One additional disapppointment is the fact that this unit is a flash based device so you cannnot sync through an Apple Firewire port and the device is not "bootable" for hard-core Mac techies.  Now for the good stuff, it has great battery life, it's very small, fits in your coin pocket, it holds plenty of songs (about 800-900 songs if you like to tag your music with good images).  The price is fair but if you are buying this, you're not looking for value and quantity of songs, you're looking to turn heads, have a device that is way cool and extremely small.  It does all of these.  One last note, Apple should have made the included headphones in black.

<Title>Love The Nano, Hate The Battery Life
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I mostly use the Nano for working out. It's so much better than using the 20GB or even the Mini. It's so light and I barely notice it on my arm when working out.  I will admit that it does scratch easily, but it's not as much of a concern as the battery life. I feel like I am constantly recharging the battery, it makes me wonder how quickly the entire battery will just die before I have to get it replaced.   Although, it's not perfect, I love my Nano!

<Title>Superb, A Must For Every Music Lover!
<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Nano 4GB Black model is amazing, iPod's are now the 'must-own' gadgets. Forget the bulky 20GB or the mediocre mini the Nano is something else. It is so small and you don't even realise that it's there. The sound quality is amazing as well. You will need a skin/screen protector for it because it does scratch  easily and has a higher chance of breaking than any other iPod. Apart from that it is a little dynamo. I personally have the 4GB because I think it's better value for money. I also wanted the black one because it is unique and different. Now I'm not being racist but Apple could face some controversy for racialising their iPod's, but anyhow I am a fan of iPods now and everything about them is perfect. Except the shuffle which is a waste of money!!

<Title>Ipod Nano 4 Gig Black
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent!  It has very easy to use controls, which sets the Ipod apart from other MP3 players.  Also, instead of having to read a manual the size of a telephone book (as is typical for most consumer electronics products these days), the nano comes with a quick start guide which is all you need (more detailed instructions are available online).  The only criticism I could possibly have is that the nano's default downloading format is Apple's proprietary format which cannot be used with other MP3 players, and the standard download resolution is quite low (you can increase it under custom settings, though).

<Title>Um.... can we have some quality here?
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are tons of refurbished Nanos available for purchase yet it hasn't been out that long. Compared to the Mini, the # of refurbished products available are pretty close yet the Mini has been out so much longer. Doesn't say too much about the quality but then again, there really isn't a well rounded MP3 player available. After some research, I'm finding that you have MP3 players with lots of uses but short battery life, MP3 players with long battery life but nothing else and MP3 players with both long battery life and lots of uses but break if breathed on. Yet they're all extremely expensive. You'd think that there would be a good MP3 player out by now.  While the MP3 world is still looking for a great MP3 player, I would have to rate this one the current best despite the # of refurbished units available (proving sub-par quality). It is one of the worst deals in relation to its price but its the most fun to use and it's very easy to download songs. Battery life is very questionable, even if you treat it like the manual recommends.  Apple customer service is crap but then again, the planet buys their product no matter what so why pay extra for good employees (in other words, having good employees is an unnecessary expense for them)?  If you need an MP3 player right now, I'd recommend this one (as would everyone I know, even Apple-haters). The durability isn't as bad as talked up but the battery life is.  Sony Bean is pretty cool also but the toggle switch is hard to use.  Ultra MP3 14-in-1 is unheard of but very cool, only knock on this one is that the battery (1 AAA) life only gives you about 8 hours (it's sold as a 512mb but has a memory card port & expands to 1.5 gb, sells for $100, add'l card is around $30).

<Title>Most IPOD Fans Do NOT Understand the Financial Risk
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros... 1) Hands-down, the very best UI of ANY portable music player 2) Itunes is the most intuitive application to be found on the net  Cons... 1) If (sorry, when) the hard drive of your PC crashes, wave goodbye to your purchased music.  There are many sites explaining how to easily retrieve the songs that you ripped from a CD or DVD to your IPOD, but if you have not backed up your purchased (from Itunes) music to another source, it is forever gone.  This is one of the biggest gotchas of any product on the planet earth; some folks have hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars worth of exposure here 2) Pathetically fragile 3) Much like previous generation IPODs, when the battery goes, the device is useless unless you are willing to spend $100 to have Apple replace the battery  Net/net: I would not recommend this player (or any Apple portable music player) to my friends without a VERY reliable back-up device.  Apple is making huge (arguabley obsence) profits off a very trusting and under-informed  public.  Caveat emptor (i.e., buyer beware).

<Title>Jameson Thottam - Nano Revolution leaves a lot to be desired
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Jameson Thottam - Nano Revolution leaves a lot to be desired  Summary by Jameson Thottam  I have wanted an Ipod for a long time now; so two weeks ago after seeing the "impressively small" hot new Nano I had to have it. I called the nearest apple store to me to which told me first come first serve. They would not take a credit card over the phone; so I drove about an into a local texas apple store. I thought lucky me they still had a couple black ones in stock, well here is my impression thus far.    Installation: Jameson L Thottam  The installation was painless as I have already installed Itunes 5.0 on my computer, and all I needed to do was install the Ipod driver and connect to one of my available USB 2.0 slots (Users take note if you do not have USB 2.0 you will need to get an add-on card)   Impression: Jameson Luke Thottam  This unit is really quit impressive; the touch wheel is amazingly easy to navigate through the unit and use. The sound quality even with the included throw away ear buds was also very impressive compared to other model MP3's players I have heard. The unit has plenty of power to drive a decent set of AKG or Seinheiser 32 ohm headphones, and also features a built graphic equalizer to adjust to your taste of music. The Eq (equalizer) is all presets; I would like to have seen a manual adjustment to even further customize it.    SERIOUS CONCERNS: Jameson L. Thottam I am sure by now everyone has heard of user's complaining of scratching and failing screens. I myself thought "O please" what are these people doing to these Ipods to scratch and or break the screen and scratch there cases. I have handled my Ipod nano for 2 weeks now with kid gloves. No pocket use, not using any abrasive cloths that may scratch it. The only thing I have used to remove finger prints is a specialty micro fiber lens cleaning cloth that I use on my semi pro 35MM APO camera lens. Well after 2 weeks of in house use not even going outside, it looks terrible. The case has a heap of small scratches everywhere, if one was to look at it under the light they would ask what was this cleaned with an SOS pad? 30 grit sandpaper?   APPLE'S STATEMENTS: Jameson Thottam What has apple said publicly about this? "Well if the consumer purchases one of the many available cases" I have to laugh hysterically at that, I spent many a hours looking for a case that is available. I have yet to find any as available, sure there are plenty in development, but what good does that do?   FINAL THOUGHTS: James Thottam As of right now I would still recommend the unit but I caution everyone I have recommended it to thus far that they may want to leave the plastic on the case and the screen till one "of the many available cases" actually become available.

<Content>I've had my nano for just a few days, and have handled it with the utmost of care, and it is covered in micro scratches, which are painful to look at in the light. I am searching for some kind of scratch remover now, hopefully that will help a little, then i'm getting some kind of skin for it. Despite this problem, i love my ipod. The flash drive is totally silent (obviously), and the sound quality is superb.  By the way... IF YOUR NANO EVER FREEZES UP ON YOU, HOLD THE CENTER BUTTON AND THE MENU BUTTON AT THE SAME TIME FOR ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS, AND REPEAT IF NECESSARY. (it should reboot the drive, according to apple's website)

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic. The "plastic" this device is constructed from appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music.  When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device is quite small which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recomend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Bach. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to. If you have any further questions, my email address is supremeruleroftheearth@yahoo.com

<Title>Ok ... here's the deal ...
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>******************************  I got my Nano. FIRST THING I DID IS BUY A PROTECTIVE CASING FOR IT ... which covers everything, inluding the screen and the wheel. People, please, isn't it obvious that when you read over the reviews and see that #1 concern is that Nano scratches easily, you absolutely NEED to buy a case for it? ... otherwise you will end up like a bunch of people I saw on here - crying over a scratched IPod. Protect it right away and you wont have to worry about scratches. Simple huh? But I do hope Apple will fix that problem when the next version comes around. On the negative side, I hear that the battery might die within 2 years, which bothers me a lot to be honest, and I also read that you can't really replace it. I guess you have to think like this: "Would it be worth buying something so expensive, knowing that it would only last a few years?". We'll see how long mine works for, but I'm really concerned about it's very limited lifetime... Other than that, I see absolutely no problems with this device, and would definately recommend it if the primary function you will be using it for is listenin to music. Um, I should mention, that you won't fit 1000 songs on it if they are of the high quality (192 or 320), but I'd say it should hold about 600-700 of them, again, depending on quality and size of the file. It's been mentioned already, but let me say it again, Nano in NOT 4GB, more like 3.6GB, so consider that as well when buying this product.   So I'd say get it! It's a nice lil thing to have around. But buy the case right away though, that would be a good move on your part.  ******************************

You'd think that a company capable of the ipod technology could design a better bud. There's just nothing about the structure of the human outer ear that works with the shape of the buds that come out of the box.

<Content>Here is a quick review pretty much summing up what everyone is saying:  Pros: -Very Tiny -Bright Colorful Screen -Great Sound -Awesome Cool Factor -Can view photos -Uses iTunes which is an amazing program that organizes all of your music  Cons: -Fragile compared to other iPod units -Scratches very easily -Headphone jack at the bottom of the unit (this may not be a problem for all people)  All and all, for a small Mp3 player thats tiny and holds a bunch of songs (around 1000) then this player is by far the top of its class. I suggest getting some type of adhesive such as an "Invisible Shield" that will go over the ipod which will protect the nano from all scratches and is pretty much invisible to the naked eye.

<Title>Good music player overall
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For a while, I was very skeptical about buying one of these - I didn't understand all the hype about the iPod when there are so many other music players on the market.  Since I got one for Christmas, I've started to see what some of the hype is about.  These are fairly good players overall.  One advantage the iPod offers over other players is that it arranges your music by artist and album, making music easy to find.  Additionally, the iPod Nano is very tiny and uses solid-state storage, making it ideal for those who wish to use a music player while exercising.  It also has a sharp color screen and an easy-to-use interface.  The graphics resemble the Mac OS X operating system, so its user interface is also fairly nice to look at.  Additionally, the sound quality is very good.  The earbud headphones it comes with also sound very good, although I personally find earbuds somewhat uncomfortable.  The iPod Nano has some other nice touches, such as games - It has solitaire, a music shuffle game (where it plays short clips of your songs and you have to choose which song it is from a list), and a few others.  The games can come in useful if you are on a long bus/airplane ride or in other situations where you might be bored.  The biggest downsides I see to the iPod Nano is that there is no way to replace the battery if it fails or to upgrade the storage if you want more than 4GB of storage.  Apple does have a warranty for the battery though and will replace your iPod Nano if the battery fails (within a certain time limit).  Another downside, in my opinion, is that you need to use special software to transfer music to/from the iPod.  Unlike other music players I've used, you can't simply drag & drop your music files onto the device.  You need to use software, such as Apple's iTunes, to transfer music to/from the iPod.  Additionally, it looks like the software scrambles the filenames on the iPod, so even if you browse the music files on your iPod without the special software, you can't tell what the music is from the filenames.  Pros:  - Very tiny (easy to take with you)  - Uses solid-state storage (ideal for those who exercise)  - Easy to use  - Great sound quality Cons:  - The battery & storage device can't be replaced  - Special software must be used to copy music to/from the iPod

<Title>Expensive but neat little toy
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own the Apple Nano. My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it.   Sound Quality: The sound quality was not as good as on my iRiver (my i had more clarity and a little more bass response), but the difference isn't even noticeable unless your obsessive-compuslive about sound. There is a custom EQ along with some presets to match what genre of music you like. I've never seen the Apple earbuds but most people say they are awful so you should probably pick up some better earbuds or headphones (the ones I have are the Panasonic RPHJE50's and my friend's are the cheaper Sony MDRJ10's if that helps you on your search).   Interface: Well, I must say I'm impressed. I will say that it's much easier to use than most MP3 players on the market (the iPod's interface is really the whole reason they are so popular). The artists, albums, genres, and titles are set up like most, in category forms so you can find your song. Note that 500 songs (128 kbps, trust me don't go any lower) is around 40 albums, so I would recommend stepping up to the 4 GB Nano which will hold 1,000 songs/80 albums. The software the Nano uses is iTunes (which most people are familiar with). It does pretty much any function Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or MusicMatch would do. It's easy to create playlists on iTunes and send them into your player.   Features: The Apple Nano has some features, even though it's somewhat lacking. One of the best features is it's size. This thing is small, only 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27 inches and only weighs 1.5 ounces. The player does display album art, most MP3 players will not do that. It has a nice 1.5-inch color display and a photo viewer. It works with most OSs, even my friend got it to work on Windows 98. Some websites will podcast and you can put casts on your Nano. The Nano has some nice features, however, some of the features are lacking. The battery life is only 14 hours while most MP3 players are more than this. It charges and syncs with one USB, which means you have to take both along if you have to charge it. Hopefully your computer has a USB port in the front like me, that way you won't have much of a hassle. There is no FM tuner/recording but most people don't need that feature, however I think it should be deserved for the high cost.   Durability: The durability is much better than an iPod. I've heard batterys are fine on the Nano unlike iPods. It seems pretty durable, though I would highly recommend getting a case AND a rubber thing for it for two reasons. 1) It scratches very easily, both the plastic and the LCD. 2) The Nano will probably break if you drop it on concrete or the road.   Price: Just in my opinion, the price is way too high for just a 4 GB MP3 player. I think Apple is just asking for too much. I know it's small, but that still doesn't balance the price.   Overall: The Apple 4 GB Nano is a treat anyone would enjoy. Though the price is high and it doesn't have a radio or a record feature, it's good because of its size and its ease of use. 4 stars.

<Title>great product...for the time it lasts
<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received an ipod nano 4gb as a gift. It was great other than it got WAY scratched up in about a day of usage. After having it & using it for about 3 weeks, I had it in my pants pocket, when i took my pants off that evening it destroyed the screen. It still worked but the screen was completely damaged. It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead. It would be one thing if all these problems came with a cheaper price, but $250 is an insane price to pay for something that will not be sturdy whatsoever & couple possibly give you less than 2 months of usage. I strongly recommend you pass this up & purchase a product that is actually reliable.

<Title>Two cents look large beside this thing
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I thought I should add my comments to the other 6 billion just to cover it all.  I have owned my Black Nano for a few weeks now and its my first. I have owned a few other playes in the past (mostly from Creative) but have not really liked them usually due to the capacity of them.  I got my Nano and removed the packing like I was doing open heart surgery.  My first impression was "Damn this thing is small".  I connected it to my PC (sorry not a Mac convert yet, baby steps) and itstall itunes and almost returned the thing.  I hate itunes the interface sucks, I had trouble getting music on the ipod and it made the whole process of getting such a great item stink. I guess one of the reasons is that I have a laptop and no mouse so I use the trackball function and it is difficult to drag stuff so I typically use shortcuts on the keyboard.  Yes I know since I am a itunes nube I am missing something but hey Apple is suppose to be easy and it wasnt. Since this is a review on the iPod and not the software I will say something about it.  It scratches easily!! (you don't have to know who Steve Jobs is to know this thing is delicate) Do yourself a favor and buy a case for it the same time you buy the player.  The player does come with a small sleeve but it is dumb and you would do better off with something else. The interface is fairly easy to use but a little touchy.  I have not found it yet but the light it bright on it so bright if you are listening to music in bed your best to not look at it when you change songs. There you go you might as well buy it weather you need it or not its history and it looks good.

<Title>?????
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Jeez, after reading all these durability issue reviews, I was expecting an IPOD made out of an eggshell!!!  What are you guys doing with these things?  I just got back from Best Buy, a store that has IPODs on a leash on display. As I was walking to them, I was thinking "Best Buy's got to be dumb as h^&* to be putting something so fragile on display like that." I was totally surprised to see that the only damage to the IPOD was a few scratches... BIG DEAL!!! I asked my friend that worked there how long that specific IPOD was on display, he said since around Thanksgiving. That's four months of consumer abuse and there wasn't anything worse than a couple cm scratch. Then I told him about the durability complains on Amazon (along with the fragile screen that breaks when dropping comment). My friend just laughed... then he picked it up and smacked it screen first on the display case (the dumba&%)... LOL... It didn't break (or even crack).  Giving the IPOD durability bashers the benefit of a doubt... maybe they happened to buy lemons, I wouldn't know. What I do know is that the IPOD on display at Best Buy was as durable as one would want (or at least as durable as I would expect). Everything scratches, big deal, as long as it's still readable & in working order, I don't see it as different than any other product, unless it's made of diamond.  I'm cheap, I have a really old Sony Sports discman.  This thing's supposed to be the toughest workout audio gear... it scratched up pretty bad in one workout, but it's worked perfect for over 5 years... all that matters!!!  If you want to test this product's durability, go to an electronics store to see the Ipods on display (most have them out).  You'll see that they are way more durable than people are reviewing.  (I'd rate it 5 stars (based on quality) but I don't agree with the price.  There's other MP3 players with more options that are cheaper and sound just as good.  My five star ratings go with them!)

<Title>Excellent function AND resilience!
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>* I'll start by countering the claims of the Nano being fragile...on 3 occasions now I've accidentally dropped mine from heights ranging from 25-40 ft in the air onto the forest floor (I work in trees)...and each time there's been NO HARM! (note: after the 2nd drop I did purchase a hard plastic case...so the last drop was a bit "protected".)  I attribute this amazing resiliency to the lack of any moving parts (flash card, no hard drive). I own regular Ipods that I would cringe if I drop a just few inches...and I know they would never handle half the fall mentioned above, even just ONCE, much less 3 times! * My experience with battery life has been excellent...just a few minutes charging gives me hours of listening...and an overnight charge will last about 12-15hrs ...much better than my standard Ipods or my Shuffle. * Sound quality and ease of use as with all Ipods is simply superb. *Finally, I highly recommend getting the Apple earphone lanyard...it turns the Nano into a no-more-tangles, wear-it-all-the-time, convenient-musical-dogtag/amulet (wear it openly or under a shirt). I like to pop in one earbud, listen to an audiobook and start/stop/pause etc. just by touch through my shirt...very protected and very discreet. The lanyard is great Nano tool... and combined they approach perfection!

<Title>Stellar quality, "hackable", fingerprint magnet 
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second product from Apple (the first was a 3rd Gen ipod), and I must say, I'm impressed with its sound quality and style. Since I was a college student, I got a pretty good 20% discount on ipod. The sound quality is good, when using good headphones, though understand that high-powered full size headphones require power...something the nano cannot always provide. Thus, there may be a lack of oomph when using such Headphones. The back case, though beautiful and can act as a good, quick mirror, is a horrible fingerprint magnet.   As usual with any popular product, there are hacks available for the ipod nano...such as video and game playing abilities (linux only).

<Title>WARNING: The Durability Issues Are NOT Exaggerated
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the black 4GB iPod Nano since 2/28/06 and the lcd screen has cracked on me today, 3/8/06. I did not, repeat, did NOT mistreat my Nano in any way. I only kept it in my coat pocket to listen to whenever I went for walks or when I needed to run errands. However, today, upon taking it out of the Apple-provided cloth sleeve in order to turn the thing on, I was horrified to see a ruined screen on my VERY babied Nano. I have never dropped it at all, nor are there even any scratches on it; the screen is simply extremely poorly constructed. I can not emphasize to those of you considering buying a Nano how much I regret buying this junk. I thought the well-reported issues regarding the lcd screens were overblown, but I promise you they are not. Hopefully Amazon will accept my return and grant me a refund so that I can buy a decent MP3 player. I warn you, buyer beware!  EDIT: Although I don't regret sending back this POS one bit, I gotta say that Amazon made me happy with a no hassle return. This is the first return I've made to Amazon and I am much relieved to know that they have strong customer support. I will definately continue to do business here.

<Title>This iPod is Awesome!!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've never owned an iPod before, but this is really cool!! It's very simple to use-I downloaded everything before the first two days. Music Quiz is really fun (it occupied my attention for 30 minutes). Solitaire is also cool and didn't take long to learn how to use. I disagree with most people who wrote a review of this product-I don't think it scratches easily. Sure, it shows your fingerprints, but I don't have any scratches on mine-yet. The packaging was also awesome, by the way. I would suggest going to the Apple support website before or after you get your iPod. It gives a lot of information on how to use the iPod and the features. I don't have Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Outlook (I use Mozilla Thunderbird) and the Apple website told you how to put things (such as contacts and calendars) on your iPod without having to get the extra programs. Although it's pretty expensive, it's a great buy!!!

<Title>not impressed
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to stay away from iPods for a long time, now I finally got an iPod nano and to be honest I'm not impressed. I must say it is BEAUTIFUL, it's nice, sleek and slim and doesn't feel cheap and best of all it fits in my pocket. And it yells out "I'm a nice piece of technology" And it is very easy to use, but what is the point of having 1000 songs and not being able to make a full day without having to recharge it? I charge it throughout the whole night then in the morning I take it to work at 8:30am and by the time I get home, around 6:30pm the battery is GONE! It will go maybe for about another 2 hours and that's it, so that's a BIG minus for the iPod nano if you like to listen music you will have to recharge it almost every day, jeez! I also have a sony minidisc and one AA battery goes over 50 hours, and even after it's almost death I can still squeeze an hour out of it. And the quality is the same; in fact the quality on the minidisc is better than on the iPod (play some Bjork or Kaya Project and listen to the details and compare it and you'll hear what I'm talking about). I like the iPod but I wish the battery could last at least about 24 hours. I was told that the normal iPod has better battery life, but I think it's too bulky. So yeah... I'll just have to deal with the fact that I must have a computer next to me every day. Well so much for taking it to Yosemite for a few days. Sorry iPod nano design, quality, style you get 5 Stars but for battery life 1 star.

<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this iPod as a gift, and it worked great for all of five days.  That was before the LCD screen became cracked when my purse thumped against another shopper at the mall while the iPod was in my purse. I was shocked that the iPod broke so easily, considering the impact of the thump wasn't any greater than what usually happens when people jostle against each other in busy crowds. The iPod was well secured in its protective sleeve in a zippered pouch, too.  The iPod still works, but I can't read the screen at all, which pretty much renders the gadget useless because I can't read it to program it.  Well, it was nice while it lasted, but I think when I go to replace my iPod, I'll go with a heftier version.

But I have a problem with the little earphone covers falling off! It has neat features like games, music quizes, photos and a stopwatch. The ipod nano has a screenlock where you pick a code and it locks it when u press the sreenlock button.So u can unlock it with your code!I thinks my nano is great and love it!

<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Everybody knows how great the Nano is as far as navigating it..as far as the screen, How Cute it is...However I HATED the sound so much..I actually sold it at a $100 loss to a friend just 2 weeks after buying it. Actually the Nano sounds fine, UNTIL you add any bass, or eq with bass. It is NOT my headphones as I've used Etymotic 4's..Koss Portapros, and nice Sennheiser phones. As soon as you add eq that also adds bass you'll hear a tiny bit of distortion EVEN at the lowest volume.It's not terrible,...but somebody should LISTEN to this thing. Forget about I-Tunes, Forget about the pretty screen..forget how cute it is. The sound is AWFUL(with eq)..and 4 that reason mine is now sold. I got a lesser known brand Iaudio U3 player and it sounds 100 times better overall plays video, has FM, records. Nothing will match the GREAT navigation of the Nano...but almost any flash player WILL sound better...I also own an Iriver, and Sony Flash mp3 player..Both truly sound WAY better than THE ipod! Apple really ought to fix this eq problem...and nobody notices this???

<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On Christmas, I recieved the iPod Nano as a gift and have been hooked on it ever since, but it still has some problems that a CD player didn't.   A very handy device, not much handier than a CD player, but it's pretty handy considering that you can forget about owning a CD wallet.  The sound is so good on it, that it was audible with about one hundreth of the sound on.  The screens don't stay crisp and unscratched for less than ten minutes.  They're just getting TOO small for convenience, when I'm jogging with it, it falls off of my armband and then I can't find it for days.  DON'T PUT YOUR NANO IN POCKETS OR ANYTHING WITH AN OPEN SIDE, it will just fall out.  The battery power is absolutely a nightmare, if you listen to it for 1.5 hours straight, it is usually COMPLETELY GONE by then.  The backlight isn't a great feature, considering that the only way that you can see anything on that dark little screen is with it on and with it on, you're draining more and more battery power by the second.  The photos feature is one of the utmost pointless thing ever created--THE SCREEN IS BARELY AN INCH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!  It is so difficult to both see and synchronize photos on your Nano that it's not worth the struggle.  The notes feature is also a pain to to put on your iPod, but it's slightly more handy than the photos feature.  Really, just buy an iPod Nano because you want to listen to music instead of lugging around a CD case everywhere you go.  The special features are overrated.

<Title>First time iPod-er
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As the title of the review suggests, this is my first foray into the wonderful (eek!) world of Apple iPods.  Up until this point I've managed to resist the compulsion to join the conforming masses and, almost literally, plug into the Matrix (that's really what we look like with the neat white wires flowing from our ears, removed from the actual going-ons of society).  But what the heck, I believe Jean Baudrillard himself suggested that nothing escapes the dominant logic of late capitalism.  If ever anything so embodied such logic, it is the iPod franchise.  You're not just paying for a product here, you're paying for the compulsion.  You're buying something for sure (and a very useful something as I will elaborate on when I end this rant), but you're also buying INTO something.    Now that you've been warned of the post-modern complexities associated with the iPod, I will expound upon the product's virtues and err.. um... non-virtues?    As you're probably aware of (assuming you live in a Westernized country and have use of your senses), the Nano is exceedingly thin and light.  Sure there are lighter, "more mobile" products out there (the MobiBlu and even Apple's own Shuffle come to mind), but the Nano is among the best in this sense.  It also packs quite a punch when it come to volume and sound quality.  It's nothing like the best audio out there (think Sennheiser headphones with one of Echo's audio products for PCs and Macs), but it is more than adequate for what we common swine use it for; passing the time as we pretend to be vigourously engaged with the treadmill or avoiding human intimacy on the subway.  It is also suprisingly easy to use.  I'm no technical dolt, so I'm probably not the best person to sing it's praises in this area, but I can say that my father, who has the wherewithal of a fish on the sidewalk when it comes to these things, figured it out in a minute or two.  Lastly, as Sam Clemens (Mark Twain, for the illiterati) would say, reports of its death by fragility seem to have been greatly exaggerated (i.e. it feels quite sturdy).  Now for some minor quibbles.  I find that the headphone jack's location, on the bottom of the Nano, is a bit cumbersome.  This is likely a result of the design, with the screen taking up the whole top side (I don't imagine the female end of the audio connection would fit behind that screen).  I also think that for the price it should come with some sort of lanyard or armband, but that's neither here nor there.  Apple is going to maximize profits and the best way is to sell the $2 POS they could include for $30 as a stand-alone (note to self: pick up some shares of Apple).  Finally, the little felt heads for the earbuds are (and I understand this problem has gained some notoriety) impossible to a) get on and b) keep on.  I suspect Apple provides two sets of them because they expect you to have lost your first set before you ever realize that they're so prone to displacement.  Overall, not a bad product, even for someone like me who hates all things (notice I don't qualify that!).  I'm giving it 4 stars, but only because I think it is over-priced.

<Title>Pro and Con
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipod nano is one of the best out there. It hold a lot of songs and very thin. I'm impressed. I like the design of the box and every included inside the bow. Speaking of what included inside the box is a USB 2.0(to charge it), the dock adapter(for older dock connector), earphone, earphone protection, itune disc, ipod manual and the Ipod itself. I really like the sound coming from the Ipod! It crystal clear! I kind of had trouble operating it at first but I got the hang of it later. Ok now the negative side. The ipod nano scratches very easily! If your planning to get the Ipod Nano you should get the case for it but don't get the ipod case. Get the ISkin cases. Another negative thing about it is charging it. It a pain that you have to have the computer have to be on in order for it to charge. (...). Well that mine review enjoy the ipod.

<Title>Wow
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have mocked the iPod for the last 2 years, calling it a stupid trend and degrading my friends who chose to purchase one. Earlier this week I put an iPod nano. All I can say is wow. I've previously used a Creative MuVo TxFm (which by the way is an oustanding device at a great price), but this is a whole different animal. The interface is a delight to use, and the integration with iTunes alone was worth the purchase price. It's just so completely seamless. It's unfortunate that you can't use a separate battery, or plug into a USB port without a cable (features of the MuVo), but the interface more than makes up for it. Make sure and get a case; you're going to love this one!

<Title>iPod Nano review from former iPod hater
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>By no means am I an iPod lover. For 3 years, I hated iPod and how much they were overrated. But after receiving this for a Christmas gift, I must admit, this is a brilliant piece of technology. It's tiny, 4GB of FLASH MEMORY, and it's beautiful. It does everything you want it to do.  Now to the cons. As you have heard by now, it scratches easily. Apple "fixed" this problem by including a flimsy little sock. It prevents scratches, but it's not very convenient to pull the Nano out of the sock everytime you want to do something. I personally bought the hard aluminum case from CoreCases.com and it works wonders. Also, the headphone jack placement is slightly annoying because it's a little difficult to remove the charging plug with the headphones right next to it, but it doesn't matter much. It's good that you're able to view photos on the Nano, but it's pretty much useless because the screen is way too small to efficiently view photos. Also, like any mp3 player, crappy earbuds included. Go out and get some decent headphones. The thing that bugs me most is that you are unable to move songs off your iPod. I know Apple is concerned about music copyrighting, but it's a little annoying if (like me) your computer crashed and you need to put your music back into your hard drive.  There are many cons, but none very major. The pros outweigh the cons, so I give it 4/5 stars.

<Content>It is a great player, but very specific, not for everyone. No FM-radio, cannot be used as a flash drive (you have to use iTunes soft & Apple proprietary non-standard USB cable), has a built-in li-ion battery -- i would prefer a regular AA or AAA battery so i dont depend on charging device or laptop. Anyway, Creative or iRiver attract me more ;-)

<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this ipod for my christmas, and i couldn't be happier. It is by far the best peice of electronics that i have. The second i unrapped it i ran upstairs and pluged it into my computer. Within 15 minutes (only because it take about 20 seconds a song to download them into your ipod)I was listening to 300+ different songs, and pictures!. If you are worried about it braking because of its small size, worry no more. It is very durable, altough one flaw is that the screen scratches easily. But thats no problem, I purchased a case for it that only cost 5 dollars,a and now i dont have the worry about it. The games on it are also very fun. It has BrickBraker, Parachute, Solataire, and a fun Music Quiz. It also has many other cool features. If you are not very good with computers, dont worry. You simply plug it in and up pops your itunes. Then you take any song you want on your ipod, and drag it to your ipod playlist. If you want them all, you can chose to have you computer automatically update your ipod with all your songs. If you think you're not into music enough to by the 4gb, dont listen to yourself. By the time get the ipod, you wont stop listening to music, so deffianatley buy the 4gb.  All in all it is a great product and i deffianatly suggest any one who wants an MP3 player, to buy this one!

<Content>* This Ipod nano is excellent! I bought it about a week ago and it is great. It is extremely light and thin, and I already have about 440 songs stored on it. I did have a problem with it; the fact that I couldn't update my songs. It annoyed me but I called Apple Customer Care and they were very helpful. Other than that I have no problems with it. I recommend that you leave the plastic on as long as possible but fingerprints and scratches show easily. I figured out that the back of the Ipod Nano can also be used as a mirror! This Nano will be great for long car rides, train rides, plane rides and waiting in the doctor's office. Great Idea Apple!

<Title>I love my nano!
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After having many troubles with my Creative Zen Micro it felt amazing to have a mp3 player that actually worked in my hands! I have been so happy with my nano.  Sound- Great! The volume controls are simple to use and the nano has never froze on me.  Music space- I am in aw by the amount of music you fit in this little thing! I mean I bet in the next three years I could fill the whole thing but 1) Im probably going to get a new ipod within the next three years and 2) you can delete songs so with the possiabilty of fitting 1,000 songs I think this is enough for anyone.  Size- At first it seems really small and you feel like its going to break everytime you touch it but then you get used to it.  I have dropped mine 2 times and it only has a few fingerprints.  The iPod Nano also fits easily into your hand.  Durablity- I do have to admit that it does get stracted and smudged easily but that problem can easily be fixed by a cheap little case  Software- SO EASY! Just follow the insturctions and its snap.  Just insert the cd and set it up then restart the computer and then when you start it up again itunes is ready to go!  The one problem- I wish it had a better battery!  I can only listen to musuic for about 6 hours before needing to charge it.  Overall I am serioulsy loving my first apple product.  Its easy to use and great fun!

<Title>tiny form, huge function
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Upon opening the box, the first thing to surprise me was the size. It's amazingly small and light. The overall feel of it is pleasant. Excellent design. Not just the actual nano, but the design of the interface too. The screen is bright, clear, and has superb color. It's easy to see that a great deal of thought went into the design.  After installing the included iTunes software on my laptop with no problems, I connected the nano with the supplied USB cable. It was incredibly easy to get music from my CD library to the nano. Very intuitive. Make sure you're connected to the Internet when you're importing CDs. This makes it possible for your CDs to be "found" and all the information (track names, album name, artist, genre, etc.) to be automatically entered into your iTunes library. Much easier than typing it in manually. The process of importing is surprisingly quick. But I imagine that is dependent on your computing platform (mine's a screamer).  After building up a library of about 20 CDs the nano had fully charged. I ejected the nano from iTunes, disconnected it and plugged in the supplied apple earbuds. To be honest, I was disappointed with the sound. Not bad, just not what I'm used to. So I plugged in the Shure E3c earphones I purchased earlier. WOW!!  This little thing can reproduce sound very well. All the subtle nuances and space is there. I'm impressed. As much with the capabilities of the nano in the quality of the signal it produces as I am with the AAC compression algorithm. During import I used the AAC (default I think) compression, and glad I did. Excellent sound quality  I've now imported 476 songs into my nano and I've used about half of the 3.7 GB available. (I guess .3 GB is used for the...firmware? interface?)   I've explored some of the features, like the EQ feature. I encourage nano owners to become familiar with this feature. It makes a noticable difference in the sound. Especially if you're using quality earbuds. The more I play around with this thing the more impressed I am with the overall design.  I got over 14 hours of play time on a complete discharge. Following lithium-ion battery protocols I don't frequently deep discharge. Even so I'm getting about 12 hours of play time. I follow the recommendations from apple on how to extend battery life, and they seem to be working.   I agree with other reviewers on the scratches. Even though I took care to keep the nano in its provided case, after a single day the front face showed scratches. I haven't dropped mine so I can't attest to it's sturdiness. My only concern at this point is the battery replacement issue. But from what I've found that seems to be the biggest "failing" of iPods in general. I'm confident that capitalism will "fix" that too.  Overall I think this product is one of those technologies that is changing how we live. Radio, TV, cassette tape, CD, DVD, iPod. What's next? If I had to choose over again I'd get the 8 GB nano. Apple doesn't make one? They should. You can never have too much memory, or too big a hard drive. When I comes to digital playback you can never have too much storage space. You won't regret owning one of these.

<Title>Slick form and features, disappointed with battery life
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall, I am pleased with the performance of the Nano.  However, I feel that the sound is a bit flat without activating the EQ functions.  The biggest disappointment is the battery life.  From full charge with sounds off and backlight at 5 seconds and few activations, I am only getting slightly less than 5 hours of life.  Not that big a deal since I do not anticipate using it for long stretches.  Hopefully it will not get worse.

<Title>Great For Runs, but the Battery Sucks!
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I held out for an MP3 Player until the Nano - I wanted a small light player for running, and the Nano fit the bill.  It is a fine little machine except for the battery life.  For me, it has been nowhere near the 14 hours advertised, and I usually turn it on and let it play during my runs, so it isn't a too-much-fiddling problem.  It usually runs out of juice in the 6-7 hour range.  Not a show-stopper since I'm not an ultra-marathoner (yet - ha!), but disappointing in light of everything else it offers.  Based on research and comments on iPods in general, battery life seems to be an on-going problem with Apple. Hopefully, they'll do the right thing and fix the problem, if not in a recall than in the future models.

<Title>Great toy, I like it, except for battery life
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the black version, and a clear acrylic case to cover it. Even with the case on, its still very cool and very small.  I like it, and have only one problem with it, that the battery lasts only 4-6 hours if you access the menus or pix.  Apple claims "up to" 14 hours, so I can't fault them. Just be aware fooling with it will drain the battery faster, and you'll need an adapter or a computer with USB hookup to charge it again.   I'm sure some people are hardcore and have their ipod hooked up to their computer every day, so it won't be a problem for most. The battery issue is just something to keep in mind if you take it on a trip.  other than that, even though the screen is small, I like being able to put pictures on it. The screen is big enough for viewing the music info though.

<Content>4 GB. That is it. 4. Any serious music listener knows that 4 GB is hideous! If you want an mp3 player, get a creative nomad! Those are even better than iPods! GASP! '_' &lt;Whoa!) Who cares about what Eminem uses or what the trend is? Nanos still stink! Why do people think that iPods are so great, anyway? If someone can explain to me why, I will stop making fun of them. For now, I still am convinced that iPods are a waste of money. This 4 GB iPod is more expensive than a 40 GB Creative Nomad Zen Xtra Jukebox.

<Content>I know that there are some questions about durability, but let me tell you my experience.  I traveled back from San Diego with the nano in my pocket, and somehow those pants I was wearing got mixed up with others.  2 Days later I was looking for my nano and found in in the washed and dried pants.  Although it shows a little wear and tear for it's experience, (a few scratches to the metal back and a microscopic nick in the front)it amazingly still works with the exception of the backlight, which luckily i can fix.  A great buy!

<Title>Best iPod ever!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a real gadget person, this being my 4th MP3 player.  This one is definitely the best so far.  My first was a Philips 128 MB, which was nice but not enough storage.  The second was a Dell 15 GB, which was also great, but very large and bulky.  The third was a Sony 20 GB Network Walkman, which was small and had great sound, but the interface was absolutely horrible.  The iPod Nano combines all the good features of my past MP3 players.  Granted it's only 4 GB, but it's still enough for plenty of music.  Besides, it's 4 GB of flash memory, not hard drive.  It's incredibly small, has a very nice interface, and great sound quality.  Also, iTunes is the best music software I have used - better than Windows Media Player, WinAmp, MusicMatch, SonicStage, and all others I have ever used.  Also, keep in mind that it scratches easily, especially the black version.  Make sure to get a case with it; I recommend the Tune Belt Armband Case, because the entire front is covered by clear plastic, but the click wheel can still be used.  Also, the armband is detachable.  The only reason you wouldn't want the iPod Nano is if you have to have more than 4 GB of music with you at one time.  To me, the small size, great sound quality, great interface, and decent battery life make it a winner.

<Title>iPod Nano
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I definitely love the iPod Nano, it's beautiful and ultra slim!  I do have to agree that it is VERY VERY FRAGILE!  It's different than the older one, not talking about scratches at all, since that's reasonable.  The LCD screen on the iPod Nano is absolutely the most fragile I've seen in electronics, mainly because it is SO thin.  You cannot put ANY pressure onto the LCD screen, not even an accidental bump, it will ruin the screen with lines just like that!  And yes, you cannot even drop it a foot above on anything, it will once again ruin the LCD screen.  The iPod itself will be fine, it'll play no problem, and no scratches or damage on the surface of the iPod, but the LCD screen is done.  Other than that, I LOVE the iPod Nano.  Just make sure you protect that LCD screen like an eggshell.

<Title>I pod my ilov 
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What can i say? Well, music and technology are my fields and this it's my third iPod. The first one was the iPod photo 40Gb (it was for sell few weeks and then replaced by the 30 Gb and 20 Gb versions), excelent music player, awesome inteface and very useful for sharing photos. The second one was the iPod mini blue 4Gb which was very good and quite more portable and discrete but lacked the color screen and as i was already used to carry my photos (by that time about 2000) i found out that the old iPod photo was still the most useful for me.  Then... comes the nano, smaller, black and with color screen, i doubted a lot when i ordered it specially because of the "easy to scratch" issue, but when i received it... I SAW ONE OF THE PRETTIEST THINGS TECHNOLOGY HAS BRING TO US, i mean i was speechless, it is not the same seeing it on internet or TV that actually having one on your hand. I kept it in its cover until next day (after its first nigth charge) and then i cut a PDA screen protector and apply it over its front (except the touch wheel) and voila! Now i hardly ever go out without this guy or his big brother, they really change the way i hear music, help me to listen and relisten those cds that i was too busy to take to the car-office-house or even search in the house everytime.  I understand the change Apple made, the iPod mini can be seen and compared as something similar to Creative Zen 5Gb and may be other music players in the market but the nano is just another level.  Just one note: Don't even think of using it if it doesn't have a protector for its front, as i said i choosed a plastic PDA screen protector becaused it doesn't add size/weight and also allow to use an additional one if someday i find one that i like.

<Title>Best MP3 player bar none...accept no substitutions
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It looks like a work of art and is so small it fits in any of jean pockets.  This is the iPod to have lets get into why.  Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. Its thinner than a number 2 pencil and less wide then your inner jean pocket. The first time you see it your jaw just hits the floor in amazement. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.  Solid State - The iPod nano has not one moving part inside of its casing. The memory it uses is flash memory which you see digital camera memory cards using. It can be shaken and dropped and dont worry because this ipod isnt going to skip. That is how apple got this baby so thin.  Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is the best value. It is only $50 more than the 2-gigabyte model, so you get twice as much storage, for only $50 more. But the beauty for you is that on eBay you can get it for even less! Yes thats right cheaper because that is the value of eBay.  Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It is 1.5 inches and is big enough to show 3 full lines of text so your album name and artist show up along with the song name. This baby even holds your photos and contacts. Photos look great on the 1.5 inch screen.  Click Wheel - The click wheel on this baby is great. Its slightly smaller than previous versions, but now it is apple designed and not a third parties part. So it feels even better and by having apple design it they were able to make the nano even thinner.  Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but now Apple realized that black is becoming the new white and you should too. The nano in black is beautiful.  Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket if it only lasts 2 hours. Well have no fear the iPod nano brings in an impressive 14 hours of continuous play.  In conclusion all i have to say is get yourself an iPod nano. In terms of size, usability and compatibility accept no substitutions.

<Title>The coolest portable device around.
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just about everyone has heard of the popular iPod. Now that music is changing to the mp3 format CD sales are down and CD players are becoming something along the lines of the cassete players. Programs like Napster and iTunes are where people are getting their music now. When mp3 players first came out the orginal iPod was real popular. Now it's a huge icon when it comes to music. Some people get them just for the cool factor. While they are hip they are also the best mp3 player on the market. They also have the best music program, iTunes. After about 7 different versions Apple has released the iPod Nano which replaces the ultra popular iPod Mini. Many people are wondering if they should fork over another 250 dollars to get the new Nano. Well my answer is yes. The Nano supports photos which the mini didn't. It also has a color screen. It is also about half the size and is much sleeker than the kiddy styled mini. I was lucky enough to get one of the rare black iPod Nano 4GB version. I love the interface on the device. It is extremely easy to use and the little gadget also has some games. I do not know if Apple will let you download more games in the future through iTunes but if they do it would be pretty neat. Like I said earlier iTunes is the best mp3 program around. The iPod's only downfall is that it only supports mp3. No WMA for all you WMA fans. It is mainly designed that way so you have to use iTunes. I can understand that in a way but people with the Windows ME operating system are stuck in the cold. It only supports Windows XP/2000 and of course Mac. There are some third party programs but I don't think they are very reliable. The iPod Nano comes in three sizes. 4GB, 2GB,and 1GB. Which holds 1000, 500, and 250 songs. The prices are from 150 to 250. They are well priced for such a wonderful device. I really recommend this deivce.

<Title>ipod nano pleased me well
<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me just say that I had the ipod nano since around October 22 and I have never changed my opinion on it. Many people were complaining about the scratch issue before and it appears that it has faded away.   It is not really a big deal if you only treat it well. I have kept the screen protector on for 3 months and also but the black incase flip case for it. Now I don't have to worry about the condition about the ipod nano since I know it will be protected, and it is!  The only reason why I have wrote this short review was just to tell people that it's alright, the ipod nano is a strong piece of equipment that just has a fragile casing, but as long as you keep it protected, it would work and look good while doing it.   The second thing that I should point out is that the stock white ipod headphones that come with the ipod nano and all ipods in that manner are garbage. The sound clarity and bass are not the best, or possibly the worst in that matter. They also break after a while and by break I mean crack or popped, and also for some reason the cable freezes in the cold. Just get a good pair of Sony's MDR series or Sennsheiners and ur set.   The last thing that I want to add is that since iPods are used for carrying large amounts of data (especially songs and photos (now videos)) it would be wise to have a backup of all the files. As some of you might know the supplied software itunes is the only software that works with ipods and it does not feature ipod to pc syncronization, which means that when your computer crashes, you would probably want to put the songs back onto is using your ipod. There are a few programs that help support this such as Anapod or XPlay 2. I recommend xplay 2 since I got it free off limewire and it uses windows' like interface.  I managed to get all my songs back from my ipod to my computer using this, and you should to.   So there's my review. I highly recommeend buying the ipod nano since it is small and has large amounts of storage considering it's size, just remember to buy a case, headphones, and sync software. :)

<Content>The Nano is a great iPod and is better than the Mini and Shuffle it isn't without it's flaws.   Pros  Sweet Design Ultra Thin Good Amount of Songs Easy to Use In Color  Cons  Shows Fingerprints and Scratches Easy Expensive Breaks if You Drop It  Well I love mine but if you are a klutz and drop stuff alot or have someone who likes to grab at stuff I don't think it is for you.   Enjoy the Nano  
<Overall>4
