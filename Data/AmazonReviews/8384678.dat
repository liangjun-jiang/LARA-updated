<Title>Great Little MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have really enjoyed using this mp3 player. It holds quite a few albums, so I can keep a variety of music on it for whatever mood I'm in. It also records voice, and can play and record FM stations. It is also easy to add or delete music - just drag & drop. The only downfall I have experienced is recording from an FM station. I was listening to a discourse, but wanted to record it as well. So, I hit record, set the player down, and didn't have the earbud cord extended. Since the cord acts as an antenna, the recording was staticy and unusable. Next time I try it, I will make sure the cord is extended or keep one of the buds in to make sure the reception is clear. Overall, I am satisfied with this product and have recommended it to friends.

<Title>Low quality and terrible sound.

<Content>Got the mp3 player and the headphone jack was defective. Had to be in just the right position to get sound. When I could hear it the sound was not very good. Nothing compared to my iaudio U3 or F2 by Cowen.

<Title>So happy with my purchase
<Date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was a bit hesitant to order this product because of the previous reviewer, but I thought the price and the features were right, so I thought I'd take a chance.  Please see the comment on the previous review; the sound is great on the product.  There are a few things to consider with the product.    1.  You must organize the files yourself on your desktop or they will be jumbled on the player, but I actually like that because I can organize it the way I want.  You can make folders for artists and put all the songs in them to organize it easily.  It works just like a jumpdrive, so there are not problems with taking music from other computers or giving music to other computers.  This also means you must know where the music files are saved on your computer. 2.  Only mp3 files work, and I originally thought this was a problem because I use itunes.  However, itunes can convert the files files to mp3 fomat if they're not yet in that format.   3.  The functioning of this product is slightly more complicated than an ipod, but it's easy once you get used to it.    Also, the voice recorder and FM player work well.  The player is also very light, and the display is easy to read.  Take that ipod! For a player that's cheaper than an ipod shuffle (even including shipping) you can actually see what songs are on the player, you can choose the song you want to play, and it has double the memory.  I'm also planning to travel abroad this summer, so I'm happy that I don't have to worry about getting a converter or anything.  This player just uses on AAA battery that's very easy to replace, and it lasts a long time.  I submitted a question to the Trekstor website, and I received a helpful response within a couple days.  I chose the 3-5 day shipping, and the player arrived in 2.
