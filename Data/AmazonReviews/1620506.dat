<Title>Finally a true mp3 sports player
<Date>Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been looking for a portable MP3 player to use at the gym for some time now, and this unit is the first that appears to be geared for the athelete.  For the most part the player fits the bill, providing a lightweight unit that fits snuggly into a flexible arm sleeve.  Here are the only downsides in my view:<p>1. The headphones while designed to stay out of the way with a cord that goes down your backside and around to the mp3 player on your arm is a little awkward.  Specifically the two earpieces are attached to one another via a plastic arm, which can dislodge if you are doing excercises where you lean your head back.<p>2. Software setup was not a breeze.  It took me a few attempts where my computer rebooted in the middle of accessing the unit for no apparant reason.<p>3. the headphone connector to the unit is a bit sensitve.  I have to wiggle the connector on mine when i attach to the mp3 player to get full stereo sound.  Another pair of headphones would probably solve the problem, but it would have been nice to have this work with no problem.<p>Having said all of this, i am happy with this thing.  The only improvement i would make would be a pair of wireless earpieces, but i guess i will have to wait a couple of years before those appear on the market.

<Title>All Good Things Don't Come In Small Packages
<Date>Wed Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  It is a great size <br>for athletes to use during exercise.  I find it to be light weight and the arm band is very comfortable. The extension is nice but somewhat on the high maintenance end if you just want to put the player on and run.  Sound is good and skipping is not an issue.<br>Downsides I found were that it came with very limited instructions for downloading music and reinstallation of software is often necessary to get your computer to recognize the device.  After two weeks of ownership it has demagnitized twice despite taking all of the necessary precautions.  And good luck if you need customer support.  It only took 12 tries to get through to them.  Best to try at 7:00amEST.  <br>Overall, good size and fun to use, but downloading or changing your music can take some time.

<Title>NOT RECOMMENDED
<Date>Sat Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i was so excited when i recieved the item, but all that excitment quickly turned into frustration.  setup is confusing, there is no instruction booklet that comes with the player.  installing the program/driver seemed pretty straight forward but i had to refer to the nike/philips website a few times.  even after all that it still did not work.  i then tried to call the 1800 support number and they had no clue of how to do anything.  so finally i gave up on it and now i am waiting for philips to contact me back with a way of exchanging the item for another because they said it must be something wrong with the product.  regardless, i think this looks good but performs poorly if you can get it to perform.

<Title>The only exersize will be when you throw it against the wall
<Date>Sun Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Against the advice of the reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased this unit because there are not that many sports MP3 players. After six hours of trying to download songs to the device, I finally was able to get a few songs on though I have no idea how to do again. The real problem is the Musicmatch software which is very unstable. While it works fine for burning cds, not so for downloading to this device. <p>Now that I have some songs on it, I have to say the quality is good and the armband works well.<p>Would I recommend buying this unit? Yes, if your idea of exercise is burning calories through frustration and anger. If not, you would be better off humming while you run.

<Title>up & "running" in 5 minutes
<Date>Wed Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>the reviews above made me worry - but as a sucker for "small electronics" and a runner I could not resist the nike-philips psa64 (psa[64 ???).<br>My experience was different from the reviews; I plugged the device in my PC (running XP) - loaded the CD&drivers; even ignored the recommended reboot - using Microsoft's Media Player 9 I could load a mix of MP3 and WMA-files and I was off in literally a couple of minutes. Easy!<p>I am not impressed by the instructions (no suggestion on what is required and what is mandatory - see WMP use) and the software install (not certified my MS and why ask to reboot if not needed?) - hence 4 stars, not 5...

<Title>difficult at first but worth it
<Date>Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Like everyone else, I had trouble at first downloading it. I then just followed the setup from the disk and then found it easy if I read everything. I have windows ME and had very little problems. It just took awhile due to the fact that there is not an instruction guide. In all, I am having no problems with it and it is great to work out with. The arm band is great and its easy to use once you get the hang of it.

<Title>Big Regrets!!!
<Date>Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made!  I am not that bothered by the 8 hours I spent trying to get the device to work.  The directions are awful; the software is terrible; and the effort required to download the first set of songs was hardly worth it!  Once I finally figured out how to download songs, things seemed OK.  The device was working well and the sound quality was pretty good.  <p>This lasted for 3 months and then one side of the headphones just stopped working.  Philips sent me new headphones, no questions asked, and I was up and running once again.  Things appeared to be going fine until another 7 months passed and one side of the new headphones stopped working.  OK . . .I figured I would just learn to live with this problem, but then the headphones just stopped working all together!  I called Philips.  They were supposed to send me new headphones a month ago and I still have not received them yet!  I haven't even had this product for one year!!<p>At this point I don't want new headphones.  Instead I am going to buy a different device.  My overall experience with this product was bad and I would therefore not recommend that anyone purchase this unit.  It is poorly made and I think Philips knows this!

<Title>Don't bother with this thing; keep shopping!
<Date>Fri Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player a few months ago, so I've had plenty of time to use it. First of all, the headset is next to useless. If you plan on any kind of exercise while wearing this, you'll see what I mean. The ear pieces will easily slip out of your ears. Plus it has magnets and a remote control. Magnets? What's the purpose of a remote control when the player is only inches away? I immediately replaced it. Second, the instructions that come with the player are minimal, very minimal. It's more like a short series of diagrams. Also, since it only requires 1 AAA battery (which I had considered a plus), it goes through batteries pretty quickly.<br>On the other hand the sound quality is pretty good. You do have to use Music Match to download to it, and that's not the easiest thing to use either.<br>There are other mp3 players out there and I'm going to start looking again. Unfortunately there aren't that many to choose from that are designed for sports or workout activities.

<Title>Truly for the active and on the go.
<Date>Fri Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The bad first:  Complaints about the instructions is valid.  Instructions are cryptic at best.  But if you know anything about computers, you'll be fine.  If you don't, this is what you do: install the Nike psa software to format the internal hard drive.  You only need to format your drive when it has to be erased and reset.  If you have Windows XP, it will auto-detect the psa when you plug it in the USB port.  Just stick the CD in when prompted.  WARNING:  Windows XP will tell you the software isn't qualified.  Just accept and continue.  Then install the Music Match software to download music to your psa.  Once the Music Match software is installed, you can read on-line instructions on how to use it. What else?  The headphones do suck.  But you can probably afford to buy a better pair with the $200-$300 you save by NOT buying the iPod.<p>The good:  If you run, if you're physically active, if you go to the gym, this is the best.  It's not bulky.  In fact it's pretty ergonomic.  I saw some guy trying to lift weights with a rectangular iPod hanging in a pouch from his triceps.  It looked dorky.  By contrast I had someone tell me the psa looked "sexy."  Nice, eh?  That's why you go to the gym, right?  I got caught in a rainstorm with this thing.  No problem.  It's not waterproof, but the design will keep it intact so long as you don't dive into a puddle of water.<p>You choose:  The equalizer is limited.  But if you've been running for 30 minutes in 80 degree heat, you're not thinking Bang and Olufsen here, ya know?  Batteries aren't rechargeable.  One AAA will last you about a week if you're really active.  That kinda sucks when your battery peters out halfway through your run in the middle of nowhere.<p>All in all, I'm in love with my little psa.  But do yourself a favor and get the 128 MB player instead.  The 64 MB IS NOT upgradeable, and you'll want the 2 hours that 128 MB will give you.

<Title>Couldn't workout without this thing!!
<Date>Wed Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've read a few bad reviews about this MP3, but have to say I haven't had any trouble at all with mine!  I love it!!  The software was easy for me to load (I have windows ME) and is user friendly I think as far as downloading music.  It is great to run with and holds plenty enough music to get me through a heart-pounding workout!<br>If I had to say anything bad it would be that I don't care for the headphones.  They don't fit in my ears that well at times and when running they have slipped out especially when I start sweating.  So, I will replace those.  Also, the remote thing it comes with is kind of wasteful.  I have yet to use it.  But, besides that, I love this thing and when/if it stops working, I will get another!

<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a fine piece of electronic, nice sound, nice and easy controls, very nice the arm band, but the headphones are a little heavy and keep falling off the ears, just replace them with a regular headphones and you are good to go!  64 megs holds up o 15 mp3's good enough to my work out routine.  I wish they made a belt holder or something like that.  OVERALL, preatty nice MP3 Player.  PS: If you are st00pid and don't know how to install it..., don't write a bad review....

<Title>Software is ridiculous
<Date>Wed Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Nike PSA player itself looks like a great little device, and is the perfect size for working out. I wouldn't know firsthand, though, because I never could get the driver software to install. The MusicMatch software installed quickly on Windows XP, but the drivers would not. After trying all of the updates from the Philips websites, and Firmware updates, still, nothing. This was all attempted by a network engineer who troubleshoots software and hardware installations for a living. I then attempted to use the Philips help line, but they were of no help at all. After reading numerous reviews, it is clear to me that there are definite problems with the software, and it's not worth taking a chance by purchasing this product.

<Title>Was happy.  Now, not so much.
<Date>Mon Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought my MP3 player about a year and a half ago.  It was a purchased on a whimm.  I did no research and saw it on sale at the store.  I was happy, I used the Windows media player on both the windows me and windows xp operating systems.  Only to have the player stop working.  I can download all the music I want to it, I just can't get it play any of it.  A year and a half of moderate use, no dropping, no getting wet, only going through about 4 or 5 batteries, and now its dead.  I'll leave it up to you whether you think a year and a half of use is worth the price.  <p>Oh as a side note, if you decide to purchase one definately go bigger than the 64 MB It has about 45 min to an hour of songs, which can bug you when they start to repeat.<p>Over all the time I had with the player was good, if terribly short.

<Date>Mon Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Simply stated - this product just isn't compatible with XP. Even if it installs correctly it will fail after a period of the player sitting idle or the player batteries running down.<p>Technical support is a joke, they have a &quot;customer is always wrong attitude&quot; if you can reach them.<p>This thing may, or may not, work for you but I don't recommend taking the risk.

<Title>A bit "iffy" but perfect for running/cycling
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this about a month ago for $50 since it was a pain to go for a run with a CD player in my hand.  INSTALLATION - Although it was a bit tricky to get it installed in WinXP (just download the drivers from the website and point to those manually for install - don't do auto), I was able to access the flash memory just fine.  It has, however, caused sudden reboots on my PC soon after I transfer files to it so I usually reboot myself to avoid any problems.  ACCESORIES - The arm strap was the big selling point for me since I'd have nothing to carry.  It comes with good headphones that don't fall off while running.  I don't use the remote part since I mind as well just press the buttons on the player strapped to my arm.  I don't like the magnets used to attach the headphone cord to our clothing, since I am afraid of having the magnets ruin my TV/monitor or something else.  SOUND QUALITY - MP3s encoded at 192 kbps sound great throught this player.  Too bad it doesn't support OGG which would allow better sound at smaller sizes.  BATTERY LIFE - Very good.  They say 10 hrs.  Overall, this player is not perfect in every sense but for the use/price I am very happy with it.

<Title>I've bought 5 of these!! they go KAPOOT on you!!
<Date>Mon Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Okay at first loved this even purchased the one with more memory 128 and the little window, however after some time they just up and die on you!! in fact I have 4 of these sitting in my car at this very minute that have all just died???? I'm going to get a box and send them all out to Phillips because this was ridiculous. I would recommend doing some major investigating for all the MP 3 players out there I have had my collection for about 2 years now. The arm band is handy, they are small enough not to get in your way, it holds enough music for a hour work out, down loading the music is fairly simple once you get the hang of it, but sometimes (it may just be my computer) the computer doesn't recognize that is it there.    Oh yea and the rubber buttons can become a challenge to press down on you end ruining the face of the player because sometimes you'll have to use your finger nails which eventually cuts into the rubber.

<Title>Piece of Crap, Don't Bother, Seriously
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This item is a pure piece of crap! First of all it does not work well with WinXP. Had to find out the hard way it would only find the driver need if you have Win 2000 or 98. The frustration of trying to install the music was hardly worth it so that you can only download about 14 songs! If you have Win 2000 or 98 and want something that will only last you a couple of months, this is the product for you. Tried to contact Phillips, they act is if they didn't even realize they made this product. If you need a serious piece of equipment PLEASE DO NOT GO WITH PHILLIPS! Consider yourself warned, do not become a victim. I will never purchase another Phillips item again! I would give it zero stars, but hey i had to put something.

<Content>Compared to other mp3 players, this is a piece of crap.  Yes, it works, but it only holds about 30 songs, and when you go on a long run, it loops!  How annoying.  I ran a half marathon with this and heard all the songs 3 times!    Also when we bought a new PC, it wouldn't connect because it's so old.
