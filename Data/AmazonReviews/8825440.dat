<Title>Flimsy and small
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is a nice little package - if you like small packages. The problem I have is the little toggle button in the front - They make it look like a dial in the pics - but do not be fooled it is a flimsy black toggle button. that is easily broken. The toggle is a two piece button that should not have been used.   Spend a little more and get the bigger Zen or IPod

<Title>Creative's products have problems, Zen V is no exception
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my Dad as his christmas present becuase he said he wanted an MP3 player. For 100 bucks it was a good deal, or so I thought. After he installed the software, Windows kept on giving errors saying that the device wasn't connected or something was wrong with the hardware. After reinstalling the fireware on the device (Creatives support is really not user friendly) Windows still could not detect it. Since my Dad lost the box, I couldn't return it to the store that I bought it from.   Like the last Creative product I bought, the Zen Mirco, I've encountered problems like no other. Save yourself some time and a headach. Look form something else OTHER then a Creative.

<Title>Awesome player for the price!
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very nice compact player. I've had this player for 2 1/2 weeks and  have had no problems whatsoever. It has worked flawlessly. Downloading music is very simple. The clock, alarm, customizable EQ, microphone, organizer, and FM radio are all nice touches. I added a V skin which really help it from slipping out of your hands. Headphone sound quality is good but I had a problem with the foam cover falling off all the time so I've upgraded to V moda bass headphones. This is a very nice system with a ton of features for under $100.00

<Title>Pros Great Sound Size- Minor Cons
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player as a gift.  I am really impressed with the sound quality. Once you get the hang of it, navigation is easy. Cons Recharging the battery is a pain.  The shipping Mini-USB to USB connector also serves as a means of charging the battery while connected to the computer.  An A/C wall charger can be ordered from Creative.  I don't understand why this component wasn't included in the original package.  After all charging off PC takes *forever*. If you travel without a laptop and didn't order the additional wall charger, once your battery runs out - you're sunk.  Pros Cnet gave the Zen V Plus high ratings and called it an "Editors Pick". On the downside, accessories are not available at retail stores that sell the Zen.  As of this writing, the only place you can buy them is at Creative.

<Title>very pleased
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old son. At first I was upset, it is much smaller than I had expected.However he loves it. The software is very user- friendly and he needed only basic help from me in the begining, now he can load all his own music without assistance. It does have a joystick-type button to access the  menu so I would recommend caution and patience when using that. So far, he has had no issues with it.Definitely worth the money. The sound quality is amazing. One thing that is not made clear though: it does have a FM tuner, BUT you can NOT record from it, we thought you could.

<Title>Unreliable
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought this product had a great price and excellent features, and when it worked it was actually pretty excellent.  My complaint though, was that it crashed very frequently. With each firmware upgrade things sometimes got better and sometimes got worse. I had to carry a paper clip with it so that I could reset it when this happened (which happened every day). The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.  Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing. It's dead.  I was very sad to see it die, because I hoped they might eventually fix the crashing problem with firmware upgrades, and despite the crashing everything else was very good (good sound, pleasant interface, even had a line-in recording and built in microphone).

<Title>great but dissapointing
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product is great. It is so light and small that it fits anywhere. The screen is bright and easy to work. I am dissapointed because the product does say that you can fit 500 songs but that is not true. They should be truthful and say that it is possible to fit up to 500 songs since you have to take into consideration the actual "size" of the song. In other words, how long the song may be has to do with how many you can fit. All in all I was able to fit 211 songs. Not even close to half but I do like it.

<Title>Better with at least 2G of storage
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only drawback would be that if you really want to add videos to it,make sure you get one with at least 2G of storage or more.The videos are not compressed and therefore take up more space.The file size doubles when converted.  I have had to reset the unit a couple of times but overall,I'm cool with the Zen V Plus.I like Creative's products and will likely buy another Zen V Plus player but I will get one with more storage.

<Title>feels cheap, navigation is odd, but works like a charm
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>overall, for the price, it's an awesome little audio/video player. the video, although on a really tiny screen, looks fantastic. it feels very futuristic to be watching such quality video on such a tiny device. it also records audio with a built-in mic and plays the radio. it's really amazing how much technology they can cram into a tiny peace of plastic. that said, it has its problems. the navigation is goofy; there are only two buttons even though it appears there is plenty of room for four, and to pull up the menu you have to hold down the 'back' button and wait. which i feel is more than a little counter-intuitive. it sometimes stops responding when the battery gets low, but after charging it's right back to normal. i wouldn't recommend it as a gift, because at first glance (and touch) it seems cheap, but if you're looking for a tiny, light, inexpensive device for yourself that can play multiple audio and video formats, this one does the trick.

<Content>This is a great product. I bought it because it was cheap but it has a lot of bonus features other than a mp3 player. The voice recorder and the FM radio are a great addition. Plus this comes with a lot of unadvertised features such as Clock and Alarm settings. The video quality is good although the screen is on the smaller side. Cons: Tiny scroll button
