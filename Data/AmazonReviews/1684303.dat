<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love music and try to have something playing all the time.  I have three iPods and my only gripe is that I have to use headphones.  I HATE ear buds.  I thought the speakers would be tinny but they are really more than adequate to enjoy tunes.  I place it on my desk at work and it plays all day.  Great battery life.  As an earlier post noted - one minus is that there is not a separate a/c recharger.  I am tempted to use my Shuffle recharger that has the USB receptacle . . . maybe not - with my luck the thing will fry.

<Title>K5 player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This K5 aka MP3 player stands up to expectations set by the manufacturers description. I experienced one problem, there isn't a way to charge the player in a wall outlet. This posed a problem while on vacation. The website stated charging took about 4 hours on a PC and 2 hours in a wall outlet. When I called Samsung I was told there is no outlet recharge connection nor do they see a date there would be one.

<Title>Ugh...
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A friend of mine bought this for her husband as a gift and I got commissioned to load it with music since their computer does not have Windows XP. This was the first annoyance. Then, since I am an iTunes user and an iPodder, we had to load all of their music onto my computer in mp3 format into the Samsung Media Player thinking we would be able to make playlists only to find we could not. So, we then copied it over to WMP so that we could make playlists. Once we got all of the music into the little bugger we were all very impressed by the sound quality of it and had no complaints, but there are definitely more user friendly products on the market.

<Title>perfect little unit
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 is an outstanding and unique player.  At work, I drive and walk around outside and I need to be aware of my surroudings, so no earbuds.  The built in speakers are what sold me and they sound great, considering that each of the two speakers are about the size of a dime.  Even with the speaker out, it easily goes in and stays in my pocket.  The play modes live up to their descriptions. I use Bass Boost for in the car & outside, and 3D for the ear buds.  Listening with the included earbuds is EXCELLENT.  Realiability has been excellent.  I've dropped it a couple times already but it's without a scratch.  Another reason I bought it was the good reviews (much better than Scan Disk).  There is a good video of the Samsung on C-Net, which show it's size and is described well. I've had the unit a little over a month now and it topped out at 800 WMA songs.  This was my first venture into the MP3 world and it's fantastic.  No more annoying songs or car commercials.  It's like TIVO for radio only better because it's free, commercial free and all your favorite songs are played, whenever and however you want.  Not in the mood for a song?  skip it for the next one.  Select albums, artists, songs, rock... country, pop, jazz, etc.  And the color changing clock is really a neat bonus. As for the cons, I would have liked the full manual and not the site to go get one in Adobe.  The touch pad requires a very light touch, but you get used to it.  Normal play is actually a little better than shuffle too, as in shuffle will try to sneak in a previously skipped track. Also, you must charge it through the computer..  There is not much in the way of accesories either.  I wound up going to Walmart where I bought a Samsonite cell phone cover and clip (fits a Nokia 3500) so I can wear it on the riding mower with the ear buds neatly tucked in ear protection. Last little gripe, you have to plug in the ear buds to receive FM, but you can still listen to the radio through speakers.  Pulls in a lot of distant stations with no fade. If you haven't guessed yet, I would buy this item again and HIGHLY recommend it!

<Title>Poor Customer Service
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player itself is ok but the customer service and support at Samsung is the worst I have ever been through.  After 5 phone calls, 10 disconnects, and over 10 hours on hold, they have promised for the fifth time they would get back to me.  The player is supposed to come with 1 month of free downloads from your choice of three services.  None of them will give you more than one week of free connect time and will still charge for each download.  Samsung cannot seem to fix the problem and has an I do not care attitude.  Avoid them and their products if possible.

<Title>Very cool player..
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been playing with this player for about a week now and there have been good and bad points about it. I'll start with what I disliked about the player. Although I love this player, I was disappointed about the music transferring process. I don't use an ipod so I don't know how the samsung compares to it, but my friends who have ipods tell me that it's extremely user friendly. I use itunes on my PC [because my bro has an ipod] and it's easy to create playlists on itunes, but the Samsung uses the Samsung Medio Studio, which is somewhat confusing for me. I found out that I couldn't change information of the songs that were already uploaded onto the player, nor could I organize them/move them around to form a new playlist. I still haven't figured out how to make playlists yet..Also, if several songs are of the same artist, but the artist name isn't uniform [ex: yellowcard v.s. Yellowcard], then it'll show up as two different artists on the artist category in the player.  Another thing is that since it's a touch-screen player, the surface can get kind of smudgy with fingerprints (but you can always wipe that off). Also, the player doesn't include a charger that can be used on wall outlets. So you'd have to buy one or always charge the player on the PC. The earphones are rather funky too (weird shape).    Despite all that, I still love this player because the design is so beautiful and the sound is amazing. It's not big and bulky like the Creative Zen players, and it's not thin and fragile like ipods. It's thicker than an ipod, but at a thickness that's very comfortable to hold. The slide-out speaker makes it the coolest thing ever. The sound from the speakers is way better than I expected. The alarm clock is really loud, but that definitely wakes me up! Plus, I can wake up to the song of my choice.  It's a very sleek and pleasing design..The glowing blue buttons complement the black mp3 player very nicely. I love touch-screen even though it leaves fingerprints because it doesn't make any sounds. One of my turn-offs of the Creative Zen player was the big plasticky buttons...when I press them, it reminds me of pressing a plastic toy button. But the Samsung touch-screen buttons makes it seem very sophisticated and high-tech. The different sound effects/modes are wonderful..I love the concert hall mode most. It really does sound like what it'd be like at a live concert.   This is not a player that will satisfy everyone, probably because it's only 4GB, can't show videos, etc. But it was a perfect match for me since I don't like wearing head/earphones for long periods of time (so the slide-out speaker is convenient) and the style of the player is amazing. I don't really need a video features..I just need it for the music. I guess if your music files are very organized, the transfer process will be a breeze. If you think this player has what you want, then you'll absolutely love it. :D

Boy did it live up to the expectations when I bought it. I know ipod is the "thing" nowadays but I wasn't one to follow the crowd. This will surely turn heads. The picture quality isn't all the great and the screen can get a few fingerprints, but the pros definately out weigh the cons.

<Title>A great little MP3 Player
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>An MP3 player where you don't have to swap ear bugs with a buddy to let them hear your music. The sound quality from the built in speakers is pretty impressive for their small size, but THX it is not. The interface is clean and easy to use, and the ability to view photos is an added bonus. It makes for a great traveling alarm clock. You can wake up to one of your favorite songs, and it stores up to five seperate alarms. Battery life on the device is excellent. This is the best MP3 player I have ever owned. The only complaint I have, and it is really minor, is that there is no menu option for viewing the clock outside of the settings menu. Would be nice to call that up at the touch of a button.  Hats off to Samsung, this puppy is near perfect.  Eric

<Title>Nice innovation but...
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this based on these reviews. I thought it almost live up to the hype and in a way it did. Don't get me wrong, I like this toy and I like it a lot but I wonder how long it would take before falling apart.  The slider seems a little flimsy and the touch screen is ultra sensitive and I'm not exaggerating. Music quality and functionality is excellent. Earbuds are strange looking and need a little getting use to. The manual is god aweful and it seems like it's written by a fifth grader. You don't have to browse through multitude of pages 'cause there're just isn't any! Biggest disappointment is that it doesn't offer more space being that it's only 4G. My recommendation: If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, going ahead and get one. You won't be disappointed. But if you're a picky mp3 user like me then I suggest you wait for the price to drop or wait for Samsung to come out with more storage space say...10Gs and up. This is a really nice job by Samsung.

The built in speaker sounds excelent, and the headphones are good as well.  The product is very user friendly because you can drag and drop files strait from their music file location.  It does come with a samsung music program to help transfor files if you would rather use that.  All in all this is a great product.

<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I turned to this mp3player because I had a creative zen micro and all of a sudden it started freezing, and I decided to buy a new mp3player. I heard from a friend of a friend that the k5 is pretty decent, it comes with cool built - in speakers where you can blast music out loud in the shower, so I said sure why not(i'm against buying ipods so it never came to my mind to purchase an ipod) well within the first month of using the k5, a red and blue line appeared down the middle of the screen, so i had to send it back. 3 months later the power button was a little fragile and at the end, it broke, leaving me to send it back again. After 2weeks of wating for my k5 to come back, i recieved it in the mail and i was so excited, when i took it out and started to listen to it the battery started dying so i charged it. When i plugged my charger it automatically says "fully charged" so i called customer service and they told me to send it back to them AGAIN! so now this is the 3rd time i'm sending my product back to samsung and i had this product for 6months...so i don't really suggest this mp3player..

<Title>Pricey but nice little MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're willing to spend some $$$ on an MP3 player and don't want an iPod, consider the Samsung YP-K5 with 4GB of memory. For starters, this baby has a black magnesium casing, so it doesn't easily scratch. Then it has touch controls. (Yes it has an FM radio, an alarm, and shows photos, but I don't care about those.) Another nice feature of the K5 is how nicely it interfaces with Windows Media Player. One of its best features is that it has multiple compression settings. At the lowest compression setting, which is called Best Quality Audio, you'll consume about 192 KBs of disk space and K5 memory (you must make both settings in advance) but your sound won't be mushy or swooshy. Depending on your headphones, you'll probably have to turn on bass boost, an EQ Effect. You can store about 30-50 CDs that way. I haven't used all my memory yet and I've got around 20 CDs on it and have only used ~ 40% of available memory. So 4 GB will go a long way. But I don't know if any is reserved for photos, as Windows Media and the K5 give conflicting readings of available memory.  One feature you're paying a chunk of change for that you may want to consider seriously is the speakers. If you don't want speakers, I believe the K3 is the model to consider. It is everything the K5 is except speakers, I think. The speakers sound good for what they are, but what can you expect for speakers so small? Personally though, I find it convenient for times when I don't want to turn on my PC or radio and still have some music.  Without writing a treatise, this should give you ample information to decide on whether or not to spend $200(!) as of May 2007 on an MP3 player. Happy shopping.

<Title>Samsunging it
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't like to write reviews unless I have owned the electronic for a substancial amount of time. So here goes, I bought this mp3 back in January honestly, because it was the only one that Best Buy had in stock at the time. I liked the idea that it had built-in speakers because this meant that I could listen to music at work (an office).   The MP3 came with a cool set of headphones though I must admit that they a bit hard to get used to and they don't last very long (the rubber tip of the headphones fell off within the first month). It doesn't store a lot of songs (1,000 for the 4GB if you are lucky). So if you have tons of music, this is not the mp3 for you.   Samsung claims the playback of you are using the speakers is six hours... and I am sure that this info is incorrect. I use this MP3 on a daily basis (always only using 1 or 2 bars on the volume scale since I can't play music loud at work) and by the end of the 8 hour workday my battery is close to running out. The speakers are decent. They are not too loud, but you can't really expect much from a speaker this size. You can't play videos on this mp3... so once again, if you want vids on your mp3, this mp3 is not for you.   The software for this mp3 is a bit difficult to work and sucky but it gets the job done. What I dislike about this mp3 is that I am unable to customize playlists... I can create folders to organize the songs when they load on the software but otherwise it does not organize the music on the actual mp3 which can be frustrating. The music will load into the categories that the mp3 comes with... by either artist, album, tracks or genres.  The touch screen is the most appealing part of this mp3. Very modern and easy to work. I recommend buying a protective case for this mp3 to avoid scratching the screen. This mp3 also stores pictures but the picture quality is probably the worst that I have seen in an mp3 player. This mp3 also includes an alarm clock which is a cool feature but I don't use it.  Overall, this is a cool mp3 if your main use for an mp3 is music playing.

<Content>When I first had this MP3 player in my hads I felt like when I was a little kid and I got a Transformer toy for Christmas I couldn't belive how cool it was. The Samsung YP-K5 has one of the most beautiful designs of MP3 players, it's very easy to use (unlike my old Ipod which took me ages to find the shuffle mode) and it has a science fiction gadget feel to it that other MP3 players lack. Just when you thought it couldn't be any better than this you slide it and Voila! you can take it anywhere and let everyone listen to what you are listening without the need of external speakers, the sound is pretty decent for it's size. ALso the player is super resistant (just watch youtube and see a video of a car rolling over it without harming it). All in all a player that deserves to be in the podium of MP3 players

<Title>Awesome sound quality, speakers decent
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sound quality surpasses or equals any iPods I have listened to. Very decent player. Lacks the 'extras' that the iPod has though, but I tend to just listen to music when jog/run/cook etc and don't care the extras. Great to play in cars too.   On songs recorded at >128Kbps, the speakers in 3D mode are just simply awesome. Lower bit rates tend to sound flat on the speakers.  The accompanying headphones were of average quality, and tended to respond too much to treble in comparison to bass. I replaced these with the JBuds Noise-canceling head phones from Amazon ( about $20)...and the combination is simply awesome.  Overall a good audio product, but does not have the frills you tend to expect from today's audio players.

AWESOME BATTERY LIFE!!! Word of Warning: The headphones included are really strange and may seem large and invasive to many (not to be shared with others) --> but are suprisingly comfortable (and can easily be replaced if they are just too weird for you).

<Title>OK, now for the rest of the story...

<Content>...I've been playing with my YP-K5 for a few days now. It is a cool MP3 player and is easy to use. I must admit though, that I'm some what disappointed with the sound of the speakers. I still own several of Philip's ShoqBoxs. Flash based Mp3 players with speakers. Sort of like little Bose radios. I can't count the number of people who've been totally blown away when they hear my ShoqBox. I could've sold a truck load of them myself and wonder why Philips has just abandoned this idea. The reason that I bought the YP-K5 was for the larger storage capacity and I hoped and thought (after reading several rave reviews here) that it would be better. It is a good rival to the ipod, but I wouldn't suggest that you buy it for the quality of the sound from the built in speakers. Very 'tinny'.

<Content>I've had the K5 for the last three weeks and love it.  Being able to set up the device anywhere and play music is fantastic, and I use the feature much more than I predicted I would.  Sure, the audio doesn't have much bass output, but for such a small device it delivers BIG sound.  Great user interface, built solidly.  Way to go, Samsung!  Delivered big on a new, unique idea.  Thumbs up from me.

<Title>It does almost everything, and does it quite well.

<Content>The excellent look of glowing blue touch-controls on a one piece gloss black screen compliments the sound quality of this tiny little player. 320kbps mp3s sound incredible on this player (using Sony MDR-7506 headphones). I have not tested the included ear buds, so I have no idea if they're any good.  The slide-out speakers are a very cool feature. They actually do a good job of reproducing most types of music, given their size. Bass response is even more surprising. It's actually pretty good!  When the speakers are out, the screen switches its visualizations from vertical to horizontal. The FM radio system is also very nice. It uses a preset mode, in which you can simply tap the left and right arrows to cycle through your list of preset stations. Also, you must have the headphones plugged in or else the FM radio will not get reception. You can also listen through the built in speakers by sliding them out.  Due to the 4GB of space and no expansion options for extra memory, it's probably not for everyone. But if you don't need to bring your ENTIRE music collection with you at all times, this is the player to get.

<Title>Ingenius

<Content>Finally, there is an mp3 player with a speaker!  The slide out speaker is ingenius.  It even angles up.  They are excellent speakers for their size.  I love this for listening with a speaker in bed at night.  The glowing blue touch pad controls are well thought out and easy to use in the dark.

<Title>Great IPod Substitute

<Content>I just received this unit yesterday and it is amazing. The speaker sound quality is very impressive for its size and modest weight. The player is great looking and the touch screen is amazing. If you have no issue with the space restrictions, this product really is near perfect. A great buy!

<Title>This is one classy MP3 Player... iPod Killa
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is one sweet MP3 Player that will have all your friends drooling ;o) I love it! And it's best feature has got to be the built in speakers, they sound like Bose quality and not a cell phone on speaker phone (that was my biggest pre-purchase concern). And the build quality on this unit is incredible! Before buying anything I always play with (stress test) at my local Best Buy and you couldn't break this one if you tried, i wasn't able to. It is made of metal and has a solid feel to it unlike most of todays cheapo gadgets built of plastics. I wish it had a larger storage capacity, 4GB isn't much these days a twenty or forty GB version would be to die for but would also up the price a bit. The controls are lovely n this even if you have clumsy fat fingers like me. I love the fact that I don't need to use any software to load music (although it does come with software on a cd), I plugged in the USB cable and my pc (running XP Media Edition) picked it right up and I just dragged and dropped my music right on without any itunes hassle ;o) I do wish Samsung wouldn't use a Proprietary USB connector, a mini USB would be much nicer I hate traveling with my laptop and having to carry around a dozen different USB wires for my devices since hey don't all use a stand mini to regular USB. Also Samsung should have included a wall (AC) charger, instead you have to use the supplied USB cable to charge. Also the included headphones roxx! I purchased an expensive pair of Bose Triport IE headphones to use with this but after testing the included ones verse the $100 I couldn't justify keeping the Bose so I returned them. Yeah the Bose sounded a tiny bit better but they actually require more power so when turned all the way up the included headphones are much louder. I love my K5 and even after considering the above mentioned Cons if I were to do it all over again I would still choose this player it is truly brilliant and a leader in it's class. I hope this helps anyone in the market. P.S. my Samsung K5 can kick your generic looking iPods butt any day! ;o)
