<Title>Love it
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I am totally in love with this since giving up my old vision m which I also bought and loved from amazon but it weighed me down too much and in came the sleek and tiny Zen. Only one fault I see so far the SD card I thought I would be able to integrate the memory card music with the ones on my zen but alas not the case. Maybe Creative will fix that with firmware update along with the video scale size. Vision M could play practically all my XVid videos which were mostly scaled larger than what the zen is capable of 320:240.  Outside of those 2 things it is a good contender against the ipod unfortunately marketing and popularity overshadows this incredible company and its products. A fan of Creative products forever

<Title>Man, the battery
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Mom and Dad got me this for my birthday [upgrade from my Zen Micro 6gb) I've got to say I love this thing; it has great sound, plenty of room for what I use it for, it has a great screen and a lot of extra features.  BUT it loses two stars because,  1. Even though I charged it all the way then drained it all the way when I first got it (3 times) it still won't hold a charge longer than 5 hours with the screen on 10% brightness, and no more than 7 or so with the screen off (on hold) Even though, the creative site advertises 30 hours with the screen off [on hold] (I didn't expect to get that much time, but, I did expect at LEAST 15 hours or more (with the screen off)) 2. It will occasionally freeze while Syncing with Windows Media Player (latest version) or while charging (It has happened often enough for to have learned to carry a paper clip with me to hit the reset button on the bottom)   Other than this problem, this IS a great player.

<Title>Best mp3/video player out there ! ! !
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The music sounds great and the videos look amazing, the screen size is perfect.  Even the video converter is reasonably fast.  All in all a great product and will not leave you disappointed.  It is worth it to by the screen protector and case because the piano finish does scratch easily and the screen will smudge.

<Title>Best flash player on the market, great even for large music collections
<Date>Sat Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great choice for those people who previously limited their flash players to workout duty, or only holding a small piece of their large music collection and having to change the music on it every so often. With a 16GB capacity most people can fit their entire collection on here without difficulty, and even have room for some videos.  First impressions of this player are very good. It is extremely appealing to the eye, everyone who sees it will ask about it. It is about the size of a credit card, just thicker (less than 1/2inch). The front is a very glossy black plastic that looks great until you touch it, instantly covering it with fingerprints :) The back is a rough, cheaper feeling black plastic. Overall it has a nice solid weight and feel to it, but not very heavy. This will easily fit in a pocket.  The 2.5" screen is absolutely gorgeous. Very bright with vivid colors. The viewing angle is very good, two people can easily look at the screen at the same time while watching a movie for example. The menus are all nicely animated and intuitive to navigate. The icons and text are big clear and easy to read.  One of the big perks to having so much capacity is plenty of room for videos. This was one of the first things I've tested as it was a big reason for my purchase. First of all it DOES play Amazon Unbox videos perfectly. Transferring files was very easy (just a few clicks) and very quick. The quality of the video was great as well. The max size of videos is apparently 320x240, I have not been able to get it to play anything larger than that. If the video is smaller (for example widescreen) you have the option of playing it at the correct aspect ratio, or fill the screen (stretched out). I've gotten it to play videos encoded in Xvid and WMV format. Xvid files were encoded with AutoGK, and the WMV files were encoded with Arcsoft MediaConverter. If you synchronize with Windows Media Player, you can put in *almost any* video file and it will automatically convert the file into WMV format and then transfer to the player. How long it takes to convert depends on the type of video you're encoding, how big the file is and of course the speed of your computer.  Music sounds very good on this player, but please... get rid of the stock headphones they are horrible. Using a decent pair of headphones makes a HUGE difference. The EQ options are OK, there are about a half dozen presets and a customizable EQ. The "Bass Boost" option just made it worse in my opinion, it just distorted the sound. Otherwise it is a very even and balanced sound, very similar to the Vision:M.   The FM radio has a whopping 32 presets and the reception is pretty good. Strong stations are in stereo, weaker ones come in mono. I haven't had a chance to test out the built-in mic.  I easily transferred music and playlists onto this player from Windows Media Player and MediaMonkey, as well as protected music (WMA) from Napster. Everything was very easy, usually just dragging and dropping. The speed of transfer is probably the fastest I've seen. I've used this player on XP Home and on Vista Premium 64-bit.  Regarding the SD cards. I think its only a slight inconvenience that the memory card media isn't directly integrated with the other content. Meaning if you have videos on the SD card you don't go to the "Video" menu where all the other videos are, you have to access them through the "Memory Card" menu. Once there, you browse through the file structure like normal. If you organize the content smartly on your cards you should have no problem. And really its a small price to pay for that feature. Currently SDHC cards are up to 16GB in capacity, meaning you could double the capacity and carry around 32GB worth of content in your pocket. Amazing. I tested a Kingston 512MB SD Card and a Kingston 2GB microSD card (with adapter of course) and they were recognized and played the content without difficulty.  A quick note about the firmware. Mine came with 1.10.05. When my player turns off, it really turns off. With newer firmwares when it turns off it goes into a sleep mode for a while before it finally turns all the way off. What that means is with the older firmware each time you turn it on it has to "boot" all over again, whereas with the newer firmware you get an "instant-on" at the expense of slightly reduced battery life (since it is asleep and not off). Something to consider before you decide to upgrade the firmware.

<Title>Faulty and had to send back
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this for my teenage son for Christmas. The one we received had a faulty processor or something and would not run videos properly (would skip and stall) and the videos would have poor audio.  I give 2 thumbs up to Amazon for the quick processing of the return.  The conversion time for putting the videos in Zen format was quite long too.  I replaced the returned Zen with a 30G Zune for my son (again from Amazon) and he's a happy camper showing me "See, this is how a processor SHOULD run a video!" for the ones the Zen had trouble playing.  Positives: small size, the size is much better than my bulky 30G Ipod. Is ours was defective and my son plays mostly videos with a few songs, I don't know how it'll fare for just music, but the size is a big plus.  Negatives: was how it ran my son's videos.

<Title>If you buy it you will have to deal with...
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>FIRST. The battery is the worst. Don't expect much from the battery. It last for me 1 or 2 days on my way to and back from school. It can be half when you turn it off and you turn it on the next day and it wont turn on because the battery is death. You need to constantly charge it because if you forget trust me you wont have battery the next day. I think my old played was way much better on that part. Because of this the clock will never be right and I am tired of changing the time every the time. The battery wont last for a long trip.   SECOND. The videos are very fast to transfer. But before the transfer occurs you have to convert the video to a different format and it takes FOREVERRRRRRRR to convert. Pictures and music are relatively fast. Videos are not excellent. The quality is good but the sound gets disturbed few times on different videos at the exact second of the video every the time you play it. Not on all videos but some and I don't want to re transfer it again after waiting so long for the format conversion. ANNOYING...    THIRD. The screen scratches so easily.    FORTH. The headphones it comes with are the worst and so big that hurts your ear.   FIFTH. Expensive. I made a comparison between this and the Ipod Touch and  found that the Ipod touch is so much cheaper for what it can do. The Zen is relatively expensive compared to other players.   SIX. It Freezes sometimes, not to much but it happens and you have to reset it and find a paper clip to push the button. If you cant find one then wait until you get one and by the way, once it freezes you can not turn it off so the weak battery will die.   Besides my six complaints is a good player. the battery is the worst trust me I have to say it again.

<Title>So far so good!
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just rec'd my zen last week and so far it has done all that I expected it to do. I have played music, videos and pictures on it and the sound quality (even with the cheap earphones) is great.  I didn't rate it a 5 star only because I haven't used all the functions yet and because I have not had it very long.  I did update the firmware and it worked fine.  Though, I did notice when I did it, that there are 2 versions of one of the software - one is for US and the other that is marked (Europe Only).  I am guessing that if someone downloads and tries to install both versions there may be an issue (this may be the reason for some of the zen's freezing after updating), so make sure you download & install the correct version based on your location.

<Title>Didn't work out of the box
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well - the theory is great, the practice is not.  My Zen arrived "Dead on Arrival."  Creative suggested I send it back to Amazon.  The only saving grace of this entire experience was Creative's telephone support (free for 60 days) and Amazon's easy returns.  Someone explain that to my daughter on her birthday today. . .

<Content>Overall the device performed well, though I never got to put it through a long term test. After connecting to my PC, the device would sync about 25% of the time and simply shut down the other 75% of the time, requiring me to disconnect it and stick a paper-clip in the reset hole.

<Title>Nice piece, but there are some issues
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player beats the crap out of ipod. It has FM radio, Microphone, SDHC card slot, plays itunes files, no need to have special software though it does have its own, and it costs less than a comparable ipod, not that there is one. I highly recommond this to everybody looking to purchase an mp3 player. There are two issues that I have come across and that is use on multiple computers, it give it a problem and it causes it to crash while plugged in. The other issue is that when I first got this it was crashing rondomly for a little while, just freeze up and I would have to reset. Not a problem unless you are driving or cannot find a staple to bend and use. It will do this freeze thing with video and music playback. Special with video playback is this stalling thing that it does, it will stop and have to be fast forwaded one second, as if it lost tracking. These issues have gone away after I stopped using multiple computers.

<Content>An excellent MP3 player.  I dropped my Zen Micro, and after looking at Creative's offerings, decided to go with the Zen.  Sound quality is excellent, ease of operation is the same as will the Zen Micro (very straightforward), and I like the big screen.  Battery life does not seem to be as long as advertised, but likely because I am not dimming the screen.  A nice MP3 player.

<Title>Great player, but has flaws...
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen 16 GB player after trying out many different players(including iPod and Zune).  I owned a Creative Zen Micro 6GB for 3 years, and it was very basic, but it did the job, until I dropped it!  Rather than send it back to Creative to get it repaired, I decided it was time to upgrade.  I read reviews about the Zen 16gb, and I was impressed with the amount of memory for the price, the ability to expand the memory(more on this later), and the different file types that it supports.  So it arrives and everything seems great, because Creative knows how to make a great player.  The players exterior does have a major flaw, the screen.  It's so sensitive to scratches that it must be made out of the cheapest plastic possible.  I have never seen a screen get so scratched up just from storing it in a pocket!  So I wish I would have purchased the screen protector(even though I think it's ludicrous to pay 10 dollars for something that Creative should have addressed in the first place), or some sort of case.  I KNOW that other makers(Apple/Microsoft) have much better screens on their mp3 players, so I don't understand why Creative went the cheapo route!  Another issue is the expandable port.  You are able to add more memory with SD cards, which are as big as 32gb, these days.  This was very exciting to me, even though the memory from the card doesn't integrate with the memory in the player.  After I bought the player, I was reading reviews of other players, and apparently one of the newer Sansa players also has a SD card slot, but it DOES integrate the card with the player's memory! Doh! Had I known this prior, I would have definitely bought a Sansa player, rather than Creative.  Creative should have addressed this problem before they released it, as well!  Other than those problems, I love my mp3 player.  It's small and light, and I like what it brings to the table, overall.

<Title>Slick Little Player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very slick little player. It is very small and light, not much bigger than a credit card. It uses flash memory instead of a hard drive, which eliminates many problems I have had on previous players. I've only had to reset the player once. Battery life is very good. I have no idea whether it meets the battery life claims of the manufacturer, but it can be used extensively for at least two days without needing a charge. Transfer of files into the player is simple and can be accomplished using the mfr. software, Windows Media Player, or by dragging and dropping in Windows Explorer. I have tried all three and all work easily. Transfer is fast also. The quality and clarity of the screen is excellent. I have not put on any movies or other video because of a lack of interest in such usage, but photos look very good. The 16 gig capacity is good, and the SD card slot allows more storage. The only difficulty is that you must access SD card storage through the memory card menu instead of the music menu, which restricts your usage of those items somewhat. Navigation is also easy. I have read that some prefer the touch pad on the Zen Vision M, but I used it on my son's unit and hated it, even on low sensitivity. I prefer the one on this unit. I have had no problems at all with the player. My disabled son used it a great deal while his player was being repaired and he was unable to kill it. He has killed 8 iPods, 4 Dells and 1 Creative, so this is a very good durability sign. In fact,our experience with Creative is stellar. This is a very nice, high quality player at a very appealing price. I highly recommend this unit.

<Title>16gb works for me!!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my 16gb for about a month now. I use a Toshiba laptop running Windows Vista and haven't had any problems at all. I did update the firmware as suggested by Zen. My only complaint was the battery life. What took me awhile to find out about was the battery saving feature. I play it at work on random play all day. I was getting about 11.5 hours with the screen turned on. I found out that if you put the player on hold the screen will disappear and save battery life. After that I now average 18 hours between charges which is reasonable. I think one of the main problems is the lack of a good manual which should be included in the box. This would assist in the setup of your new player. I urge Creative to invest the extra quarter in the manual which would probably eliminate many of the problems listed in all the reviews. You shouldn't have to spend hours on the internet to get it up and running. Overall I rate it as an excellent player. Use a Palm screen protector cut to size to protect the screen. Hope you enjoy your new ZEN, I do!

<Title>Great player, my second Zen
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second Zen purchase.  I use Napster To Go, and the Zen is the best player in my opinion for that service.  My first player was a Zen Micro 4GB purchased about 3 years ago.  Both have performed superbly.  The new 16GB Zen is awesome.  The screen is so clear it's scary.  I really like the player too.  It has a huge capacity, great battery life, and another plus is that it charges off the same charger as my Moto Razr phone (they both charge with mini-USB).  The only thing I don't like about it is that the screen gets fingerprints on it often, but it's nothing that can't be overcome.  Also, the battery cannot be removed, so if the battery fails later on, I guess I'd need to buy a whole new player.  So, in short, I love the new Zen.  Its the perfect player for my needs, and the 16GB capacity lets me put all my favorite tracks on there with room left over.

<Title>Nice player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use Windows 2000, and that operating system is not supported whatsoever by this product.  You MUST HAVE XP or VISTA to make any practical use of this product!  Perhaps there is a statement to this effect somewhere in the product description, but I didn't see it and I was a bit bugged by the revelation.  I plan to install a second hard drive in my computer and load XP on it just so I can use my ZEN.  I have loaded many MP3s on my ZEN using a friend's computer and this thing works great.  The sound is much improved by getting some better earphones for it.  I bought some Creative EP-630 earphones and I think these are an excellent choice.  Considering that you can spend $300 for earphones if you want to, the EP-630s are an excellent bargain.  If you want to get a leather case for your ZEN, be sure to consider the one from PCMICROSTORE.  Amazon goofed (I think) by putting this case in the "Apparel" catagory.  All of the other ZEN accessories are listed under "electronics" and it took a little effort to find this case/accessory kit.  Check out my review of this product if you're interested.  I highly recommend it if you're a leather-case person.  Getting back to the ZEN, the functionality is virtually identical to an iPod, and there is no difference in the sound quality if you use the same data rate and earphones.  That little wheel gadget on the iPod is very nice and is the only reason I can think of to buy one instead of a ZEN.  The ZEN will not destroy the files on its host computer like an iPod will if you're not careful.  That alone is reason enough to choose just about any mp3 player over an iPod in my opinion, but most people buy whatever their TV tells them to.  The ZEN is very flexible in terms of its storage and retrieval options, and I found it very intuitive and easy to use.  The display is large and bright enough, and the buttons are spaced conveniently and are large enough for my chubby fingers.  One of those wheel things would be a big improvement, but apparently those are proprietary to Apple products.  That's too bad.  As far as I can tell so far, the ZEN is functionally equivilent to an iPod nano, sounds every bit as good, is considerably less expensive, and is more "open" in terms of available accessories and media compatibility.  If you're trying to choose between a ZEN or an iPod, that decision was an easy one for me.    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110O5UY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">PCMICROSTORE Brand Creative Lab Zen Small Wonder 4gb 8gb 16gb Premium Leather Case Cover with Video Stand and Swivel Belt Clip - Bundle with 12v Rapid Premium Car Charger and Home Travel Wall Charger</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LVIC58/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6954301-3468444">Creative EP-630 - Headphones ( in-ear ear-bud ) - black</a>

<Title>A Great MP3 player, despite a few glitches
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a month before doing my review, since it often takes that long for issues to surface, and my opinions to solidify.  Just so you know, I only use my ZEN to play MP3s.  I don't store pictures on it, and have no desire to watch videos on a tiny little screen (although the image is remarkably bright and sharp, with fantastic color depth).  Having said that, this is a GREAT MP3 player!  Noise levels are incredibly low, and the EQ settings (both presets and custom) guarantee a sonic experience that will be pleasing to almost any ear.  I like bass, and this unit can certainly deliver (with the right headphones).  Here's what I like: -	Great sound! (See above) -	No moving parts.  Completely solid state player with no disc drive, which should decrease vibration susceptibility and increase unit life. -	Lot's of storage space.  I have 834 MP3 files downloaded, with almost three forths of my memory leftover. -	Reliable operation:  My unit was shipped with OS ver. 1.10, which gave me headaches.  It would sometimes hang when connected to my computer, or even when just turning the unit on.  I had to reset it several times.  But ever since I upgraded to ver. 1.20.02 several weeks ago, it has been rock solid!  I have downloaded to it, uploaded from it, and played it for hours at a time with no problems whatsoever. -	Long battery life.  I haven't tested how long it lasts, but it seems to go for hours and hours without needing a recharge. -	Connector placement:  All the connectors are on the unit's side, allowing all cables to be routed next to each other in my car (ahh, it's the simple things in life...).  Here's what I wish was better: -	User interface:  Button functions and menus took me a little while to get used to. -	Software gremlins:  Syncing album artwork to the music sometimes gets messed up.  For example, whatever "Greatest Hits" album is playing, it will show the album cover for Styx "Greatest Hits". -	Construction:  The tactile feedback from the buttons and switches makes me wonder how long they will last.  Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, since I am an engineer used to working with expensive lab equipment.  Incidentally, the "5 in 1 New Creative Zen Kit" with AC charger and car charger (also available from Amazon) is a GREAT accessory, worth every penny!

<Title>Sorry device.
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had it for about a week.  Had to reset it 20 times.  Sending it back.  Previously I had a samsung 5GB mp3 player.  Never had this kinda problem or any problem for that matter.  I plugged in headset into the device and the screen went blank (white).  There was no volume and the function buttons stopped working.  I then attempted to reset the device, that did not work.  I had to let the device sit for about 30 min and it began working again.  Then I went to Creative's website thinking this was perhaps a software problem.  After updating the software (which the version was already current) the problem continued.  Could not find a tech support telephone number on Creative's website.  Finally I contacted Amazon and they are sending me another one.  After sleeping on it, I want a refund instead.
