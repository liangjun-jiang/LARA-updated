<Title>Awesome product

<Content>Awesome product. My brother has the older model (8-in-1 Ultra player), hence the reason I even know about this item. I've been shopping for an MP3 player for about half a year now but haven't been sold on any until I saw my brother using his. He let me use it & I found that it was extremely durable (the new one is even more-so) which is my main concern and also that it has the cool feature of having a memory drive.  This device itself is 512 MB but is expandable to 1.5GB. You can save 512MB to the machine then another 1GB worth of stuff on a memory card. This means that you can have as many 1 GB cards to keep your stuff without having to delete it in place of newer stuff (you can keep all of your song downloads w/o having to constantly delete them when you're sick of them, very cool!!  You can have a card for each music genre if you want!!). I'm just in it for the music but this player can do pretty much anything (14 uses).  Five stars all the way (oh, and up to 15+ hours of battery life compared to the older model's 8 hours).  ****HUGE WARNING: YOU CAN'T USE REGULAR AAA BATTERIES TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC, YOU CAN ONLY USE THEM TO LISTEN TO STUFF.  DOWNLOADING REQUIRES RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES DUE TO THE FACT THAT RECHARGING OCCURS WHEN THE DEVICE IS HOOKED UP WITH YOUR CPU.****

<Title>Decent but not Impressive

<Content>Over All Rating: C Earbud Sound: C Overall Features: A Documentation: D Tech Support: F Quality: B  I recently bought this MP3 Player because it had a great rebate deal that brought the cost way down. For the price I paid, I am happy with it. If I had paid the standard price, I would have been very disappointed. The good news is that it has some great features. I love the 1.5 Gig expandability and the FM Radio tuner, but I don't think it stands up to the quality you find from companies like Apple.  Customer beware when it comes to Firmware upgrades. I downloaded the latest firmware from the Company's site after getting the product. The "latest" firmware on the site was older than what came with the player and when I tried to load it on the MP3 player, it turned out to be incompatible too. The player went dead and it took me a good 3 days to figure out how to get it to reload the original firmware again.

<Title>Warning - no resume feature
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit does not have a resume feature, which is a must if you use this for spoken-word audio.  Other MP3 players from Ultra Products are having their firmware upgraded, and will correct this shortcoming, but Ultra Products has not committed to upgrading the firmware for this unit.
