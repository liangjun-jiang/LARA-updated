<Title>Do not buy the pink one
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered one of these after reading the reviews of the black stone trying to decide if it was a good product. I have had good luck with other Zen players so I thought this would be a good buy. I got from the people who reviewed the black stone that this was a great piece of equipment at a great value. Well, maybe it is if you buy the black one, but the pink one is a piece of junk. The first one (yes, I returned it for another one) would not charge at all, would not turn on and generally refused to work. I returned it to amazon thinking the one I received was defective, until I had the same problem with the second pink stone I received. At this point I do not want another stone and I will be looking for another mp3 player.

<Title>i used to love all things pink, but this just sucks
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After charging all night, I attempted to turn this mp3 player on and no luck. I heard nothing. Since there is no screen or noise, I had no idea what was wrong. I thought maybe there was no music on it, but then I reconnected to my computer and it was preloaded with several songs. Then I went to the creative zen website to try to find more information and nothing helped. Therefore I sent the player back.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2695226-3084839">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Creative has fixed some of the software issues.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Content>With a 6 year old wanting to keep up with classmates this is a wonderful little MP3/WMA player with a great volume limiter. Fill it with Hannah and High School Musical and let them go. Also great for digital children's books.

<Title>LITTLE ZEN STONE PLAYER
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This little player was the perfect gift for our seven year old grand daughter. The price was right, and we loaded it with lots of her favorite songs. We love the fact that we could set the volumm at a reasonable level, and hopefully, protect her hearing. This is a super product for a child. Thanks !

<Title>poor quality mp3 player :-(
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this pink zenstone from Target for a very good price, and was ecstatic about the simplicity of the design...and the small size.Until I took it home, charged it on my computer (which took almost 3 hours). The songs downloaded with ease, and needed no software (which was a great bonus), but when I played it, the battery died after 5 minutes! :-( I took it back to Target,got store credit and paid alot more for a Sony mp3 walkman, which was well worth the extra money!This zenstone is a great concept, but the quality needs to be greatly improved.
