<Title>a great product but...
<Date>Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player for when I go to the gym or beach.  Something that if I dropped it in the parking lot I wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss.  This was the player for me.  What they didn't tell you is that the software and Windows XP don't play well together.  I tried downloading different drivers and such from their website.  I just made a bigger mess than I had before.  Long and short...I had to borrow a friends computer running Windows Me to get things to work.  Once it did, I loved my little gadget.  It was just a long process to get there.

<Title>OK for short use but not good for the long haul
<Date>Sun Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>We've had two Rio 600 MP3 players for over a year now, and while they are generally good units, there are several problems that are worth noting.<p>First, with 32MB, we can fit around 10 songs onto the MP3 player. While this is great for a daily selection on the bus or in the car, when we've taken trips those 10 songs get old REALLY quickly. So depending on how you're going to use it, that limit may be fine or may drive you crazy.<p>Next, as much as we've tried to be very careful with our units, they drop sometimes. They fall out of pockets, or down the stairs, or your hands slip while using them. Sure, I don't expect the units to last if you drop them onto concrete from 30 feet. But even the smallest drop seems to damage pins and switches. We have numerous problems with our Rios, from buttons not working to bizarre behavior, from even slight mishaps.<p>The headphones aren't really a big deal to us because we probably have 20 sets of headphones around the house. Most people who enjoy music have headphones already - getting a set with their MP3 is the least of their worries. Yes, the default headphones are barely adequate, but that is hardly a reason to choose or not choose a MP3 player.<p>We found the software to be quite good - and plus, just about every other MP3 software package we use also sees the Rio. So even if you don't like the software that comes with the Rio, you're hardly stuck for options.<p>The main issues we have really come down to its small memory size and its flimsy quality. Sure, you can buy more memory for it. But it's probably far wiser to buy a higher quality unit that already comes with more memory, and have it last you many years.

<Content>It was a dark and stormy night...lightning flashed in the diamond multimedia building. They had just created the ultimate mp3 player...the rio 600!! DUM DUM DUUUUUUUM. Ok i know i shouldn't be writing a review if i dont own this product but i can't help it. Courier messed up my shipping type, now the device will be here on monday. But from what i've heard the rio 600 is an awesome simple device yet has a few defects. <br>Pros:Large backlit lcd display<br>     USB support<br>     upgradable firmware and memory (future proof)<br>     Changeble sexy faceplates<br>     Ajustable equalizer<br>Cons: Only 32mb of memory<br>      Bad customer service<br>      Memory is only upgradeble by means of special (expensive) unreleased "backpacks"<p>All in all im looking forward to my rio arriving on monday

<Title>average mp3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Rio 600 32 MB is an average MP3 player. <br>Its got more Cons than Pros!!!<br>Cons:<br>-Rio Audio Manager software is sooo useless, even amateurs can write better software than this. <br>-The buttons(play/pause,stop,next track etc) are soo difficult to use since they dont have the feel of a button at all. They are more like a dial which is really stupid.<br>-Earplugs given with this product is soo stupid and get entangled all the time.<p>Pros:<br>+Low battery consumption(about 9-10Hrs on a single battery)<p>+Windows Media player 9.0 detects this player immediately and is easy to transfer files(takes 10 secs to transfer a song)<br>+Supports WMA (Windows Media Audio) which has better compression at 64kbps.<p>Also I see most people pointing out that 32MB is too low to listen to a lot of songs but thats all you can do when you have a 32 MB player. Its not the fault of RIO mp3 player.

<Title>could be happier with it
<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was so excited to buy my first mp3 player about a year ago, however I should have done a little more research first.  I was happy with all the features, the display, etc., but there are a few issues worth noting with this.  First of all, the battery doesn't last anywhere near the 11 hours it says.  If I leave it for any length of time without using it, the battery dies as well.  Then there is the memory issue.  I realize that is an issue with any 32 MB mp3 player, however, the memory backpack things are impossible to find; though the wonderful people at the store I purchased it at assured me I could order them online, that was not the case.  I suspect the reason they didn't have them at the store was that this model was on its way out. The website currently makes no acknowledgement of the memory &quot;backpacks&quot;, and while they do still have software updates for the 600 model, they don't sell it anymore.  I have not been able to find them ANYWHERE.  If you want more than 10 songs, do not buy this.

<Title>Most horrible thing I ever bought
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This was a horrible and udderly usless piece of junk.  When I first got mine (the first one i got) it worked for about 3 days. Then it just stopped working and i just heard static when i wanted the song to play.  Along with that, the software didn't work (i have a PC).  I tried countless times to upgrade on its site, called costumer support(which was very inconsiderate and didn't care if it got fixed or not), and did everything possible to fix it.  Then I got another one, thinking this one was just a bad one.  I was wrong.  Same problems with the software, and it worked for 5 days, then i just got static again.<br>       All in all, don't buy this one and get an archos or something (archos work very well.)even if it is a little more money.

<Title>Horrible battery life, cheap quality plastic design
<Date>Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was not impressed with this MP3 player at all. First of all, im not sure if mine was defective but it would only go 2-3 hours of playing time before the battery would flat out die. I tried upgrading the firmware or calibrating the battery beforehand. This brings me to the quality of the design, when I try and get to the battery compartment. You have to remove the entire back cover and then open this other flimsy door to get to the one AA battery. Try and squeeze the battery in the small space while so worried that the small plastic holders are going to break off. One you got that in, you have to carefully position the back cover to fit back on with the metal contacts in place. Whew.<p>Goods:<br>-Nice blue backlight<br>-Small Light Design<br>-Somewhat easy menu system.<br>-Easy to copy songs using iTunes on mac [no experience with pc software]<br>-Fast/Easy USB.<p>Bads:<br>-Cheap flimsy plastic case<br>-Extremely short battery life<br>-Hard to replace batteries [Afraid of breaking something while squeezing that AA in an extremely small plastic holder thing.<br>-Horrible customer service when trying to get it fixed. They keep saying to flash the memory upgrade firmware I have done all that with no avail!<br>-Doesnt use any traditional upgrade memory method [compact flash or smart media] It needs some kind of special backpack to strap on the back for only another 32MB of memory.<p>In conclusion, I would not recommend the Rio 600, even though it was quite cheap. Spend about $20 more for a Creative Labs' Nomad IIc. It has double the memory and easy to expand.

<Title>excellent product- rio 600
<Date>Thu Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was very pleased with the Rio 600. Before recieving it, i was worried it wouldn't turn out so well because i had checked online reviews about it and said that it doesn't work, etc. However, for me it worked great! I took it on a field trip, it worked perfectly. very easy to change the battery. the battery can wear out fast, but don't keep the backlighting on so much, and remember to turn it off. by doing that, the battery lasted for three days for me. the rio-600 is a bit larger than other rio models, but yet, its still very compact. i did not use the headphones provided and the sound quality was pretty good. i didn't use the software either, but easily got mp3 files uploaded through real player. its very easy to download file from there, just add in rio- 600 as your audio device, and then copy files from there. rio-600 has little memory, but i still got it to download six files. i heard you can also add a memory card which lets it have up to 320 mb of memory! overall, i'm a satisfied owner of the rio-600.

<Title>If you like shoddy craftsmanship, then purchase this player
<Date>Sun Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months.  (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack).  After the first three months, it simply stopped working.  Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.<p>Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement.  i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again.  I wish I had believed other reviews about this product.  If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing.  if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio.  You get what you pay for... (paid $70)

<Title>Great new mp3 player, VERY upgradeable
<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The diamond rio 600 is a great player.  It doesn't feel fragile like the previous rio models and has very good sound quality with the earphones that come with it.  Apparently, you can switch faceplates so your rio will have  different colors but there isn't really any point to doing that because the  original color is just fine.  The worst feature of the rio 600 is that it  only comes with 32mb of memory which translates to around 6 or 7 good  quality songs.  The software it comes with gives you the option of reducing  the bitrate of the songs, allowing you to fit more songs on.  However, I  would not recommend doing this because this causes the background music to  make a &quot;squeak&quot; type noise that is very irritating.  Of course,  you can also purchase additional memory in &quot;backpacks&quot; of 32, 64,  and a whopping 340mb in addition to the 32mb of internal memory.  Unlike  the rio 500, you can actually increase the volume to a level that blocks  out most of the background noise.  I would definitely recommend this  product to a friend as it has a very low price and with the large memory  upgrades, you aren't likely to want to buy another mp3 player for a very  long time.

<Content>I like the device but have a couple complaints: not enough memory 32 is just too small and I can't find the upgrade modules yet. No belt clip, a case is extra $$ I'm hoping the fm tuner remote and extra memory modules  will be out soon and be affordable. (can`t be too soon for me). I use a Mac  and already use the included soundjam software, the usb download was fast  and software easy to use, I just need more memory!  The price was  reasonable as well, but we'll see when I add-in the extras I want.

<Title>Great player, for a great price.
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ever since listining to my friends mp3 player ive wanted one, but the price of quality players quickly detoured me.  My eyes lit up when I can across this player on rio's site, and the price, $169 practicly made my  eyes bulge out of my head.  The usb cable is great for quick downloads.   Also the memory backpacks are cheaper then flash cards, and you can upgrade  it to 340 megs with them.  The sound is great, it has a great interface  which makes it easy to change the settings.  Also if you want to spend an  extra $20 you can get a remote control that unlocks the ability to use the  fm tuner (havn't got that yet). It's asteticly pleasing, but if you don't  like the blue you can buy many different faceplates to customize the look.   Its very light and it fits perfectly in your hand, the lcd display is easy  to read and if your in the dark its backlit.  This is a great player for  anyone.

<Title>Good....good for beginners
<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ok, I like this player. i like it alot. to tell you the truth this player is the first one ive ever owned, and because of the fact that you can upgrade, might be my last. The sound is quite clear, no problems there. To  me the actual best part of this player was the software, i love the  software almost more then the actual player. its very easy to use and cool.  The only bad parts in my opinion is th play/pause/forward/backward/stop  buttons are all on one little disk, they can be a little dificult at times.  also if you want to upgrade your memory to somthing higer, you have to by  new little &quot;backpackes&quot; that have to go on the back, in my  opinion it would have been easier if they used flash cards.  over all the  Rio 600 is a well rounded player with many cool hip accesories, like a diff  color plates. you can also get an FM tuner extra. Worth the money in my  opinion.

<Title>something that you should know
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>For me and others the rio 600 was a long awaited electronic device.  Sadly my first rio was a dud.  It cracked and poped and sped up and slowed down unexpectedly.  It also thought every song was under a minute and half even  though it was not.  After playing just a small part of the song it would go  onto the next song even though the first one wasn't done.  Example: the  player says the song lasts 3:44 it ends at only 1:30 into the song.  I then  spent an hour talking with diamond over the phone and they told me it was a  dud. So I took it back after working with it for 5 hours.  The new one acts  the same way so I tried it on another computer and it plays the whole song  now but it still sounds like Rice Crispies.  The USB port is squirly and  causes the songs to have big glitches but the computer version of the mp3  has no problems the computer version should be identical to the rios  version.  This prouduct is just begging for a recall.  Be smart don't  invest in a rio till this one gets a recall.

It's easy to use, the RealJukebox software is reliable and easy, and it does come with a case and belt clip.  I bought it 4 months ago.  I use WMA format and can store most full length cds.  Storage capacity is not a problem, because I'll typically load a new cd into it practically everyday.  It only takes a matter of minutes!  I got 2 rechargeable AA batteries for it and so now battery life is not a problem.  I use it with sony earbud headphones for better sound quality.

<Date>Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I got this player as a gift and was SO excited about it. I read some bad reviews and went, "whatever." MY personal experience was that it was a really good player at the beginning, good software [once I figured out how to use it...took me awhile as I'm not very technically inclined], and looked great. Then, the buttons got really hard to push/broke entirely...fast forward to now: it's practically un-usable. The thing sits on my bookshelf 24/7/365...which stinks. What ticks me off worse is that I wrote various e-mails to the company about a replacement or refund and received really stinky customer service e-mails back...vague and super unhelpful. The player also eats up the AA batteries pretty fast. I really don't recommend this player...don't get me wrong...buy an MP3 player [the idea rocks!] but make sure you get one from a more reliable company and one that got better Amazon.com reviews!

<Content>Since i work at an electronics store, i get to test and play with these things. I personally own a 32 and 64 MB Rio 600. For the 32MB one, i get several people returning their rio 600's all the time. A few of those, their unit never worked at all, but to most they returned it about 2 months in use or more. I have had my Rio 600 32mb for 1 year and 3 months now, and it is still in great shape, and works like a charm. Why is this? It hasnt broke in 2 months because i have taken extremely good care of it. Most people's players die because they bend a small part in the hardware, such as in the batteries. So when i do anything with the batteries, i am EXTRA CAREFUL. Treat it like you are inserting batteries in a 2000 year old artifact that will crumble if you are the least bit rough on it. Don't try to insert the batteries in a hurry, either. Just be real careful, and try not to drop it. Also, be careful when insterting/taking out the usb cable and headphones also, to avoid bending anything. <br>Player Pros/Cons<br>Pros:<br>-Nice Appearance<br>-Good Interface and fast connection speed<br>-One battery thank god<br>-Lasts long if you take good care of it<br>Cons:<br>-32MB isnt enough, expensive expansion<br>-Batteries dont last long and battery indicator is wrong<br>-You have to take good care of it<p>Enjoy

I can also have a lot of diffrent songs without having to buy all those CD's. What also great about it is that it doest skip. I run and jog with it and it doesn't miss a beat. The clip clips right on to me so I don't have to hold it. Also the download time is really fast. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it holds a fair amount of music it could be a little bigger but it is still a great product.

Using the WMA format it sounds just fine.  <p>It is not easily expanded, but if that is what you are after get a mini-disc so that expansion is as simple as buying additional, low cost, discs.

<Title>A familiar tale: It's great while it lasts
<Date>Sun Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I will echo what seems to be a common refrain: after a while, the Rio 600 just quit working for no apparent reason. If you turn the volume up all the way, you can hear a faint clicking and popping rendition of what would be the bass line if you could hear the music.<p>I got this unit free as a promotion when I bought some networking equipment. I thought it was a neat little gadget, and it worked as promised in the beginning. The software could be more intuitive, but it got the music onto the player. The earphones hurt my ears, so I replaced them with an inexpensive pair of Koss earbuds from Wal-Mart, and that worked great. I was very pleased with the sound quality of this little unit. 32 MB is really not quite enough memory, however; you could expect to get 30 to 40 minutes worth of music loaded. If you're planning on using it a lot, rechargeable batteries would be a good idea (although if it breaks fast enough, that won't matter). I tried it out for running and for downloading short clips to practice on my guitar, but the bottom line was that it was never quite convenient enough for me to use regularly. <p>So it sat in a drawer for many months until my wife's portable CD player started to skip. I loaded up a playlist for her, and the first time she tried it out while running, the abovementioned problem occurred. Judging from the other reviews, this is a non-repairable problem, so it looks like we'll toss the Rio 600 and try something else. <p>Nice try, SonicBlue, but at this point the most valuable parts of the unit are the Koss earbuds and the AA battery.

<Title>Rio 600's most significant feature improvement is....
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>WMA SUPPORT!   I can't seem to stress this enough! There is one and only one reason I decided to give up on my old Rio500(after multiple failures which are too many to list here) and go with the Rio600 ,it's WMA support.  Without it...32megs of memory would certainly not get the job done but with  it...32megs of memory is in essence just as good as 64megs. of memory (the  Rio500) of a player that only supports MP3.<p>Now before all you MP3  &quot;Loyalist&quot; have a cow...hear me out.  I kept reading the claims  of Microsoft and their WMA encoding format as being capable of delivering  sound quality just as good if not better than MP3@128kbps at half the file  size...WMA encoded at 64kbps.  Well, after testing the various encoding  rates of MP3 and not being able to tolerate anything less than 128kbps  (didn't even consider MP3@64Kbps...ouch!)...I really doubted the claims of  Microsoft and WMA.<p>However, anything that promises to double my music  playing time without having to spend mega dollars through memory expansion  and still maintain &quot;near&quot; CD quality sound is certainly worth a  try.  So that is what I did.  I converted several of my MP3's@128kbps to  WMA@64kbps and then did a  &quot;side by side&quot; sound comparison of the  two for any given song.  Folks...I was hard pressed to hear any difference  in quality.  And in those few instances where while listening very hard...I  thought there was a small difference...it certainly was not enough to  matter.  Wow! was I thrilled with the possibilities of WMA.  So, when  Diamond announced support for this format with their new line of  players...I knew that I would purchase the Rio600 as soon as possible.<p>I  couldn't help but shake my head as I read one reviewer call the WMA support  as ...&quot;meaningless&quot; because it is not an &quot;open&quot; format  like MP3. Well, when you are downloading to the player...what does it  matter?   I have all my music still preserved as MP3's on CD-R's ready for  conversion to any other format that may  exceed the memory saving space of  WMA.<p>Besides the WMA support...this player has so much more going for it  than the earlier Rio's and all other players out there.  I'm afraid I will  be running out of room to go into detail but I just felt with all the  complaints about the measly 32megs. of memory with the Rio600...it seems  that most people have not attempted or are not aware of the true advantage  of WMA...CD quality sound and half the size of MP3 means<p>twice the  music!<p>You really owe it to yourself to try it out.

<Title>this rio rocks!
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>if you are trying to decide between the 600 and other players, your search has ended here. The rio is not only incredibly lightweight but is very small. The software this player comes with is AWESOME it's very easy to use  and even reads mp3's from zip disks. If you are thinking about getting a  player with flash memory think again not only does the rio come with memory  but you can soon buy a 32 megabyte expansion for 50 bucks!  try buying a  32 meg flash card at 50 bucks!  the diamond comes with headphones that are  very comfy and great software, plus a usb cable. I downloaded a 4 meagabyte  song in 5 secconds!  The usb is not only fast but as soon as i plugged it  in it immediatly detected the player. i just can't say enough about this  player i would give it 15 stars if amazon would let me!  trust me, if you  buy this player you won't be dissapointed. p.s.s the sound this baby makes  is just like a cd, forget what that other guy said about crackles, it's  crystal clear!

<Title>Rio600 review...part II.
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Ok, my last review had more to do with &quot;championing&quot; theadvantages of the WMA format over MP3 (since the Rio600 supports WMA). But I would like to know add my thoughts and review of the player and what I believe are it's biggest improvement (besides WMA support) over the previous Rio's, particularly the Rio500.<p>Style-No doubt about it, the Rio600 blows away the previous Rio's in the style category. Of course I realize that this is a subjective trait but the Rio600 is quite an &quot;eye catcher&quot; IMHO.<p>Feel-The case coating material (I believe it is teflon or some other &quot;rubber&quot; based compound) gives the player a real nice feel while holding it in the palm of your hand.  Also, that &quot;odd&quot; shape is really quite ergonomically sound.<p>Functionality-Big improvement here as well.  The &quot;joy pad&quot; (as Diamond calls it) is far better than the small individual &quot;function&quot; buttons of the Rio500. Once you put your finger on it, you are able to easily engage all the major playback options (play/pause, forward, backward and stop) without looking at the player. With the Rio500, you have to either take the player out of it's clip carrying case or just guess whether or not your finger is on the correct button for whatever play back option you are trying to engage.  I am able to keep the Rio600 in it's case (I purchased a &quot;generic&quot; Neosporin cell phone clip case and it fits like a glove and works great) while just reaching down, putting my finger on the joy pad and from there it is quite simple to know where all the play back options are. Also, the playback buttons on the Rio500 were &quot;above&quot; the case surface.  This made it somewhat necessary to engage the &quot;hold&quot; button on top.  With the Rio600, the rim of the joy pad is &quot;flush&quot; with the case surface and then gradually is &quot;indented&quot; into the surface in a &quot;cone like&quot; geometry.  So, if you bump the player into a piece of equipment, it is far more unlikely that the playback features will be altered thus making the use of the hold button unnecessary. Again, not engaging the &quot;hold&quot; button then makes it possible to easily engage all the other playback options with the joy pad while actively exercising, etc.  This also makes the need for a add on remote less useful.<p>Navigation-Once again...much better than the Rio500.  The thumbwheel of the Rio500 is not intuitive in the least.  When I purchased the Rio500, the instructions (if you could call it that) that came with it were pretty pathetic.  No where did it mention how to access the &quot;submenu&quot; options using the thumbwheel.  I found that out after &quot;technical support call #1&quot; (with many, many more to come over the next several months). The Rio600 is very intuitive and very easy to figure out.  How can you not understand it with a dedicated button labeled &quot;menu&quot;? Once you hit this button, a row of folder tabs rise from the button of the LCD screen.  Very similar to your toolbar in Windows if you have the &quot;auto hide&quot; option chosen.  Now here is where it does require a little technical intuition on the users part.  You use the joy pad to navigate from one folder tab to the other.  You hit the center button of the joy pad to choose your option.  You are able to move in all 4 directions and choose the various options with the joy pad.  Again, much better than the thumbwheel of the Rio500. Generally, the whole LCD display is far more pleasing than the Rio500.<p>USB Interface and Transfer-Well, hooking up the player end of the USB cable takes a little more effort than the Rio500 but it may be worth.  It appears to be much faster than the Rio500 in the transfer rate.  Also, if the player is off (in the sleep mode that is)...once you hook up the USB cable the player comes to life and turns on.  This seems to indicate that unlike the Rio500, the USB is actually supplying the power during transfer.  Big advantage if this is indeed the case...much less drain on the battery.<p>Bottom line...easily a big improvement over the Rio500!  And with future accessories (particularly the memory/rechargeable upgrade back packs), this player will even be better.  I was going to hold out for the Rio800 but since I was having so many problems with my Rio500 (can you say 4 returned and 5 failed units! ), I decided to grab this as soon as possible.  I can honestly say that for $100.00 dollars less than the Rio500...this player has made me one happy consumer.  If you think that I am forgetting the fact that this is only a 32meg. player vs. the Rio500's 64megs...please read my initial post about the WMA format support and what this essentially means in terms of total playing time.  Also, a few have said that this player is having problems with MP3 playback.  I can not speak to this since I only use WMA music files on this player and they all have worked flawlessly.<p>Hoped this information helps,<p>Drew

<Title>Diamond Rio facts
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've been wanting an mp3 player for a while now and I have been tracking the different kinds ever since they came out.  I almost bought a Rio 500, until I heard of the Rio 600. Though there are a couple of reviews that say  it's a bad product (doesn't play whole song, sound is bad)I have not  encountered any of these problems. It plays the whole song without  skipping, and the sound is quite impressive, especially the base it can  offer. The software is satisfactory, and though it only comes with 32  megabytes of memory, the WMA support it offers still allows me to put about  16 songs on it. This compared to a 300 dollar Nomad II without WMA support  kind of seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, the Rio 600 doesn't have  voice recording capability, at least not out of the box. Of course, if the  mp3 you're recording has problems, then obviously the Rio, or any other mp3  player is not going to play it well. Make sure you have a good enough  computer to do USB transfers. All that aside, the Rio 600 has been very  good for me so far.

<Title>its aiight....
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The device itself is alright, menu options are cool, sound quality is good, and its compact size and rad earphones are very good.  The main drawback is that the buttons are kinda jacked. You're supposed to be able to hold and skip back or forward for 'X' amount of seconds, but the  button's circular-disc design limits the control of your search.  The  button can jam on you causing the whole thing to freeze, in which case you  gotta slide the battery/memory pack out and back in to reset the device.   To avoid this you should try and use the circular control button for track  search only.  <p>The software that comes with it isn't all that great.   Nothing really new has been put on there.  In fact, if you want better  sound and rips you should get MusicMatch Jukebox, and if you want better  visuals you should get Sonique, both of which are freewares.  The only  thing you really need from Rio Audio Manager is its upload ability which is  very fast.<p>Overall, this has been a mediocre purchase.  If you're looking  for an Mp3 portable player, you might want to look into something with more  memory since the additional memory backpacks(available later this summer)  may boost the overall price of the Rio 600 [considerably].

<Title>Rio 600 Pros and Cons
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Here's my assessment of things I like and don't like about the Rio 600:<p>Pros:<p>*Small, lightweight *No Skipping *Decent sound quality (the above apply to pretty much any portable MP3 player) *WMA Support *USB interface for fast transfer of songs *Future support for 340MB IBM  Microdrive *Possible future AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) support *Low  price<p>Cons: *Rio Audio Manager software is extremely cumbersome to use  *Supplied earphones do not sound good and will have to be replaced *You  cannot distinctly discern by touch what button you're pushing on the round  pad.  You'll end up stopping or pausing tracks when you want to skip to the  next track. *Only 32MB RAM standard with no upgrades available at this time  *Larger than previous model Rio 500 *No belt clip *No recording for FM  tuner<p>The Rio 600 is your basic MP3 player.  WMA support is nice, but  because of Digital Rights Management, the WMA format is difficult to deal  with and I'm not going to convert all my MP3s to WMA.  Someone should have  tested the Rio 600's button pad for usability.  You can't feel what button  you're pushing and because the Rio 600's body is curvy, it's hard to  discern up/down/left/right without looking at it.  You also have to use  your fingernail to push the tiny center button or you'll accidentally press  on of the up/down/left/right buttons as well.<p>As of right now, I would  recommend the Rio 600 over any other MP3 player currently available, not so  much because it's so good in itself, but it's good when you compare it to  the others.  The things I most wish it had right now are memory packs and  better software.  I'm not sure how much the memory pack upgrades will cost,  but I'm hoping that a 32MB memory pack will not put it in the ballpark of a  Rio 800 which will come with 64MB standard and have recording  support.<p>The Rio 600 is cheap, but if you get the Rio 600, plan on  spending more money on headphones and a memory upgrade, unless you want to  deal with the WMA format.  Faceplates allow you to change the color of the  Rio, but the standard metallic blue is stylish enough for me.

<Title>Welcome to the Next Level
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>S3 has heightened the standard for entry-level MP3 players with an inexpensive player that includes USB, Mac-compatibilty, and expandibility.  <p>Mac users rejoice, finally S3 (Diamond) has given us an inexpensive MP3  player compatible with the Mac. I own a PC at home, but I'm a Mac user in  my office. <p>While the Windows software rocks, the Mac's Soundjam software  leaves a lot to be desired. At Mac World companies like MusciMatch were  promising plug-ins for their MP3 players to allow 600 users to manage their  portable players, so maybe someone will develop a better interface.  However, I'm happy to have a player that works without any glitches on both  OS 8.6 and 9.04. <p>My main qualms with the harware is the on/off switch  because it also controls the ability to turn off the buttons when you stash  it in a pocket. In addition, I don't like the ear-buds packed with the  system.  Plus, don't trust the machine's battery monitor.  When the  batteries inch below 40%, grab an extra one in the event that it  prematurely dies -- I had this problem in the subway the other day.  In  addition, I reccomend Duracell Ultras for the 600, and a good pair of Sony  earphones.    <p>I can't wait for the memory upgrades. While other critics  pan S3's choice to stop using standard flash memory formats, I praise S3  because the company chose the new form factor, so they could use IBM's  smartdrive technology, which are basically small hard drives.  The price of  a 300 mb smart drive is the same as 64 mb of standard flash memory.  Hmm,  60 minutes of music, or 5 hours of music?  Unfortunately the smartdrive  backpacks won't be available until Christmas.  <p>This player is ideal for  both Windows and Mac users because of S3's embrace of smartdrive  technology.  However, if you already have a player, but are looking at  nextgen models with USB, wait until Christmas when the smartdrive  technology is available.

<Title>S3 Rio 600 review
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Rio 600 is a very good product. It has a low price $169.99, very good  sound quality,and, is above all easy to use. I did at first experience a  few problems with the whole song not playing, but after a few painless  calls to service and support, all the problems were fixed. The software is  fairly easy to use and because of the USB connectivity, downloads only take  a few seconds. You can also swap the blue faceplate for other faceplates  that are available at riostuff.com. This player is definitely a fashion  statement. The reason I'm giving this player 3 stars is it's meager  on-board memory. There are memory back packs available to boost it's  on-board memory,but it would have been a lot easier if it just supported  Compact Flash cards. But, if its combination of low price, stylishness, and  ease of use has won you over, just use WMA files like Drew said to  compensate for its slightly lacking memory.

<Content>The Rio 600 was a five-star product for the first three months; 3 stars for the next three, after the power slider broke --fortunately it remained in the "on" position :) ; and after six months, it stopped working altogether.  <p>Pros:<br>-Stylish<br>-Backlit display <br>-Good sound quality at low volumes, can get very loud (I usually listened at the volume setting of 3 out of 20, given a quiet room--but YMMV depending on the earphones)<br>-Neoprene belt case at least is rugged :P<p>Cons:<br>-Poor build quality <br>-Poor design decisions<br>-Proprietary memory expansion<br>-Rioport software works only with CDs as far as I know<p>When I first received the Rio 600 I was thrilled.  It felt nice and solid in the hand, the backlit LCD looked great with lots of track information, and the sound quality seemed pretty good.  I even grew to like the included earphones, which I found to be perfect for the gym and bike riding, unlike earbuds.  (For folks who like that type but hate getting their hair pinched, Sony makes the MDR-W08, which is all plastic). <p>I picked up a 64MB backpack (at a ridiculous price per MB, compared to CF, SM or SD cards) but the Rio600 was one of the few players to natively support Audible.com content, so I felt it was worth it.<p>A few months after I got it, the power slider became stuck in the "On" position.  I gave it a tug and it broke, sliding around freely.  The player stayed on, however, and since it will go into standby on its own, I didn't mind _too_ much. <p>But I really hated their design decision to use a d-pad button layout, instead of separate buttons for play/pause, ff, previous.  I can't count the times I tried to hit pause and went to the next track, or worse yet, hit previous and went to the beginning of the audiobook.  I'd rather have something you can operate easily by feel.<p>Then the d-pad quit working entirely (the play/pause button seems to be stuck) and I'm now in the market for a new player :(  I hate to say it, but since I have a 64MB paperweight, I'm thinking about giving the Rio 600 another try. It really was nice while it lasted.   <p>Then I press the d-pad on my broken unit (nope, still hard as a rock) and decide to look for something better.

<Content>Quite simply - I have two of them - and for the money - you cannot beat the musical experience.It's true you'll need to probably add the 64mb module to increase the amount of music stored - but you can buy the backpack modules on EBAY used if you'd like. And yes - Windows Media program is definately the transfer program to use. But it works FINE with Windows XP - it recognizes the Rio the second you plug it in. Downloads are fast and easy !<p>The headphones do have to be replaced for extended listening. Try finding a decent set that ships with ANY portable out there.

<Content>One of the best things about MP3 players is that you can easily put on whatever type of sound interests you most - whether it's jazz music, old time rock n' roll, or even bird songs! It's perfect not only for music, but also for any hobby that involves sound! For one great price you can get yourself an easily customizeable, greatly dynamic bird song system / language training system / etc. that doubles as a portable jukebox!<p>I love the Rio 600 - I have 2 of them - and they're super easy to load music on and off of. Just rip your favorite CDs, rearrange them into your own personal play sets, and load them onto the Rio. Want to learn a new language? Load up a set of phrases. Going birdwatching at the beach? Stick 20 beach bird songs on there, and there's plenty of room left for some music too!<p>The Rio has been very sturdy for me - we've dragged them everywhere, dropped them, thrown them, and it keeps on running strong. <p>Highly, highly recommended!

It comes with a carrying case that you can clip on to anything!  The software is easy to use. The sound quality is great! I have never been more happier in my life with this product. It is true, you do need to buy better headphones. You would with any other brand too!  None of the companies give good headphones with their product. It does need more memory, but prices on that are going down.  For the price, its the best Mp3 Player around. Take it from a Telecommunications major at one of the best colleges around.

I don't find the lack of a belt hook to bad as I use a bum bag anyway.  When I do want music, I can download either .wma or .mp3 files from my home library.  <p>My two dislikes are 1) the included headphones -- YECK! and the fact that you can't expand it with smart media cards -- you need to overpay Sonic Blue for &quot;backpacks&quot;.

<Title>Very nice player!
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is a very nice little MP3 player.  It has very simplenavigation and has a nice look also.  The 32 MB of built in memory is fine.  If you ever need more though, just get a memory backpack!  The software is easy to use and works very well.  The USB makes the transfers very quickly.  The Rio 600 also supports WMA files which is a nice addition to an MP3 player.  My ONLY complaints about this player is that 1. Some of the buttons and the switch on top feel kind of cheap and 2. I'm afraid that I might break the little guy. It actually would be pretty hard to break but I still like to be very careful with it :) The backlit LCD is nice and bright.  Most of all, the player works flawlessly.  The sound quality is great even at 60 KBPS.  I have never had a problem with the Rio 600.  If you want a small, lightweight, reliable, and sleek looking MP3 player, the Rio 600 is for you.

<Title>Premature Termination of Tracks
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>At least two other reviewers here have posted about the problem of some  Rio 600 units abrupting ending the play of a track before reaching the  tend.  Despite these warnings, and consoled by the large number of positive  reviews, I took the chance and bought a unit from the local store of a  large national clicks and mortar electronics chain.  Sure enough, my unit  exhibited the same behavior; of the three MP3 tracks I tested, ranging from  six to eighteen minutes, all would end after less than a third of the track  had been played.  A repeat download of one MP3 did work, so the problem  seems sporadic.  Despite a nice design, the execution is flawed.  Who wants  a well-designed can opener that opens a can only part way?  I returned the  unit.

<Title>A rock-solid value for a great product!
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I bought the Rio 600 yesterday, and it was my first mp3 player, even  though I have accumulated mp3's on the Mac for many months.  All around, I  have been extremely impressed with this player.  It works seamlessly with  my Mac, even through an add-on USB card.  The limited edition of SoundJam  MP, included with the player, is as Mac-friendly an app as you can get,  complete with full drag-n-drop capability and a clear visual interface.   The controls on the player are straightforward and intuitive, and it's easy  to navigate the player's menus.  The bright blue backlight makes it easy to  see what's playing, regardless of the lighting conditions.  Even though it  only comes with 32 megs of storage, I can still pack on a little over a  half-hour without losing sound quality.  My one request to S3 (the  manufacturer) is that they speed the shipment of accessories like bigger  memory &quot;backpacks&quot; and that they sell a version of the Rio 600  with 64 megs as well.  Overall, I could not have asked for a much better  player.  What a bargain at $170!!

<Content>Great product, exellent sound.  I also own a sony MD portable player, after I bought the Rio 600, I havn't used it once.  My only complaint is  with the Rio's software package, if you already have a large collection of  MP3's I had a difficult time loading them into the Rio's database.  Found  it much easier to use the plug-in with MusicMatch Jukebox to download  tracks into the Rio 600.

<Title>so far 2 rio600's both trash
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>My first rio600 waas improperly put together... The thing is light-weight  plastic to begin with, but this one was not sealed properly and the  on-hold-off button could just fall out unretained. Back to the store for a  replacement.<p>The second one is having all of the problems others have  reported: (1) the introduction of painfully loud pops and crackles into the  music, and (2) the inability to play MP3 files to completion. <p>Anyone  heard anything from S3 about these problems? I sent them a support email  from their webpage, but no answer so far...<p>So far this product looks  like a rush job to fill the super-low-end market. <p>Others seem to like  it, so maybe I've just been unlucky. But the premature song termination  problem seems reasonably wide-spread.<p>I recommend buying this one from  someplace you won't have any trouble returning it to if you have  problems!<p>Marc

<Title>Wow!
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I was a little nervous about buying a player with only 32MB of memory, but  since the Rio 600 supports WMA files it acts like a 64MB player.  It's very  cool to be able to have a playlist with both MP3 and WMA files, and the  software makes it VERY easy to do that.  <p>The one AA battery seems to  last forever.  The box says 10 hours, but I think I'm getting at least 11  or 12.<p>Great player and the best looking one on the market!  My brother  wants me to trade for his Sony player - No deal!!

<Content>After extensive research (and using reviews listed here), I bought the Rio  600 this past weekend and it rocks. The software to load new music is  basically &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; and the sound quality is awesome. My  only complaint is the 32 MB fills up real fast and I can't wait to buy the  340MB backup. If you're looking to make your co-workers jealous, this is  the toy to get.

<Title>Easily the best portable, but there's room for improvement
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The Diamond Rio 600 is a paradox.  It's twice as good as anything currently on the market, but half as much as you need.   There's something  very right about each of the three components of the system--headphones,  body and software--and yet there are serious deficiencies with each  part.<p>The Rio's headphones are  marginally tinny at any volume, and  stressed at higher volumes, but good enough for a portable you'll probably  use in a noisy environment anyway.  To be sure, other headphones will be  needed to fully realize the sound possibilities of the Rio, but the ones  included give you at least the beginnings of great sound.   Their rather  odd, around-the-ear construction is both sensible and awkward.  They're  perfect for using while working out, because they never fall out,  regardless of how vigorously one behaves.  But they're hard to get used to  because they do take a comparatively longer time to put in than other  headphones.   Serious audiophiles will dismiss them outright; those of us  just looking for workout music will probably get used to their oddness.   <p>The body of the Rio is its clear strength.  It's about the size of a  pager-but lighter.  Of all the portable music solutions I shopped--CD,  cassette, and digital alike-this one is the very best in terms of  size/quality ratio.  It's the best thing I've ever used for working out.   It's also the best device currently available in terms of expandability.   Though on the surface it seems to have less memory than the Rio 500, and  than many other newer .mp3 players, it has the capacity for adding on 340  mb.  Also, the fact that it takes the .wma (Windows Media) format  effectively means that you can store what would be the equivalent of 64mb  of songs in the .mp3 format <p>There are some reservations, though.  First,  its small size means that the battery is tucked away in a pretty  inaccessible place.  It's somewhat tricky seating a new battery.  It's not  impossible, mind you, and it's worth the effort given the benefit of the  unit's small size, but it's still frustrating on occasion.  Second, while a  battery does actually give 10 hours of use, the unit's battery life  estimator is never accurate.  It deducts time too slowly at the start of a  battery, so that by the time you get to 6 hours of apparent time left, you  actually have only 1 or 2 hours.  It's not a huge problem, once you figure  it out, but it can be infuriating at first.  Third, the unit doesn't come  with a belt clip holder or an FM tuner.  They're both available, but  they're extra.  I can understand the FM tuner being extra, but it seems  ridiculous for a portable music player to come without the means to make it  truly portable.<p>Finally, there's the software.  Easily the weakest  element of the Diamond Rio 600, it's only a *little* more than a way to add  on $20 to the price of the unit.   It's entirely too difficult to install  and get running.  I installed the version off the included CD.  When I got  it running, it linked me to rioport.com, which informed me there was an  update available.  This update, however, was really only for the Rio 300  and 500, and so it failed to recognize the Rio 600 as being present.  So I  uninstalled the update and tried again with the CD version.  Then after a  mere 50 rips, it told me I had to pay to "unlock" the program.  So I tried  to unlock, but the software never allowed me to get to the "pay" screen.  I  then reinstalled the update and miraculously was allowed to unlock the  program.  But this version still didn't recognize the Rio 600.  So I  uninstalled the update and reinstalled the original.  Finally, everything  worked.  Hardly an encouraging start.  Then, I instructed the program to  search my hard drives and come up with a database of playable media.  This  it did, but it found a lot of `junk' files I wanted to delete.   Unbelievably, the program doesn't allow you to group delete, so I had to  individually delete each file I didn't want.  Finally, after hours of time  and $20, I got the software set up and ready to use.  But then came another  one of those little Rio paradoxes.  One of the strengths of the software is  that it allows you to read a CD at a variety of different compressions.   You can decide to fit more of your songs on the Rio and sacrifice a little  quality.   The problem is that you might want a song at the highest quality  to burn a CD (which the software also does) but at a lower one to send to  the Rio.   The result is that you practically have to read each CD twice.    That's a lot of hard disk space to dedicate to your music library.   Hopefully updates will include some sort of converter, so that you only  have to scan CDs once.  <p>On balance, I highly recommend the Rio,  especially if you're just looking for workout music.  Be warned, however,  that it won't be quite the effortless pathway to great music that the  merchandising proclaims, and that the Rio is based on modularity.  It has  the greatest potential of any current .mp3 player--it can be worn  comfortably, has the largest potential memory, can play FM music, and can  even be used on your car's lighter--but you're going to have to pay for  each added function.

<Title>Perfect for audiobooks!
<Date>Mon Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I love my Rio 600. I purchased it along with a subscription to Audible.com (highly recommeded also)and it works just wonderfully for audiobooks. Software loaded perfectly, and I get 9 hours of book playback on this incredibly light, very durable player. It comes with a little case with a belt clip, and I just clip it to my clothes at work and listen to my books. Dowloads are quick and easy, and it plays just crystal-clear. I haven't tried it for music, but it's just perfect for audiobooks. The best part is that you can load several different books at one time, if you're like me and like to listen to several at once, depending on your mood. Audible.com's software allows you to load specified times to the player, so you can load one hour of Steven King, 3.14 hours of John Grisham, and so on up to 9 hours. The backlit screen on the front is easy to use, and as long as you hit stop before you turn off the unit, it remembers where you left off and starts there again. It's also very easy to scroll between the various books you have downloaded. I highly recommend this player for audiobooks.

<Title>Defective product and insulting service
<Date>Sat Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I purchased a Rio 600 for my son's Christmas present. It became defective after a couple of weeks. I spent more weeks getting to tech support  and running through tests before they would issue an RMA.<p>Their RMA process says that if the unit is defective, they will replace it, provided they have replacements in stock in their service center. Guess what? They don't have any in the service center, even as they sell them on-line. They have no expectation of getting any and require that customers wait indefinitely for the replacement units.<p>I get the impression that there is a high defect rate and it is clearly compounded by awful service.

<Title>Just got one...
<Date>Sun Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I just bought one of these at a local electronics store.  I can't say for the device (since it hasn't worked, yet), but the software is trash.  If you get one you should know that you will:<p>a) have to register it with the manufacturer with unique ID codes and your email before it will run.  (before that, it will just crash anytime you try to send data to the device.  But, SURPRISE, once you register it, it works perfectly!  Or, at least, it starts working at all...)<p>b) pay them a monthly fee to use the software.  You are allowed a free mode, disabling several features, including storing data on CD's, but to use the rest of the features, you have to pay a monthly [fee]...P>Just keep these things in mind, when you're considering the low upfront price of this device.

<Title>Rio 600, a nice little MP3 player.
<Date>Tue Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this MP3 player a few months ago.  I think it is a great little device.  I would recommend that you purchase one, except that it isn't perfect.  <br>The main problem with this cute little thing is that it doesn't take a standard (and cheap) memory format.  If you want to expand its memory, you have to spend way too much money buying proprietary 'backpacks' instead of something cheap like MMC's.<br>The second problem with this player is the small carrying case.  The neoprene case with belt clip... is a welcome layer of protection and convience.  However, the plastic 'window' is of no use whatsoever and and actually damages the MP3 player.  The case is very snug, which isn't a problem.  The problem is that the snug neoprene pulls the clear plastic window down too firmly onto the buttons of the player.  Specifically, the 'Menu' button can become damaged and then is super sensitive.  What you do is stuff two or three socks into the case and let it sit for a couple days.  If it doesn't seem like they'll fit, keep trying (I am not responsible if you blow up your case, haha).  This stretches out the case and prevents damage to the player.  Also, the window is a source of frustration, as if you try to change songs or volume without taking the player out of the case, the menu will pop up first.  Also, you can only see the bottom 1/5 of the display while in the case.  So, it would have been better if they had just left the window out of the whole thing, but no one asked me...<br>Finally, 32MB of memory is enough.  The only catch is that you have to just shove that CD that came with the MP3 player up the constricted hind-ends of whomever wrote it and use Windows Media Player, which does a fine job of interfacing with the Rio 600.  WMP is availble freely for download for Windows users.  WMP even converts to WMA on the fly at whatever bitrate you desire, so you don't have to 'convert your whole collection'.  Finally, WMA does sound better at 64kbps than MP3 does.  However, songs that are heavy in percussive high pitch noises can be slightly distorted.  I've found this isn't an issue with about 80% of the music I listen to.  You'll have to find a song (I suggest Hail, Hail by Pearl Jam) and convert it to 64kpbs WMA.  If you don't mind how it sounds, you'll be fine with the stock 32MB that the player comes with.<br>If you are still reading this, and I haven't scared you away, here are the good things about this player.<br>Dirt cheap (I got mine for $[money] after a mail-in rebate).<br>Beautiful and somewhat sturdy (except for that poor, abused menu button).<br>Lots of cool accessories (like different colored faceplates, inline FM tuners)<br>Lasts about 8-10 hours on a freshly charged Nickle Metal Hydride battery (forget Nicads, this thing eats them for breakfast.  Also, if you use alkaline and throw them away, I hope you have to drink water contaminated with used batteries).<br>Beautiful and easy to use interface / display.  Tons of information, lots of cool little screens.  Hi-res (for an MP3 player!).<br>If you want to listen to tons of music on a small player, get something that costs $[money] and takes MMC.  If you want something to replace your cassette walkman (holds about 60 minutes of music, convert and transfer music quickly) then get this.

It took me several hours to figure out how to load songs onto the device. The Real Jukebox software is very intrusive, loading many things onto your computer. When I tried updating the software, it would only give me a 14-day trial to the new software and asked me for a credit card. I am a literate computer user and fond this device to be very difficult to load songs. Customer support give you the wrong email address and cannot forward you email to the proper division.

<Title>short of expectations
<Date>Sat May 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The Rio 600 was a bit of a disappointment.  First of all, within a week or two, the supplied earplugs separated and the control pad used to play the songs became increasingly more difficult to depress.  Getting a song to play was at times almost impossible.  One thing that I really did not like was the inaccurate power monitor for the batteries.  When the Rio said that I had &lt; 4 hrs playing time, it would not play.  According to the power monitor, the battery still had 1/3 of its power, but yet the Rio did not play.  I must say that I have been dissappointed with the Rio.  I would recommend the Rio as a[n]..alternative to people...

<Content>I got my player through Audible.com and I love it! It's well made and SIMPLE to use.My only recommendation is that you ignore 99% of the software that comes with it. It wants you to use RealJukebox(which is junk as far as I'm concerned). I discovered that the jukebox I already had on my computer works just fine(MusicMatch). I did eventually buy the memory backpack with the charger. Both of those are also easy to use- it's nice not having to open the back to change batteries.A 32mb player with the 32mb backpack will hold about 16 hours of audio books or a couple of music CDs(depending on the compression rate of your music).I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product.

<Title>I Really Like MY Rio 600!!
<Date>Tue May 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have had my Rio 600 32MB Mp3 Player for almost a month now. I have not had ANY problems with it at all. Tranferring the songs onto the player is quick and very easy. It says in the instructions that you have to install the Real Player onto your computer to work it, but Musicmatch also works with the Rio, and you can reduce the bitrate for mp3 onto it, meaning you don't have to convert to wma format. I reduce mine to 64 kpbs, and it sounds great! There are only  two reasons I did not give my rating a 5 star:1) it was only 32 mb, and you defintely need 64 mb, to enjoy the player to the fullest. So, I had to purchase an extra 32 mb backpack for it, but the extra backpack came with a rechargeable battery, and an adaptor, so I don't have to worry about buying new batteries every week. 2) I wasn't too impressed with the earphones that came with it, so I bought another set, which worked out great. I can fit 30 songs on this player, which is just fine with me! This is a great MP3 player, and I highly reccommend purchasing it!!

The Play/Pause button, the rewind button,  and the stop button have worked fine, but the fast forward/next track  button doesn't work right.  It somehow makes the songs Play or Pause too.  <p>That really doesn't matter though because the remote control will  replace all the buttons and it should be fine.

<Title>Worse than I thought. I have 2 in my hands right now
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Hm.. lets see. After reading all these great reviews.. i went ahead and ordered one from amazon.  Then the day before it arrived, my gf bought me one from a local store.  So I figured, hey, Ill keep both and try them both  out just in case one has a problem.. well.. after 8 hrs of playing around  with both of them with 2 sets of cables.. I am pretty disappointed.  Let me  tell you why..<p>First of all, the detection of the unit by the USB cable  is relatively poor. I had to exit and restart the audio manager a few times  and turn the power on and off the unit itself before it detected it.  That  is one of the main reasons Im returning both units tomorrow.  It is rather  annoying to play guess games to see if it picks up on the unit.<p>Second  major flaw.  I didnt get any skipping as few other reviewers have, but  however, the tracks I did record onto the player was periodically  interrupted with annoying (and loud) white noise.. I even went as far as to  record the SAME exact track on both of the units.. and guess what?  Both  units had the same problem.. except the noise interruptions were showing up  on different part of the track .. so if it was my mp3 (which played fine on  winamp) .. the noises should of at least showed up at the same time on both  units.  The noises aren't long.. just about a faction of a second or so..  however.. it is much louder than the set volume of the music and even as a  collge student, my head hurt after listening to a few tracks.  I recorded  and re-recorded tracks and on both units, they were all interrupted with  periodic chirps or white noise. Anyhow, you get the idea.<p>I really wish I  had gotten a unit that was as perfect as all the other reviewers had  received.  However, this is the truth from my experiences with the units  and I had not exagerrated any of the above.  Im running on an Intel 700 so  I really dont think it was my computer's problem.  Anyhow.

<Content>Most MP3 players are not made that well, RIO is the best of the lot.  The  600 is functional but has little memory, and as of yet, expansion memory is  not available, and no prices are set for it as well; you really don't know  what you're going to be charged.  There is an 800 model coming out with  twice the memory, definitely worth waiting for. Buy a RIO, just not this  one, yet. Wait for more information.

<Content>THE DIAMOND RIO 600 IS UNREAL! SURE, IT MIGHT ONLY ME 32MEGS, BUT IT'S  AWESOME! THE SOUND QUALITY IS AS GOOD AS THE RIO 500 OR NOMAD, BUT THE  BUNDLED HEADPHONES ARE ONLY AVERAGE. THE PLAYER IS LOADED WITH FEATURES  INCLUDING A COO BLUE BACKLIT DISPLAY, DSP (SAME AS EQ) SETTINGS AND HEAPS  MORE. IT EVEN HAS 'NOKIAPHONE' STYLE CHANGEABLE COVERS! HOVEVER, THE BLUE  STILL LOOKS GREAT! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLAYER! THE SOFTWARE IS ALSO  GREAT AND THE PLAYER ITSELF IS REASONABLY SMALL AND VERY LIGHT. IT ALSO HAS  A SLOT FOR MEMORY EXPANSIONS UP TO 420MB! THAT'S ENOUGH FOR AROUND 110  CD-QUALITY MP3 FILES! THIS PLAYER ALSO SUPPORTS WMA. BUY IT TODAY!

<Title>Some bad units out there
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I purchased a Rio 600 at CompUSA and returned it a week later.  It  exhibited the same problems a few of you have commented on:  (1) the  introduction of painfully loud pops and crackles into the music, and (2)  the inability to play MP3 files to completion.  The software is not too  great.  I assume, from the overwhelming positive reviews, that not everyone  has this problem but beware.

<Title>Don't blame Rio.
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Don't blame RIO if you are having problems with your PC or your PC software. I've had the Rio 600 for several weeks now and it worked  flawlessly from day one on my MAC Powerbook and MAC desktops. The sound is  very good. As for the memory, for $169 it is a very good buy. Memory  expansion modules will soon be available, making this a truly flexible  unit. Think Different!

<Title>Great product....unless you're one of the unfortunate &quot;few&quot;
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Let's start with my beefs-they are few but if you're unfortunate enough to be suffering from the most troubling of them, you're probably breathing  fire from Rio's handling of the situation.  I'm referring to the 'USB bug'  that infects certain computers (tech support couldn't be more clear/candid  about how many people were suffering from the ailment).  &quot;It's our  biggest complaint&quot; were the words of my by-now beleagured support  guru, Mike.  It's essentially static that bleeds into your player when  music is downloaded that translates into minor static bursts (try picking  one up at high volume) to an outright skipping of the song to the next  track...intermittantly.  Try jogging with your car radio set to 'scan'  without the benefit of a regular interval and you'll know what I'm talking  about.  Out of the dozen or so tracks (different bit rates, repeated  attempts) I downloaded, 11 of them exhibited this maddening glitch, which  to me rendered the device useless.  Rio's response?  &quot;They should be  updating the firmware in the next 2 weeks to compensate for the  problem&quot;.  This after the device was available on the market for over  4 weeks.  Grrrrrrr....  The work-around?  Buy a USB hub: my Xircom 4 port  (after a speedy 3 minute installation) licked the problem for $29.  Face  it: the way the industry is headed, you're probably going to use multiple  USB devices eventually.  Use this logic to keep you from screaming into the  phone at your tech support rep about how ridiculous it is that arguably the  largest MP3 audio manufacturer can screw up this badly.  And don't try the  website for info on the when the glitch will be patched or even  acknowledgement that it exists: it's useless. <p>My other beefs are minor,  but annoying.  No belt clip.  Who do they think is using their product?   Try the weight room or the track without the handy PMP 300 clip.  Not very  well thought-out.   And the earbuds...it may be me, but are any of you  noticing the &quot;water ear&quot; you get with aerobic exercise and these  things?  It seems that sweat gets diverted somehow diectly into your ear.   If I'm not using these things correctly, please let me know.<p>With that  off my chest, I have nothing but praise for the player and the software.   The LED may (or may not) chomp at the battery, but it's clear, backlit and  gadgety enough to impress my friends (if they're not in the middle of  'Freebird' when it skips).  The menu button is handy and the forward, back,  etc paddle is nifty enough.  The hold button has even moved to a place  where it can be used!  (See PMP 300).  The audio software for file  transfers is lucid as any I've seen.  I especially like the visual  representations of the music (attention Rio:make it a  screensaver-convertible and I'll forget about the earbuds).  The  possibility for expansion is cool too...300+mB?  I can't wait to see the  price tag (and I'm hearing ADDED?  battery consumption *ahem*) on that  one.  Who am I kidding?  To hear my Barenaked Ladies CD's at 192mps, I'll  snatch it up in a heartbeat.  <p>Bottom Line:  If you're one of the  unfortunates who picked up a computer with a 'polluted' USB, pick up a hub  and some crazy glue for a belt clip.  Or you could just buy a Yepp.  But  for my money, WMA compatibility and exponential expansion, I'll make do  with a semi-scathing review on amazon.com.

<Title>DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This mp3 player is very easy to download songs onto and is portable and light BUT, this product only holds 32 megabytes, which is pretty expensive  for that small memory.  I bought this product and could only hold 6  regualar sized songs, about 3.5 minutes each.  The only way to get more  memory is to buy a whole new memory stick will will cost you another load  of money.  That means just 6 more songs!  I decided to get a minidisc  player instead.

<Title>Bang for the buck!!
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Hear me out. I purchased the Nomad II by creative Labs, nice, but very  pricey, $300!! Ouch. I took it back. I picked up the Rio 500, also a nice  unit, but still pricey, $269. I took it back as well. The reason for the  purchasing of the first two is this: Smart Media, I have a Ricoh Digital  Camera and thought that it would be great to swap out the smart media cards  with them. Boy was I wrong.....BE WARNED.....once a rio device formats a  smart media card, it can only be used in that rio device. Talk about anger  when I smoked a 32MB card on the rio 500. Any way back to the Rio 600,  since I had to buy memory for the rio 500, I looked into the 600. It's a  $100 less. It's better looking. The display and LCD screen are much clearer  and easier to understand. Rio has a ton of cool things coming out for it.  Like a FM tuner remote. IBM will have out this fall a 340MB micro drive  back pack that you can slap on. I heard the price will be $250. Yeah that's  alot but a 64MB smart media card is around $150! You can get replaceable  face plates, just like your Nokia phone. The software is great, and what  USB problems? Keep in mind that I have mine connected to my G4. No  problems. Maybe because it's a Mac, I don't know. Look it's a awesome  player for the cost, the head phones are fine, people that complain about  them should stand in front of a mirror while putting them on the first time  so they can figure it out. I really like mine.

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I loved this unit when I first got it and used it daily for 2 months.  Then the on/off switch broke.  Technical Support is impossible to reach unless you call 3 minutes before they open.  I finally got them and returned the unit.  3 weeks later my new unit arrived and worked great for a week.  Then it starting having memory problems and I could not get it to play anything.  I complained to management and got a new unit about 1 week later.  It connected to my computer and loaded music fine but all I hear is static.  I have now had 3 units in the first 4 months and all had different problems but none works.

<Title>Rio 600 for spoken word
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Overall, I found the Diamond Rio 600 only marginally satisfactory for my needs. In fairness, I should add that my needs are apt to be different from that of many other people. I bought the Rio 600 primarily to listen to spoken word, such as from Audible, not primarily for listening to music, and my most of my complaints about the Rio are of less importance for playing music.<p>Before turning to specific problems, let me say that there are several quite good things about the Rio. The USB drivers work flawlessly and downloading to the unit is fast and nearly trouble free. The only problem I had (using Windows 2000) was that the Rio Manager could not see the unit from a user account after installation from the Administrator account. I upgraded the user account to have administrative privileges and reinstalled the software from the user account to solve this problem. This compromises security, but it does work. <p>The connectors are solid and most of the buttons on the unit work with solid tactile feel and respond reliably. The only exception is the round shuttle which is quite sensitive to direction and which often does surprising things. In particular, any attempt to set a bookmark is a gamble on par with a Las Vegas slot machine. Most of the time you just loose (in this case, no money, just your place in the program). <br> <br>On top of that, when you just stop the Rio, you automatically loose your place in whatever your were listening to. With music this may not be a major annoyance, but with spoken word it is an extremely annoying deficiency. After listening to the first forty-six minutes of a news program on my drive to work, I'd like to listen to the remaining forteen minutes later in the day - not start over from the beginning. Unfortunately, the Rio assumes that I would prefer to start over.<p>One other problem (for my admitedly peculiar needs) is recording density. The unit only supports monaural MP-3; it will not play monaural WMA. The impact of this is that it un-necessarily restricts the amount of material that I can record on the device.<p>Trying to notify Diamond of these problems revealed what is probably the biggest reason I regret buying the Rio 600. Their customer service stinks! If you call them on the phone they suggest sending email to avoid waiting. But don't believe this suggestion! They never answer email. Never, ever! Stay on the line! It may take an hour or two of waiting but this is the only away to get a response. When you do reach someone, they are apt to be knowledgeable and helpful, but obviously over-worked and way too busy to waste much time with you.

<Title>Has a great first run, then watch out!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was on cloud 9 with this product for about a week: wma compatible, nice headphones, etc.  Then I needed to change the battery, and all hell broke loose.  The backpack failed to snap back on after replacing the battery, then the off/on switch snapped and wouldn't work anymore.  Within a week, this had turned into one useless product.  So I took it back and exchanged it for the Intel 3000: it may look a little clunkier and the headphones aren't as nice, but it's been great so far, and I haven't had any problems changing batteries.<p>Buyer beware!

<Title>Inevitably, everything comes to an end
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>13 months, 12 days.  This is exactly how long my RIO 600 worked for me.  And yet according to many reviews, I lucked out...I think that by eclipsing the one-year mark I broke the record!<p>So now what do I have?  A purplish plastic thingy that refuses to turn on when I give it that very command.  I'm not asking it to factor 200 digit numbers.  Nor am I asking it to draft an economically feasible flat-tax proposal.  I am just asking it to turn on, and yet it can't.<p>This seems to be easily, the most common defect among RIO products, particularly their portable MP3 players.  I think that they might have to start advertising these things as disposable, we should be able to buy them in six-packs.<p>Anyway, I am going to avoid the temptation of getting another one of these stylish numbers, and I am recommending that anyone thinking of buying one look at another brand.  Intel is looking better and better, but I really wish that Sony would get in the MP3 game.<p>Bottom line: if this gizmo could last longer than a hockey season it would be great.  Features are wonderful, great sound, yada yada yada.  Sadly though, it just aint gonna last, and that's a fact.

<Title>It's a shame they can't make one that works
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I really wanted to like this gadget. It does just about everyting a portable MP3 player should. It's display is easily readable. The menu functions are intuitive. It supports id3 tags, playlists, and bookmarks. It remembers where I was in the playlist if it powers down. The sound quality is great. The earphones are decent. It is fully supported by iTunes and my Mac. And the price was right. My only real criticism is the skimpy 32MB and the use of non standard memory for upgrades.<p>But.....<p>In three tries, I could not get one that functioned properly.  The first one would "wink-out" from time to time. The second one had a defective display backlight. The third wouldn't power up at all. I finally gave up. Fortunately, [...] exchanges and returns were fairly painless.

<Title>VERY Disappointing - BROKE at first battery change...
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>mp3 players are wonderful!  And I was in love with this unit - until the first time I tried to change the battery.  The battery is attached thru the memory &quot;backpack&quot; and sliding this unit off and on is difficult.  When the pins for the memory chip failed to line up perfectly, they broke - rendering this product useless.  Make sure that the mp3 player you end up with uses Compact Flash cards for memory, is upgradable, and has more than 32mb of memory (32mb holds 6 to 8 songs).  Good luck!!

<Content>I received my Rio 600 for [price] (a refurbished one) when I signed up for a years [store].  I use it exclusively for [store] books. It holds about 6 hours at a time.  For back and forth to work, its great.  My Rio does not restart every time I shut it off.  It resumes from where I was.  Setting a bookmark though proved to not work.  It does set me back to zero, so I  just shut off.  Two major complaints.  The foldup headphones look good, but hurt my ears.  I'd prefer something softer.  Secondly, the single AA battery compartment is shabby.  Occasionally the Rio won't turn on, although I get no low battery warning.  I just open the case, and reinsert the same battery.  Voila!  Doesn't happen too often.  The battery lasts about 6 hours, which is good for me.  Wish I had a cassette player in my car!  Mine came with the adapter,  but I only have a CD player.  Like I say, if its [price], the quirks are quite livable!

<Title>This is Probably The Worst MP3 Player Ever!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I got this mp3 player as a birthday present and i was really excited because i had wanted one. The software had a lot of problems resulting in a lot of changes to my computer system. Some of the songs i had wouldn't load on to the mp3 player even though they were in mp3 format and the songs i could get to load would skip and were very bad quality. The power switch which controls on/off/hold functions fell out almost every time i used it, and if you have seen this mp3 player you know that the switch is pretty small. So after i took off the backpack and opened up the mp3 player i had to get out my tweezers and carefully place the switch plate back on to the actual switch that is about the size of a pinhead. Not Very fun since music is my life and i bring my mp3 or Cd player every where i go. So, if you are considering this mp3 player, DON'T BUY IT!!

<Title>A good 32MB MP3 player
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've had the Rio 600 for over a 7 months. In that time I've dropped it countless times, stood on it, fell on it (bicycling), spilt coffee on it and other varieties of abuse! And it's survived unscathed. If you're looking for a player for outdoor use then the Rio is excellent.<p>The main drawback with this model is the buttons. If you aim to fast forward or to skip a tune, you generally hit the pause key. The headphones are poor quality (but aren't all headphones that come with these units!) and the software is pretty unfriendly. That said though, as it's only 32MB, it doesn't require much to transfer those 5-15 tunes.<p>Definitely go for the 64MB model as even compressing tunes down to a reasonable 96 kps only fits 10-12.<p>I had this given to me as a present, but I would certainly recommend buying one to my friends.

I really like the light on the LCD screen. I can see it when I'm in bed. I really like the shape and color it's "snazzy!" There are two small things that I don't like about the Rio 600: it runs out of batteries kind of fast (so just carry extra), and the search buttons are a little bit hard to use. Other than those two things it's a really great MP3 player at a really great price too! Enjoy!

I was one of the  people that suffered from the USB bug and contacted Tech Support from  Diamond.  They were very unhelpful and ran me around the bush when it came  to getting a fix for the bug &quot;it will be out in a day or two&quot;  (two weeks later still no fix).  <p>I tired then to return the product to  Best Buy but since they have a very poor 30 day return policy were  unwilling to help me out (i returned it 5 days over their 30 day agreement)  I even showed them pages and pages of email between myself and Diamond.   Needless to say do not shop at Best Buy beacuse they are unwilling to do  that little extra for the customer.<p>On a positive note, Diamond was  willing to refund the purchase price of my unit without any problems.   Maybe Best Buy should learn from them.

When I called Customer Support, they said there were problems  with the current version of Rioport Manager, and a new one would be posted  to the S3 website soon.  So far, it hasn't been.  BUT.... There is software  that allows you to download files using Windows Media Player 7, and this  works fine.  Windows Media Player also automatically converts MP3s to WMAs  (if you want it to, by setting the writing speed to 64mps).  It can also  transfer MP3s, but since the WMAS take up half the space and (to my ears)  sound just as good, why not use wmas?  I can get about 14 songs on this  way.<p>Now, the second problem.  The skips.  My unit skipped on about 1/3  of the songs originally.  But the website has a firmware update, which you  download to your computer.  When you run the program it updates the  operating system of the Rio.  The skipping problem seems to be gone, and  now you can create playlists right in the player!  I'm definitely happy  about this.

<Title>It works now!
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I agree wholeheartedly with JT's assessment of the product.  I too had  songs cutting off and mind jarring skipping noises when I first purchased  this product.  HOWEVER, Diamond Rio has actually fixed the problem with  their new firmware.  (Version 1.08 available from their website.)  And now  it works perfectly. No skipping or dropping, an hour of CD quality music.   My computer system isn't that state of the art, so I'm sure if the firmware  fix worked on my machine it will work on yours.  A cool, relatively  inexpensive product.

<Title>Why an Mp3 Player?
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>One of my misinformed siblings bought the 600 and thought it was fine and  all. A few weeks later I got the Minidisc Player/Recorder Sharp 722, I was  the envy of my brother.  For only $180 you can get a good minidisc  player/recorder and have the ability to have a MD collection full of hours  and hours of music. An mp3 player can only hold about 32 mb of audio which  is not equilivant to to even 40 minutes of playing time. But minidiscs only  cost about $1.50 if you but them off Amazon and each one has a 74 minute  playing time, like a CD. You can name he tracks, divide, combine, delete,  or add another at any time. But you're not restricted to only getting music  from mp3. If you buy an audio patch cable at Radio Shack for $4 you can get  sound directly from computer to MD, CD to MD, MD to MD.        My main  point is that you should shop around for a portable music player, I think  you'll find that for about 20$ more you can get a unit that expandable to  unlimited amount of music for just $1.50 per 74 minute disc. Shop around, i  know i did, after weeks of reading online reviews and going to huge  electronics stores I found the best choice and it was a Sharp MD-MS722. I  spent $180 for the MD player/recorer then $30 for a pack of 20 minidiscs  and so far i have them all filled for a playing time of about 1200+ minutes  of playing time.       So if you want to save $40 but only get a half an  hour of music, then yes, the 600 is probably your best bet.

<Title>Workout personal bests and my new Rio 600!
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Diamond (and other MP3/WMA player manufacturers for that matter) should  pick up on this one - these players improve your workout! Seriously, I've  been actively exercising for a while now. I bought my Rio 600 four days ago  - and have achieved a personal best on my treadmill each day :-) I do think  the choice of music is important!<p>Seriously, I am very pleased with my  new purchase. One of the important factors for me was a realization that  Microsoft's FREE Windows Media Player gives me everything I need to manage  my music library and don't need to use the Rio-supplied software at all.  Based on a tip from another review here, I explictly set the &quot;write  speed&quot; to 64bps so that files are automatically transcoded to WMA,  which saves a ton of space. Typical file sizes are in the 2.5 - 3.0Mb  range, which greatly bypasses the fact that the unit has only 32Mb.  Overall, I just find the Windows Media Player software to be more intuitive  and functional.<p>Anyway, for my own use, I am EXTREMELY happy with the  unit. Can't wait to find out when the travel pack and memory expansion  backpacks are available, though.

<Title>Sleek and Stylish
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I chose the Rio 600 over the other MP3 players based on the price ($170),  its small size, and expandability. I'm very happy with it. I love the  design. I think it's very ergonomic and I happen to like the 4-way  &quot;curser&quot; type button. The blue backlit screen looks great and  displays lots of information. You can create different playlists from the  songs that have been loaded onto it. USB transfers are very fast, and when  its hooked up to the PC it automatically sets the time and date on the  unit.<p>On the downside, 32 Megs isn't much. To get a full hour of music  into 32 Megs you have to encode to WMA at 64K. It actually sounds OK but I  have a huge collection of MP3s - all encoded at 128K. There's no way I'm  converting EVERYTHING to WMA, only the stuff I want to put on my Rio. My  major complaint with the WMA format is that there is NO ID tag, like with  an MP3. It doesn't store any artist or title information in the file  itself. So, a database program has no clue how to organize it. <p>Plus, the  RioPort Manager software that comes with the Rio 600 is complete crap. It's  really cumbersome and you cant convert between formats with it. I use Sonic  Foundry's Siren as my MP3 database. It has really strong organization  features and is very flexible. It let's me make a 64K WMA file from a 128K  MP3. It also lets me manage my Rio. But, even though the Rio can accept MP3  and WMA files, Siren will only let me transfer MP3s to the Rio. Why??? So,  I still have to use RioPort software to transfer WMA files onto the Rio.  And since WMA files have no ID tag, the software will only transfer part of  the filename to the Rio. So, I have 5 different songs on my Rio with no  title, just artist. It's either that or use MP3s and only get about 30  minutes of audio. But these are PC software issues which are easily fixed  by upgrades, or finding a better MP3 database program. There is supposed to  be a 370M rechargable add-on. I assume this takes the place of the  removable back plate which holds the battery. I'm curious how much that  thing will cost. It sure would be nice. That's about 400M total(with the  internal 32) which is about 13 hours of WMA or 7 hours of MP3. <p>It has no  belt clip, so you have to either hold it, put it in your pocket, or buy a  belt holder for it. The headphones that come with it aren't that bad. I  really like how they are 2 separate buds with an ear clip and no plastic  bar connecting them. If you want better sound quality then get some  headphones that are bigger and fit over the ear, like the $20 Sonys that  everyone is wearing lately. I dont think you can really complain about  these since they came with the unit. Overall, I think the Rio 600 is very  cool. It's very small, lightweight, has no moving parts, never skips, runs  for 10 hours on 1 AA battery, and gets VERY LOUD. I'm sure something better  will come out in a year or 6 months, but it will always be that way.

<Title>Too bad only 32mb
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I purchased this player about a week ago, and have experienced nothing but  great sound quality, and awsome performance. A lot of people have  experienced problems with this player, and to fix that there is a free ware  up date. Also that problem only occurs on pc's. Mac owners don't have that  problem. Ups dropped off my player the next day, and within 5 minutes of  owning the rio 600 I was listening to my favorite songs. I was able to fit  11 songs on this player when converted at 96 by 32kbs. The sound quality is  fine. The volume has also been improved greatly. The only problem i have  with this player is that it only has 32mb. As soon as the 340mb back pack  comes out I'm going to purchase it. All in all this is a fantastic player  and i'm incredibly satisfied. All my friends are jealous, and one of them  then purchsed the 600 after me. He too is very satisfied. What a great  player.

<Title>Cool but Not Quite There
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I'll be sending this one back.  It sounds great, the backlighting is cool,  and the USB connection is really fast. (I loaded up about 8 songs at CD  quality in about a minute).<p>BUT, the headphones are INSANE -- small and  irritating to put on, and tinny sounding.  The 32 MB is WAY too small, and  the main play button is really poorly designed -- sometimes I push the  right button, other times I don't -- it's almost arbitrary. Also, the lack  of a belt clip was an extreme oversight -- I don't want to have to hold  this thing while I'm on the treadmill!<p>When the 800 ships with 64 MB, and  you replace the headphones with something normal, I'd recommend this  player. For the Mac, it's about the only option.

<Title>Don't replace those headphones just yet
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>After reading the online and print pans of the Rio 600's headphones, I  ordered a pair of Sennheiser MX-3's when I ordered my Rio.  I found the  standard 600 headphones to be excellent.  The Sennheisers offer slightly  better bass but were much more uncomfortable to wear.  I ditched the  Sennheisers and am sticking with the stock earbuds.  My only complaint with  the 600 is its tendency to spontaneously advance to the next song in  mid-recording--very annoying.  I'm sending mine back for a replacement.

Needless to say, I took it back the smae day, and gave up!<p>I just bought a Compaq iPaq (USB, WMA compatible, 64Megs) and it works great, looks great, is the size of a pager, and appears to be much more durable than other players.

<Title>Is that the best you can do?
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>At first, the Rio 600 seemed like a dream come true. It was very simple to transfer songs from the computer to the device. The only major problem(or so I thought)was that it used up a lot of AA batteries in one week. After about 3 months, I was no longer able to add songs to the Rio library, therefore making it so I could no longer listen to newly downloaded songs, only old ones. I could still transfer songs that I had downloaded before though. About a month later, I was unable to transfer any songs to the device. It said on my computer screen that the songs were being transferred, yet they failed to find their way to my player. Now, the mp3 player won't even turn on. I've tried putting in new batteries, but nothing will get it to turn back on. Too bad there wasn't a four month warranty.

<Title>I've tried 2, both broke
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I had a Rio 600, two in fact.  One broke, I returned it, and now the second one is broken.  Everything in this review I found to be consistant with BOTH of them.       First of all, the 32 MB it comes with is not nearly enough, the backback is essential.  Second, the device will go through battery power even when the device is in the off position.  I would put a new battery in, use it for an hour or two, turn it off, and the next time I would go to use it the battery would be dead.  What I ended up doing was taking the battery out and only putting it into the device when I was ready to use it.  A major pain in the a**.      The final problem I had with BOTH of the devices I had was that after using it for about 3 months something would break that caused the audio output to be full of static.  The songs would load fine (and play fine on my PC) they just would sound like garbage coming through the headphones.  I tried anything I could think of...new headphones, new battery, formatting the memory, different songs, emailing their tech support (4 times...no response yet) and nothing worked.  So it is currently sitting in a box waiting for someone from Rio to get back to me.  My advice to anyone looking to get an MP3 player would be to stay away from this one.

<Title>Unless you love headaches, go look at another MP3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>One word sums up this player: unreliable. It is very temperamental. Some days it'll work fine, while others it will just turn off by itself with no provocation. It's not funny when you are in the middle of a song, then having to turn the switch to off and then backs to on, then pressing the fwd button until you reach the point you want. I've only had one problem with a song not downloading properly, so it's not a major problem with my unit. A battery will last a good day, two to three with moderate playtime. However, Rio could've found a better place to put the battery. Every time I replace the battery, I'm afraid of breaking the golden pins on the battery side of the unit. Overall, if you want a really good investment for your dollar, don't buy this product. Go look somewhere else.

<Content>I think this item is fantastic! and the fact you can upgrade it is pretty cool. In my case I wanted the 64mb model, but it was too pricey at the time i really wanted a player so i went for the lower model and then found out I could upgrade it and I thought that was really cool. The RIO model of mp3 players is great and sooo easy to use. I encourage any person who enjoys mp3's to get a RIO player because they are simple and you can change the faceplates,which is great if your not into blue.

<Title>Be careful replacing the battery!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I am a parent of a 16 year old. Last Christmas I bought her a Rio 600. She is an avid sports player, and the Rio seemed like a good solution that would allow her to listen to music while practicing. The Rio worked well for about the first 60 days, and then all of a sudden it didn't work. We contacted the manufacturer, and they told us that we would have to send the Rio along with $100 dollars in order to fix it. Come on! I took the Rio to a friend of mine that is an electronics wizard to see if he could do something with it. He reported back that one of the gold pins that is located in the battery unit was bent, and it had pushed out the female side. It couldn't be fixed. I am really disappointed with the design of the Rio. The target population is teenagers, and I really wonder what would possess a company to think that most teenagers could be careful with such a delicate part.  Maybe they were counting on it breaking?

<Title>no problem with it.
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>The audio quality is exceptional. It is small and rugged. I have had not a single problem with it so I am wondering if the other reviewers are high or something. One reservation I have with it is the cost. At like ($) they could have at least included the battery charger feature that is available in the BackPack upgrades. It could not have added much to the manufacturing cost, I don't think, except maybe dip their profit margin a fraction. The other reservation I have is the curvy body. I like my electronics hard and straight and this design is a little too fruity for me (Stupid Apple Computer!). Also there are some annoying quirks. If you pause it and don't play for like a minute, it turns itself off.... Overall this is an good unit but terribly short on features.

<Content>I got this for Christmas 2K, and have been pleased with it since... I quickly figured out that if you convert your mp3z into WMA files you can get almost twice as many songs on there... I can sometimes get up to 20. Though it has the capacity for one battery, it sure lasts quite a while. Sometimes the battery just dies on me though, it'll say it's at 70% and then just die. &lt;shrug&gt; The rubbery coating on the outside has started peeling, so it looks kinda ghetto now, but I love it when I'm working out, or walking to school.

<Title>Improvement over the Rio 500
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was the happy owner of a Rio 500 until about two months ago when I left it on top of my car when I was putting my daughter in the carseat. I drove off and haven't seen it since. Oops. It took me this long to get back into the market for an MP3 player. When I did, I found that the Rio 500, which I was generally happy with despite a few quirks, was no longer available. I read the reviews and decided to go with the Rio 600. It's a choice I'm glad I made. It's sturdier than the 500, has better volume control, and the controls are easy to access and use. The major selling point for me, over the Rio 800, however, was the use of a standard AA battery. The Rio 800 uses a rechargable battery, which is, in theory, a great way to go. However, I've found the power on such items always runs out at the most inconvenient times. With the Rio 600, I simply carry a spare AA battery in my pocket at all times and I'm covered for many, many hours of listening; I've found I get 11 to 14 hours out of a single battery. There's no question that I'd recommend this sturdy little player to other listeners with the following caveat: When you receive it, go purchase a cheap pair of in-the-ear headphones from any electronics store, they'll give you better sound and in my opinion are far more comfortable. And happy listening.

<Title>An excellent player
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>.....But not the best in the world. There are a few problemswith this player. I am in Sydney, Australia, so the player may differslightly to the US version. The earphones I got were prettyuncomfortable to wear and they might fall aou when jogging, however myfriend got a completely different set of earphones (also in Sydney,AU) which sort of went around the ear, however they were still ofless-than-acceptable quality. I went out and bought a pairof...Philips earphones, and the sound quality was EXCELLENT. Abouut 5rimes better. So if you decide to buy this player, make sure you get agood set of sony or philips earphones to take full advantage of therio 600s sound capabilities. Another problem with the 600 is the gapsin between the plastic joints (paticularly where the snap-onfaceplates go), which makes it feel decidedly cheap andflimsy. Overall, though, these faults can be forgiven because of theexcellent quality, design and sound of the player. I stronglyrecommend this player.

<Content>I love my Rio 600. I in fact bought one for me and for my son because they were so lightweight, easy to use, don't skip, easy to update, and much more.<p>They play both MP3s and WMA files, and the system is very easy to use! Just plug it into the attached cable and in seconds you're moving files on and off your player with no trouble at all. You can update what's on the player quickly and easily as often as you wish.<p>The software it comes with is great - I do music for several bands have have high end Cakewalk and other music programs on my computer, but this is easy to use, easy to learn, and quite up to the tasks of organizing music.<p>I would never use something that costs ... on a belt loop - we bought simple ... nylon cases and keep the players in something sturdier like a backpack or belt pouch or purse while playing them.<p>We haven't had any trouble with them at all - we use them pretty non-stop and they've been flawless. The buttons are easy to use, but you really don't need to use them much anyway - just start the music and let it run!<p>I have to put in a good word for the STELLAR work done by WhiteCap. I was amazed by the music visualization software that comes with the Rio - it turns your favorite tunes into waves, spirals, teardrops - you name it! Everyone I've shown it to wants a copy for their own computer. You can get hypnotized for hours.<p>The Rio 600 is definitely a great buy for anyone who loves music!

<Title>IF YOU WANT THE REAL INFO ON THE RIO 600, READ THIS!
<Date>Wed Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I recently bought the RIO 600, and while I haven't experienced any problems with it (like the skipping and freezing), I do have a few things I want to say. First of all, FALSE ADVERTIZING IS ILLEGAL!  The back of the box specifically says &quot;...Holds an hour of music...&quot; What they don't tell you is that means an hour of low-quality, .wma files, that have to be converted from a non-supplied program. The software is screwed up only because of the mp3 tags not being read right (authors names in the place of titles). I have read all 74+ or your comments/reviews and have a valuable piece of info you might not know. The &quot;expandable&quot; memory pack will COST AS MUCH AS A NEW RIO!   Too freakin' much!  Also, who would pay 11+ dollars on a fruity pink or orange faceplate? The color doesn't really make a difference if you have to put the thing in your pocket(no belt clip). Next, the earphones are irritating and made my ears sore for a week. Now my play/ff/rew/stop button isn't working because it has been used so much. When you try to change the volume without looking, you usually press the menu button, and can't even tell if you have. And how cumbersome is it to take the backpack off and on? Is there some type of special tool you are supposed to use? In all, if you want to own a small memory, over-priced, hard-to-hanlde piece of obsolete machinery, then shell out your money. If you want a cheap, reliable, same sized .mp3 player, buy the iJam. It comes with a belt clip and case!

<Title>Good quality MP3 player. Here's why you should buy this one.
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I did lots of research before I purchased my MP3 player. I even purchased a MiniDisc player before I lay the cash down for the RIO 600. Here's why:<p>- Basically I needed a music player that I could use while running and working out. The minidisc just didn't cut it. It would skip horribly after I began running faster. An MP3 player was the logical choice because it has no moving parts and therefore doesn't skip.<p>- I chose this player because of its price; it's potential memory upgradability (~340 MB at the time I purchased it), its looks, and its interface (USB). I have been using it for over two months now regularly. I bring it with me to school, to the gym, to work, etc. It has been working wonderfully. Even with the software that comes with it.<p>- Most of the problems I see that other people have are not with the player but with their computers. USB is still kind buggy on some motherboards. I would plug my player into one workstation and it would work fine and on another it won't. This is a problem with the computer and the way the motherboard manufacturer implements their USB. I would recommend updating your BIOS before using the player.<p>- The player takes only one AA battery and plays for at least 8 hours with it (nice).<p>The only reason I have given this player a rating of 4 stars instead of 5 is the memory. 32MB is not a lot to work with at the beginning. I wait for the memory upgrades to become available...<p>Until then, happy shopping!

<Title>awesome!

<Content>You would think that being a full blown technophile would cause me to grab the latest gadgets, but I am actually more skeptical of newer technology than most.  None-the-less I eventually succumbed to my urges and bought a Rio 600, somewhat prepared to be disappointed.  First, I was very surprised by its size, smaller than a cell phone.  The first thing I did when I unpacked it was put the headphones on, press play and shake the hell out of it.  Absolutely skip proof!  The software is easy to install and use, and in no time I had downloaded songs both from CDs and from the Internet.  The 32MB standard memory pack easily holds over 1/2 an hour of music in WMA format (half the size of MP3s).  It's compact size, skip proof technology make it an ideal replacement for bulky Walkmans.  Perfect for music aficionado on the go.

<Title>Flawed Design - Beware!
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've been through three of these little suckers in six weeks! All broke in exactly the same way: the on/off switch drops out, and eventually the unit won't power up. Despite the fact that Amazon and Rio have been great about shipping replacements, this is an essentially flawed product (as corroborated by Rio's customer support - who today offered to ship me unit #4).<p>Look elsewhere!

<Title>very good mp3 player
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is an excellent Mp3 player.  Especially for its price, its better then the other ones, I could care less about the &quot;radio&quot; or the &quot;voice recorder&quot; on the creative labs model, I want portable music, not a whole kitchen worth of appliances.  If you buy this, I strongly urge you to use the much smaller but equivalent sounding WMA files instead of Mp3s, and you will be able to fit approximately 67 minutes of music on this player.  It also has excellent battery life. (make sure to keep the backlight feature off and you will get more battery life).  The buttons are pretty easy to use, and the screen is easy to read.  One thing I didn't like is that somehow a tiny piece of dirt got inside the plastic screen thingy.  Other then that, its a very solid player, that hardly weighs a thing and fits easily into a pocket.
