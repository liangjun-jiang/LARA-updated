<Content>I got this and it broke after a few days!  It is a waste of money!  Buy the ipod nano 3rd generation, and even if it's more expensive, it's simpiler to use and has some cool features!

<Title>Fantastic Dell MP3 Player!!

<Content>Pros: In terms of aesthetics, it is small, durable, and sleek looking. Not too big for your pocket and not too small to break with your fingers. In terms of functionality, the buttons work perfectly for all its function. Unlike the Apple iPod's, the scroll button works easily and fluidly no matter how sweater your finger is. The volume buttons are easy to reach and use in case of sudden loud or soft music. The player's menus and music selection is easy for any beginner. The sound quality has been crisp and clear for most all of my music. The equilizer settings within it become handy in case you're picky.  Cons: It lacks some of special features like games, calenders, and other tricks that iPods might provide. Without the software cd, the drivers are sometimes confusing to install for beginners. However, the dell website provides all drivers and directions for an easy install. After that, music transfer is very easy. No special programs like iTunes or Dell Jukebox is necessary.  Overall, it is a fantastic product for simply music lovers! It will do everything you need it to do.
