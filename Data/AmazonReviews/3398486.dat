<Title>very good all around

<Content>I'm very happy with this item after a couple of days of use.  Pros: * Built in clip. * Basic button layout is good--my fingers quickly learned the basic functions so I can operate player while clipped to my back pocket. * Tiny screen (1/2 x 1/4 inch) is suprisingly legible and useful. * Plays OGG, FM radio. * Works as mini USB drive. * Good sound, though I'm no audiophile. * Can drag and drop music files in Windows file explorer.     Neutral: * Navigation interface--good, but not great.  This is not so important for a 1gb device which doesn't have a ton of content to browse thru.  And it's a lot better than a LCD-less iPod shuffle, which is marginally cheaper.  Cons: * Does not play Audible. * Too small - makes one-handed navigation not so easy. * No hold switch, but buttons are pretty well protected by a lip around the player. * No iTumes support, but this is also a plus.  Disclaimer: I am biased against Apple for their "lock-in" strategies and policies.  I used iTunes as my desktop player, though. * Seems to not play nicely with external USB Lacie drive.

<Content>Ok ... I may be biased. This is the first MP3 player I've owned. The last portable music device I bought was back in the 80s ... so I can't help but be ASTOUNDED as to the sound quality of this device.  I actually like the earphones that come with it -- they have better base than the $30 Sony's I recently purchased.  The screen is small but displays all the info you need.  I purchased this because I want flexible formats and I didn't want to be locked in to a specific vendors software.  The Koreans seem to understand that thus Samsung and Cowon offer you drag and drop via USB just like a jump drive.  I am totally happy with this purchase.

<Content>This Mp3 player has everything I wanted including FM radio and even voice recording! It is very convenient to be able to clip it to your clothing or wear it on a lanyard around your neck. The controls are intuitive and easy to learn. I have no complaints about it whatsoever!!
