<Title>Slow Hard Drive Access and Ackward User Interface

<Content>After having my Archos 104 for about one month, I am pretty happy with my purchase, but there are some small details that occasionally annoy me.  I purchased the player because it works with protected WMA files, which I get from Yahoo! Music Unlimited To Go.  Loading my music is not a problem at all and I have been very pleased.  I've also used the new Windows Media Player 11 (comes with Windows Vista) to sync podcasts that I download.  The player also has great battery life.  I have a long commute to and from work, and the battery has lasted from when I turn it on at 6:00am to when arrive back home around 7:00pm (with the player being off for 1-2 hours while I'm in meetings, etc.).  Now for the annoying parts.  First of all, on shuffle mode, if you want to skip to the next song, there's a long 2-3 second gap, which compared to my girlfriend's iPod, is a long time.  Also, the user interface can be a little counterintuitive at first, and it's way more complicated than it should be to switch from shuffle to a playlist.

<Title>Great fidelity, moderate volumn.

<Content>I initially purchased the Apple iPod Nano, but was not happy with the sound quality, even after trying various EQ settings.   I returned that unit and purchased this Archos 104 because I sound checked it in a store and recalled that it had outstanding sound quality, definitely better then the iPod Nano.    The other advantage of the Archos is that it has two modes of interfacing, in one mode, it is tightly integrated with the Windows PC software, much like the Apple iPod must use iTunes - I never used this mode.  The other mode is that the Archos can be configured to interface with the computer as if it were a standard flash memory drive.  This permits the Archos to be used on any operating system that supports USB flash memory drives, i.e. Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.  This mode also frees the user from having to use a specific application, such as iTunes, to manage the music library, since in the flash drive mode, music is simply copied as any other file copy operation.  Once the music is copied over (in flash drive mode) the software inside the Archos will scan the ID3 tags of the newly added music and update it's internal database, organizing by Album, Artist, Track, Genre, etc.  There is also a file browse mode that enables the user to ignore this organization and just navigate the files and directories directly.  The only issue I have with this unit is that the volume is simply too low.  At least with the iPod Nano and another mp3 player I tried (TresStore), I was able to drown out the horrible music at my gym; unfortunately, the Archos is unable to deliver the volume needed to do this.  I would recommend this unit for high fidelity listening in an environment with little or no background noise.
