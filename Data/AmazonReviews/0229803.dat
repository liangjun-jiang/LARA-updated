<Title>Divx 6.x not compatible
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>most of these multimediaplayer harddrives are NOT compatible with the Divx 6.x standards out there for about a year now, and as well NOT compatible with the new quicktime 4 format also used by most pros out there. in contradiction to what they advertise for ....  but these items are usually "ONLY" compatible with older Divx version up to 5.x, which needless to say, NO ONE uses any more for a year now.  so dont be surprised if your downloaded avi or divx or mov movies from the internet just will not play, and also dont be suprised if customer service is not reachable , and if it is, then they will only  very reluctantly admit to the lack of compatibility of their players.  if you are not sure, call the manufacturers guys, ask them about this, and let them know what we consumers need...
