<Title>Noticeable improvements
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my 8 GB nano to replace my 1st gen 4 GB, and I have to say that everything about it is better.  First, it has double the capacity and battery life, and yet it slightly thinner.  Second, the aluminum exterior is a big improvement, because it is much more durable and does not show scratches and fingerprints nearly as much as the plastic on the previous generation.  Lastly, the screen is noticeably brighter and sharper, and the sound is a little clearer with more bass.  The new headphones fit in my ears better too.  In my opinion, this is the best flash MP3 player available now.  I have had 5 MP3 players in the last 4 years, and I've found that iPods are the best-selling for a reason.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow! This is a wonderful machine - with easy to use (and to read) functions, and a great sound. I use mine mainly for music, but a friend of mine keeps a large library of photos on his iPod. It seems to be highly durable, but time will tell. To be honest, I was skeptical whether it would be worth the price, but I have not been disappointed.  Other reviewers have noted that you really need to have a USB 2.0 port for this, and I heartily agree. My old computer was wheezing and sputtering until I ended up getting a USB new card.

<Title>Many problems and glitches with 2nd Gen 8 GB iPod nano
<Date>Tue Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: After initially giving the 2nd gen nano 1 star because of the problems I was having, I am updating my review to 4 stars....BUT it won't let me!!  I still belive the 2nd gen nano to be of lesser quality than the first (click wheel quality, and lock out swith quality)...however, the combination of the 2nd gen firmware update and the software update to iTunes 7 has fixed the problems I was having. I occasionally still have to reset my nano when playing through my Alpine head unit in my car (NEVER had to do that with my 1st gen).  And occasionally, iTunes has a heck of a time when I go back and forth from 1 iPod to the other.... That said though, my experince has been good enough to now recommend a 2nd gen iPod to anyone.  NOW it is a good product!  OLD POST: This is my second nano. After my first, I built my life around the iPod...I wondered how I lived without one for so long...I purchased all of the goodies...3 sets of headphones, 4 different types of cases from workout to casual, I upgraded my car stereo so it plugged directly into the Alpine head unit, I purchased a 'remote' unit that plugs directly into my Audio Video controller at home...life was good.  Then came the purchase of the 8GB 2nd gen nano...and all hell broke loose.  The 'data' has been 'corrupted' three times in as many weeks. And every time that happens you have to follow the 5 'r's that Apple recommends, which basically wipes the memory on the unit and you have to reload all playlists.  The iPod itself, I have to reset on a weekly basis...my Alpine head unit will all of a sudden not recognize the nano, until I reset it.  The 2nd Gen nano has been VERY disappointing so far...  In addition, the 2nd gen nano, is slimmer and taller than the 1st gen...many accessories for the 1st gen (workout arm bands etc) won't fit the second gen nano...  NOTE++++Make darn sure, the accessory you are purchasing SPECIFCALLY says it will fit a 2nd gen nano!!!++++buyer beware!  RECOMMENDATION: I would purchase a 1st gen 4GB iPod nano since they are on sale, and wait for Apple to get the bugs out of the 8 GB 2nd gen nano.  I have gone back to my 1st gen, and everything seems to be working just fine.  If it matters to you--The 1st gen nano battery life is 2.5-3 hours...whereas the 2nd gen nano is about 23 hours...

<Title>The best MP3 player ever!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod has to be the best MP3 player ever made.  The sound quality is superb.  Navigation is extreamly easy.  The ultra thin profile is a brilliant.  I keep it in an armband and can hardly tell that it's there most of the time.  It's also nice to have the comfort of not having to worry about breaking a hard drive when working out.  I had no problems transferring music over and had fun buying music from the iTunes store.  The remodeled headphones that came with these are way more comfortable that the gen ones and don't fall out of your ears as easy.  The rounded edges of the body of this Nano are even slightly more comfortable to hold.  With all that being said, I'm having problems finding accessories to fit the gen 2 Nanos.  That's the only problem I've had with it so far, if one would consider that a problem.  I'll definately recomend this iPod to all my friends.

<Title>Dumped 4GB nano for this
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb.  However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding.  Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb.  Here are my 2 cent:  The Good: - The finish now resists some scratches, which is what we are looking for - Probably the best quality 8gb player on the market at this price range.  Big bang for your money. - It seems more responsive than the previous nano. - It supports song searching now.  The Bad: - Personally I perfer the silver color, but the black color is the only option for 8gb.  - The packaging looks like a cheaper product than the 1st nano; in fact $249 for a mp3 is not cheap at all - I don't know if the sound quality has been improved or degraded using my Shure earphone.  But at least I can recognize the default "EQ off" has been tweaked, which I need some time to get used to. - The LCD display is brighter, but the contrast does not look better than 1st nano. - I can't get iTune 7.0.0 working on my PC.  It seems like Apple was forced to release it the same day Steve speaks.  It is a big disappointment.  Finally 7.0.1 came to fix my problem. - It does not fit to 1st generation Nano Dock.  It is an unexpected big disappointment.  I really don't understand why Apple can't make it compatible with the former dock, as the connector is just shifted to the edge a mm!  The 2nd nano deserves a 4-stars, as it does not beat the 1st nano.  Anyway it is a hard competitor for Zune to beat.

<Title>The best MP3 player ever made
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you like me wondered if buying the 30 GB video or the 8 GB Nano (as they both cost the same $249), think about this: - are you really going to watch movies on the small screen of the iPod Video?  - do you really care about watching pictures on a MP3 player? - do you want a small and slick device or a bulkier one? - do you really need 30 GB, or 8 GB (2,000 songs) cut it for you? - and what do you think is giving less problems: a spinning disk (with the issues we all can immagine if the head bumps on the disk while running, jumping or , well, falling) or flash memory?  While everything pointed me in the direction of the Nano, I wasn't sure about the 8 vs 30 GB. What I did was to install iTunes, rip all of my CDs, all of them and make a backup on an external USB disk (even with the 80 GB iPod you still need to backup the data somewhere, as it is not a matter of if but when you're going to loose something) and while it was more than 8 GB, I knew I didn't want to listen to all of my songs. As a matter of fact, there are some albums I only care for a couple of songs. So I started rating my songs and putting in different play lists. Guess what, I didn't even get close to 8 GB, not even if I double my collection.  This was the final answer I needed, I ordered the 8 GB model and WOW! It's amazing. It's my first iPod, I used many other MP3 players in the past but this is by far the best, most complete, most advanced, really outstanding sound-reproducing device I ever used. You can't realize how small and handy it is until you have one in your hands (and you know it's yours!).  In other words, it's amazing beautiful (yes, the wow factor is important too for this price), very easy to use (I already want to get rid of my last MP3 player) and even if it doesn't have a FM radio or voice recorder, who cares, I wanted an easy to use MP3 player and it's 100% on target. Pictures, games (which it has some), calendar, contacts and so on are nice, but I have a cell phone for that so I'm not too hot about them - yes, nice to know I can add that too but I really, really love what it primarly is: a great, for my the best, music player since the introduction of the portable CD player.

<Title>Superb!  Exceeded all expectations.  Most limitations aren't.
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Absolutely fabulous mp3 etc player. Exceeded my expectations.  Had for two weeks now and I couldn't be happier with this one.  I've been a skeptic and hold out on iPods forever. Previously had a Creative MuVo 4gb mini hd system.  It was the tiniest by far in it's day for it's size, and had features, in theory.  But here's the real world thing.  The software on that suc*ked.  Caused me to not use it much, after the initial honeymoon, or kinda forced honeymoon.  This beauty in contrast, in addition to being just about the perfect form factor, incredibly thin, pretty narrow, and the right amount of tall, and a very sleek black plastic, bright color screen, has wonderfully easy to use software.  I guess that's been true of iPod's generally for awhile but it sure is of this one, with improvements.  Now what about the 8gb "limitation" compared to current HD iPods of 30 or 80gb? The thing is the iTunes host PC synching software is so easy to use that it's real simple to simply move around what's in the thing.  Just set up lots of playlists by artist or album, or type of music, or whatever.  Same kind of idea with podcasts.  Really well done.  Really easy to vary each day, usually only in part.  Or every so often,etc.  This baby's plenty big enough if you go this way.  Not to hold all you own, but why do that?  That's what big hard drives on PC's or external firewire's for laptops (like my 300gb for just music) are for.    Now what about Apple's locking out subscription services and tracks?  Simple.  Buy $50 Replay AV, or something like it, though that one's real good.  There are TONES of internet radio stations broadcasting in streams that software can capture, often at 128k and sometimes 196k shoutcast mp3, and it will even divide into songs AND TAG THEM WITH ARTIST AND TITLE.    As well there's now a nifty $50 (ok way overpriced, but excellent) Apple fm radio, shirt top TINY control button for everything, accessory.  Recommended.  As is Belkin's $5 on Amazon silicon rubber protective sheath and (detachable) running armband combo.  Couldn't recommend more highly.  This is the way to go for portable music today!

<Title>Much better than iPod Minis
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is slick.  It sounds great, the form factor is awesome, very small and thin, yet feels durable enough so that it won't break in your pocket.  The color screen is very nice and the controls are very intuitive.  That being said, the only reason I bought this iPod was because the battery in the old Mini I had was absolute crap, yet I had invested a tidy sum in music from iTunes.  Hopefully this iPod will perform better than the mini series but, malfunctioning batteries or not, the best bet is to buy CDs and burn them to MP3 so you are not locked into buying iPods all the time and the outrageously overpriced accessories required to do anything but listen to it with headphones.

<Title>A great looking product that even works sometimes!
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of Nano and that's a good thing. There is roughly 7.5gb free space for storage and that's a good thing.  However! Buyer beware, because I have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch:  Approximately 1 in 3 of the mp3 file's I uploaded to the 8gb Nano won't play. Instead the screen turns black with a white Apple logo displayed for approximately 5-6 seconds, then the screen goes off completely for a moment, then reboots to the black screen with the Apple logo for a few seconds then displays the main menu. Sometimes the root folder of the mp3 file that didn't work is removed from the directory tree.  I haven't found anything online about this glitch--as far as a firmware update or if this problem is widespread. As much as I love it and want to keep it, I will probably be returning this iPod and waiting for a more stable version to be released.  :'(

It works great and I will eat my negative words about IPOD! It is a high quality and seems like it will be a long lasting device.  I recommend this IPOD (mine is the 2nd GEN IPOD 8GB not the new smaller one-I don't know about it).

<Title>Mixed Feelings
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this item for christmas.  I am using it primarily for running and at the gym.  It has some good features; high capacity, light weight, nice look.  However, I have found the controls to be akward in many situations.  The control dial is to sensitive, and the controls are not easy to navigate while running.  I added the Nike+ system and have had poor results.  Specifically, the menus are confusing, and the sensitive controls often leave me on pause during a workout or have my workout being logged when I don't want it to be.  I've had to re-load the operating system twice as I keep getting errors.  I also found when you turn the unit off, it will not come back on again until it is docked.  There is no manual included, you have to go online to figure out how to use it.  In all it has potential, but it is not easy to use right out of the box.

<Content>This is a neat one.  I like how the metal case is all one peice and wraps around the unit, unlike the other color 4gb ones that have the shiny back.  Looks super cool in black, if you are unsure about it, I can tell you it grows on you.  Much more solid then 1st gen ipods, mainly due to the flash memory instead of a hard drive.  Battery lasts forever, I use it to work out and it can go weeks on a charge.  Sound quality is also better, as is display contrast.  I have a new 3rd gen and almost like this one better, more compact and discreet.  Shows album art when available, but no cover flow like 3rd gen.  Also has nifty screen lock, so if u use it for party tunes you can prevent ppl from messing around with your playlist.  Basically, it looks dead sexy and works well.

But I sometimes use it to go like downtown and other places I know that my ipod touch will just be a big disturbance. I love this ipod but now I realize that if i had to choose between the color I had originally got and this black one I would have chosen this black one.. but oh well..the thing that matters the most is how it works not what color it is. Now I wish that can get the 3rd generation ipod nano..but I think that is too much with the ipods and will have to wait a while b4 i can get it..atleast till my ipod touch(not Itouch ppl) wares out on me. I overall love this ipod that if I had to recommend an mp3 player to a friend it would be this if they still had it on stock.

<Content>At first I thought someone forgot to pack the iPod in the box. But this slim, narrow black "card" turned out to be my 8 GB iPod Nano.  This is my first experience. It took me two days to figure out how to shut it off. The wheel with it's subtle places for directions seemed to be designed for the fingers of a 8-year-old not an adult.  The online instructions are somewhat helpful, but actually, it proved so intuitive that by just fiddling around with it I think the the iPod teaches me itself.  I am glad to have bought the 8GB. I wasn't sure it was going to hold all my music and audio books, not to even consider favorite photos. Yet as of today I have put everything except photos on and it still has about a third of capacity left. The price was great, too. All my stuff fits in this tiny, black package. I love it and only hope I won't lose it.

I wanted an Ipod smaller than I previously have because sometimes I just want to carry a smaller device and this fit the bill. I recomend a Ipod nano to anyone who wants a smaller Ipod than the original Ipod. I also purchased this one so it would fit the hat and visor I bought to insert the Ipod into. They both only will fit the Ipod nano at this time. Great little ipod and it basically works just like the bigger ones.

<Title>8GB 2nd gen. iPod nano
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>2nd best iPod I've ever owned.  I rate it second due to lack of capacity, but that's what the iPod w/video is for..storing all my stuff.  I got this after my 30GB 5Gen iPod died, as a hold over until the news came out this fall about the new lineup of iPods.  I must say the sound on the nano almost seems better than the sound on my dead 30GB, and who can complain about the size.  It definately took a while to get used to the much smaller scroll wheel and screen, specifically the location of the smaller click wheel in reference to the size of the whole nano.  I have a library ~40GB, so having to switch to manually managing my music and deciding every few days/weeks what to take off and put on got kind of old.  After hearing of so many issues with the new generation iPod classics, I went to the Apple.com store and bought a refurbished 80GB 5.5gen for a little over $200.  I'll keep the nano for the beach, biking, etc, and be able to keep all my music on my 80GB.  Overall, a solid 5 star iPod.  Especially for people with smaller iTunes library's who don't have to worry about what to put on or take off the iPod nano!

THe battery life on this ipod is also great.

<Title>I don't get the hype
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I kind of expected to really like this thing - I felt I had been making do, sound wise, listening to audio books and other mp3s copied onto discs and played over cheap mp3 players, so I figured this would be a big step forward being able to listen to anything, not just what was on a given disc.  But the iTunes software is to me, horrible, nonintuitive and time consuming.  I would pretty much need to go thru my entire list of imported songs and tweak each entry to make it really usable.  I suppose if you're downloading stuff from the store it may be different, but working with a library of my own stuff it really blows.  I would MUCH rather simply deal with files and folders directly than have to do it thru the facade of iTunes.  I may end up using a 3rd party ID tag editor or something to get thru it.   The instructions, or lack thereof, fail to cover many of the basics, and web support is similarly confusing.  Likewise with the iPod itself.  Again, a nonintuitive (to me) interface, with many mysterious things happening.  Typically, when I add songs, I can't play them until I reset the iPod.  What a great feature that is, right?  Hooking up the iPod to the computer it regularly gets into a mode where it doesn't want to disconnect.  Never mind that nothing whatsoever was done or needed to be done, i.e. the battery didn't need charging, no songs needed to be synced.  But it doesn't want to let go.  Now it could be that I got some kind of hardware lemon going on there, but that still doesn't excuse the software.  Can't say I know of any great alternatives product wise, but I'll damn sure try something else next time around.  It's hilarious that I imagined that this would be a great product - I had thought everybody raved about their Apple products as being so user friendly.  Live and learn.

<Content>I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down.

<Title>If it works, it's great
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is great.  We only had a snag when it was first shipped to us--it couldn't complete the setup.  But after it was replaced, it was great.  The hassle of shipping it back and forth was disappointing and cost more in terms of shipping.  I'd be interested in how many people have to go through this process to receive the product they want.

<Title>Good but possible defect?
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.  Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself!  UPDATE:  So I went to my nearby Apple store, put each Nano on display to my ears and 1 Nano in the entire store produced the same buzz sound as my unit.  I talked to the Apple tech person and he explained it was not a defect and that my nano was to spec.  He rationalized that essentially it is an electronic device and different nanos may behave slighty different.  He offered to exchange my brand new nano for another one but could not guarantee the replacement won't produce the same buzz.  Since I bought my nano through pcconnection.com, it could not be exchanged ultimately.  Oh well, kudos to him for even offering in the first place.  I've decided to live with my "buzzing" nano and am a happy camper.

<Title>Would be great, IF it worked...
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!  This product does not work as advertised.  If you put more than 1000 songs onto this device, On-The-Go playlists cease to function.  This is very, very sad for a player with 8GB of memory. It's supposed to hold over 2000 songs, but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded?  Wow.  Unbelievable.  This is a well-documented bug on the Apple discussion forums, yet Apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet.  Will they ever?  Who cares?  Why should they, if consumers like you keep buying it and RAVING about it?  I bought my 8GB Nano, but returned it two days later when I found out the problem was known, but not fixed and not fixable.  Apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them!  Don't they test these things?!?!?!  By the way, the same problem also occurs on the 4GB Nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it, which isn't all that hard to do...  If you don't care about having more than 1000 songs, or you don't care about On-The-Go playlists actually working as advertised, what are you doing shopping for an 8GB player?  Better stick with your 2GB models...

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this ipod in order to replace my mini and it has turned out to be a great investment. The design of the nano is by far the best design of mp3 players on the market. The nano is small and may appear fragile but truthfully is strong, durable and scratch resistant. This 8gb nano doesn't hold movies, but who watches movies on an ipod? Also it has the capacity to hold 2,000 songs with its flash memory which has been proven to last longer than a hard drive like on a video. I fully recommend this product.

<Title>Apple continues to deliver
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I waited a couple of months before reviewing so I could put the 8GB Nano through its paces.  It has performed flawlessly.  Like all previous IPODs and Nano's, the user interface, navigation, and ITunes integration are superb and worth any extra money you might pay for this product.  The sound quality is excellent moving between songs seemlessly, but the earbuds do not give it justice so I prefer to listen with lighweight headphones.  The screen's detail is great and it is so bright you could use it in a pinch as a flash light.  And finally the battery life as advertised is much improved.  I can go days and days without recharging.  I'm sure the next generation will have more memory for less money but 8GB provides a lot of listening pleasure.

<Title>Waited Until Now To Buy One!  Now Part Of The Culture!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I saw it years ago when it first came out and did not think much of it; until you gradually realized that everyone has one, either an ipod or nano; and you wonder why? or/and how could they be so stupid to shell out that much just for a recorder that plays back their songs!  I will tell you my personally experiences and in the most simple but concise way that I know - - - "It simply wonderful!  Not only is its sounds reproduced in so excellent quality; but it an art piece to be admired for looks and the cut edge of technology.  The loading of songs is very simple and the menu systems is also very simple to navigate.  Makes life simple in a complicated world.  That the beauty of it.  Did I mention that the nano is very thin and small, plus it is black.  The second generation earbuds have vastly been improved upon too.  All in all, how could I have function all this time without my nano?"

<Title>Good, not great.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Much has been written about what makes the new iPod Nano great, so I won't repeat all of those reviews here. Instead, I'll focus on the flaws that have  slightly marred my experience, though not enough for me to regret my purchase. I'm still glad that I bought it.  As soon as I read about the new iPod nano, I ordered one straight from Apple. I liked the Mini with its all-metal body, and have been wishing I could get a Nano like that since the Nano came out. However, I'm somewhat disappointed with the diminished quality of this new iPod compared to the previous iPods I've owned -- the a 20GB 4G (I've owned two) and the first-generation Mini.  A lot has been written about the great new features of this new iPod, so I won't get into those much. Other than the nice small form factor and the 8 gigabytes of space, I like the new volume lock feature the most.  This list is grouped into several categories.  Design Flaws:  The center button is now slightly recessed instead of being slightly raised like in previous models. When the button was raised, it was a lot easier to follow around the scroll wheel with my thumb.  The screen is hard to read without backlight. With older monochrome screens, which work just fine for reading what song I am listening to, I could read it without the backlight in all but the darkest environments.  The GUI is often jerky. My hypothesis is that previous iPods used separate chips for the GUI and for the audio decoding and the GUI, while this one uses the same one.  The "Now Playing" screen displays some titles center-aligned, some left-aligned. I haven't figured out what the deciding factor is.  The headphone jack being on the bottom is very inconvenient. This is obviously a personal preference when you are talking about just walking around with the iPod. But this also makes it virtually impossible to unplug the data/charging cable without first unplugging the headphones.  Software Bugs:  Apple has already released firmware version 1.1.1 for this iPod. I have installed this firmware. Despite this, I have already discovered several bugs in the software:  Album sorting seems to happen based on several factors other than the track number. In one nine-track album, the first track was actually listed and played last. I was able to remedy this by clearing all the tags other than artist, album, year, and track number for all tracks in this album.  It seems to choke on certain files that play fine in other players. I have yet to figure out a pattern.  Quality Flaws:  The screen in my iPod is slightly crooked. This is, in my opinion, unacceptable from a "premium" music player. I admit that this would not bother everyone.  The hold button has some play, and often the orange hold indicator shows through despite the hold switch being off.  The center button (and the entire scroll wheel area) also has a lot of play. I imagine that, beyond communicating a lower quality level, this would also invite dust and dirt inside of the iPod.

<Content>Got tired of my quirky MP3/CD player and decided to give the iPod a shot.  I always thought people were overpaying for these, considering there are plenty of other less expensive mp3 players that do the same thing.  Boy was I wrong.  The interface (wheel) on this thing is great, quality of the music is great, iTunes is OK, and allows you to import your own MP3s.  If you plan on using an mp3 player more than a few hours a week, then I'd recommend getting an iPod for ease of use and numerous available accessories.

<Title>Upgrade from Ipod Mini to Nano
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review is for users who, like me, want to upgrade to the Ipod Nano 2nd generation after using another Ipod product which required installation of ITunes on your computer. (If this Nano is your first Ipod purchase, you can skip to the last part of this review for comments on the Working Nano.)  In my case, I had a 4 gig 1st generation Ipod Mini that I used for about 18 months and then the battery life was down to about 1 hour.  I was faced with sending in the Mini to get a new battery installed (about $70) or getting a new Ipod.  I chose the latter, and got this 8 gig Nano with an alleged 24-hour battery life.   Apple support hasn't caught up with this product -- at least in terms of the upgrade process. The small booklet that comes with the Nano is perhaps useful only if you don't have ITunes on your computer. There is a 60-page manual for the Nano that you can download from the Apple website that is somewhat useful, but does not clearly address the situation of using two Ipods on one computer account with one ITunes Library.  I initially hooked my Nano up to my PC, hoping to download onto it all the tunes I had in my ITunes library for my Mini.  Well, not so easy. Computer freeze, brain freeze, and many resets of the Nano.  I had read another review here about how someone just plugged in their Nano and it input all their ITunes library.  This did not work for me.  Unaided by anything I could find on the Apple website, I had to find out how to get my ITunes music on my Nano by trial and error.     I found that ITunes is specificly dedicated to your first Ipod product (Ipod One).  To use another Ipod product, such as using this Nano (IPod Two) on the same computer as your Mini, and to take advantage of the ITunes Music library you accumulated for Ipod One, you have to do several things: 1) RESTART your computer each time between hooking your Ipod One and Ipod Two, 2) set your Ipod Two (Nano) to Manual Download.  3) Once your Nano shows up on ITunes, Drag a group of tunes (in clusters of no more than 20 at first, then up to 40) over to the Ipod Nano icon - DON"T DRAG PLAYLISTS!!.  The tunes should start loading. 4) Once you have dragged groups of tunes  to your Nano icon and have all your tunes on the Nano that you want, THEN drag your playlists up to the Nano icon.  This may seem redundant, but hear me now and believe me later: I COULD NOT DRAG PLAYLISTS TO MY NANO without first directly loading in (dragging over) the tunes from ITunes.  Maybe this is just me, maybe it's a PC thing, I don't know.  I am just telling you what worked for me.  What I have not told you about are the 12+ hours I spent figuring out the foregoing.  During these hours, my computer froze every time I tried to "auto input" tunes to the Nano or "sync" my Nano to the ITunes library and every time I tried to download a playlist without first loading the tunes from ITunes. I had to "restore" the Nano several times.  The one bit of advice Apple provided that was useful was to switch USB ports if you have trouble restoring your Nano to factory settings.  And be patient.  It may take up to 5 minutes for a seemingly frozen process to suddenly complete itself.  This is likely a PC thing.  OK, now that that's out of the way, here's a review of the Working Nano.  It is small, it is tiny.  If you lose it, it will be gone.  I walk my dog at night and listen to tunes.  I once lost my Mini in the grass but was able to find it because of the size and bright color.  If you lose the black Nano in the dark, good night.  I don't know how you could possibly find it unless it was in a place that had a light background and you had significant light.  Apple should have provided some kind of basic clip-on attachment to help you secure the Nano.  It doesn't come with anything but earbuds, a connecting cord to the computer and a small stand to hold the Nano upright on your desk.  The placement of the input jack for the headphones is awkward.  It is on the bottom.  So the Nano will naturally hang upside-down after you plug in your `phones, which will probably weigh more than the Nano.  Apple should have configured this differently.   The screen seems brighter, mostly because the lettering is darker.  The battery does last a long time - I can vouch for 6 hours playing time with barely a dent in the battery icon.   The music quality seems clearer, with better stereophonic effect, as opposed to the Mini.  So this is one neat little product.  You just have to figure out how to get your ITunes music library into it and then how not to lose it.  I hope the tips above are helpful.

The earbuds will fall out with any movement and the sound is terrible. I did have to purchase a quality earbud system to compliment the Nano.

<Content>I have only been using this product for a few months, so no reliability info.  But it's supposed to be much more reliable than the hard-drive based video iPod.  Sometimes it jumped to the next song before the end of a song.  Other than that, no other problems with the device so far.  At home, I connected it to my home stereo system using a Nyko Stereo Link cable through the iPod connector.  The bass is much stronger than the sound coming from the earphone jack.  I dropped it a couple of times, but luckily the iPod was protected inside a Contour Design iSee clear case.  The case also made the iPod look more beautiful.  The iTune is very easy to use.  I rippped all my classical music CDs using Apple lossless decoder.  So I could only store about 30 CDs, and swapped different playlists every few weeks.  Have not played my CD player since I bought the iPod.  Interestingly, I listen to music much more often than before.  Highly recommended.

<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I know this iPod is the same price as the smaller iPod video. There are many reasons I bought this one. 1- I wanted the small size, to have in my pocket while working. 2- I was trading in a 6Gb mini, I didn't want less space. 3- I prefer 2nd generation computer stuff, so I'll wait until the next release for the video iPod.  I love this iPod. It's fantastic. The size is perfect for 1000+ songs , a couple of audiobooks, some language lessons and a bunch of podcasts. I have yet to outlast the battery on any average day. The controls, though smaller, are just as easy to use. The screen and colors are fantastic. I even stuck a photo of the cats on to show off. The size and weight is fantastic. I like the black color, though I have also bought an iSkin case to protect it while working. The playback and volume is flawless. I was wary of the 1st Nano's cases, but this redesign for the 2nd gen, not only reminds me of the great mini design, but feels very secure and durable.

<Title>8GB smaller than my wallet
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 2nd generation Nano is great! I've had the 8GB model since a week or two after it was released, and it's been great. I originally bought to replace my old 20GB 2nd generation iPod when I was at the gym. Since it stores 8GB of music, I am able to transfer the majority of my music collection that I tend to listen to onto my iPod Nano. As a result I find myself rarely using my old iPod since the Nano fits in my pocket and I don't even know it's there.  The new headphones are nice too. They fit my ears much better than the previous headphones that came with the iPod.  I don't have much desire to watch video on a small screen, so the Nano is a good solution over the regular iPod of the same price, but with 3 times the storage capacity.  In my opinion the iPod Nano is the sleekest MP3 player out there, and for all of the people out there claiming Apple is defective by design because of the DRM on music purchased from the iTunes music store... all of the digital download sites have DRM. If you don't like the restrictions, buy CD's and rip them like you had to before if you wanted LEGAL music.

<Title>Nicest upgrade so far.
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I initially held off buying an ipod until the 3rd generation 30gb a few years ago, which I used every day, for most of the day (actually the battery would always die before my day was over & I could get home & recharge). I did have a problem with that one, but Apple replaced it & it's been fine since. I've tried using it at the gym & exercising, but found it cumbersome. Not long ago the battery died & I replaced it. It hasn't been until this model of the nano, that I've felt a need to buy a new one. I have a large (terrabytes) music/audio collection and so the smaller players just didn't have enough new features until now. This model is significantly lighter and smaller, while also being a bit sturdier & more scratch-resistant than the 1st nano. For me, 8GB is about the minimum I need (while syncing everyday) to store all the Podcasts I listen to, plus have music mixes for the gym, my calender & contact info. I don't have much need for watching video while away from the house, so having a flash mp3 player was more important than having a (video) player with greater storage capacity. The improvement in battery time is significant. Now I can use it all day & don't worry about when it'll run out.  I always used my 3G with the original case in my pocket to protect it from bangs or drops, so I bought a rubber case for this one, but found the case to be more annoying (the belkin model collects lots of dust and dirt & the button openings don't quite fit right, it also collects moisture if against your body) & so I usually keep it bare in my shirt pocket, where it's less likely to get banged around. It is very easy to take to the gym and use one of those arm band holders. So I use this one now for exercise (DJ mixes) & podcasts (which I listen to while working) and use my older 30 gb model for the car. One thing this ipod seems to do is collect moisture on the aluminum's exterior (from sweat/body heat) more easily than my older ipod, particularly if it is in a case. However it is much easier to take running. Not only does the flash-based player make things lighter, it doesn't skip (as my 3G has a tendency to do, particularly with large song files). I also bought a Nike + unit which is a nice add on (to be reviewed later).   While there are many features I also wanted to see in a new ipod (exercise aids, gps, voice recorder, radio, etc.) it is nice to see that Apple is keeping the iPod simple & maintaining a higher quality player, with the potential to add on the features. All-in-one might be more convenient, but I prefer something of quality & is durable over something that has every possible feature. I'll review the Nike add on under that product, but one disappointment is that there aren't more of these things.  Come on Apple, where's the high-quality recording module? or the radio tuner?   The best new feature on this version is the ability to play full albums without any gap between songs (and without having to import the entire album as one track). I vowed to wait for this feature before buying another ipod & it looks like Apple finally heeded customers' complaints. The sound quality is significantly better than my 3G, but I can't say whether this is because of an improvement in components or the fact that there's no whirring hard drive to produce additional noise.  The earbuds are also nicer (smoother) than those that came with my 3G (which developed an annoying buzz in one ear after only a few months), though whether or not they will last, I won't be able to tell, since I already lost them & have replaced with Sennheisers (which I find have a better sound quality, though not as nice of a fit).   The ipod seems to function more smoothly than my 3G for the most part. Screen selections flow more smoothly & quickly. The newer control (with buttons on the scroll wheel) is easier to use without having to look at it than the 4 separate buttons + scroll wheel on my 3rd gen. However, turning off the iPod by pressing the play button is more difficult. I have to try many more times than on my 3G. I also have a more difficult time trying to do the Menu + select button combination to restore the nano than the combo on my older ipod. However, the lock/unlock switch seems to work better on this nano than the one on my 3G I also don't like the fact that the earphone jack is right next to the connector opening, which means you can't recharge/sync your ipod with the earphones still attached (which I can do with my 3G). Another drawback is that this model syncs/charges by USB 2.0. My 3G was firewire based. Since I have a computer with only USB 1.0 & firewire, my older ipod syncs much more quickly. If there is one thing that Apple is doing wrong, it is dropping support for its Firewire standard, a much faster and efficient means of connection than USB. The last shortcoming is the screen. Since I don't view photos on my ipod or play games, I could care less about color. The screen on my 3G was much easier to view in daylight without the need for the backlight to go on. While this nano provides a significant increase in battery time, the backlight eats into that time much more significantly. The choices for the back light timing aren't very good (2 secods is too short, 5 too long) & are not customizable. It might not seem like much, but when you realize how much battery life it eats up when you use it more frequently, you realize how important this is.  Another drawback is that this model only comes with a USB 2.0 hot sync cord and a little adapter to put in older docks, but no dock or case or remote (all of which were included in with my 3rd gen. ipod). Ultimately I'd give this model 4 1/2 stars (knocking off for the shortcomings I've mentioned), however kudos to Apple on the packaging of this model. Very compact & more environmentally friendly than most consumer products. With this small packaging Apple removed the CD & all the packaging material, and instead used just a plastic container (ok we can still work on that) and crammed all the parts very efficiently into the plastic container with minimal use of plastic & paper. Apple can now ship more units while taking up less space (saving on fuel costs). Smart move & the reason why I rounded up rather than down on this one.

<Title>Major issues -  Freezing and skipping songs! 
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nowadays, it is very common to throw unfinished software on the market letting us, the users to beta- or even alpha-test the product. And the software is IPod's major issue, because the hardware is really sweet! I love the design and I love the handling too, but the firmware is total crap! Because, like I wrote in the title, my iPod having the firmware ver. 1.1.1 (which is not 1.0) installed, skips and freezes at songs that are ripped from original cd's or downloaded with iTunes. The forums on [...] are full with exactly this kind of complains - now, I'm asking myself, are there ANY developer tests in the Apple house before a bugfix is released? Do we really have to wait before we buy ANY product that has software installed until the Service Pack 2 comes out?  Anyway thank you, Apple for providing me such a beautiful player, which skips so many songs!

<Title>Bad Nano cost me 4 hours--now I've got to wait 5 days to receive a "repaired nano" back
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So I get the Nano.  Download itunes follow their brief instructions.  Got my music arranged and started to synch.  ERROR "The iPod " " cannot be updated the required file cannot be found."  So I download iTunes and reinstall several times.  Still same error message.  Then I figure okay I'll try a restore (back to manufacturers settings).  Okay that comes up with an error message The iPod "" could not be restored --unknown error (1418).  Sunk.  Try it several times same error what do I do now.  Wade through all sorts of help options--still nothing the same error.  Finally 3-4 hours later.  Do they have a human I can talk to.  Call talk to someone who could barely speak English and after wrestling around the guy finally says call back in 4-5 hours they will send you a "repaired nano" to replace the bad one you have.  So now I get a repaired nano for the price of the new one and have to wait 5 business days to get it.  I'm glad their sending me a "repaired" one (why not a new one).  What a disaster.  Tell me about Apple someone... what a joke. I hope the next one will work.  If not i messed over as it is a gift for Christmas.

<Title>Heaven
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When it comes to high tech toys.. I am lost. When I received my Nano yesterday I was a little concerned because there was no GIANT manual. It pretty much said.. hook up to your computer and go to the apple web site. Once I got there it was relatively easy. I am very happy with my NANO, the itunes site is very easy to use and convenient. Dont let previous reviews that are written by obvious frustration sway you away from this great device. I am a runner and I have found a whole new world of music and podcasts dedicated to runners. I am in heaven!

<Title>Small ipod, big rating
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this ipod a week ago, and have used it every moment after that, and it's great. I started off putting on my 2pac collection and the sound quality is great, just not on the ipod headphones. Yes, you may have heard it before, they are crappy quality and they hurt your ears. I am currently using them though, and in a few days my sony headphones will arrive. Well back to the actual ipod, the picture feature is good, I can view all my pics but of course its small so I guess for pics get a bigger screen player. The shuffle feature is great and is practically stutter free. I don't know if its me or what but seems as if my ipod screen is crooked, but I don't really care I guess but this and the phones bring it down a star. The click wheel took me a day or two to get used to but now its comfortable. The playlist feature is kind of tricky though. Overall, I'd recommend this, it's a great piece of electronics.
